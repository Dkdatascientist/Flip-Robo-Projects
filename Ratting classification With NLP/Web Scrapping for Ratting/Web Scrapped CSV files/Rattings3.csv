3,"Go for Fujifilm X-T30 at a lowest price, you'll get the same function like the a6400. Fujifilm came with the best pictures quality and new APSC sensor...you'll get alot than what you pay..the only downside of the X-T30 is 10 min. recording limit in 4k and 15 min. in 1080p but the rest is similar and 1080p footage is much better in fuji than in the sony a6400..if you want to spend around the same price as Sony a6400 then you should go with Fujifilm X-T3 which is way much better than the Sony."
1,"It does not fit the screen for D7200, waste of money and bogus fraud supplier"
2,It was not of proper size. I had to cut it in order to fit my camera screen.
1,Poor not currect size ...its bigger than the screen
1,Over sized not for D7200
1,False marketing! The images show that it has reflectors but the box does not have any reflectors. Components included says the right thing but the images are incorrect please remove them
1,"The product is good. But the battery which I was delivered seems fake. The charging cable as committed did not come with it. Neither does the battery have a micro usb port for charging. So clearly the seller did not check before dispatching a wrong battery with the product. I am returing it, but the light by itself looks sleek and good built."
4,"Nice product sleek and handy good brightness , easy maintenance"
3,"Peak brightness is only for 5 mins and then it dims and keeps dimming for 10 mins before 0% battery. 2-3 hours charge only gives 10-15 mins of battery life, so pretty much not usable, but can use it while plugged in. Also only 80% brightness when using while plugged in."
1,"Hot Shoe mount is supported in 3 mm screws. the moment I connect in just my DSLR, hot Shoe mount could not manage  of LED light and it removed from it. never buy this product if you want to use with hot shoe mount in DSLR. you can't return this product, just replace."
5,"Very good lights,nice brightness,easy to use and light weight."
2,"Lighting works fine, good brightness.Battery charger/adapter & charging cable are missing in the product.No replacement option, only refund is possible"
1,Always receiving defective product.very dissapointed
5,Brightness is more the a 500w helogen. Easy to use. Only problem it cannot work on mains supply.  Have to be depending on the battery wich lasts around 2hrs
1,They sent me a fake battery which lasts less than 20 minutes despite being fully charged. I have the same battery from sony which easily lasts more than an hour. Not worth the money at all
4,Good Product.. but Battery sucks doesn't last long should keep on charging it bcoz it doesn't have direct power cable
1,Reflector shown in the picture is fake ... No reflector do not buy .. cheating
3,Battery life is very less can't use for more time
5,Awesome!
5,Best
5,This is an amazing LED light for YouTubers and another video maker they give two options in light one is natural light and another is yellow light so it's very good for me.
4,This product is amazing and very good 😍 value for money.Must buy 👍
5,"A Digitek product , Very good !!"
4,"People may frown about its lack of stability and sturdiness in outdoor or windy environments.In that case, if you are not satisfied you should invest more and buy some professional grade product.But at this price (800/-) the quality of this tripod is unbeatable. You can't find a better tripod at this price.Pros-✔️Looks good and professional, and the color is awesome✔️Functioning has no issues, all screws and movements are smooth and working properly✔️Height  is sufficient✔️No issues with stability in the room, or on the terrace( given it's not much windy)✔️Very lightweight so easy to carry✔️Built is sturdy, I have been using it for 10 months. No issues whatsoever.✔️it can easily handle my Handycam and smartphone, it's not for heavy DSLRs.✔️it comes with a small carry bag, that's very useful.Cons-❌ Not sturdy enough to be used outdoors.❌If you intend to use your phone with it, you need to buy a mobile phone holder separatelyBOTTOM LINE: If you are a beginner and want to use it mostly indoor and don't want to spend much. It's the deal you want. But not for outdoor photography and professional purposes.I'm SVK.Please press ""HELPFUL"" if you liked my review of the product."
5,"This is my first camera tripod. I was hesitant at first since I will mainly use this for travel video and picture taking purpose. But after receiving the product, I am really impressed. As written on description, this product is lightweight and sturdy. So one can easily use this for outdoor shoots. Also, the camera head movement us pretty smooth. The product is no doubt user friendly but ir would have been better to supplt a mini user manual for beginners.I will do an update here after shooting some outdoor pictures in my upcoming trip."
1,I tried entering review in the second week itself when I bought it but I was unable to submit any review at that time. I am not a regular user but in the first or second attempt itself one of the legs came off from the base attachement. I dint see an option to return it as well. So one more junk equipment lying in my drawer unused. It’s not at all good for use with my dslr canon 700d. You don’t feel confident that the camera will stay surefooted. The slightest push will topple the tripod. Stay away from buying this u less u want to use it for mobile fone.
3,"Honestly I returned the product, becuase its clip mechanism is broken after 2 days,I think i received  a bad product,but product built quality of the product you are getting for this price is great,amazon customer service is great because,i told them that it is broken after two days,the told me return the product,but at that time i was not able return the product becuase i was travelling,so they told me that its has 1 year free replacement policy,so that i can return before the 1 year mark,but i managed to sent to amazon and got the money after 1 daypros:° Build quality great° Affordable° Good replacement policy° Made of aluminiumCons:° i got broken oneBut i am definitely going to buy one again"
1,"1. All the locks on the feet slip and will not stay in place, balancing is a nightmare. If not careful the whole thing might fall off.2. The pistol grip is totally useless. It cannot even hold a small mirrorless camera.The only good thing about this product is that the carrying case is not bad.This is a potentially dangerous product since all the locks slip and your camera can fall off anytime. The locking might seem adequate when you purchase the product but it wont last more that 3 to 4 uses and then everything feels very lose. I could not return the product on time so I'm stuck with it and using it as a glorified light stand.Please do not use this tripod for a camera because however careful you are with it potential breakage is inevitable.Really keeping up with ""Amazon Basics"" will break in 15 days standards."
4,No doubt  its the best tripod in range of Rs500  . Its very lightweight and sturdy. You can get pretty desent shots by this one. But at the same time when you put a 300mm lens on this one you will get hazy  picture. Overall its good product to invest in
5,"Guys, do not read any other review. And read this if you really wanna know what this tripod is like.It's a great deal and definitely worth the money spent. Some of its parts are to be fixed manually [I saw some reviews where people said it was broken]. No, its not broken. You have to assemble some parts.I've bought this for my youtube channel, and it works completely fine. I use a monopod mount on it for my phone camera, and it is great."
4,"For a price below Rs 1500, you can't really complaint. The tripod looks nice, build quality, if not excellent, is rather good and the tripod stays stable on level ground. If you are looking for casual use in plains, this one should be sufficient. I wouldn't recommend it for difficult terrains. The head is made from plastic material that could have been made a little better. It is very difficult to obtain a stable shot if you are using high zoom lens with your camera on this tripod. The plastic material tends to retract due to its flexibility. It is not rigid. At maximum height the tripod is flimsy and may easily trip over in strong wind. Easy to carry."
4,I am using canon 700d with this tripodAnd experience was good!Pros: 1) sturdy compared to other tripod in this price segment.  2)features  3) pivot legs  4)height  5)lightweight  6) bag quality is also goodCons:  1)panning is not that great  2)only 1 release plate provided
5,I got it on 13-Oct-2018 with all the accessories mentioned so no issue with the delivery and the item delivered.I am using Nicon Semi DSLR with this tripod. Following are the details :-Height &Weight :-9/10It's very light weight. Only 3 lbs (1.36 Kg). They provided the Zippered carry bag which make it easy to carry for outdoor shooting. It's perfect for most cameras up to 6.6 pounds.Tripod’s legs:-9/10The tripod’s legs can extend from 20” to 48” which helps to keep the stand stable even the surface isn't flat. Leg locks release smoothly and glide easily to your desired height. Crank up the center post for a tripod that is 60” tall which helps to make real videos even there is a huge crowd.The rubber feet adjust to help you achieve the perfect position.At maximum height tripod may loose the stability which will depend on many factors. That's why I gave only 9 out of 10.Level :-9/10There is a built-in level above the legs which lets you know when the base is level. Another one is on the top of the camera plate which lets you know when the camera is level.Also there is a rubber feet adjust which helps you to achieve the perfect position.Movement :-8/10It does pan from left to right and left to right. It's move very  smooth however some professional photo grapher will not find it very smooth.Holding :-9/10There is no default configuration to hold the mobile phones as it's specially designed for Cameras however You can  search for a bracket or an adapter to hold the mobile. These brackets are very cheap. You can get them for Rs.150 to Rs.200 through online/local market.Finally it's a very good product at this price range.
1,"Would you believe if I say that I ordered this 4 times and for what? Because every time, either this or that is broken or not supplied (yes in the final-time, I got the product with one of the leg-bases missing). In the other 3-units; the gasket was broken, height adjuster and one of the leg-locks with it.In the final unit I had to receive the broken piece and use it anyway because my better Manfrotto tripod was broken and I had no choice since the trip was on the very next day. Yes I've been dealing with this shiz for a month and they never got it right. Returned home after the replacement so I couldn't replace it either. Now I'm stuck with this and what's even worse, the locks and dials are already making weird noises and getting stuck sometimes. Would *not* recommend it to any extent, better save your money and get a Manfrotto :)"
1,"Well it's handle got loosened and suddenly a nut fell, thereby seperating the handle from rest of the body.This is not the worst part, I mailed cloudtail to avail warranty with sufficient description and sufficient amount of photos; first got a reply saying they'll need a video, I sent the video, and guess what, they're not replying since past three days. I've even reminded them twice but no response."
4,"I've been using this tripod from a little more than an year (initial purchase in 2017) & mine broke few days ago (in February) because I mishandled it.  It saved me money because I made a monopod out of the broken tripod. This tripod is good but not for long exposures as it catches vibrations when mirror lifts up & goes down when you press shutter button. But I purchased this again because of its super handy size & low price. If your aesthetic makes you to take long exposures, there's another amazon basics tripod somewhat around 1299/-, that'll do the job for you. For regular/normal use, this tripod is the best buy!"
5,GOOD tripod which- can hold a 70 - 300mm lens- has level bar shows the current level-  is light weight and easy to carry around- also comes with its bag
5,"Summary: Nearly a must have for any amateur camera or video recording work---------------The great:1) No less than 10 kinds of adjustments2) Can sit at just over a foot height and can go upto 4.5 feet3) Easy to carry: The bag to carry is very good and the tripod itself shrinks to a carryable size to carry in the bag4) Must have for youtubers. The stability it provides is very good for youtube videos.5) Quality:  The quality of material is simply exceptional. I could drop it from about 5 feet height and it wont' break (not tried, but it feels that sturdy)---------------The good:1) Has level meter: But only for right left. Wish it had for front back also!---------------The not-so-good:1) No Universal Holder: If you plan to shoot video with mobile, you need a universal mobile holder bought separately.---------------Who is it for:1) If you are buying a video camera just go ahead and buy a tripod already.2) If you do any kind of video work, even on mobile phone use a tripod. Without tripod, the videos will be very jittery due to movement, even if you (or cameraman) have a very stable hand3) Photos: Needed only for photos that have long exposure (for example in the night). Or for long distance shots. In both of these cases a small movement in your hand will lead to blurry photos."
4,"1. The tripod is very easy to set up2. It is pretty sturdy comparing the price at which it comes3. There is also an additional hook present in the middle which can be used to suspend weights in order to provide more stability in a windy environment.4. Easily holds my Nikon D3400 with both 18-55 & 70-300 lenses without any worry.5. Lightweight, hence great for travelling. The bag is also very handy.6. The bubble levels are pretty decent.7. Panning is also pretty smooth.8. Only downside is build quality of some parts and plastic are cheap, i hope it lasts."
5,"The tripod is one of the best budget tripod. The matte finish it great and the overall fit and finish is great, the materials used feel premium and of high quality. It also has an inbuilt spirit level to see if the camera is straight/in level to the ground. The trip gets very high and allows you to take shots from a wide variety of heights. The pan is smooth and tilts are also smooth. Although a beginner wouldn't be able to take very smooth shots. You need some level of experience with panning and tilting for very smooth pans. The tripod also removable mounting screw so you don't have to screw in your camera everytime. The tripod is light and the carry bag allows you to easily take it to several places. Although I would have liked a bit more sturdy feeling when at Max Height. All in all it is a great purchase and nothing else can beat it in this price!"
2,"Received successfully today, disappointed because of broken handler, can’t you check before dispatching. Remaining product features are good. Very delicate. Poor finishing. Made in stupid china .Initiated my replacement, if you repeat this again .i won’t  repeat buying products from Amazon."
5,I had bought this product for my Nikon D5300 and I need to say that the built quality is the perfect I bought it around 3 to 4 months back and it's still working fine the durability is very good it's sturdy and a big thumbs for Amazon basics
5,"Its heavy and sturdy. Comes as three pieces, the head, the tripod and a padded bag.  Inside the bag, you have an user manual, spare camera shoe and allen keys.The tripod is real heavy. Approx 3kgs. Fully expanded, stands tall at about 5' 5"". Add the head, it will reach about 6ft. The tripod has a level indicator and a small compass. The head has three level indicators. The only problem I saw is that, you can't store both tripod and head in the bag.The pistol grip is solid and apart from the quick release button for the shoe, there's also a screw to hold the shoe in place.Witb the pistol lever pressed, you get a 360 deg movement and be able to lock in any position.The centre rod can rise up another 10"" or so... And it has a hook at the bottom to add weight or tie the tripod down if necessary. Also it can be removed and the pistol grip attached for low shots.Overall, bang for the buck."
4,"It is quite good for my Nikon D5300 with both 18-55 and 70-300 lenses. Haven't tested it in the outdoors yet. The leavers are not very best and have to see how long will they sustain. Also the leg folding leavers are very delicate and durability is to be checked. Overall if you want to use it rarely and want a tripod for lower price, you can surely buy this."
4,I have been using this product for past 6 months for my iPad and phone so far so good. It is good for small 1 kgs camera but if you need it for your expensive and bulky stuff then you'll have to purchase a sturdy stand as well.This is excellent in terms of compactness yet it opens into a high platform. Even a six feet person can operate it.Good for household and hobby photography for phones and tabs.Material is holding for last six months. No breakage or loose item.
4,Best Tripod for YouTube videosI am using canon 80D with this tripod. The tripod is very strong and Steady.Pros:1) Strong2) Adjustable height3) can level the tripod after fixing4)height5)lightweight6) bag is good7) Can hold DSLR Camera8) good quality plastic9)less space occupiedCons:1)no mount for mobile2)Amazon Basics doesn't sell mobile mount together with this3) price bit high
1,"I was mislead by the review of this product. When I read the product review, people quoted it as nice and excellent.Let me tell you the overall product experience.Quality - below average.Usability- not that simple. It won't stay properly even after a study fix.Value for money- NO, definitely not. There are other brands available in same price point with a better build quality and better handling.Final verdict- don't buy this item as it doesn't work properly and has a poor build quality."
1,Just Waste For Me .There Is No Mobile Clip Holder ☹️.Really Disappointed .I Shoul Go For Cheaper One Which are About Only 500 But They Include Mobile Holder ..That's Preety Bad Amazon ...In This Period Of Lockdown I'm Really Disappointed From You ..I Have To Take Online Classes Of My StudentsNow I Have To Wait For Some Other Days .To Arrange An Mobile Clip Holder...
5,"After trying 3110 tripod which was very affordable but has cheap Quality, I bought this Amazon Basics tripod. The build quality is top-notch. The platics nobes and other plastic parts are made of good quality. The tripod feels sturdy and stable. The pan function is super smooth. The tripod comes in good packaging and a carry bag with shoulder strap. The only thing which could have been added is a good mobile holder clips but still it best buy for the bucks. I would recommend this to beginners photographers and YouTubers."
4,If you are on tight budget get it. 👍It is light weight & easy to carry.But if you have expensive phone or camera then get a better one.Although it serves the purpose but it is not so stable.A gust of wind can make it fall.But if you are using it for smart phone its good.
5,Product quality is worthyI bought for 1399/-  as a deal priceGo for it ☺️👍N yes I fixed my d5300 . It fitted nicely
1,"Misleading information• I searched for a “mobile phone tripod” and this product came up third in the search results.• It is an AmazonBasics product so I relied on the branding, did a quick scan of the specifications and ordered it• When it was delivered, I realised the product was NOT compatible with mobile phones• When I read the product details again, I realised that on scrolling down 2 to 3 screens (in small font on my iPhone XS Max) there’s one line saying the product is not compatible with mobile phones• The Amazon app and the customer representative told me that the product can be replaced with the exact same product. That obviously doesn’t help me.It was quite disappointing as I had relied on the Amazon brand and, to be honest, I felt cheated. I entered a very specific search. This product should not have appeared in the results. Also, the information about mobile phone incompatibility should have been highlighted."
4,"I wonder where was Amazon hiding this monster for so many years. If you are looking for a tripod which stands solid and stiff in the price range, this is is the one. I am rating it 4 stars because of the bulky and awkward ‘Pistol Grip’ ball head and would want stress here if you're OK with buying a separate ball head, your search for a tall and sturdy tripod ends here.The only flaw is in the Pistol Grip head. The head that comes along is bulky and takes a lot of time to getting used to. I find it very awkward to use for panning shots. It’s really difficult to keep the camera at level or angle. The pistol grip adds an extra 9 inches to an already tall tripod. The movements are jerky. If the tension is tight, you really have to squeeze the grip hard to move it. If the tension is loose, the head may not hold position steady. Sure, they have a screw to adjust the tension, which may be toggled using a hex wrench (included), but is stressful anyways. The extra 9 inches of the ball head also gives a little wobbling movement. Further, the quick release plates on this ball head are proprietary and cannot be used on any other ball head. That is another annoying factor.Another factor that renders this tripod head useless for panning shots is that the centre column is immovable horizontally. You can slide it up and down to increase or decrease height, but you cannot rotate it horizontally. There is a groove in the column which locks it into place and the column cannot be rotated. Maybe, if the centre column had horizontal mobility, panning shots would have been easier. I call it a plus point as it practically disallows any kind of wobbling by the centre column.Coming back to ball head. For me, the better solution was to look for another ball head, and I did find one, which now adorns the dandy long legs of this monster (see image). The QR plate and holding clamp is 38mm Arca Swiss design, which makes it easier to switch with other ball heads with similar 38mm shoe clamp, without changing the plate.Some of the plastics feel a little cheap, but I choose to ignore, because at the end of the day the system stands rock solid and sturdy. Some may criticize it for the weight, but I say the weight is an added advantage for this tripod to stand stiff, especially in windy conditions. I have made bulb ramping long exposures on this stand, without having slightest of blur.So, if you don't care about weight and size, and you are OK with spending another 3k+ on a ball head, this is the tripod for you. Buying a separate ball head is basically a minor issue since all other tripod heads included with tripods in this price range are going to be similarly incapable.P.S. Maybe you will find the pistol grip handy and easy to use, I couldn't..."
5,"Awesome product. I liked the product, worth buying. The material and components used are really good. Easy to use, expand and compress. Great color, lightweight and good for indoor and outdoor use. Packaging was also good with good delivery service from Amazon, though the product was delayed by one day due to addressl issues. Go for it guys, it's worth buying and you will not regret for having this."
4,"Excellent product. Using tripod for the first time. The product is strong. Seems sturdy and easy to use. The only con is Amazon did not send any product usage / parts guideline with the same. Since the product is designed for beginners, its imp that they should hvr sent some manual / set up guide for the product unboxing and set up. Had to rely on youtube for the same. Anyways, that does not demean the product quality. Its nice and sturdy. Some of the screws am yet to discover! Overall, a good product. Amazon, pl mail me the product booklet if possible. One less ⭐️ only for the same..."
5,Worth for 799paid.Total height comes nearly 5feet.This tripod is light weight but it worth for indoor use not fit for outdoor or for heavy cameras.For mobile and lightweight cameras this tripod will be best in low budget range.Bottom leg is very slim so won't be stable in outdoor or windy areas. And need to be handle softly or you might be ending in breaking of its bottom leg.As this is nearly 5feet you can use it even of you are shooting of standing person.As per this covid19 this tripod is useful for staffs for online class they can attach tripod with mobile and shoot online class.And even students can use this for viewing class online. They can fit their mobile and increase height  as per their requirement and sit in table and take notes watch online class easily .As i have mirror less and DSLR camera i can able to use mirror less on this tripod as it is slim and light weight.I won't recomment this for DSLR as this wont support DSLR weight you will end in breaking your camera.Note. You need to buy mobile holder for using mobile with this tripod.
5,Dont expect professional quality. You can not place a DSLR on top of it (Better to buy a carbon fiber frame/aluminum tripod). It for Lightweight camcorders/point n shoot/mobile/light weight projectors. (My XA11 holds good in this one once locked as its a light weight camcorder).Its pretty strong except the head mount and lots of option that you will find in pro ones. Head rotation is not fluid. Its good if you are planning to fix in a place and shoot. SO basically for beginners . I am giving 5* in beginner series.
4,"As a small youtuber i had no choice but go with a budget tripod, so after a lot of research and binge watching reviews i ordered this product.I was both scared and excited as there were mixed reviews about the quality of the product.But i was so relived after  i received the product, it came in good package and was in good condition.So i have been using it for the last 3 years or so (Not regularly).I use Nikon DSLR5300 for making youtube videos and this is the stand i have been using in all my videos.Now what do i think*This is absolutely fine for recording Youtube videos that are static (where you don't need to move around the cam)*It is not at all suitable for B rolls as it's budget product and feels clumsy.So if you are someone who wants a basic tripod to mount your DSLR cam and just record this is hands down the best at this price rangeIf you are more in to recording broll like videos where you need the help of a stable and smooth tripod this is not at all suitable for that."
3,"It seemed like a fine product at first glance and I ordered without hesitation as it was Amazon Basics. I have had positive experience for amazon basics products. But this was not the case.I had to return it within a day only. It was not able to hold a DSLR firmly at an upwards angle. This was with a normal 18-55mm so not too much weight. I thought that the product must be defective so I decided to go for a replacement.As it turns out, that was not the case with that piece. The new piece had the same problem. Tripod was not able to hold it firmly. Even the movement of auto-focus motor was sufficient to make lens move from it's angle.  This was enough to ruin photos especially the long exposure ones.Packaging:This product comes with wrapped in plastic inside a decent cover. Cover is good for overall use. However the box that it came in was damaged the second time. It was torn at many places but I didn't mind that too much.I had to return it again and finally ask for a refund. I would suggest go for something more sturdier even if it is expensive."
5,Very solid and sturdy. Does the job for me.  Holds my D610 with 70-200 f/2.8 perfectly fine even in portrait mode tilted on the side. Pistol Grip holds fine and perfectly.Definately a buy recommendationUpdate after almost a year of use:Still great but one leg became loose when I mounted the nikon d 850 with the 200-500 f5.6 setup. Will tighten amd update
5,This is very useful taking tilt and pan shot and also quick release plate help to remove camera and gimbal with few seconds..I am using DJI OSMA gimbal using this tried moving time laps in hills station stability Is good but  this only for beginners.And also don't expect the quality like simpex and Bosch
3,"As the title reads - It's the best budget tripod for beginners. So let me first say all the good things about it before I come to describing the BUTTT part of it.I am a big AMAZON BASICS fan. I like their range of products not only because of cost but also build quality.This 60 inch Tripod is exceptionally good in it's range. After getting the first one couple of years ago for a friend, which I used for tests for almost a week, I ordered 2 more for friends and one for personal use. It is much better than some known branded tripods available right here on Amazon. It's light weight. Well built. Comes with a hand grip. Holds pretty good on any general surface. The head is not very sturdy for video purpose (actually its not build for that job).So why BUTTTTT! My recent order for the same Tripod I received a damaged Tripod with scratches and damaged rubber ring. Looked kind of used or badly stored. On my request they replaced it within a day...but sadly the second one also came with not only scratches, but this time broken Rubber ring. Of course I got a refund after returning the product. But this turned out to be a huge disappointment and waste of time. I am now not comfortable ordering this product for sure. :("
1,"Within 2 months of moderate usage, The tripod is unusable. Worst ever experience using Amazon service.Could've bought a better on Flipkart but got tricked by the ""Amazon Basics"" tag.The 1-year warranty is just a fake promise. Since over a month I've been writing emails back & forth to Cloudtail for the warranty claim and they never processed it. I even shared photos and videos as requested by the team, but still no use.When you can't provide the warranty why try to sell a fake promise AMAZON?"
1,"Hello AmazonI have tripod with me.(for ref. check Digitek Tripod DTR 450 LT with Phone Clip Holder)so i searching new one with the best quality.so my search stop here.i choose this one.find some images of tripod that i think quiet impressive and tall.so i ordered one.but when i got my order i got same typical tripod.pls note that you also never given any image of tripod.so now i have got different cheap tripod and also headache is i can't fit  LED ring light kit on it.also there is no guide book to understand how to fit all.the  LED ring light is too short to adjust samsung galaxy a50 mobile and there is no facility to ad phone on LEDso i Decided to Return Tripodsend me another one which other showed in pieces.also i don't understand how to connect LED ?where to put that LED USB? in computer ?because that usb never fit to mobile. i guess it's for batteryi put it on my pc then it work okay, but i cant put in pc always.then how we make a video through ?so much confusion at least send another new tripodthank you"
5,"Product is good quality with all possible adjustments. Light is also very bright with diff color and brightness adjustment. Very sturdy, strong and light weight stand. Very high tech working. Height is also adjustable."
3,"The product is not bad. The ring light has three different modes, which is a very nice one. The tripod is not entirely metal, only the top section is metal, the remaining parts are plastic. So while fixing the ring light, there is a chance that it will fall because the ring light is slightly heavy compared to the tripod. Tighten all of the knobs correctly, so that it won't tip. The height of the tripod is ample for sitting poses, for long shots as well."
5,Very nice and well fitted. It helps me to enhance my photography and making videos so damm effective and beautiful. Specifically it helps me to short video for tiktok. I'm very happy with the product.
1,It's not 18 inch it's 10 inch .. light is good but there is no instructions of installation.Clip for mobile is broken
1,"I order 16 inches but they send me 6inches ring light, I refund that. And product quality is not good, low brightness"
4,"i like the product ,well its good & quality of light matters the most isn’t very bad & if i say bout tripod stand it’s not that bad also but excessively long(unwanted) like of no use for that big , well over & all its just (good)"
5,"It's very nice and easy to useGood products, easy to carry, light is very nice,It have multiple light,Stand is good quality"
3,I ordered a square shape light but I got round one.. infact the nuts are missing in the stand.. I had to purchase the nuts coz I needed it in emergency... Stand quality is solid.... Light is also ok..

4,"The XT-200 is typically a successor of Fujifilm’s entry-level mirrorless camera XT-100 which was launched more than a year ago and its pricing sits just below the mid-ranger XT-30. Although there are various upgrades over the previous generation, being a vlogger one upgrade that I consider major is its capability to shoot 4K videos up to 30 FPS as compared to just 15 FPS with XT-100. To go through more differences and new features keep reading.1. XT-200 sports a 3.5-inch -90 to 180 degree rotatable LCD as compared to a 3-inch 3-way tilt LCD in XT-100. The new 3.5-inch LCD supports a 16:9 video playback instead of 3:2 in that of the XT-100.2. Both XT-200 and XT-100 come equipped with 24.2 MP aps-c sensors but the one on XT-200 is a copper wired sensor. Though it’s hard to notice any major improvements while capturing still images.3. As compared to manual up-down navigation controls at the back of XT-100, XT-200 now equips a joystick control. Also, most of the controls are now on the touchscreen panel of XT-200 like Q button, dept sensor, aperture, and exposure adjustments. There’s a complete changeover of UI in XT-200.4. XT-200 showcases some new functions like an improved digital stabilization mode called Digital Gimbal and an HDR movie mode that allows HDR video recording in high contrast situations on 1080p resolution at 30 FPS. Also, there’s a much better face and eye detection AF system in the new XT-200.5. XT-200 comes with a 3.5mm audio jack as compared to 2.5mm on XT-100. Also, there’s a USB type C port on XT-200 whereas XT-100 only supports standard USB.6. Both cameras come in a plastic body but XT-200 showcases a matte finish as compared to a shiny one on XT-100.7. XT-200 is designed to give a better grip with a hump in front side as compared to XT-100 where there was no such hump.8. XT-200 weighs significantly less at around 370 grams as compared to XT-100 which weighs around 450 grams.Cons:- Although there are some major improvements, I personally don’t feel the huge price difference between XT-100 and XT-200 is justified.- Supports only 15 minutes video at 4K resolution.- At such a high price point Fujifilm should’ve offered an X-Trans sensor instead of a CMOS sensor.In case you’ve got some more bucks in your budget then X-T30 would be a great option to consider instead of upgrading to XT-200.P.S.

3,"Seller: Appario RetailPrice: 58990\-Delivery: 2 days, Prime, BangalorePackage: Came in box pack, covering contentsReturnable: NO, 10 days replacement, but that too subject to Amazon terms!Note, only replacement if faulty is proved to customer care. If they are not convinced, you have to service it at service point only!. Better to buy locally if possible after thorough testing.Biggest disappointment is price dropped almost 9K after I bought. It hit the lowest 49990/-, after I bought it. Very much disappointed!!!Box contains Camera, Lens kit, Bag, Basic manual, USB type C cable for charge, Battery and 16GB SDHC class-10No Battery charger unit provided.Things to know:~~~~~~~~~~~~~>>  Charging through USB cable via 2A adapter takes 2-3 hrs>>  Display is 3.5inch, articulated, huge and sharpest among any other camera even a segment above>>  Viewfinder is electronic, supports pictures and video preview as well, but some lag is noticeable, can't replace an optical viewfinder smoothness>>  Rated 275 shots in high quality, not tested>>  3-4 buttons and dials can be customizable, including some parts of touchscreen>>  Supports HDR caped at 1080p 25fps only, Gimbal mode caped at 1080p 30fps only!>>  Supports 4K 30fps only, HDR or gimbal mode are not supported at 4K video>>  Touch screen is not as 100% touch capable as smart phone. Mix of buttons is required!>> Somewhat slower compared to DSLR shooting speedFuji XT200 or Canon M50 or Sony 6100?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the budget range of 40-60K, Canon M50 poses a tough competition. Sony is only good for auto-focus, rest is simply similar to others but they charge so much for the same. To decide between Canon M50 and XT200,>>  M50 has 4K crop factor and a big downside in 2020>>  M50 is 2 years old, XT200 is 6 months old>>  XT200 LCD is sharper, bigger and vivid>>  Gimbal mode and HDR supported in XT200, but only on 1080p>>  XT200 supports 120FPS 1080p slow motion, which is very good out of the box>>  425 Focus points in XT200 against 143 in M50>>  No USB charging in M50>> vM50 uses USB 2.0 while XT200 uses USB 3.0>>  Fuji lens are cheaper and expansion is easy>>  Picture quality and video quality is much better than mobile shooting (iPhone, S10, etc)Picture wise, there shouldn't be much difference, but there are lots of reason to get XT200 than M50, esp for those who prefer videos. Fuji XA7 is a low cost model, sold here at Amazon for ~39K. It has no viewfinder and lacks HDR, Gimbal mode, slow motion, etc.Disappointments:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>>  Camera price dropped sharply>>  Gets warmer soon (which seems normal)>>  Some live filters and editing features you can apply but seems more like gimmick like smart phones these days>>  Picture quality is good unless you start to zoom beyond 2x>>  Auto-focusing isn't faster in picture or video capture, Sony is better>> Stock LENS IS A JOKE & VERY AVERAGE!!!..Fuji a disappointmentIf you looking for upgrade over mobile shooting and considering ease of use, prefer this mirrorless cameras. If you still want to learn and earn, you can buy a good midrange DSLR for this price and still take amazing pics!Hope this helps"
5,"To begin with camera looks i will give 5/5. Retro look with premium finish.Light weight with good colour options to choose.Looking for a dslr entry level camera but couldn't find one,you can go for fuji mirrorless.15-45 mm lens work fine and potrait mode is excellent for candid photography.Value for money i must say"
1,"I got a product with an open box packing which was plastered. The product seemed okay inside but on close inspection I could find the country of origin of camera is Indonesia and the lens was from Philippines, while I was of the impression that the product would be from the Fuji’s legacy factories in Japan. It’s dubious Amazon doesn’t give the country of origin for their products sold in the platform, giving the sellers the opportunity to cheat people by selling a low end product desguised as the original factory claimed. It’s worthwhile to note that flip kart and tatacliq specify the make factory and country clearly on their website. I got the product not of my colour choice, that I could get a refund. But even if I came to know the product they delivered is from another country not expected, I think I would’ve got a refund if they delivered the right choice of color for me. So beware and ensure the product comes from Japan itself before you buy it. At the time of writing, I had a better offer from tatacliq and they give the product originally from Fuji Japan factory...note that my seller here was Price..Perfect"
3,"It's very disappointing to know that the package doesn't contain battery charger,  Amazon website doesn't list this which is not correct, customer must know upfront what is included in the package"
5,"Don’t take pictures in jpg, use raw for better image and quality, don’t know why fuji jpg was not good in xt200 with human skin, reds poping thats the only problem at all"
5,"Absolutely worth every penny. It is small, easy to hold. Comes with a touch-enabled rotatable LCD screen. Battery life could have been better, but no other peeves.Note:You get a 16 GB SDHC memory card with the camera; I would suggest buying an SDXC 128 GB with the camera."
5,Very good choice compared to other cameras in mirrorless category..Box includes1. camera + lens2. 16 GB memory card3. Beautiful camera bagPoora paisa wasool.Great features at affordable price
5,Great Purchase.
4,"The grip is uncomfortable, the camera itself is really good for beginners. Battery life is not great, decent enough"
5,Very very nice
5,Very Good Product....U will Be loving it and have ur memories with good Quality
3,Availability of lens is very big issue
5,It is what it is 🔥
4,The product details mentioned i was to get memory card but it didnt came with a sd card.
4,ठीक है पर बैटरी पावर कम समय है
5,"I'm a beginner when it comes to photography. I bought the X-T200 after a month of research (online- YouTube and other forums), I compared this with the Sony A6100 and Canon M50 and found this more to my liking. You can always compare the three (or any other) cameras on any website so I will leave the specifics out of this review.First of all, the camera looks premium and is built very well. It has a presence. It's ergonomically shaped and is quite comfortable to hold. It has a well lit EVF and a 3.5"" screen which can be turned on/ off. It has a front aperture dial, a rear shutter speed command dial and a dial on the left side which can be configured- I have set it for ISO.The battery seems to be the only issue for me and drains a bit fast but I have the Bluetooth on so probably that's why.The camera comes with a beautiful bag, a 16 GB memory card, a strap etc.Anyway, the pictures I'm attaching are all shot in manual mode and it responds quite well. The dials are a little stiff and small so that might take some getting used to. I'm really happy with this device and can't wait to try it with different lenses."
5,"Since most of the reviews revolve around comparing this to a DSLR, I guess my take on it comes from a size perspective. You also have this sony alpha mirror less camera here  but its too expensive currently.I cannot take a DSLR hiking, they're simply too bulky and too heavy to justify the space in my pack. When I looked at replacing my Canon, I went out to find something that I could get that was lightweight without sacrificing the quality of the images I had grown used to with the DSLR. This had an aesthetic I really liked and the features I was looking for as well. It doesn't look like a cheap point and shoot with a bigger lens strapped to the front. The controls are perfectly fine for me and are more second nature since I've spent a lot of time behind it. Like anything new one gets, you have to get used to it. I find the colors on pictures I take with this camera come out much better overall compared to my old Canon. It isn't excessively difficult to use, and I don't find the menu cluttered at all. The camera is very light and very small for what performance you can squeeze out of it, its footprint is about the same as my Samsung Galaxy s10e. The camera is mostly just wider with the lens mounted.I cannot attest to the video features as I do not use them.My only gripes about this camera are the kit lens and the materials, mostly the kit lens, and those are never really spectacular anyways. It just seems to be adequate for most circumstances, without ever being the ""perfect"" choice for a scene. Its easily replaced however, so you can learn on it before getting a new lens better suited to your tastes. That lightweight I enjoy comes at the cost of the materials unfortunately. The camera is VERY plastic-y and does not feel like it would survive a fall. I don't drop my cameras, but I'm not sure my old DSLR would have survived either. Better materials and weatherproofing would have meant a higher cost anyways, and that would've defeated the purpose of this for me.All in all, I find this camera perfectly suited for what I needed. I needed a lightweight, high image quality camera, and the Fujifilm XT200 got me there. Your mileage may vary though depending on your skill level, experience with much more expensive cameras, and overall attitude."
4,"The Fujifilm X-T200 is an inexpensive mirrorless camera that uses the company's X-mount. It replaces the X-T100, a camera that seemed promising when it was announced, but whose sluggish performance was a letdown. Thankfully, Fujifilm has put a lot of work into making the X-T200 both more responsive and full-featured.Key specifications:24MP APS-C sensor with Bayer color filter and faster readout speedsUpdated hybrid autofocus system with 425 phase-detect pointsRefined ergonomics, lighter body3.5"", 16:9 fully articulating LCD with 2.76 million dotsEasy-to-use touch menus2.36M-dot OLED viewfinder with 0.62x magnification8 fps burst shootingNew 'Clarity' effectOversampled 4K video with no cropAudio level controlsMicrophone and headphone inputs (latter via USB-C adapter)New Digital Gimbal and HDR video options.conclusionThe Fujifilm X-T200 is quite a bit different than its predecessor, the X-T100. While the X-T100 tried to be a scaled down version of the X-T20, Fujifilm failed to pull it off, for a variety of reasons.The X-T200 tries to be a scaled down X-T30 and more. It's a camera that should suit both amateurs who want a lot of physical controls, and smartphone upgraders who like the familiarity of touchscreen operation. And this time, Fujifilm has succeeded.From most angles, the X-T200 looks like many other Fujifilm X-series cameras, like the X-T30 and X-T3/X-T4. It has a DSLR-style body, plenty of dials on the top (though, thankfully, not as many as higher-end models) and an electronic viewfinder. What makes the X-T200 stand out from the more expensive cameras is its gigantic and bright fully articulating 3.5"" touchscreen."
5,"Here are a few things to note before you make a decision1. This is a nice option for anyone looking to get better pictures and videos compared to your Smartphone, especially if you are a content creator2. Don't get discouraged by the 15 min limit for 4K videos, because unless you are creating videos for commercial purposes, full HD resolution is way more than sufficient. Now, if you do need 4K, 15min is quite a bit for one shot.3. The XC kit lens provided is not the best option to get the most out of this camera. Considering upgrading to the significantly better XF 18-55F2.8-4 or a fast prime lens (16/23/35 - depending on your needs).4. If you are willing to spend another 30k, the X-T30 comes with the kit 18-55 option, but you will not get a fully articulating, screen which may be a deal-breaker.At this price point, you will no go wrong with the T200!Best all-round prime lens (subjective): Fuji 23mmF2 or Tokina 23mmF1.4 (just released)An alternative, comparable camera at this price point: Sony A6100An alternative option if you are only looking at casual photography: iPhone 11Do check out my other reviews on YT (Home Savvy Tech). I will be reviewing a Fuji camera in the near future."
2,"I bought this camera, but now I'm refunding it because of images quality is very poor, Everything in the camera is good.  4K video, eyes focus is good but its image quality with this lens is not good.  Better lens should be provided with this camera because price is also too High, according to the money, its image quality is very bad."
5,"Go for it, it's better than Canon m50 and Sony a6100. And cheaper too!Picture quality is excellent, you won't regret it. Surprisingly I absolutely love the film simulations, Classic Chrome is my favourite!To mkae your kit complete, you can buy the following:1. XC 35mm f22. XC 50-230mmThese two lens along with your kit lens will give you all you need to take your photography to nwxt level."
4,"I bought this camera from offline market. Becoz i was not flexible on spendig such a huge amount thats too in advance. And one more thing one of my friend purchased this camera from here and he received a water bottle and a cheap quality bag. So guys Just check everything before u buy or go for offline options , becoz u might get cheated.."
1,"Picture size 5.00 mb maximum. It gets heat after 30 mins of use. Battery lofe 1 hour.If you zoom image and video quality gets down,In video follow focus dont work properly,Not for video and not for photo.Please don't buy. Compny is a cheater. Images get so much of noise."
5,Easy to use.Great LCD screen & it is very responsive.Helpful preset modes.Indian version includes a Memory card + Bag (bag is lame though)
1,Camera is goodBut if you wish to reocrd long avoid buying it.There is over heating issue in xt 200 which effects your recording....
5,Best camera
5,"This is very good product, worth of money.  Easy to install. Customer support very helpful.Installed this 4g camera at my farm. It's working very well even with low bandwidth."

1,"Not working, 7 days over I returned the item but where is my refund?"
5,It's working osm..
1,Not satisfied
1,"This 18 inch light measured 10 inches in diameter for me, I returned it but it was a waste of time. Tripod stand also was less in height as shown in description and product images."
2,Quality is nt so gud broken in. A month’s time of usage
1,This one is not working is gathiya one
5,Product is very Nice.
4,"First of all I want to mention that it not 75 inch (as mentioned on the product page), the one I received is only 55 inch, since I didn't have time, so I didn't return it and for me it served the purpose. But apart from that tripod is good. Not the best build quality, but looking at the price it's fine and as it is light weight you can carry it while traveling also."
5,it is very useful product. it has light weight so i can even take it in my luggage and travel. it  is easy to use. i got it in perfect condition. very useful for making  feeds and post on social media platforms. it comes in very good quality and finishing  . The packing of the product is also good too. you can buy it without any  second guess.
4,The stand was as described. It was light in weight and has sufficient height once fully extended. There was a mobile holder that was given bundled. Now while the clamp itself was good quality it doesn't get fixed in 1 position. There should be better locking mechanism on the top of rod or it wont be able to hold heavier objects.
1,Hopeless item. I won't never recommend it to any one. Cheap quality. Nothing less than fooling customers.
5,Good product. Value for money
5,It’s an excellent stand !! Build quality is good and feels sturdy. Highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a stand with quality and value for money!!

1,Adhesive is of bad quality.....it os getting peeled off...
5,Good
5,Good Quality..
1,"Ring light is not 18inches.Stand is not as strong as shown in the image, the phone holder is lose and does not hold the phone for long...I have oneplus 6 and it is umable to hold the weight of it. Brightness of the light is not good enough. Overall not satisfied with the product."
1,"First of all, the name of the light is misleading. It is not 18 inches but 10 inches only. amazon shound amend its name immediately. Secondly, it is not as bright as it claims. It does have several colour lights but no use if is not bright enough. They didn't provide vertical mobile .Tripod is flimsy and I could not took a chance to install my expensive camera on it. Plse read careful before you buy this flimsy and misleading Cowboy product. I was so disappointed that I gifted it to a young led living closeby."
5,Amazing product. The best about the product is that it is lighy weight with good metallic body.The light have 3 mode. Also you can suggest it's sharpness.Phone holder is also available inside. So it's good to go product.
2,I am highly disappointed. The reason is ring light. Amazon has not delivered ring light as per discription. 18 incg light is mentioned in description and only 10 inches was received by me. Tripod stand had dent already on its arm..
1,It's only 10inch with very less bright to click any pic ..But very well marketed here so that customers can buy this product**Don't know why Amazon is not taking any action as the seller is fooling the customers**
5,Mobile holder  & stand  is very goodBrightness  may be up to 10 wattsWith this price it is best
1,This is 9 inches ring not 18 inches wrong commitment very bad quality even the light dosen't take the weight of phoneChor ....
5,Nice product good reflection of light
1,"स्टैंड के पैर और इसका मेटेरियल बहुत ही नाजुक है,इसे खड़ा करने के लिये प्लास्टिक का क्लिप प्रयोग हुआ है जो जल्द ही टूट जाता है। The structure of the stand is so delicate that it is unable to hold the weight of a mobile and light.Its hinges and clips are also very delicate due to which it never lasts for more than 3 months.My Stan's leg broke twice .It is worthless purchasing this item."
3,Tripod is okish feels like it can break easily ring light is 10 inches not 18 inches brightness is fine but could be better.Good for beginners and those who have tight budget RGB lights are good.
5,"As a beginner, I found it really simple to use. The light source is incredibly bright and comes with an adjustable switch to increase or reduce brightness. If you are not sure what to buy, and with a limited budget, then this one is worth trying and gaining more experience with recording your videos or self-portraits."
1,Usually the seller say's that the Ringlight is 18 inch but i have got 10 inch i replaced it for 2 times then also they are giving 10inch only very disappointed with this Ringlight! Don't take you'll get 10 inch Ringlight waste of money
4,Everything is perfect.. lights are bright too.. however.. there is no stand in the middle of the ring light
4,I bought this product about a month back for recording videos. Its a good product however being light weight even a slight movement can cause it to fall. You may need to add some weights on the base to ensure its stability during use.
3,It is very good product i m satisfied this product quality and its features ...it is very simple to use ...and it is very useful for making makeup videos....and click perfect pictures...
5,"Best Product for Beginners of Tiktok,reels Vloggers and youtubers. Tripod is very light Weight and brightness of ring light is more than I expected. Good job COWBOY.If you're a beginner as I mentioned above then it's a must buy product."
5,Very helpful for online sellers..
2,Product had a number of nuts missing. There is no manual for guidance on how to use the same.
1,"Be Aware: this is not 18 inches light as mentioned but its 10 inches. Despite getting it exchanged under the category ""wrong product delivered"" I got 10 inches light again Thanks to professional approach of team Amazon that finally I am getting my money back."
5,"I was very reluctant about buying ring light online but this made it perfect....this is the best ring light you could ask for so my advice is go for it, the packaging is good the quality is good. Its a steal at this price👍❤️"
5,"The product is good for making short videos, it's easy to install and use, brightness is also very good with cool & warm options with brightness controller. it's very light to carry and install anywhere."
1,The light was nice for video call etc. But the quality wasnt up to mark. Stopped working within 1 month of me receiving the item (delayed due to covid). Disappointed.
4,It's good. Sturdy enough at this price. Can't expect anything more. Lighting is bright and adequate. Really good product tp save money.
3,The light is good but whereas the stand you get is not so sturdy and there are high chances of light falling because of this.
5,Very nice product ☺️ for me I start my you tube channel jyoti mangla for the help of ring light thanku so much this product is awesome and prize best 👍
5,Really liked the product Its perfect for those who are searching for something like this ......
5,The product doesn’t feel cheap at all. It’s handy and easy to carry aroundHas brightness levels with 2 shades
4,A lot shakey after fixing the light for 360° degree use as the key dosen't fix properly in stand overall product is good.
5,"Over all it’s a good product, would have preferred a longer cable though. Brightness could have been more but still it nails the output for both pictures and videos.Worth buy."
5,Product quality is really good then any branded one.
5,"Awesome packaging, my daughter fixed it very well shez just 7. It’s very easy to use easy to carry as well.Go for it and njoyyy"
2,I got this product a week back and it was working perfectly until I plugged it on a power bank it was not working the light on the remote was on but the main light wasn't working
5,"Convenient, easy to use , lightweight and has  3 different colour modes and levels of brightness. Perfect Product"
1,"It is a 10 inch Chinese ring light, don't order if you want a 18 inch ring light."
1,Not a reliable product
5,It's for starters who wants to kick in video or beauty business.
1,"Broken ring light, very cheap quality product, not satisfied only the brightness is little bit better, but didnt expected this type of low quality and packaging was also improper."
1,"Cheap quality and fragile light. It should not be labelled 18"" as it is definitely not.Returned it once and received a similar bad quality product again."
4,"Nice product. The brightness is ok, set up is ready. Easy to fold and carry. Serves my purpose well."
1,Effect is good but stand is not working properly its not user friendly..
1,"They give a special buy-one-get-one-free. I ordered two, but got 4 (two extras). I should have ordered one and would get the two I require.It says ""Material from Korea"". Product is  made in India.The biggest weakness of the product is the fit. The 4 corners do not perfectly  fit the frame of the LCD screen. The  fitted screen guard does not look smooth at the 4 edges. Looks unstuck. It looks likes it's a fit for another camera though it mentions 5100 in the Amazon listing.The LCD visibility and clarity is okay, but the fit is not.I can now understand why they have given 1 free....effectively making it a Rs. 150/- priced product. The better brands sell at 299 - 399.Will  not buy this brand again."
3,"Size is perfect for D5300 but it may be inconsiderably small for other 3"" Nikon screen at edges. Opacity is good. Adhesion is weak and may peel off in harsh use and develop scratches while cleaning and due to nails. The wet wipes is not wet at all and can be use with lens cleaning solution ,Else is a value for every penny."
5,"I bought for my Nikon d3400. Perfect size. Can be also suitable for Nikon d3300, d5100, d5300.Got one more free in offer. So good"
3,"Its good to have a buy one get one free offer. But the product is average, display gets little awkward after installing the product.images are quiet blurred and pixels are magnified"
1,Cheap product .... does not stick. Even the pack which has a moist cloth to initially clean the camera glass was absolutely dry
1,Poor quality and poor adhesive. Don't buy. I think they are clearing their old stock items.
3,"Does not cover the entire screen, but I guess it'll do the job until I find a better one."
5,I loved this worth for the price comapre to other products very good nice delivery was too late waited for that
5,"I am pretty happy with the purchasePositives :1) They have 2 varieties of the green screen cloth - I got the thicker one, which is the higher GSM, and it makes for a really good green screen and creates a pretty seamless virtual background.2) The colour is exactly as you can see in this picture, and I didn't need to iron it. It works just fine with the way you can see.3) The only virtual backdrop I have been using it for is with zoom.4) The size of the cloth is as described....what you see in the uploaded picture, its bigger than that.The stand is also really good quality..It may take a bit to balance it properly if you don't extend the height of the stand, all the way up. In the picture, the stand isn't fully extended vertically or horizontally...which means that there is a scope to take it higher or wider as per your requirement.5) The stand is pretty easy to assemble.Seller Review6) I had a lot of questions before buying the product and the seller was very prompt and efficient in replying.7) In fact, one of the items got left out during delivery, and they made sure to deliver it promptly, once notified.Overall, happy with the purchase!"
5,"I'm giving this product an absolute 10/10 for multiple reasons. 1. The packaging was exceptionally well done. Plus it comes in a neat handy bag for carrying it around if you ever travel with it. 2. The cloth material is massive in size and the one you see in the pic is actually folded to half size. 3. The material is way more solid than some other sellers on Amazon and is perfect for green screen editing and photo shoots. 4. The stand setup was easy as pie and was just perfect for different lengths and room sizes. Also height adjustable so pretty damn customizable with length and height. In fact, in the pic I skipped using one rod so you get the picture. 5. Those lovely metal clamps to be used at the top are a blessing and make attaching and removing the cloth easy. You can also use the cloth loop to make a more permanent setup or use the clamps if you want to switch between the different colored cloths. Black and white. Also. Minor detail but I loved it because the clamps also have rubber padding at the sharp edges making the clamp itself perfect.For this price. After experiencing the poor quality of other budget options on Amazon, I highly recommend this one. You can't get anything more professional than this kit for this low a price. Thank you seller!! 😍 You made my day"
2,"Cloth quality is burst, very thin and transparentnot received as shown in picture, it very thin and transparent, not usefulstand is fine, requesting to VTS to replace my cloth"
5,"Well packed, on time shipping and delivery. Very sturdy backdrop stand that one could bank on. Comes with a kit bag, took me 10 mins assemble and start using it. Way ahead interms of quality when compared to other brands in similar products. Worth the price."
4,"A good product, well packed and good material. Handles well and has a solid built.The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 because 1. the telescopic rods get stuck and need a lot of force to pull out and push back, and 2. I have just unboxed don't know how the product will do with usage over time."
5,"Perfect product for indoor shooting.Best for video recording as well as photography.Size is very large, I had to reduce the size by doubling on itself, clips that is included helped me doing that.After processing your image you will love it.If you want to have a look at more of the samples then check out my photography account on Instagram (flash_instafiends).Thank you"
5,"Product is absolutely fantastic and I strongly recommend it. The stands are sturdy and the lights are bright too. If you wish to buy it, go for it, buy confidently.Special mention of the seller who coordinated with me continuously, and got the product delivered safely and on time, despite stringent lockdown.Highly recommend Seller and this product. Thank you very much."
5,i bought yts background kit and tried it worked really good.. i was using this for chroma key effect i was really happy . and so i ordered one more.. first time i recieved with small damage i returned it and  the dealer directly contacted me and took responsebility to give good product..
1,"The clothbis very transparent and has the light vertical stain like line. Also stand the clamp fornadjusting the height of stand broker on very second day. The pipes at the top on which we fix the curtain are so jammed that only after one use, now they are stucked and cannot open. The fitting tip at the top of stand has got bent. Complete waste of money."
5,"Heavy setup and quality is very good, backdrop cloth stuff is heavy, and the quality of the product is also very sufficient in this price segment."
5,Awesome.. Everything is good and up to the expectations. They deliver what is shown. The product is strong. The cloth is also good. It  worth it. I got it before time.
2,Average product.. you can buy this..low graded iron-rod product.. if you tighten the screw with little bit pressure then it will dent and the plastic quality of the clamp is very much poor.. not satisfied.
1,When ordered first time background screen was missing. Which is y we've cancelled the order and reordered again informing the same to customer care representative. Still the same thing happened. It is clearly mentioned in the faq section that background screen is included in 9*9*-5 stand.
5,Very Happy With the Product.  Have used it to shoot YouTube videos and it came out very well. Thanks for the good product
5,Great light weight product that is easy to install.
5,Good built quality.. good powder coating.. the rods are nicely weighed and sturdy.. the cloth  green jersey and is nice.. there is a carry bag for the tripods .. this product is of international standards .. really impressed 👍
5,"Good quality product, with perfect finishing at justifiable price. Can go for it without hesitation."
5,So heavyweights but excellent product for creating YouTube Video🙏🏻
1,"The clamp was broken at the time of unboxing. It was made of very cheap plastic and is prone to frequent breakage.With even a single clamp broken, the entire stand is rendered useless. I suggest you look at other brands."
1,"Poor quality stand. It broke the second time we used it.Cloth also very thin, light comes in from behind."
5,Cool product to buy for all video makers and picture editors and the seller provided a cool mask along with it
5,IT IS VERY GOOD I TOTALLY LOVED THIS GREEN SCREEN SET .IT IS VERY USEFUL FOR  YOUTUBEERS AND PHOTO STUDIO YOU MAY  BUY THIS  .
1,Product is not as said it will be. It's really see through material. Than shown in the discription
5,Good quality
5,Full marks it's very nice easy to set up easy to fold and easy to carry
4,Decent stuff
4,Broadly the product is fine. But one stand does not fold fully. This is causing trouble in storage when not in use. Can that alone be exchanged?
5,Excellent.  Value for money
3,Cloth is not goodBut backdrop suport system is werry well
5,It is good to use with backdrop green screen.
5,"Great Quality ,Easy to assemble and very sturdy frame. ***** star."
5,Stands are solid and steady. The backdrop I received is thick enough which serves the purpose.
3,"Cloth is not up to quality, stand and cover is good"
5,"Yes, this product can be use as outdoor purpose but with the proper presence of  light outside."
5,Good
5,Sturdy setup n heavy backdrop in good price.Happy with our shopping ☆☆☆☆☆Star  in my side.
1,I expected that it would include the screen atleast
5,Perfect ! What I expected !! Real sturdy one ! Best Buy
5,"The seller is very reliable, prompt. The product is excellent."
5,It's exactly as it looks. Iam very happy with the product.
2,"Look and feel is good, But it contains the ordinary LED light without adjustment. The background is not pure white, its a kind of rexin sheet , They are not providing background color sheets. where the other photo tent products comes with adjustable light and multiple color backgrounds. while we take jewellery photos it is giving glare effect. sides are not obsorbing the reflections. unable to take professional snaps on this, instead you can go for less price photo tents which comes with nice features and various background colors. simply say an ordinary carton box with white chart inside  is giving more clarity picture than amazon basics tent. Not worth for the money."
1,Bad quality. Grey background. Only 2 lights present. Does not let us return the product.
4,"fanntastic product.Love the big size. There background spreadsheet and the lighting system is amongst the best in the market. Although relatively costly, anyone looking for a big photobox would find it value for money.Still, I wish it was a bit bigger.I have used a photostudio which is one fifth its price (Box studio Photostudio), but still I think it is a worthy upgrade for someone whose products are bigger."
4,This product is absolutely good and best quality.Good in1. Build Quality2. Best LED lights3. East to clean4. Best photo qualityCons1. Weight2. Not suitable for transport3. Not a handy4.price
4,"The product is quality wise good, and box is stable, size also Ok, convenient to operate, but the gray background still persists after adjusting the camera setting too. This  is due to the lack of third light. Instead of two lights if 3 lights are given this problem could be solved. The two lights are insufficient to get a nice photo. Since it is made in China, I feel  I paid bit high price. The adaptors lasting is a big doubt."
1,NOT OVERALL SATISFIED LOT OF IMPROVEMENT NEEDED.LOT OF MODIFICATION NEEDED.OTHER BRANDS OFFERING SOME MORE MODIFIED VERSION WITH A VERY REASONABLE RATE.PRICE IS ALSO HIGH AS PER THE PERFORMANCE AND ALL.
5,more colors of backdrops would help a lot like some of jewellery photos need black background and lights get hot too soon need to take breaks after every 3 or 4 products photo shoot so lights dont get destroy
1,Waste of money....don't buy....and also I got used product....no lights in the box it's clearly showing someone cutted the wires and removed lights....since returning the product...refund my money back.
1,"The light is insufficient due to which, background looks off-white. You need to spend sufficient amount of time in image editing to make your products look good.A higher powered lamp (say 12W) might give better results."
5,Very good quality product by Amazon if you have little knowledge you can take good images and save your time I will shoot a video of this photography tent and post it on my YouTube channel very soon must have item if you are online seller
5,"I am not an expert in photography, but this product does its job. You just need to learn some basic manual settings of your camera and you are done no need to edit your photographs, i purchased this box studio to shoot photos of my product to sell online. Dont think twice just go for it"
2,It's bulky and not easy to handle. Lights are not properly mounted so calibration is difficult. Not recommend for small object photography.
1,Light is dim and the white sheet for the background has marks on it. Its a faulty product i think or may be its this quality only what they sell. Just be careful
5,"One of the best buys till date. Was quite apprehensive before buying this, seeing the mixed reviews, but it is a lot more worth than its price! Able to do photo sheets without any hassles, fab quality and easy to maintain."
5,This is awesome product. I am really happy with the studio. It allows me to shoot decent photos which can be used even on my promotional materials.
5,"This product is good on quality of components used. Clean your products to shoot well, before placing in the box for shoot."

5,"The build quality is really good. The foam inside is perfect. It is nice and heavy. Feels very solid and rugged. The wheels are also very good. It will survive for a while, you stay calm and pick this hard case. (Stickers not included)"
4,"Since pelican is way too costly in India, I brought this case. Decent quality and almost same size as Pelican 1510Issues1. I doubt if it's allowed as carry on as it's a bit bigger (Height) compared to pelican2. After sales support or service is doubtful3. Inside there is a big hollow space in between the rails, they could have just provided a flat platform ( it depends, some may use that space) see photo4. Hinges are not so premium as that of pelicanDecent buy and a good job by AmazonEdit: Got an after market insert done from a local bag maker (around 1k) and now it can easily hold 2 bodies and 5+ lenses"
5,"Good product, and just as good as overpriced ones, if not better. The pre-cut foam is great, helped me set up everything in less than 5 mins. Love the latch, much better than the ones on my Camtree and it has a pressure valve as well. Missed the sale on this or would have got it rs 2500. Still at under 3k, it is worth it. Delivery was within 36hrs, but then I look very in Mumbai. Good job Amazon. Will update if things don't work out... So far the product is Makhan."
5,"The build quality is really good and sturdy . The foam inside is pre cut won't take much time to fit ur gears in, just Place the lens on top, mark an outline and just pluck out the squares, feels very safe and tight, the wheels are made of Ball bearings make it more easy to carry around, it has a gasket rubber around its opening once closed it make it air tight,i could easily fit in my canon EF500mm f/4L IS II USM , Canon EOS 5D Mark IV (along with Its battery gripper) Canon Battery Grip BG-E20, Canon EF 1.4X III Extender, Canon EF 24-105mm f/4L Is II USM Lens, Canon EF 100mm F/2.8 Macro USM,Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L III USM. and 2 LP E6 Battery .A worth case for adventure travel photographer writing this review after an international travel had no problem or any issues with the productThank you AMAZON for the amazing product."
5,"Initially I ordered for an amazonbasic camera bag for 1969/- since they delivered a cheap and wrong product I had to return it. I was checking out other bags but wasn’t satisfied. Happened to check this hard case and though let me put a 1000 more a get this. Trust me I was glad that I got a wrong bag delivered in my initial order because I wouldn’t have searched, thought or brought this otherwise. Very sturdy, good build quality and your costly equipment is going to be safe and protected. Spend a little more and go for hard cases specially if you have costly cameras"
5,"It comes with foam uncut, so you can get configuration to fit your kit. Value for money, fast shipment."
4,Easy to setup and use. Fits in my camera with couple of primes and 70-200 easily. still got some space left for another prime lens.
5,"Great case, the precut foam is so easy to customize. Perfect for my camera and lens. Loved it. Hope it is airtight enough to prevent fungus to a limit (along with the silica pack)."
5,"This is great product, the pre-cut foam is a bit difficult to work around but it is surely the best option for the price. The case is very sturdy and looks like it can take some damage. It has an airlock valve but don’t know how water resistant the case can be. Overall great purchase !"
3,"Box is good, but the hinges for cover do not seem to be robust and not smooth while opening/closing"
5,Very good product.. Value for money... But box cover texture is not good. Otherwise every thing good.
1,"This product is not as per requirment, requested for returned solar nothing had happen.. It been almost 3 weeks."
5,Good for Photography equipment
5,"I m not using it as a camera accessories box, using this hard case for my musical instruments,and I m happy with this hard case ."
5,Perfect .... Multilayered checkered foam ... No air gap
5,very nice product.....but price is little bit high.......

5,Not a Pelican but still closer to it . Worth the  purchase .
2,Good case
5,"I ordered small size, it's very rugged and strong, you will have to cut the foam according to your camera and accessories witch is very easy. I have put one Canon EOS R, one 24-105 rf lense, and 6 battery.  The size is Small the I expected but good for traveling. I would definitely recommend the small size if you are on a budget."
5,"Excellent service.I ordered the product and got it with a loose tilt head. The seller connected with me and I informed them about the issue, they gave a tilt head replacement immediately.Communication of the seller and product quality is excellent.I would definitely recommend this seller."
5,This is a nice product...nd I think u all should also try this...amazon never do any mistakes...in anything..so I am thankful to amazon
1,"Don't go for this at all the handle is already broken, tripad legs are too thin to bear weight of your phone. All the screw are too weak. It is a typical example of ""Chinese "" poor quality product. 2000 is too much for this ... don't buy this at all. I am returning it back."
5,"This is a very good quality product it the seller was also very helpful and the price is also appropriate, overall it is a perfect ring light."
2,Had bought this product 15 days back. And it's damaged. Not worth the quality. The stand is not as shown in the pics. They claim 7feet tripod . But it's not even 4 feet. Plus the quality of tripod is very bad. Can't take the weight of the light and the phone. The fitting quality if the tripod and light is also not good.

5,Luv it best quality but light was so deem but stand quality is better ❤️❤️❤️

5,"Very good product regarding its price , have been using it for long now. Good built quality."
4,Great product!! Good for the pricing.. recieved everything specified. Only issue is that there’s no manual to tell us what goes where.. else it’s super nice!

1,"Poor quality ring light. Even if you're a beginner, please invest in a good ring light once but not in this."

2,"It is not the same item shown in the picture,The light I ordered was 18 inches .But it came with 10 inches. it is a miniature version of the actual ring light, that too with poor quality tripod and light ...."
5,More sturdy stand would help.But overall good quality and brightness with 3 light shades.Value for money.
5,"The most unexpected part was that the tripod was really stable and heavy duty... As I thought it wont be that good due to the price... But I'm surprised.. the ring light has 3  modes cool white, natural white , and a warm light. The ring light isn't much heavy as it is build all from plastic I wish it was a bit heavy and  a bit more high grade plastic should be used... But that's the only issue. Otherwise it's all a great product just go for it. Loved it"
1,"Seller mentioned that it is 18"" light but it's just 10"". Wrong info shared at product page. Tripod is of inferior quality.Well to be honest, in such a price you can only get 10"" LED. The only fault of seller providing incorrect info about the size of the product. So just for the integrity sake, I've rated them 1 star."
5,"As a professional makeup artist and a youtuber, i want something different kind of light which will gives me a natural lighting effect, n this ring light is perfect for, i wanted to recommend this ring light which comes with a portable tripod to all, grab this light whithout thinking twice, it has 3 types of different color lights, I'm totally satisfied with the product...Big 5 star from my side..."
1,"Does not match the item description. Product was only 10 inches not 18. Only one mode was available not three, or two other modes were not working. Too slow to despatch the item. I can understand delay in courier, but slow despatch cannot be accepted."
1,"It is not the same item shown in the picture, it is a miniature version of the actual ring light, that too with poor quality tripod and light .... absolutely worthless....Seller should actual product picture rather than stealing picture online of some other ring light ....."
4,"I ordered 18 inch ring light but received 12 inch ring light. That’s why 1 star less but the light is amazing, i give it that! Does the great job."
5,Very good product. The tripod is quite sturdy and tahe light diya quite well. Gives out a bright light suitable for making HD professional videos.Different modes and brightness can be adapted according to available ambient light.
1,It is the worst product I have ever got from Amazon.I have ordered Htech light 18inches but I got 10inches light which is not Htech light also.it is a normal ring light of no certified company.And the stand is too much thin to use.I request to Amazon please bann this merchant from Amazon either people will suffer.

1,"Size difference, it’s shows 18” in the description and I got 10” when ordered.Happened same thing when I ordered previously. Clearly an issue of fraud and misleading descriptions."
3,"It's fine and all but the ring light in a mere 10 inches which is okay to use. Else the product is cool. However, not worth spending  this much on. It seems more like a 1k INR worth of an item. But great if you're purchasing in a rush, like I did lol"
1,"It is not of 18 inches.It is only 10 inches ring.So, don't get fooled by the description"
3,They cheated me . They said its a 18inches ring light but it wasnt that one it was a 10 inches ring light !I dont have time to exchange sooo im accepting this noww

4,"To start with, i was a user of canon 550d for years. So anyhow this camera was suppose to be a big improvement for me.Just in case you are planning it to buy now, wait for the canon full frame mirrorless instead.The overall experience of the camera is great. The only major problem i experienced is the cramped up autofocus points. Its annoying. Period.I am not into videos so not having 4k wasnt a big deal for me. The 4k timelapse is awesome though!Battery life is great, dpaf is ""almost"" great, display is great, form factor, weight, everything else is great except those focus points!(cries in corner)I have attached few photos from the camera.Ping me up in case of any queriesInstagram : @bangerasiddharth"
5,"Canon 6D Mark II is the most anticipated camera after 5D Mark IV in recent times, whilst we have been expecting its launch from October 2016. Finally, I have the pleasure of both using and reviewing it, which is quite a pleasing experience till now. The introduction of 6D Mark II came after a long wait of 5 years since the inception of 6D, thereby packed with much changes and technological advancements.::::::::::::::::::::  Why 6D Mark II ?  ::::::::::::::::::::Whenever there is a launch of the new model, we are faced with an ever gripping question – Should I buy it?Before elaborating on it, I would like you to know two things if you are sticking to Canon:a) 5D Mark III – Almost unavailable in the market.b) 5D Mark IV – Costs almost double than 6D Mark II.::::::::::::::::::::  Positives  ::::::::::::::::::::After my hands on the device and using it for few weeks, I am quite satisfied with it. Some of the noticeable advantages of the Mark II are summarized below:1) Extremely Cost Efficient Full Frame Camera  -  6D Mark II is the most cost-effective DSLR among all the Canon EOS Full Frame devices and stands tall with technological advancements.2) Significant Technological Upgrades  -  There have been significant technological upgrades as compared to 6D model and its presence is felt with each passing click. The changes are:i) Resolution: Mark II flaunts 26.2MP, an increase from 20.6MP.ii) Digital Imaging Integrated Circuit (DIGIC): There has been an upgrade to DIGIC 7, up from the available DIGIC 5+ in 6D. DIGIC 7 is much efficient in the handling of the heavy image file, thereby saving them to the memory much faster than DIGIC 5+.iii) Focus Points: 45 autofocus points (all cross type), a jump from 11 autofocus points (centre cross type). However, the autofocus points are seemed to be crammed at the centre, like all other full frame cameras. Naturally, the presence of all cross type helps in fast focusing.iv) Frames per Second (fps): Both the Canon’s 6D supports 1080p recording, but, the fps rate has been raised from 30fps to 60fps.v) Weather Resistant: 6D Mark II has debuted the weather resistant feature which is a ‘cherry on the cake’.3) ISO - Mark II has normal ISO in the range of 100 to 40,000 and it can be extended to the range of 50 to 1,02,4000. The video ISO, however, has the range in between 100 to 25,600.In most of the cases, the noise will be negligible while taking pictures in ISO 1600 and even the clicks taken in ISO range of 3200 to 6400 will be usable for most purposes. However, it is to be noted that the option of using the pictures on occasions will continue to be diminished as we increase the ISO from 1600. Many use the ETTR (Expose To The Right) strategy to lower the noise in pictures, however, doing so can have slight issues in Dynamic Range, in comparison to other DSLRs. I was expecting Mark II to handle the Dynamic Range better, but it is not the case.4) Availability of Remote Shutter App  -  Canon has application both for Android and Apple devices which communicates with the camera via Wi-Fi. You can use the app for camera remote, image viewing, to name a few. It is indeed a positive approach of Canon in ‘delighting us always’.5) Lightest in the Class  -  The total weight of the body along with the battery stands at mere 765gms. According to the Canon website, it is the lightest DSLR in the EOS Full Frame line up. Having a light full frame camera in everyday life is such a relief that I cannot sketch my excitement in words.6) Vari-Angle Touch Panel  -  The Mark II is packed with a vari-angle touch panel which has multiple benefits. It helps in varied angle photos, while touch panel has packed in ease of the touch.7) Digital 5 Axis Image Stabilization  -  Mark II is also pampered with Digital 5 Axis Image Stabilization which makes it quite easy to record video, nullifying the effects of unintentional shakes, both vertical or horizontal. It is highly useful while recording at 1080p, in both 30 and 60 fps.::::::::::::::::::::  Negatives  ::::::::::::::::::::Even the best performing devices have flaws in it and these are some of the shortcomings, I cannot seem to ignore:1) Missing Inbuilt Flash  --  Following the trend, the Mark II lacks an inbuilt flash which did not come to me as a surprise. Though it does not affect my decision of owning it as I do not prefer using on-camera flash under any situation, it might be disappointing to few.2) Menu Driven Controls  --  Mark II lacks dedicated control buttons and is infused with menu driven controls. Usually, the professionals who are involved in photography for a long time will surely find bit uneasy using the menu-driven controls as it will not only delay their performance but also will lead to frustration. We wish for hassle-free experience while using a camera and this feature has surely not helped the cause.3) Single SD Card Slot  --  Not having a second slot clearly hinders the peace of mind and we have to constantly keep track of the storage. While the liberty of saving different image formats in separate cards is shattered, not having a backup of the picture is tad terrifying.4) Missing 4K Videography  --  I was in high hopes for the Mark II launch and hands-on with 4K videography was one the vital reason for it. It surely came to me as a shock that Mark II has no 4K videography, but, taking the price bracket into consideration it surely doesn’t make me disappointed.::::::::::::::::::::  Miscellaneous  ::::::::::::::::::::These are some of the features which I could not include either add in pros or cons:1) Mark II has backward compatibility with lenses from past 30 years, with the exception of APS-C camera’s EF-S / EF-M lenses.2) There is no option for adjusting LCD’s Brightness but is sufficiently bright for most occasions.3) The image quality of Mark II seems identical to the range of 5D S / SRs. It is to be however noted that the hard-core professionals, using their professional skills might find some enhancements which will have no effect on either normal or semi-professional user.::::::::::::::::::::  Conclusion  ::::::::::::::::::::Taking all points into consideration, I would term this a good buy. The close competitor to Canon 6D Mark II will be Nikon D750, which is a 3 years’ old model. In my opinion, Nikon D750 produces the same picture quality, despite being cheaper than Canon Mark II. However, the video quality on 6D Mark II is much better than D750.It will be an ideal buy for those who are considering owning a Canon full frame camera. Also, one who wishes to upgrade from 6D can definitely think of it as an option due to the added advantages as discussed in the review.:::::::  If you are in need of clarification or have other questions, please feel free to contact me via ‘Send an Email’ button on my profile.

5,"I preferred 6Dmkii over eos RP because,Higher frames per sec.Better battery life.Cheaper in price.4k in EOS RP doesn't have proper codec or DPAF so it's useless. Also, the 3.5 frames per sec is too slow.Apart from newer processor and light weight it don't have much to offer.Either go for EOSR and 5Dmk4 or stay with eos6Dmkii"
5,"This is my review about the product received and initial testing of about 1000 photos and a few videos.First the package - As shown in the pictures and described. No complains.Delivery time - spot on, received it under 48 hours of order.Packaging - Decent enough, no complainsSealed box - checkInside the box - Camera, lens, battery, charger, strap. everything there and intact.Warranty - registered the products without any issues for a 2 year warranty.Initial impressions of the camera and lens.Boy is it heavy!!!The Camera and lens together feel heavy if you are coming from ceop sensor cameras. Good heavy I mean. Feels solid.The camera menu takes some getting used to though. But the touch screen makes it easy to navigate around different settingsThe Lens! Simply wow. The flexibility you get with this lens is just awesome. Without compromising on image quality at any focal length (unless you pixel peep around the edges at 24 or 105).Images are crisp and clean with great color science. Dont need to edit much with colours post. Although the shadows and highlights may need some tweaking when shooting low light. Also noticed over exposure when shooting Aperture priority, need pulling down during or post clicking.Get a 70 MBps plus UHS 1 card for burst, else the lag is significant.Decent Videos at 1080 24, 30 and 60. Not much to talk about here.Will try and follow up with a more detailed review once I have used it enough."
3,Everything is okay but bill pe serial no wrong haiMeans i think its imported piece and wrong gst bill picture quality is best
5,This is one of the best Full Frame gear that any one can afford  to start with photography.( Value for Money)Picture Quality is good.Enjoing using this gear for my use.
5,A full frame camera that comes within reasonable budget and works wonderfully.
5,This camera look was too good and excellent working experience.☺️☺️☺️
1,It’s fake not real
5,"Got this wonder in March 2018.as a interest in photography I directly bought it for my hobby, YouTube videos and to convert passion to profession.😀I don't know why some people's tell that first buy a bigenner cam. but I directly bought it without asking for suggestion.but it worth for me. I learnt a new camera world in this.lots of new features in this dslr.I am uploading a video on YouTube for this cam with detailed features and full journey how to use."
5,"Purchased after too much research and reviews from professionals. Was stuck between 5dm4 vs 6dm2.After too much evaluation went for this one. And satisfied with choice. This camera is perfect for ones who're upgrading from beginner level. It fits in budget, it has pro level features, it provides much better picture quality, is fx and latest in canon lineup.If it's is first fullframe professional camera of you then this one is best. It lacks pro features  but in this budget it packs much more useful features. Flip lcd is much useful for video makers. Focusing system is also quite fast.Picture quality is quite good.Overall in budget it has much more to give."
5,Canon EOS 6D ii very good pictures quality video quality super  its predecessor to improve upon every aspect of image capture and creation.
5,Awesome
5,Good camera for wedding photos and outdoor shooting...i liked
1,Not at all a good camera ... much better cameras r available at that price with more features don’t know why canon brought such a product in a market before buying plz do chk for reviews on YouTube abt this camera
5,"The build quality is really good. The foam inside is perfect. It is nice and heavy. Feels very solid and rugged. The wheels are also very good. It will survive for a while, you stay calm and pick this hard case. (Stickers not included)"
4,"Since pelican is way too costly in India, I brought this case. Decent quality and almost same size as Pelican 1510Issues1. I doubt if it's allowed as carry on as it's a bit bigger (Height) compared to pelican2. After sales support or service is doubtful3. Inside there is a big hollow space in between the rails, they could have just provided a flat platform ( it depends, some may use that space) see photo4. Hinges are not so premium as that of pelicanDecent buy and a good job by AmazonEdit: Got an after market insert done from a local bag maker (around 1k) and now it can easily hold 2 bodies and 5+ lenses"
5,"Good product, and just as good as overpriced ones, if not better. The pre-cut foam is great, helped me set up everything in less than 5 mins. Love the latch, much better than the ones on my Camtree and it has a pressure valve as well. Missed the sale on this or would have got it rs 2500. Still at under 3k, it is worth it. Delivery was within 36hrs, but then I look very in Mumbai. Good job Amazon. Will update if things don't work out... So far the product is Makhan."
5,"The build quality is really good and sturdy . The foam inside is pre cut won't take much time to fit ur gears in, just Place the lens on top, mark an outline and just pluck out the squares, feels very safe and tight, the wheels are made of Ball bearings make it more easy to carry around, it has a gasket rubber around its opening once closed it make it air tight,i could easily fit in my canon EF500mm f/4L IS II USM , Canon EOS 5D Mark IV (along with Its battery gripper) Canon Battery Grip BG-E20, Canon EF 1.4X III Extender, Canon EF 24-105mm f/4L Is II USM Lens, Canon EF 100mm F/2.8 Macro USM,Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L III USM. and 2 LP E6 Battery .A worth case for adventure travel photographer writing this review after an international travel had no problem or any issues with the productThank you AMAZON for the amazing product."
5,"Initially I ordered for an amazonbasic camera bag for 1969/- since they delivered a cheap and wrong product I had to return it. I was checking out other bags but wasn’t satisfied. Happened to check this hard case and though let me put a 1000 more a get this. Trust me I was glad that I got a wrong bag delivered in my initial order because I wouldn’t have searched, thought or brought this otherwise. Very sturdy, good build quality and your costly equipment is going to be safe and protected. Spend a little more and go for hard cases specially if you have costly cameras"
5,"It comes with foam uncut, so you can get configuration to fit your kit. Value for money, fast shipment."
4,Easy to setup and use. Fits in my camera with couple of primes and 70-200 easily. still got some space left for another prime lens.
5,"Great case, the precut foam is so easy to customize. Perfect for my camera and lens. Loved it. Hope it is airtight enough to prevent fungus to a limit (along with the silica pack)."
5,"This is great product, the pre-cut foam is a bit difficult to work around but it is surely the best option for the price. The case is very sturdy and looks like it can take some damage. It has an airlock valve but don’t know how water resistant the case can be. Overall great purchase !"
3,"Box is good, but the hinges for cover do not seem to be robust and not smooth while opening/closing"
5,Very good product.. Value for money... But box cover texture is not good. Otherwise every thing good.
1,"This product is not as per requirment, requested for returned solar nothing had happen.. It been almost 3 weeks."
5,Good for Photography equipment
5,"I m not using it as a camera accessories box, using this hard case for my musical instruments,and I m happy with this hard case ."
5,Perfect .... Multilayered checkered foam ... No air gap
5,very nice product.....but price is little bit high.......

3,This is over priced.. I would recommend a smaller size. Large size is of no use.
5,Super strong . But heavy .

5,"I ordered small size, it's very rugged and strong, you will have to cut the foam according to your camera and accessories witch is very easy. I have put one Canon EOS R, one 24-105 rf lense, and 6 battery.  The size is Small the I expected but good for traveling. I would definitely recommend the small size if you are on a budget."
5,"We bought this light system with intent of having a portable dressing studio and it serves the exact purpose. This provides light enough to beautify oneself. Not just this, it is also extremely versatile to be used with personal camera shots too :) Good buy!"
5,This selfie Ring light is too good . I really love to purchase this product.
1,I am fed from the services this is the second time my pick up is cancelled . I have opened the box and light is damage no one is coming to pick up two times i recived the message to resheduled pickup
5,This Ring light stand is appropriate for my requirements. Three mode of lights are impressive and a great product.
5,This is the best budget ring light I have ever seen it. It is very good and the light is very bright.
1,It’s mentioned as it’s 165inches where as it’s not . Poor quality
4,"Ring light is good. But, the tripod didn't have much strength . Anyway the product is good.  I like it"
5,I liked the three in one lighting n adjustable stand
1,Not good quality
5,A good product for a very affordable price!

5,Very Good

5,Very nice quality light.... Very helpful in making video in night or dark area
5,"Wonderful product , More than expectation , Built quality is ultimate. Heavy metal and heavy fiber used. Appretitate the MADE IN INDIA COMPANY"
4,"Heavy,  sturdy  and good product with mobile holder...Before i use this product i use 2-3 different tripod... but all that break nd not working condition in 20 to 30 day on regular use...But this product is very sturdy...and very good product...If u want to buy tripod,  then sure go ahead with this...Just one point and that not any issue...-- minimum height of stand is aprox near to between 2-3 feet...So if u want to seat at floor and display paper/drwaing from the floor ... then ....phone camera is above 3 feet...ElseVery very very  good And best product in this time..."
4,"I like the product but packaging was not good. Not properly packaged. Inside Box was open and Amazon box was somehow tapped.This monopod is is very strong it's rod are of metal and due to that it's weight is not suitable for selfie purposes, so be aware if you are going to buy this for selfie purpose. It is purely and perfect for tripod stand type use.Quality is very good.But I got some scratches in this monopod which I am little disappointed by the seller. You can see the pictures.Overall it is value for money and strong monopod."
5,Amazing Product.Built quality - 10/10Extension >5ft  - 10/10As a Monopod - 10/10As a Selfie Stick - 10/10Ease of use - 10/10Weight - quite heavy coz it's monopod. If you use it as selfie stick you will feel a bit heavier.
5,"I was looking for a tripod / monopod to support a 300 mm tele lens. A cheap aluminium tripod I already have does not have the stability to hold a heavy telephoto lens. So I started looking for a stronger monopod.This monopod is solid and claims to hold up to 10kg. It is sturdy to hold the tele lens. Now I have decided to use the existing shaky tripod for the flash.Prolite monomod is great value for money. Under Rs. 900, you don't expect it to offer what a Rs. 9000 imported tripod or monopod will. The overall structure is strong. Finish is so so. The rubber grip is loose. The metal is strong, but the plastic clamps look a bit ordinary. But I am not looking for a monopod that will last a lifetime. I am looking for something that is cheap and good. So I give it five stars.On its own, the product is self sufficient. However, I attached a ball head. It works well.On a 300 telephoto for birding, I would need 1/500 of a second handheld shots. With this monopod I can go as slow as 340th of a second to get a much steadier shot than 1/500. I am not a pro. If you are an amateur with little money, go for it. If you are a pro or an amateur loaded with cash, buy the imported stuff. Don't buy fake Indian stuff with the foreign brand. This is at least, proudly Indian, not fake."
5,I use it to stablize my videos. A gymbal is an overkill for shooting activities where the camera need not move about a lot yet should be able to quickly setup from one to another.
1,The product is un-manageable and you cannot return this product so you are stuck with it. It’s way too heavy and bulky and they have used heavy steel for this. Much more heavier than my tripod and hence pretty much defeats the purpose of a monopod .
1,"On opening the Amazon platic bag I found the cardbox to be opened from one side. The monopod was halfway out, with the camera plate broken. I would request for a refund. The only reason I bought this with paid next day deliver was so that I could have it for my trip to capture videos for the ministry (media work) and now I won't be able to take it. I would like a refund so I can buy digitek because they are always trustable. Considering I will be going for the trip broken hearted I might as well wait a little longer for a good quality monopod."
5,"Product was sturdy and as per description. However, I received a probably used product with several tiny damages all throughout. Promptly returned for a refund, since replacement was not provided as an option."
5,"Good can handle the weight, but some scratches were there under the foam grip also the foam for grip is not good, its come off frequently overall good"
5,"Very sturdy. My 6kg gear seems to be safe on this monopod. Self weight is on the higher side compared to other monoppds in the market. However, I'm happy."
4,I like it for its low price. Besides it Can convenient for small camera and mobile phones. It is OK in this price range. Satisfactory performance. Value for money
5,"Excellent product and value for money. But the packing is horrible, first time I got it damged and missing parts. But they made up the shortcoming in the replacement.Should have included a carry bag also.Strong metal body which can easily carry 10 kg. as claimed."
1,"The box in which it came is completely shattered, and there is only a stand inside it, no attachments nothing, just stand, how the hell should I use it without the attachments?"
1,I had ordered tripod on 9th first time it was delivered without mobile holder then I requested for replacement n once again they delivered but with defective n brocken mobile holder ... very disappointed with Amazon it was not expected ..next time I ll think twice order something on Amazon
5,Sturdy and useful. Buy the mobile holder which had the possiblity of attaching vertical and horizontal if you need that option because just the ball of the tripod will not allow that . I tilt the stand for table top video. Works fine . Good but
5,"The quality is professional level ,osm product never expected this quality ,if someone like to buy in this range , without any problem can buy this, packaging was not good but it is worth to buy , little heavy"
1,A small item repacked badly in a bigger package. All threads missing inside. Original packing seals broken and items inside missing. Very poor packing.
5,"Excellent product, very robust and sturdy. Its value for money. Most importantly - It's Proudly Made in India"
1,The product seems like used and old. Not upto quality as expected and the price they charge. There are many other options which are better than this and more price efficient.
1,"Waste of money and unfinished, no Quantity if you are looking for something sturd. Not recommended for DSLR professional use"
4,"it's heavy to carry along, but sturdy in use. am happy with it."
5,"Since others have mentioned the qualities already, I will just say that I am using it to make dance reels on Instagram and for me it's the best buy😁"
5,Liked : Good Product.Disliked : Amazon will increase the price of the product very quickly.
5,very nice product easy to use
5,Wonderful Product....Made in India and very Good Quality....I was wondering to buy tripod from couple of months but Chinese products are big NO for me......Finally found this....n m so happy
5,Easy to use and of good quality.
5,Very good product in this price.Worth it.
5,Nice product heavy Duty. You may use it for light stand and mobile holder as well. This is not  Horizontal movable video clip.
1,"Don't buy this from this vendor, I returned 3 times. Every time I got used item only.Quality wise good ,and it's heavy."
3,Tripod head fitting problem
4,Not sure of price but tripod is quite sturdy and useful.
5,The product is very good I was recommend this products orders all professional photographer it's very good....
5,Value for money... I really loved this product. Superb..... Fully satisfied... Love to recommend others too. 👍👍
5,Perfect and sturdy. Good for beginners.
5,"Amazing Product,Worth Purchasing.Metal Quality is Good and its of Heavy Material"
5,Strong and sturdy. Value for money.
5,"Really it's amazing.., i didn't expected this much quality. Really tanx a lot to both manufacturer and Amazon."
3,A hanger should be included
4,Damaged piece wanna replace only this damaged one....plz reply how to replace this one
5,"Of all the options available in this price range, i found this one very sturdy and useful. One of my friend was using the other tripod in which the legs were a little fancy. After comparing both this one seems to be better choice. I even used this on my bikes handle and the stability was perfect. The build material is good and the best thing about this is the rotating ballhead which is very stable. I had used both my phone and camera and didn't face any problem. I would recommend this product."
5,I have a YouTube channel and was looking out for a tripod within budget. I came across this product.It is a 10-11 inch tripod.It is suitable for holding cannon camera as well but do not use for heavy weight cameras.It turns allaround 360 degree easily without any issue.Looks is also good
5,The Build Quality is good The Design is also good The 360° Rotating Skills are really awesome You really liked it it is best if you want to make a smooth video. And If You have Youtube Channel so It is Best Choice For You.
4,"Let's begin what I like about this tripod:1) It is extremely sturdy.When compared to tripod with beads, this one is more sturdy. It doesn't have any beads so you don't have to worry about it's sturdiness, it won't break easily.2) It is super flexible.You can twist the legs of this tripod, bend them, tie them together or keep them straight. It will stay rock solid untill you want.What I don't like about this Tripod?1) Mobile Phone HolderThe quality of the holder is pretty basic. It grips the mobile well but it doesn't inspire confidence.Also, don't mount your phone without cover otherwise it will give scratches on the sides of your phone.Overall, it's a great FIRST tripod. If you are getting started with photography like I am, then you can buy it.You'll start liking it more and more as you use it."
1,Believe me its of very poor quality. Hear me out...1. If you are a professional or you want to use this regularly please spend some more and get a good tripod. Just streach your budget. It will be worth it. Dont cheap out on this.2. I bought this for casual use and still returned it because it was just not worth it. I would rather wait and save some money and get a good quality one than spend my money on this. Good quality one will cost maybe twice as much but there's no use in having cheap quality stuff. It will mostly fail you when you need it the most. I don't feel confident in putting my relatively expensive camera or phone on this flimsy piece of hardware.Think about it. And still if you think you really need a cheap gorillapod in your life then go for it.Ps. I bought it because it had lots of reviews and decent positive ratings. I don't know how the other reviews are so positive.
5,"First of all , I bought this for my daughter as she wants to become a blogger and she saw me the same tripod on a you tube video..and asked me to buy same .. that's why i searched this on amazon and bought the same .. This tripod looks good , and best part is we can move its legs in every directions.its hight is 13inch ..easy in use and looks durable as many bloggers use this type of tripod.. my daughter is very happy as she got a good and useful tripod ..."
4,"So finally i received another product in exchange of same, previously which i ordered in thats there wz no propr attachments, the screw wz not attaching to the mobile holder and the tripod wz damaged, this time i got perfect 10 inch tripod with perfect holder and good quality, but one thing i wud say that before any shipping seller shud check if the product is proper with all the accessories or not bcz customers face problem cz of them by exchanging agin and again. other then that m happy this time i got good product after so much of hussling."
5,The small device does all that it showed in the Amazon site description.I used my Nikon D5600 DSLR on this and was OK. The flexible legs can really be bent as you want to make it stand on different surfaces. The screw fits well into the groove below the camera. It also has a mobile holder where one can place any mobile for a self timed shot. Size and weight makes it easy to carry where it becomes difficult to carry your normal full sized stand.The material of build is good and seems sturdy.Good buy at the very low investment.
4,Packaging needs to be improved - the smartphone holder was broken the moment I turned the package and the quality is cheap but my primary need was to use this tripod with Canon 200D as a vlogging setup and for that it's good.The tripod is stableThe legs are grippy as wellAs it does not have the ball head the setup feels much more stable.I also have the fotopro ufo 2 but I prefer adofy (this tripod) over it because1- it's real affordable2- it feels more stableUsed it for couple of times and overall satisfied
5,"I purchased this for mobile idk about camera experience.It's sturdy. Easy to set up. The screw at the back of the ball is for tightening the rotating ball. The product is basically made of plastic and rubber. Looks not excellent but decent. Flexible to the extent I would like it to. Yes, you can hang it on the pole or upside down. Yes, you can trust it with your mobile (idk how much weight it can take as mobile are fairly light weight in comparison to cameras)It's better if you can set it up and not move it much cause certain movement are actually for opening the parts and not for moving the camera actually.Got it for Rs 699.You can opt for it.Only one complain it packing was not upto the mark but the delivery was prompt. The Adofs box was not tapped. I would have preferred it. But we can let it slip considering the product is good."
5,"I'm happy with the purchase. The ball head is of good quality, anodised finish, doesn't feel plastic-y. The phone holder that comes with it however feels not that sturdy and you can hear the springs inside. Hope it lasts a few uses. The ball head has a universal mount, now I wouldn't however trust it with my heavier DSLRs. I tried to mount my D7200 with 18-200 lens and I felt nervous. The head can hold the weight if you screw it tightly enough and the camera may remain steady if you perhaps spread the stands in a measured manner, but that's careful calculation and I wouldn't advise that. The heavy lens does tend to tip forward. But overall satisfied with it. I'm going to use it with my phone to follow my  doggy for his YouTube channel! 😊"
5,"I was pretty skeptical about purchasing this, since the original JOBY gorillapods come for more than 5k rupees. But after handling this for the first time, I can confidently say that it is worth what you pay. If it can keep the DSLR stable, then it is very much appropriate and maybe the best choice for a smartphone. It gets one solid smartphone accessory and a GoPro mount too.I have attached some pics. This is only the first impression, I have not used it much as of now. I will, however, use it and edit this in the near future.For now I can say that you can go for it!"
1,The actual height without phone holder is 9 inchPlus there is no ball rotatorAnd the actual product is not adofys as shown in imageActually it's a little cheap oneWhich the dealer is sailing showing image of adofysIt's a fraudWhy they are doing so
1,"So, I love most things about this product. The gorilla arm works nice, albeit a bit shorter than I hoped for. The mounts are interchangeable. Can freely move the top part 360deg and lock in place.I bought this to use my phone as a webcam during the pandemic. Here's where the problem starts: the included phone holder is pathetic.It has this elastic mechanism to grip your phone which is the culprit. It's way too tight! It's not easy to loosen it to insert your phone or to take your phone out and I struggle everytime I have to do it. I use my phone with a clear silicone case and I didnt remove it when using it with this holder. After many times using it, one day, this tight grip caused the glass on the backside of my phone to break. Cracks appeared right at the point where the holder was gripping my phone at. Luckily, my display was spared but I've avoided using it since then.So, be very careful about your usage before buying this. I'd recommend getting another phone holder for use with this or trying a different product.To the manufacturer: probably don't use this tight latching mechanism, replace it with an adjustable manual locking mechanism."
5,To be honest I ordered a number of mini tripods from Amazon but most of them came either broken or of bad quality. So I increased my budget just a little and I ordered this. It's plastic is more strong and steady. The tripod handels the weight of my mobile nicely. Just a little concerned if I will be able to use it for the long run. The ball rotator is pretty good and excellent for mobile phones. The mobile bracket could be better but I am not complaining.
5,Nice product good quality good for gifting can be used for mobile and DSLR cameras I use it for my YouTube channel and it is really good for my YouTube channel satisfied by the product and recommend you to buy this it comes in a low price so anyone can order this
5,"The design and what it allows you to do is fabulous and I am amazed every time what all I can achieve with this. May it be mounting your phone for a family photo, using it to mount a microphone for your podcast show or some sort of small screen while at shooting. It just makes your life easy. It is very easy and quick to use and sorts your purpose in no time.The only issue I am facing it, the rubber grips on the pods is sort of coming off from the neck after every use. So I end up putting it back every time and then storing it when I don’t need it. I am not sure if initially it was glued and the glue has come off or the design itself includes no glue in which case it is a flaw.Nevertheless I am happy with the utility and would recommend it to anyone who finds this interesting but is not sure to order it. Just go for it."
5,I just unboxed this product and just like the simplicity of this item.It's plastic and looks durable and it's totally flexibleI liked and i assume it'll last. Long time.Very good purchase i must say.One can buy if you're tired of watching movies/show by holding in your hand.I don't have camera so i don't know how that'll work.And yes you got a mobile holder which looks normal not so called tough quality.
1,"Such a poor quality tripod. The legs are loose, the packing was opened, no name of the brand 'Adofys' over the box.Better spend more bucks and try Fotopro Ufo 2 or Solofix GorillaPod.This one is really worst purchase ever."
4,"I was looking for a vlogging tripod for my gopro. I came across all the options but all of them were on the higher budget side. Even the gopro tripod costs you more than 2k.I compared it with all the available options and trust me this is worth buying. It is sturdy but the grip is on the average side. It is fine for me as I took it for vlogs.Also, it is light weight and can be fit in your bag easily. The mobile mount comes with grip which I like the most.One suggestion: BUY FROM OFFICIAL WEBSITE. It is almost 200rs cheaper. Else go with this one."
5,"This is nice and superb product but the tripod''s box was fully damaged, but the product is nice, it has flexible leg, you can buy this product, as it's not high prise, you can buy, and a free holder"
5,"The build quality of the product is very good. I'm using this tripod stand for Gopro and Digital camera.The digital camera can be mounted directly, whereas, we need a tripod adapter for GoPro.The mobile holder is also good and fits properly.Best for GoPro and Timelapse and still photography with Cameras.When we pan the camera, it gets unscrewed. This is the only drawback."
1,"I've ordered 2 products from amazon in the last 2 days and both were defective, I had to return one order but can't return this one as I need tripod for some work urgently.The customer's time is not free that he's gonna play the return game everyday and wait for the actual product for like 10-20 days. SHAME"
3,"Although the product is sturdy, may not sturdy enough for multipurpose use (phone and dslr cameras) . The bulge that you see in the picture is the screw that pierces into the phone holder holder. That restricts the phone to remain in a proper grip. If it is loosened , the weight of the phone makes the holder to swivel (I use an iPhone SE - old version)."
5,"It is really good tripod. The phone holder is pretty reliable but still, it is a spring action holder so I don't expect it to last long. It might not be good idea to try and hold a DSLR on it but it can handle Mirrorless. The ball head can easily hold my a6300 + kit lense. However it struggles with the Sigma 30mm prime and I do not expect it to hold camera kit any heavier than that. However, I think the tripod, without the ball head can hold the bigger lenses. In the end it does work for me and I'm happy with this."
5,I am not a photographer but I just like to click my own picture and shoot some time-lapses.It is just perfect for meIt is not that light weight but it actually feels sturdy in you hand.On the handle hard rubber coating and other parts are of plastic.ROG phone2 fits perfectly in this.
5,Love the product. Can hold DSLR with almost all the kit lenses. But for heavier lenses you shouldn't consider this. Disappointed with the mobile holder. I would suggest everyone who wants to use it for mobile. Holder is not reliable. Mobile tend to sleep. Please go with the third party mobile holder. You cannot get best tripod in this range
5,Good and worth the money ...have been using for ...4 months ...it’s very useful for online meeting ...I don’t use much to hang it anywhere with those legs ...it’s a good tripod with flexy adjustmentThe holder is bit tight to hold the mobile  ...but that’s not a big issue ...as we want our phone to be safe ...
4,"It's a good tripod , value for money if you consider the price 650Rs., the quality of the material is nice, the ball joint is metal, the legs are flexible, the phone adapter is also good, however it cannot support DSLR's whatsoever, works great for phones, and small video camsgot the same product as advertised, one disappointing this was that I received a 9 inch tripod instead of 12"
1,"Quality is not good. Firstly when I ordered this item, I got only mobile holder items are missing. Then after replacement, I got my product and  I saw that the quality of the product is very bad. We can get better quality at this price. It's just to showcase that you are having a tripod with you.Think about it. And still, if you think you really need a bad Gorillapod in your life then go for it.Ps. I bought it because it had lots of reviews and decent positive ratings. I don't know how the other reviews are so positive."
4,Needed urgently a stable ipod and tried contacting many offline vendors as tripods with good reviews was showing delivery time greater than a week.I was a little skeptical about this product but I am quite happy with its quality and its complete value for money.How much you ask?Check with any camera accessories shop and they are selling this for upwards of 1000 Rs.This is the best tripod under 1000 Rs.Thankyou for the seller for selling such good product at such a reasonable price.
2,"Does the job of holding but it isn't much stable. It cannot take much weight, ball head cannot withstand much weight. Once u bend the leg, dont think of getting straighten. Good for mobiles though and less weighed cameras. U need to keep on adjusting the ball head and tighten it full. While doing that, don't feel confident enough that the head gets damaged."
4,I personally preferred this over the black-white gorilla pods because I they gets crack after some usage except for above Rs1000 range. Product is great. Hard rubbers and the upper mobile mounting is very easy due to the help of 360 degree ball mounted on it.
4,Great for use with mobile. I have also used with mirror less camera - sony a6000. So definitely useful foe lighter cameras/dslrs/mirror less. Keep in mind it is not very sturdy and cannot be your main tripod in windy situation or when surface is very rough/not level. I used during my trek in Spiti and it was useful. But during windy weather it did not feel reliable.
5,"1)tripod is looking good2)stiff,3)can hold a dslr4)legs have anti slip surface ,5)easy to mount , hang on any surface6)provided moblie holder  with 2 nut s for vertical and horizontal7)good length8)good packing"
4,I bought it during the whole corona virus situation... and i got it on may 11th... the expected date was 15th... the pod is not too heavy but feels decently sturdy the leg is rubber  and the head part is plastic of decent quality... it came with a phone holder that accepts pretty much every phone... the ball head is a little rough but i assume is will get smooth after some use... the ball heads screw will come of if turned too much... and if its lost... its un usable... i wish it was a little bit longer... but am happy with this...  the leg is really flexible anf study... overall am really happy... if u are looking for a low budget gorrilla pod of ur phone or dlsr... go for it...u get what u pay for... ☺️
4,"the legs are flexible and sturdy, the ball head is good as well. the mobile mount included is not of the best quality and a it would have been appreciated that if a better quality phone mount was provided."
5,"Writing this after a month's usage.It's compact, sturdy and easily operable. The mount head is adjustable and offers a free rotation around its axis. The legs can be easily moulded into any shape that fits your angle and can be re moulded back into original shape very easily. Overall it's been handy and compact to use. Definitely a good buy if you're planning to buy a mini durable tripod."
4,"Be careful when using the tripod for DSLRs. The ballhead tends to move when we place a DSLR on it. The tripod feels sturdy, but the ballhead feels a bit cheaper. Its better suited for mobile phones."
5,"This product is easy to handle and gives best quality results. Tried this for the first time and I have comparatively way more good result in sense of video stabilization as this gave me many options like I can use this for my vlogs, or mount it on shoulder and have a hands free angle. I tried many variations with different angles and videos were as per my expectations. Over-all the product has met it's quality standards and also my expectations."
5,"Wonderful product , More than expectation , Built quality is ultimate. Heavy metal and heavy fiber used. Appretitate the MADE IN INDIA COMPANY"
4,"Heavy,  sturdy  and good product with mobile holder...Before i use this product i use 2-3 different tripod... but all that break nd not working condition in 20 to 30 day on regular use...But this product is very sturdy...and very good product...If u want to buy tripod,  then sure go ahead with this...Just one point and that not any issue...-- minimum height of stand is aprox near to between 2-3 feet...So if u want to seat at floor and display paper/drwaing from the floor ... then ....phone camera is above 3 feet...ElseVery very very  good And best product in this time..."
4,"I like the product but packaging was not good. Not properly packaged. Inside Box was open and Amazon box was somehow tapped.This monopod is is very strong it's rod are of metal and due to that it's weight is not suitable for selfie purposes, so be aware if you are going to buy this for selfie purpose. It is purely and perfect for tripod stand type use.Quality is very good.But I got some scratches in this monopod which I am little disappointed by the seller. You can see the pictures.Overall it is value for money and strong monopod."
5,Amazing Product.Built quality - 10/10Extension >5ft  - 10/10As a Monopod - 10/10As a Selfie Stick - 10/10Ease of use - 10/10Weight - quite heavy coz it's monopod. If you use it as selfie stick you will feel a bit heavier.
5,"I was looking for a tripod / monopod to support a 300 mm tele lens. A cheap aluminium tripod I already have does not have the stability to hold a heavy telephoto lens. So I started looking for a stronger monopod.This monopod is solid and claims to hold up to 10kg. It is sturdy to hold the tele lens. Now I have decided to use the existing shaky tripod for the flash.Prolite monomod is great value for money. Under Rs. 900, you don't expect it to offer what a Rs. 9000 imported tripod or monopod will. The overall structure is strong. Finish is so so. The rubber grip is loose. The metal is strong, but the plastic clamps look a bit ordinary. But I am not looking for a monopod that will last a lifetime. I am looking for something that is cheap and good. So I give it five stars.On its own, the product is self sufficient. However, I attached a ball head. It works well.On a 300 telephoto for birding, I would need 1/500 of a second handheld shots. With this monopod I can go as slow as 340th of a second to get a much steadier shot than 1/500. I am not a pro. If you are an amateur with little money, go for it. If you are a pro or an amateur loaded with cash, buy the imported stuff. Don't buy fake Indian stuff with the foreign brand. This is at least, proudly Indian, not fake."

4,Yes it charges my 2100mah battery in just about 45 minutes the display is not good quality and I don't know when it might stop working and you can't see it from certain angles but the main problem is that it gets so hot after just 20 minutes of usage and by hot I mean really really hot but other than that it works as promised just so you know I use 2100mah envie batteriesIf you buy this product please take the time to write about the things you love or hate about itAS ALLWAYS THANK YOU FOR READING THIS REVIEW IF YOU FOUND THIS HELPFULL OR UNHELPFUL YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO
1,"This product is merely an astute scheme to fleece the customers. The premium feel is misleading. It consists of just a small transformer (contributing most of the weight), a few surface-mount resistors and diodes and precisely two LEDs. The cumulative cost of these components would hardly exceed ₹50. Throw in its liking of turning into an scorching piece of plastic while charging, and you have the perfect recipe for disaster."
5,Nice product
5,Packaging was good. MRP mentioned ₹250. I bought it for ₹171. Working condition and both leds are working fine.. it's better to spend less amount on this things which can be used rarely instead of spending 500 or 1000₹.I bought charger and 4 pack battery for ₹325 which is awesome at this price point.
1,"This charger charges the battery quickly as specified. Quality is good. The major issue is heating. If two or more batteries are charged together, heats up a lot, makes the battery very hot and can't touch the battery for few minutes after recharge. As batteries get very hot it may reduce battery life. I will not recommend this product."
1,"I bought this Amazon basic AA  2400 mah four batteries along with envie fast charger on 25th july 2019. but quite disappointing, i did replacement once on 2nd august and finally retuned today(12august). Since batteries were showing full charged after putting in envie faster charger for 1.5-2hours still it is not showing fully charged the batteries. But after putting these fully charged batteries in my toy, its performance/power supply is less so toy music comes  with vibraration, like batteries already drain out or not fully charged. And it used in very simple hanging toy which has just music and very slow rotation, last for 5-6 hours only. I couldn't understand that problem is due to batteries or charger.Whereas when i used duracell non rechargeable 1500mah batteries, it was last more than 16 hours. I spoken customer care also, but they were helpless and suggested to replace.customer care support was very good.every dealer is also good. Only problem is with product. i pay thanks to Amazon to cooparate.I suggest not to buy these batteries and charger.Pls suggest me some better charger and batteries because It is needed for my son's toy based on your experience.Thanks,Chandra Shekhar"
5,"The Charger quality is Outstanding. I could not ask for a better Quality.The Material used on this Product is World Class.And the CORD, oh my Goodness! So Incredible.This is so Awesome. I'm LOVIN' it.You guys out there can buy this Product without a Second Thought.Yep, it is that Good.Thanks to the Seller for getting me this Incredible piece of Battery Charger!!!"
4,"Bought this charger, skeptical about the quality of the charger. Replaced camelion charger which lasted around 5 years with this one.This one charges cells individually unlike many chargers which charges cells in pair. The batteries now retain charge longer than with the previous faulty one. Using this to charge Eneloop and Camelion NiMH precharged batteries for more than one month without any issues.Charging speed is fast compared to previous model. This seems to have auto cut off as the charging indicator stops blinking when completely charged."
4,Overall the build quality is good. Led indicator lights are perfect in brightness.Most important:You can not charge single cell in this charger. the charging will start only when you insert two cells.Also the case is same with 3. The third one will not charge until there are 4 cells. I use an extra spare cell just to complete the circuit.
1,"Made in: PRC (Public Republic of CHINA)How many times I got my batteries charged with this charger: ZERO TIMESComments: No instructions about charging,For how long one should keep the four batteries placed together for completely charging.Or For how long one battery should be kept in charging, since this not the ""AUTO-CUT"" Charger.Generally it is 10 hours for four batteries,if put together in charger, I did the same, Result: All four batteries are spoiled and charger's charging light is off,and it's dead.Recommendation: Never Purchase this item. Go for a charger,that has ""Auto-Cut"" option,when batteries are fully charged."
4,"Actual results -AA 2800 mAH  x 4 batteries takes 6.3 Hours for full charge...AA 2800 mAH  x 2 batteries takes 2.5 Hours for full charge...Battery temperature is high, it's obvious with rapid charges...Faster than Envie ECR-20"
1,I js recieved the package.. I inserted my AAA batteries to be charged in it but aft seconds it started showing error .I removed the baateries and again did the same process bt again showed error now dont know if the product is faulty or what
1,"As another reviewer has also pointed out this charger overheats and a burning smell is clearly discernible after it is put into the power socket.  Envie batteries meant for this charger take 4 to 7 hours to recharge but the burning smell and overheating is in evidence within an hour of charging.  The first charger I purchased was replaced by Amazon on request but the same problem is there with replacement charger.  Therefore, I can only conclude this is a fundamental flaw with this charger.  Given my experience thus far, it is not unreasonable to assume the charger will overheat and burn out after a short period. A product redesign is needed.  As the saying goes, caveat emptor  or buyer beware."
1,So today i tested with 2100mah envie Ni-Mh batteries.. it took almost 1hr to show full charge symbol.. so i thought great its fast.. but then i switched off and on in a gap of 10sec.. charging startrd again with 1point.. and charged for 1hr.. now showing full charge but batteries got heated and i took risk and turned on again same problem started from 1point.. but this time i removed.. so my conclusion is there is no auto cutoff there is no battery charge detection.. waste of money
5,I am happy with the product and it has all the specifications as mentioned on the website. The charging indicators are best and good visibility. I am not sure how long the product goes on but it is really doing it job. The AAA battery slot is bit tightened maybe after a couple of uses it may be alright.1. One can charge 4 AA batteries or 4 AAA batteries or combination maximum of 4 at a time.2) The charing indicator is the best of it.3) Chargins speed is also alright to me. For 2500mah it took 3 hours
3,"I hope to write a long term review. Right now after about a month of usage the battery is working well, holding charge enough to power my camcorders, walkmans, and world band tuners for weeks. The charge cycle frequency is over three weeks with charge depleting as per usage. The  charger seems to be working well to though heats up a bit, though I guess that has more to do with the ambient 45 degree summer heat right now.I know some other sites are offering this at a lower price of INR 500 or less for 4 2100 mah battery and including a charger, but I chose Amazon even though they were higher priced at INR 600 just to be sure that I get the genuine item, which I seem to have. I remember when I used to buy these in the eighties and nineties at a much lower priced point to power my walkmans and cameras,  but I guess those days are for memories now. My feedback to the manufacturer of this product is that include a timing circuit inside the charger like some Sony charges do which cut off charge voltage after a preset time of say 12 hours, as a slower charge and deplete rate extends battery life, and with that feature that Sony chargers offer but not Envie ECR 20, one needn't worry about having accidently forgotten the charger attached to the power terminal and returning home to find swollen batteries."
1,"two batter not charged after few day usage ,please avoid to buy this brandSize of the battery is larger compare to standard sizewe dont know where to claim the warranty .i purchased 8 battery and ECR 11 Speedster Charger .waste of money"
2,"Out  of 2-ports(for 4 no batteries), one port is not functioning since last 2 months. I am now using the charger for charging only 2 batteries at a time. Co. will say that didn't my product worked satisfactorily till warranty period ? I shall be forced to say 'Yes'. But my question would be 'will you purchase a product just for using for 1-2 years or your expectation would be for 4-5 years life' . Choice is yours. Mr. Envie, your approach for quality would now be envied by every charger manufacturer, because this would be a very profitable proposition."
1,"Durability is pretty useless. No body pickup the fuking phone of their customer care. 4th time I charge my batteries and it short-circuit. It is gone. It used to heat like as if I can boil the milk in it. Pretty useless. And yes ""value for money"" if U WANT TO BUY this useless product. Better To give some poor or loose the money then to buy it. I can't understand why is Appario Selling it. I purchased it because Appario was the seller. Period."
4,Nice product for the price. Built quality looks nice. Indicator is a unique feature which you don't find in any battery charger.It helps you indentify bad batteries.Amazon delivery was in time and properly packed.Overall it's a good product.
1,I bought it since it was tagged as amazon choice.Here's why I'd rate it 1 star:1. There's place for 4 Cells (I used AAA) but If I charge more than 2 then it gives some error in charging. So I have to charge 2 at a time.2. I used the charged cells but they discharged it very soon.Using Duracell AAA cells. Brand New.
1,They have send me a dummy product which is not even TV speedster ECR land and the battery when infested it out the why was so weak then you can say that this is the democratic and uploading the pictures to you all people can have a view of envy speedster battery charger which is getting the heaviest Abdul costly banking that it may burst also it's getting very over heated and all this things when I call Amazon people stating that I am I got a product or you can say duplicate products what they say yes they always do the same so we have we take a complaint against the dealer and we get the dealers in know about this things no
5,"Bought the product with a few apprehensions, especially after I read a few reviews which mentioned that the unit gets overheated. I expected that to happen, but fortunately the unit did not heat up other than the normal heating up when one leaves batteries for a charge overnight. The great thing about this product is that it has a LCD display on the charge that is there in all the four batteries when connected. Happy so far."
1,Batteries may be good but ECR11 charger is really worst. I returned it stating the reason it takes very long to detect fully charged batteries and shows as charging for around 10 mins. The seller mailed me stating the reason is silly. And also there are many reviews about the charger that when you power on the charger without batteries it display the LCD green light and turns off as there are no batteries but nothing happens like that. The display just stays on. Is that normal or defected not sure but the seller never replied to that.
1,"First I am happy for excellent service by Amazon but if they provide return window for this kind of items this will definitely help it's customers to make right choice as these items are really of cheap quality.The quality and performance is not good, go for panasonic or duracell.Since there is no return window for this product, you will definitely feel regret after purchasing it.  This is fine if you get it below or at ₹75.  Even if you get it at ₹100, you might regret your purchase."
1,"Didn't wanted to trust a non-branded product. But bought by trusting the 4 star average rating amount 10k+ reviews. Unfortunately I felt among the rest 1 star purchasers.The product stopped working in 1 hour. The batteries that comes with the charger are not fully charged. There were only charged one third. Left the barriers in charge. The charger got turned off in less than an hour and never worked again. I tried with Duracell batteries as well. The charger never turned on.Also the charger doesn't come in a sealed pack. It is only stapled. So I doubt if it is used, already faulty or dolate duplicate product.I bought this in 2020 Prime sale. I also doubt if Amazon or the sellers are using the sale to clear out faulty products. Because of we return the product, the total order value goes before 5k and the 10% discount gets cancelled for all the remaining items we bought also.This is the second time I get faulty products from Amazon Shipping Festivals. Happened during 2019 Prime Sale also."
1,"I ordered this and realised I needed AAA batteries but this set give only AA. On  the same day of receipt,  I entered return/replacement but NOTHING happened. I am saddled with the USELESS set with me now. No word from  amazon or the manufacturer. The misleading description that it cherges both AAA and AA batteries made me think I may get BOTH AAA and AA batteries. I needed the AAA batteries desperately. So, I made alternate purchases. What surpirsed me is that, I cliked the return or replacement link but NOTHING happened. I don't know why such a claim is being made that this product has 10 days replacement. I am much disappointed with amazon's monitoring of mesleading and deceptive product descriptions, of late. One has to read a lot of small print to find out what to expect from the pictures and text now-a-days. I am speaking this being a customer of years of standing and of late observing this feature. Legally, it is not wrong, but you see very very deceptive and misleading products and this is definitely one of them. And, support just non-existent in some cases."
5,"Many people are complaining for its other models as they were transformer based or rectifier based converting AC to DC, EC11 MC model takes DC as input from your mobile chargers hence no heating or any other issue with it also the speedx model is a fast charge type charger so can charge your batteries full in an hour or less and due to its trickle charge property batteries are protected from overcharging and heating issues. Easy to carry and easy to use."
1,Batteries are in bad shape. Dents and scratches are found on every battery. Disappointed.
3,"The product has a nice design, looks relatively well made ""from the outside"". It has two indicators led that are red in colour. This is where the confusion starts. The two red led are on the two sides of the device which may house 4 AAA or 4 AA cells. So, first when one of the LEDs lit what does it mean one cell is charging or two cells are charging? Once the cell charges to full capacity the LEDs don't change colour. So it's difficult to tell when the cells have fully charged. If you can ignore this then the product gets 4 stars from me as it also has a over charge protection, i however do not like this  confusion hence the 3 stars"
5,"It's a decent charger, in this price. Do not expect hi end features like auto cut (upon full charge) or individual unit charge. The charge output is low @ 150 mah meaning it can charge both NiCad & NiMh units.The inside consists of a rudimentary circuit, involving primarily a transformer. It heats up rather alarmingly, so I drilled 4 holes to enable heat dissipation. DO NOT LEAVE IT ON CHARGE OVERNIGHT. Rather, use it for two hours followed by a half hour break, about 5 times for AAA & 8 for AA (depending on either's specific mah). Overcharging is BAD for both, especially NiMh.It's a GOOD buy considering the price."
1,Cons:1. Its a dumb charger. It will not cut off automatically2. Transformer inside heats abnormally which is a fire hazard3. You cannot charge a single cell. You have to charge 2 and that too in the adjacent slot4. Detrimental to battery life and charge cyclesPros: Just one. It charges while it lastsAmazon wont refund even if product is defective and will die in the long run. Better buy Panasonic/Eneloop charger and batteries and get peace of mind. Works flawlessly. Envie is cheap and useless
3,ERC-20 MC.It's a fair product. Doesn't do much. Doesn't do less. Good at doing one job that is charging. Biggest turn off is the indicators. They stay lit all the time don't expect them to turn off when battery is full. Don't expect super fast charging.I think mc stands for multi connector. This guy supports USB-C and micro usb charging ports.Good for household use.Not recommended for professionals.
5,"During last 5 year i always searched for a Battery Charger that come upto my expectation, as being a Dad of 3 year kid , i always need lot of batteries and always look for battery charger option but always come out with a faulty charger, but my search really got end with this charger. its LCD display is just awesome.  Its a must buy if you are a regular battery charger needy."
5,"I like the product very much, performance is pretty fair, so is price. i charged my 1900 mah battery cell somewhere between 1-2 hours not more than that, 2 cells at a time, only disadvantage i felt if they provide percentage indicator would have been much better. But still thats not a main issue. I still like the product, may be in future 2nd version of speedster company will provide that too in affordable price. I hope this review will also help other customers."
2,"The device stopped working after a couple of months. Yes, there is a one year warranty on the product and I can definitely claim my warranty and the company would honour it. But that is not practical. The thing is I am required to courier the product to them in Delhi and the courier charges are about 500 rupees - which is the about equal to the price of the product. So I guess I will just buy another charging device but this time, I will take a better quality one, even if it paying a bit more. (By the way, the manufacturers do not read your emails, so don't bother to write to them.)"
3,"I observed this with the help of usb ammeter. For instance it’s taking 500ma with all four cells charging, when one of them gets charged earlier, the current consumption is same, same when the second one is full.So technically now the charger is charging the rest of two with double current which is unsafe specially when only the last one remained in charging state and the current was still almost the same, all of it is going to one battery. I couldn’t observe an intelligent charge logic in it."
1,Envie - what a letdown! The batteries stopped holding charge very quickly... 2800MaH lol - nonsense. Completely dead batteries will show 3/4th charge on the speedster. You can keep the batteries charging for a day and then it might have enough power to run a remote control but little else. Save your money and buy a better product from Panasonic or Duracell. I don't know why I bought so many of their batteries and chargers based on some of the positive reviews here - should have taken my advice from the critical negative ones which share a similar viewpoint to this review. In a nutshell they are selling low performance products with no QA of any kind. You have been warned.
4,"Here is a tip, for those of you who are facing heating issues. Try charging two batteries at a time instead of 4.For AA 2800mah capacity, no need to charge more than 45mins. Battery will reach full charge. For AAA batteries you can charge an hour.Usage: i use these batteries for playing games with my xbox one controller. Even after extensive gaming sessions over the weekend the battery still has juice left for more.If you are using these for digi cam your mileage may vary. I am yet to test this on digi cam. Majority of people are using smartphones these days. So professionals would be the ones in need if these for photography.Conclusin: All in all its a good purchase if you follow the above mentioned instructions."
4,"Reviewing after a month of usage.The best thing that I liked about the charger is the charging speed. ECR 11 charges the same battery almost 3 times faster then ECR 20.Time taken to charge a AA 2800mAh battery from 0 to 100 is almost 1 & half hour.The charger can also be used to charge AAA batteriesAlso the Envie batteries have stood upto the expectations.The only issue with the product is heating issue. The product heats up slightly while using, so make sure to turnit off after fully charging the batteries"
4,Yes it charges my 2100mah battery in just about 45 minutes the display is not good quality and I don't know when it might stop working and you can't see it from certain angles but the main problem is that it gets so hot after just 20 minutes of usage and by hot I mean really really hot but other than that it works as promised just so you know I use 2100mah envie batteriesIf you buy this product please take the time to write about the things you love or hate about itAS ALLWAYS THANK YOU FOR READING THIS REVIEW IF YOU FOUND THIS HELPFULL OR UNHELPFUL YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO
1,"This product is merely an astute scheme to fleece the customers. The premium feel is misleading. It consists of just a small transformer (contributing most of the weight), a few surface-mount resistors and diodes and precisely two LEDs. The cumulative cost of these components would hardly exceed ₹50. Throw in its liking of turning into an scorching piece of plastic while charging, and you have the perfect recipe for disaster."
5,Nice product
5,Packaging was good. MRP mentioned ₹250. I bought it for ₹171. Working condition and both leds are working fine.. it's better to spend less amount on this things which can be used rarely instead of spending 500 or 1000₹.I bought charger and 4 pack battery for ₹325 which is awesome at this price point.
1,"This charger charges the battery quickly as specified. Quality is good. The major issue is heating. If two or more batteries are charged together, heats up a lot, makes the battery very hot and can't touch the battery for few minutes after recharge. As batteries get very hot it may reduce battery life. I will not recommend this product."
1,"I bought this Amazon basic AA  2400 mah four batteries along with envie fast charger on 25th july 2019. but quite disappointing, i did replacement once on 2nd august and finally retuned today(12august). Since batteries were showing full charged after putting in envie faster charger for 1.5-2hours still it is not showing fully charged the batteries. But after putting these fully charged batteries in my toy, its performance/power supply is less so toy music comes  with vibraration, like batteries already drain out or not fully charged. And it used in very simple hanging toy which has just music and very slow rotation, last for 5-6 hours only. I couldn't understand that problem is due to batteries or charger.Whereas when i used duracell non rechargeable 1500mah batteries, it was last more than 16 hours. I spoken customer care also, but they were helpless and suggested to replace.customer care support was very good.every dealer is also good. Only problem is with product. i pay thanks to Amazon to cooparate.I suggest not to buy these batteries and charger.Pls suggest me some better charger and batteries because It is needed for my son's toy based on your experience.Thanks,Chandra Shekhar"

5,I am happy with the product and it has all the specifications as mentioned on the website. The charging indicators are best and good visibility. I am not sure how long the product goes on but it is really doing it job. The AAA battery slot is bit tightened maybe after a couple of uses it may be alright.1.

3,"I hope to write a long term review. Right now after about a month of usage the battery is working well, holding charge enough to power my camcorders, walkmans, and world band tuners for weeks.

5,"Many people are complaining for its other models as they were transformer based or rectifier based converting AC to DC, EC11 MC model takes DC as input from your mobile chargers hence no heating or any other issue with it also the speedx model is a fast charge type charger so can charge your batteries full in an hour or less and due to its trickle charge property batteries are protected from overcharging and heating issues. Easy to carry and easy to use."
1,Batteries are in bad shape. Dents and scratches are found on every battery. Disappointed.
3,"The product has a nice design, looks relatively well made ""from the outside"". It has two indicators led that are red in colour. This is where the confusion starts. The two red led are on the two sides of the device which may house 4 AAA or 4 AA cells. So, first when one of the LEDs lit what does it mean one cell is charging or two cells are charging? Once the cell charges to full capacity the LEDs don't change colour. So it's difficult to tell when the cells have fully charged. If you can ignore this then the product gets 4 stars from me as it also has a over charge protection, i however do not like this  confusion hence the 3 stars"
5,"It's a decent charger, in this price. Do not expect hi end features like auto cut (upon full charge) or individual unit charge. The charge output is low @ 150 mah meaning it can charge both NiCad & NiMh units.The inside consists of a rudimentary circuit, involving primarily a transformer. It heats up rather alarmingly, so I drilled 4 holes to enable heat dissipation. DO NOT LEAVE IT ON CHARGE OVERNIGHT. Rather, use it for two hours followed by a half hour break, about 5 times for AAA & 8 for AA (depending on either's specific mah). Overcharging is BAD for both, especially NiMh.It's a GOOD buy considering the price."
1,Cons:1. Its a dumb charger. It will not cut off automatically2. Transformer inside heats abnormally which is a fire hazard3. You cannot charge a single cell. You have to charge 2 and that too in the adjacent slot4. Detrimental to battery life and charge cyclesPros: Just one. It charges while it lastsAmazon wont refund even if product is defective and will die in the long run. Better buy Panasonic/Eneloop charger and batteries and get peace of mind. Works flawlessly. Envie is cheap and useless
3,ERC-20 MC.It's a fair product. Doesn't do much. Doesn't do less. Good at doing one job that is charging. Biggest turn off is the indicators. They stay lit all the time don't expect them to turn off when battery is full. Don't expect super fast charging.I think mc stands for multi connector. This guy supports USB-C and micro usb charging ports.Good for household use.Not recommended for professionals.
5,"During last 5 year i always searched for a Battery Charger that come upto my expectation, as being a Dad of 3 year kid , i always need lot of batteries and always look for battery charger option but always come out with a faulty charger, but my search really got end with this charger. its LCD display is just awesome.  Its a must buy if you are a regular battery charger needy."
5,"I like the product very much, performance is pretty fair, so is price. i charged my 1900 mah battery cell somewhere between 1-2 hours not more than that, 2 cells at a time, only disadvantage i felt if they provide percentage indicator would have been much better. But still thats not a main issue. I still like the product, may be in future 2nd version of speedster company will provide that too in affordable price. I hope this review will also help other customers."
2,"The device stopped working after a couple of months. Yes, there is a one year warranty on the product and I can definitely claim my warranty and the company would honour it. But that is not practical. The thing is I am required to courier the product to them in Delhi and the courier charges are about 500 rupees - which is the about equal to the price of the product. So I guess I will just buy another charging device but this time, I will take a better quality one, even if it paying a bit more. (By the way, the manufacturers do not read your emails, so don't bother to write to them.)"
3,"I observed this with the help of usb ammeter. For instance it’s taking 500ma with all four cells charging, when one of them gets charged earlier, the current consumption is same, same when the second one is full.So technically now the charger is charging the rest of two with double current which is unsafe specially when only the last one remained in charging state and the current was still almost the same, all of it is going to one battery. I couldn’t observe an intelligent charge logic in it."
1,Envie - what a letdown! The batteries stopped holding charge very quickly... 2800MaH lol - nonsense. Completely dead batteries will show 3/4th charge on the speedster. You can keep the batteries charging for a day and then it might have enough power to run a remote control but little else. Save your money and buy a better product from Panasonic or Duracell. I don't know why I bought so many of their batteries and chargers based on some of the positive reviews here - should have taken my advice from the critical negative ones which share a similar viewpoint to this review. In a nutshell they are selling low performance products with no QA of any kind. You have been warned.
4,"Here is a tip, for those of you who are facing heating issues. Try charging two batteries at a time instead of 4.For AA 2800mah capacity, no need to charge more than 45mins. Battery will reach full charge. For AAA batteries you can charge an hour.Usage: i use these batteries for playing games with my xbox one controller. Even after extensive gaming sessions over the weekend the battery still has juice left for more.If you are using these for digi cam your mileage may vary. I am yet to test this on digi cam. Majority of people are using smartphones these days. So professionals would be the ones in need if these for photography.Conclusin: All in all its a good purchase if you follow the above mentioned instructions."
4,"Reviewing after a month of usage.The best thing that I liked about the charger is the charging speed. ECR 11 charges the same battery almost 3 times faster then ECR 20.Time taken to charge a AA 2800mAh battery from 0 to 100 is almost 1 & half hour.The charger can also be used to charge AAA batteriesAlso the Envie batteries have stood upto the expectations.The only issue with the product is heating issue. The product heats up slightly while using, so make sure to turnit off after fully charging the batteries"

1,The item is totally different from the descriptions of the seller. The size is only 9 inches (not 18). Only for phone. Stand is of a poor & cheap quality...etc.Don't waste your money
5,"I really like my light. The tripod is nice and has a lot of adjustable heights. The light itself is bright, but you can also change it's brightness and mode which is great for varing skin tones and environment. It also comes with a phone stand in the light itself and an attachable phone stand that can go on the tripod itself. Last pic is using the light and center phone stand. Works great!!!"
1,Third class product. This is the second time I have received a damaged product. I want a fresh and good product.
3,"I have received the ring light and camera holder.. ""but I did not receive any warranty or guarantee card neither did I receive the bill from the seller also the camera holder seems to have just sent it as it does not have any bolt or screw to be held or joined with the tripod stand.."" thanks for resolving the above issueIt still has a loose screw to hold the led.."
1,I received a damaged product and ring light is also 9 inch it's not 18 inchs. Seller has given wrong information in description. Do not buy and very cheap quality product. Stand is also very light nd very cheap in quality.

1,"This is the most terrible experience. So you order 18"" LED ring light. You're just exited to receive the product and when you receive it you get 10"" inches ring light which is no use and it's okay we all make mistake so you just replace the product and again wait for it and then again the same thing happens. Again you get 10"" third class product."
5,Very good quality product. It's simple assembly is easy to use and gives very bright light to make bright and good quality videos and selfies. Extremely satisfied.
5,"If you are looking for a better looking photos or videos, its worth having this light to put your phone and lighten up the recording.Super bright! It's perfect for me i generally have to work at night and the lighting in my house It's great. I love love the tripod height options and the movement of the light head. It was simple to assemble and so far easy to use."
1,"First time I received the stand was damaged asked for replacement and the replacement product was inferior than what I had received first time ,first time the mobile holder was flexible in the replacement it was not flexible the ring was smaller all in all a waste of time hope the seller does quality check of the product before dispatch"
1,I wish I had zero star for that rubbish waste cheap product  dont dont dont buy it please
5,"As a Counsellour and Trainer, I find this product extremely useful for making my videos and it has 3 light options and needs to be connected with the laptop for using the product. The brightness can be adjusted according to use. You can shoot your picture standing or sitting as the product is adjustable as well."

1,"Do not buy this product if u r looking for something which has the features mentioned in the description... The product doesn't worth giving 2.5k . It's 10 inch and not 18 inch and the tripod is different from the one shown in the picture and also it's not long enough it's a very small tripod and it's very weak also ,it can't even hold the ringlight and my phone properly ... I'm keeping it because I'm in urgent need"
1,I had high hopes for the product but let me warn you that one of the legs of the tripod broke upon assembly. but i still managed to work with it. tripod is made of cheap plastic as the next thing to break was the attachment holding the light to the tripod (it literally crumbled in my hands) on the third use. i have used tape to hold the whole thing together now. Also the tripod is so light the whole thing falls over as soon as you attach the phone to it.Only plus point was the ring light - good intensity - and the warm light is perfect to Indian skin tones
1,LED ring suppose to be of 18inches .But it is only 10inches .Pls do not disappoint customer with wrong descriptions .Unhappy with the product .Even after paying 2999 it's not worth .
5,"The quality of the ring light is too good,this light is very useful specially for tiktokers I suggest people to buy this productI am totally satisfied with the product, loved it"
3,Liked it but not a very strong material....the brightness modes are cool but not very bright on the cool modes....the adjustments after fixing the phone is a bit difficult but it’s a great buy if you only buy for lighting purpose...I felt the price too high as compared to the product delivered.
4,"The light works well, and is value for the money in the price category. The tripod came was surprisingly sturdier than I thought. Though, the plastic casing of ring is delicate. so one needs to he careful if it falls off or little hard blow and it can break and mounting is not possible. This is my second piece and first one broke like that.. Though it is still working and needs to be hanged using string."
4,"I’ll recommend this product only for a beginner!It’s easy to use and has 3 light options: white, yellow and neutral; and comes with a phone holder.But it’s not 18 inches it’s 10! This is the false information provided by the seller.Also, The quality is not that great but works!"
2,This product is tooooooo cheap for its price amazon should remove this product from their list its too tiny and very very poor quality if u look for this same product over the street may be u will find it for 500rs
1,"This product is not worth to buy bcoz ring light is 10"" wide not 18"" and tripod is also only 51"" highted nd a bad qulity ..seller please mantion right imformation in your product discription dont missguide ..."
1,"Deceiving Seller. Advertising 18"" but I received only 10"" ring light. And product is not the same like shown in pics. Shaky & poor quality. And there is no plug or adaptor with it. I have to use my mobile charger in order to plug it."
5,Good! Stand is week but can use in a different stand too.
3,The light won't recharge more does it have an adapter. It needs to be connected to a powerbank for it to work. The stand is flimsy and may break easily. The light is good but again..it's very poor quality material. Be very careful while handling it.
1,"It is extremely flimsy and doesn't even come with an instruction manual, it literally broke when I was trying to assemble it, like I didn't even apply too much force, don't go for it guys it's not value for money."
5,Loved the product and amazing brightness. It was worth the money I spent.
1,"So this is a buy for two months only. And its fused. Cant be repaired - obviously. If it can be replaced,.. probably will be worth the money,.. 2+grand for 2 months!!!!!Very disappointing."
5,Good product. Serves my purpose. Have been able to use it to full satisfaction.
4,Very happy it's perfect😍😍
1,The stand is too light and the moment you place a 6'' mobile.. it sways. Poor quality..breaks immediately with a small hit wd anything
3,Product is only 10inch. however advertise as 18inch. that is the only drawback. other features are good as description.
1,The light was good at beginning but aftee a month of use..the light starts to flicker and i couldnt able to use it and replace it either.
1,The thickness is written 18 inches....But I got 10 inches.... I was not at home..... Because of which today I saw my ring light....
5,"Good product, sturdy frame ... only wish the ring size and brightness would be a bit more... on the whole.. a good buy"
2,"Ring light is smaller than claimed , not 18 inches. Phone holder is flimsy and damaged.The lights have only three different brightness effects on each colour.Stand is actually of good quality !"
1,Don't buy this product the tripod doesn't have a stable stand it doesn't have the height it shown above.... product is bad and the delivery is too bad. I never don't buy anything from amazon
5,Good
2,"Poor quality. But can be used indoor with a light weight phone, while in sitting position."
1,Very bad it's not 18 inches I received only 10 inches it's a fraud
5,That’s really a nice product if you are a beginner.. it’s cosy freindly and easy to operate
5,The product is very good in quality as compared to others...all was gud as expected!!
1,this product come with a stand I didn’t get any stand just they make me fool.Very cheap quality product as per the price.
5,Nice
1,What you get is different from what is shown. Also I received a defect product.. Not working
2,1) very flimsy2) not 18 inch3)can easily break as it is so flimsy4)tripod not long enoughBut good brightness

4,Product is just amazing... 😊...I've recommend to my friends.  Happy with the products. 😊😊
5,It was Value for Money... GUYS CAN GO FOR IT..
5,It works really nice. Go ahead without a doubt.
1,They show wrong description and total waste of money 😡 and timeThe light size is 10and stand is 4feet
1,No product manual to install the light. Absolutely rubbish product.
5,Good for Money you paid
1,"Its 2019, and Sony has come out with a camera without IBIS.Pros:facial recognition and tracking have been improved.New Processor.The 6000 series overheating issue has been resolved.No 29-minute recording issues.Cons:1) Sony, we need a side flip articulated screen.2) The Flip which 6400 has is upward which is of no use if mike is attached at the top.3)No IBIS.4) Why the hell has it been priced so high? It's 899 USD, it is supposed to 400 USD cheaper than the 6500, why the insane pricing?5)Not worth buying at this price point.6) No useful for recording in those amazing sigma lenses, so basically buy the expensive Sony prime and zoom lenses and pay extra for the OSSA big thumbs down sony. First disappointment of 2019 from Sony."
4,Sample unedited images attached.Bought it after going through lot of reviews. Looking for a compact dslr quality camera with good features and mainly 4k video recording w/o any time limit.Was confuses b/w this and Fujifilm. Was really into the fuji retro look and there color effect but bought it due to offers in Amazon great India sale.Bought it just before our Diwali holiday and explored it throughout the trip and believe me no regrets. It has lot of customization related to the buttons and dials. Images come really good.If you can use the settings then many a times there is no need for editing as well.You can save them in raw as well with jpeg.On highest quality the size of on jpeg is around 14-15 mb.I bought it mainly to shoot my videos and the quality is just amazing.View finder is good and it has proximity sensor so screen turns of when you move near to view finder which is really good.There is a recording mode and a dedicated recording button which enables you to record any time. Sound is also clear and w/o any distortion or lag.Another plus is it's wireless connectivity. You can transfer the images and videos wirelessly over wifi through it's app that too in full quality and size. So if you want to share the images or videos instantly then it's a big plus. Then app can act as a remote also to click pics but you can't record videos with app.I hope they will bring that feature in future update.Build quality is superb it feels amazing in hand and is really compact(after using Nikon D5100).One major drawback is the screen tilt functionality. Not sure what sony was thinking while designing it. Even our Nikon D5100 which is like 9 years old as a side flip and rotatable screen which is way more convenient then this one.Second thing is I would really like if they have provided pause functionality while taking videos.Other thing is no seprate charger and small battery.Overall I am quite happy with the quality and performance.
5,"Directly going to pros and cons :Pros: 1. Light weight and easy to carry.2. Amazing atufocus and af points.3. Image quality is top notch.4. Video recording is a bliss with tilt up screen.5. Great burst mode.Cons: 1. Expensive, like really expensive.2. Sometimes it feels uncomfortable to hold.4. The settings menu is loooooong, u need to spend some time getting used to it. Overall verdict : great camera overall for vloggers and also for still images, with the amount of lenses available for sony e mount you can create amazing compositions."
5,"Must buy if this fits in your budget. Can talk a lot about the SW features which are way ahead of the dslr features, but I will leave that to many reviews on youtube or reddit.A special mention for eye tracking feature. For a perfect shot in dslr it needs atleast 10 takes in some cases, but this one needs one take due to the algorithms available.At a first glance, the pros don't weigh enough for the price tag, but if you can push up your budget, boy you will not regret the purchase. If you have used a dslr and planning for a switch, go for it blindly, you can notice the difference clearly the moment you hold it and start shooting.Also sony lens are costly compared to the other options available in the market, so you might have to be prepared for that. If you are convinced for a mirrorless camera and can spend more, checkout alpha a7 as well which has full frame sensor."
1,Horrible picture quality feels like an ordinary digital camera. I need a refund for the quality provided! Twice had to change it! The experience is a nightmare. In the name of autofocus these people are selling a camera that can not compete with a good phone leave aside coming close to dslr! It's not a beginner camera it is an overpriced digital camera
5,I brought this camara in sale.. the camara is best in class in this budget range.. but the lens are very costly if we compare with canon and Nicon..for Sony lens are very rare and fewer third party brands available.. but if we want good quality and performance then we have to go for best one.. that is Sony. If you are basic learner or new to photography don’t n buy with kit lens buy only body and buy separate lens as per your requirements.
5,"Tried astrophotography on the first day, pictures came out really good even at  F3.5. I bought it for learning filmmaking. This is the best option for a filmmaking camera. I'll recommend you to buy a tripod and flycam along with it. If you are a beginner or professional or whomever you may be, This camera is the best for all of you. For more a6400 pictures and videos, visit Instagram @travel_kaprad"
5,"Still using the camera. Takes a while to rate the quality of the output. But in a jist, the image quality has been good so far. It gets better with the correct settings which may not be the same in all cameras. The package came in well with extras that were not mentioned in the listing. So, thank you seller for keeping it a surprise and making it special for me."
5,"The product was superb, built quality is best and its so compact and still so powerful, the product had 64g Card which supports the  4k Recording speeds no need to buy another.I got a bag also with this product and the packaging was good from Amazon.Overall a best product and just unboxed it."
5,"I am not a professional in this field, so whatever I am writing is what I want in a camera and if it is really worth it.This is my first camera, and before it, I was using my one plus 3 to shoot videos for my channel. Definitely there is no comparison between both of them, but during the purchase, I was a bit confused between Canon eos 200 M2 and a6400. To save my money I wanted to go with 200 m2 but the focus tracking system of A6400 is absolutely amazing and being a maker I want my camera to track my hands not the objects lying around onto the workbench and in that case, A6400 never fails. Sometimes I am 3D printing some work and want my camera to follow the printer nozzle and it never disappoints. The slight downfall is that you cant use the touch screen to navigate into the menu page but my menu tab helps you to keep your most-used menus in first priority. So for me its never been a barrier. If you want a camera and object tracking focusing is not your priority then you can go with canon 200 M2, but if it's your first priority like me then sony A6400 never ever going to disappoint you. Overall for me A6400 definitely worth the money spend on it."
5,My brother use this camera for shoothing youtube video. U can check the quality (youtube channel: The indian budget gamer)
5,"You will never regret buying this camera.One of my favourite.There is a free 64gb memory card the supports 4k recording and compact bag for the cam however I would suggest buying a better one.The only disappointment was the packaging. No bubble wrap or any other safety measures.To mention, the shoulder strap is pathetic for a 80k investment."
4,"The camera is excellent as expected. But the package has missing contents. There's No body cap. They attach the lens on the body and then don't ship the lens rear cap and body cap.Secondly, the memory card mentioned on the box is 64gb but inside there was 16 GBBe careful guys ."
5,But the kit lens could have been better 16-50 mm is not a great lens even for a beginner. My suggestion is to go with the body + 35mm /50mm /any sigma lens . Trust me 16-50 mm lens is not doing justice for the camera sensor. After using that lens you feel that the camera is shit but in reality the camera is really good only thing is you have to buy a good lens . You can go for the camera it's really cool
5,"My First Experience is Really Amazing ! This My First' Camera & I really Like The Footage Quality Even With The Kit lense.If YOU'RE Trying To Buy This Camera Then I'll Assure You To Buy This Camera ! Ya There's Some Limitations Like Steady Shot !- Did You See This Video,This Video is Recorded With KITLENSE & Handheld Shots!Cheers !"
5,ProsHighly advanced autofocusDecent burst shooting speedBright viewfinderGood video featuresGood value for the specConsNo built-in image stabilizationNo headphone jack16:9 aspect ratio screenPriceyDoesn't offer anything special than a6300
4,Go for alpha 6600 if you don’t want to end up with battery drain so quickly and stablization problem. It is using Np fw 50 battery which half of the fv50 which is used in the a6600. It do not have inbuilt stablization so end with not properly configurable with high end sony lenses. And with out stablization lenses cause too much jitter in the video.
5,It’s such an amazing camera ! Even as a beginner it’s really easy to use ! I followed a YouTube tutorial on how to set it for the best pix and videos as per your preference. And it does wonders ! I have lovely images of my kids that I can print and frame :)
5,Best mirrorless camera. Gotta increase your budget a bit but worth it.
5,Previously I was using a6300 comparing nto that this auto focus wors awesome and the lcd telt type is best for utube vlog
5,"Amazing camera, I was waiting for so long and finally I got this beauty 😍.Amazing sharpness, clarity and features.4k video is amazing. Loving this camera"
4,I've just bought it before a month and I could say that the camera is best in the segment although I'm not a pro but I like it's everything autofocus is fast and accurate just waiting for it's next level performance after buying a prime lens.......
5,Awesome Camera. 100%.
5,"It's a great mirror less camera below 1 lakh price tag. Quality almost like full frame and weight less, easy to carry."
1,Not good products Rog products Nikon D5600

4,"Personal usage,Am using this one with a sigma 1.4 prime lens"
5,value of the money
5,Better than a6500 exept for the ibis(in body image stabilization)
3,Not meeting expectations
5,One of the best mirror less of sony
1,Beware of these sellers. They'll show you something different in title and product description and you'll get something different. The title of this product says that the size of the light is 18 inches but I got 10 inches delivered to me. I usually don't write bad reviews to the new sellers but this seller is betraying your trust. At lease you should be honest with your customers. I was amazed to see that someone is selling 18 inches ring light so cheap. I thought give it a try might be worth it. The product is worth the price but the only thing that I'm furious at is the incorrect details at every step.
2,"In title 18 inch ring light is mentioned but actully they are delivering 10 inches of ring light, even the quality of light is not so good, and material used to make this is also of cheap quality."
1,As shown  is not same product  i order 18 inch but i received 10 inch i not like this product n tripod also not proper
5,I ordered a 18inch light but received a 10 inch light. Product is best and works perfectly fine. But be sure to send someone the same product you mentioned.
5,"Its good and strudy, even the mobile holder. Will recommend to buy."
5,I m facing little problem to set my mobile in ring light.. but otherwise it’s awesome overall
5,Nice product and at this price I think it’s all that that you need ♥️
5,Very good product.. easy to use..
4,Very good product I am very much satisfied
4,Good product
5,Great tripod. Durable. Light weight. Strong. The light is good and works well. Can capture face beautifully in phone camera. Great price point also
2,"Ok the DSLR Giant Canon have launched 1 more entry level DSLR. Actually i bought this camera for my friend. Does this camera worth 31K. Lets seePROS1.  Its easy to use2. Decent battery backup3. Live mode operation is not lagging.CONS1. While focusing the DSLR is making too much noise and its the kind of annoying that u will lose interest in taking photos.2. No shortcut or assigned button to change F stop (aperture). A manufacturer who is keeping dedicated button for changing the ISO have to thing about the importance of aperture.3. You can't change the focusing point by pressing the round dial in the system, if u press it some other setup will open up.4. The output image quality is actually not mind blowing.5. White balance- Use it if u want to take risk6. Main issue. If u use camera flash to snap a pic during focusing it will flicker like anything and it will annoy and irritate the subject7. Noise Noise Noise. Whatever low ISO you use noise will b there and when i went to service center to ask about this they were saying use a prime lens to get good output.I am a Nikon user i have Nikon D3400. I compared both cameras by taking same images with same settings in manual mode. The output from Nikon is better than Canon 1500D.In one word if want to push photography to next level from using a Point and Shoot or mobile camera to DSLR Or to learn the whole DSLR setting go for it (only with a mindset to change the camera in 1 or 2 years). As canon accessories are comparatively less costly than Nikon it wont create hole in ur pocket.I am not biased towards Nikon, i wrote wat i felt.Its not worth for money"
5,Good camera for beginners.
5,"Great camera. Perfect product for young budding photographer..... Useful for in-house, nature, functions, and spare time photography. Take high quality pics, videos , portrait, landscape wildlife, nature pics etc"
5,"Really impressed with Amazon surprise for delivering within the 2 nd day from ordered Really packing was excellent and the quality of the material is awesome love to control the camera from mobile through Wi-Fi easy to connect, best one for taking self photos and group pics also the quality of canon speaks everything dont go for any oscillation beginners blindly got for it"
1,"You are on your own if you buy this product because canon local service center is of no help even in providing the product demo. We logged the complain on canon India site and not bothered to reply. Amazon call raised its hand saying ""proof of non service"" from local service center. So we have a DSLR that is producing blur images and canon is not providing any proper service. stay away"
1,Request for replacement of camera main body  There is lot of blackspot/blackness automatically appears in View finder mirror just after 15 days.It is requested to please replace the camera as soon as possible.Awaiting early reply.Regards.
2,I have received my product DSLR Cannon 1500D at 15 the October 2018 . But Adopter has not been given along with the DSLR which is a very common accessories.They must deliver that as soon as possible.Otheewise I gave to complain about it again & again.
3,"Auto focus is not at all perfect.Minimum aperture is 4.5, so dont expect much in portrait.While focusing manually there is a play for the lense(18-55 mm) so that there is a chance for getting missing ur focus even though if ur made it correctly.Easy to operate compared to Nikkon models.Fast moving subjects cannot be captured as expected due to its poor auto focus performance. It take about 3 to 6 seconds to focus in internal lighting conditions and it fail to focus several times in dim lights.Plastic quality is poor.I got it for Rs.18599. So that it is a value for money product. Don't go for this model if ur willing to pay about 23k. Better go with Nikkon 5300."
4,If you want to upgrade your camera from point and shoot to a dslr then it is a good camera for you but if you want to start videography then don't buy it auto focus of video is too much bad. If you want  a camera for videography then go foe canon 200D or Nikon D5600
5,"I am really fully content with the product. It reached me within two days with everything  content in it and no doubt in a very good condition. It may be somewhat difficult for the beginners but it will not take a long to learn. If you are choosing between canon and Nikon I will suggest you canon because of its real colour capturing and fine focus of its lenses. You can get more slightly more features in Nikon than canon at the same price but that doesn't mean that will surely better than canon. You can look for contrast between canon and Nikon in the internet. I think it will suggest you the same""canon""."
1,Canon Has Cheated The entire photography community. if you are a photographer and use flash or studio lights this camera is not for you. do not buy external flash and studio ligits like elinchrom and godox will not work.  .reason why i am saying this.the mount on with the flash is put has one point of contact missing. in 1500d they have removed the main point of contact . 1300d has it. go for 1300d .
2,"Dear friends i buy this camera for my YouTube career😞 and if you’re buying this camera for your YouTube career then its not for you. Bcz this camera doesn’t have mic input, and its also not takes a great videos, you’re not able to record great videos without mic input. No auto focus option in video recording, basic camera 📷!! This camera only good for pictures clicks!"
5,"This camera is a perfect choice if you are a beginner. The price range is decent, the camera is user friendly. I recommend everyone to buy this camera if you have a tight budget."
1,"I paid Rs 20240 for this product and have read some of the reviews, and  I can say I bought it expensive. Some people got it for Rs 18000 in the offer period. I tried some of its features and felt terribly disappointed. The autofocus is a joke here. It takes forever to click a photo in just slightest low light. I was very annoyed. I feel like I should have bought a cyber shot instead. Nikon D3500 is way better than it hands down in terms of clarity of photographs, quality, ISO, battery, grip and display. However, you'll have to pay Rs 3000-4000 more, but that's worth it. You don't buy DSLRs every day. Choose a better camera."
5,Good Product who are really have  passion for photography
4,Got dual lens with body in just 28K with SBI MASTERCARD. EXACTLY HALF OF SHOWROOM PRICE.Too early to comment.Excellent delivery within 2 days.I can say it is best for beginners with more natural photos than NIKONPros:HandyEasy to useBest blur with 55-250 lensVarious modesNatural ColourFast autofocusBest fit for beginnersCons:Lack of touchscreen (Look at the price)Bluetooth is not availableYou can't operate your Camera after connecting with smartphone.No WiFi connectivity is available with laptops.Suffer a bit at low light.Overall it is best for beginners and even upto semi pro level!!!!
4,"Thanks to amazon and the courier partner for the quick delivery. Well it was an awesome deal from amazon purchased it for around ₹21.5k with a free gift Motorola wired headphone worth ₹650.Coming to the camera it’s a great learning camera especially for the beginners who love photography and also want themselves to enhance here. My personal experience after using it for a week for now with the combination of shutter speed,aperture and ISO with a desired white balance you can be click practically any of the desired picture that you want to click.The camera comes with a 18-55 lens that is self acclaimed for beginners. Do master your parameters with this lens then you can obviously go for desired range of lens available in the market.The only shortcoming that I personally found was the focus which need to be adjusted manually/you need to have patience while clicking raw pictures. But this is again not a shortcoming for sure this is the area you need to improve yourself over the camera."
1,The camera is in good condition...I have received the charger and the battery but it doesn't charge the battery....charger received is faulty..don't know how to go about it....as really frustrated ..there is no return policy also....
5,"It's a best entry level DSLR camera if you have used only point and shoot or mobile. It has built in guide which makes it easier to use and learn. The auto focus and pictures quality is also very good but some time in low lit situations it generates noiy in pictures for that use extra flash other wise best. Videos are also very good for blogging video use manual focus which is very eyes to use with best results. It's better than Nikon d3500 as videos, auto focus and features are better in this camera. If your budget is limited and you are new in DSLR then it's a must buy."
1,"Amazon was dispatched this camera on 08.10.2019 at home and i went to some official trip on that time hence i was not able to check its operation. I came home on 23.10.2019 and opened this product, captured some images and it was good. Later i tried to transfer the images from Camera to mobile through Wifi and found the camera getting switched off. I tried several times and the problem remain same. Further i tried to return the camera and the seller is not accepting my request as the date of return is already crossed.I have contacted my friends who is working in photo studio regarding this and they have expressed that the Canon EOS 1500D is having such types of problem and we have seen many of the cameras having such problems.We request buyers who is willing to buy this product, pls avoid online purchases of this product. Verify before purchasing.Now i request Amazon to help us regarding this issue."
1,"This may be a good camera for the very experienced professional of photography. It is challenging for a newcomer in photography.1-Flash Makes too much noise2-You cannot record a  good quality of sound because it does not support any external mice.3-This camera does not support any audio jack for recording sound.4-Wifi does not control the video recording function5-No Bluetooth connection could be established with other devices.6-This camera is manufactured recently, but it does not have recent audio jack.7-They are using very old audio jack technology. If the external audio jack is compatible, then canon should give the one connectin cable and audio jack which complies with the camera, but unfortunately, the camera does not provide it.Thus it is concluded it is an outdated product is dumped in the Indian market through Amazon platform.if canon disprove me, I will remove this product review or update it"
5,"First of all thanks Amazon for giving such a wonderful offer , my dream comes true and finally I have dslr....Picture quite is awesome in both day light as well as low light. Still learning the different modes of camera for taking pictures. For beginners it's little difficult to handle but there is an auto mode  that can be used if you don't understand anything. But quality of pic comes better when you set the camera manually"
5,I have purchased this for my brother last year from Amazon.I got the single kit. slightly disappointed due to that. Otherwise....*Excellent DSLR for beginners.*Easy to use.*Good quality.*Decent battery backup.*Worth for moneyFact: If your expectations are high with the stabilization or photo output etc then please go for Canon 5D/7D. This is for beginners (21K) and so if you buy this then keep your expectations as much you pay. :p :)
5,"I had only 3 hours to make the decision. Next day I had my flight to Korea and we thought of buying a DSLR at night (didn't make a decision earlier, as we had One+ and iPhone which are kind of best in class for the camera). So, I quickly did research and found just 3-4 options. I watched 2-3 YouTube videos to make the final call and guess what I made the right choice. I took next day morning delivery paying 50 rs extra. The camera is superb (5 stars). Though I handled a Sony camera earlier, this is my first DSLR and believe me, it was quite easy to follow their instructions manual. I would highly recommend you to read the manual / try at home/rehearsal before you go out to capture actual pictures. I am attaching a few pics which I captured with just 2 hours of the experiment."
1,The battery is faulty .... It drains even when not in use
5,"WARRANTY CAN BE REGISTERED!! IT HAS 2 YRS WARRANTY!!!Just finished registering the camera and lens.Great camera. You will love it. Very steady. Great buy to start your hobby/profession. Don't compare to other cameras. At 26k good its a great dslr with 2yrs warranty. Should take care of parties, weddings and video shoots. Excellent battery life. The camera case is good.It has no external mic in."
1,I wanted to return this order on the same day and purchase Canon 200D as I did not like it.. but never had an option to do that. Tried contacting CX care a number times and nobody were of any help to me. Atlease got a chance to ask for assistance regarding the return. I still have it packed as it is.. I am not at all happy with the product and have not even charged the battery even once.
4,Picture quality fantastic and camera handling and features are very good which will attract a beginner.
5,"Let me explain.Yes, with 9 point AF with the OVF, you'll feel the AF a bit dated but does the job rather well. Live view has face detect but has a jerky continuous AF and is slow.But those are most of its negatives.The camera takes wonderful pictures and with digic 4+ image processor, the jpegs are perfectly usable. If you want perfection, shooting in RAW will give you what you need.The colors captured on this camera are perfect and natural, with settings to tweak them to your taste (see picture settings in menu).The build quality is solid and ergonomics of the camera, especially through its grip is wonderful. It feels perfect in my hands. The menu system is uncluttered and quite intuitive. It is very easy to customize the camera to your specific needs.You can shoot videos with this camera but without continuous AF, you'll get better results if you switch to manual focus during video.Why is it the best DSLR?Because of it's limitations in AF and simple straightforward usability it lets you take control over your photographs and videos unlike other advanced models which take control away from you and makes the choices for you. The result is you can get the exact photograph you intended to take. Combined with the 24 megapixel sensor, which is the same sensor found in almost all other canon APSC DSLRs, all the way upto 80D, the image quality is at par with much more expensive cameras.The digic 4+ processor is good for image processing, frankly the more advanced processors bring features such as 4K and such, which if you're not into video, you'll not miss it. The digic 4+ processor is more than adequate for your photography needs.With all the above considerations, it's the best DSLR you could get, in my opinion."
5,"Excellent camera for both beginners and advance users, 24.1 Mp gets your pictures crystal clear. I suggest to get this deal before it ends"
1,This amazon playing very cheap games to the customers. I have ordered this product on 29th for almost 29k and now the sale daybits cost around 23k. How fooling the customers for this kind of false pricings and every product has 10days return policy but now its not acceptable reurns it accepts only replacement. What a cheap gameplay amazon. If you really think about the customer do some promising thing not such kind of fraud things. Never ever i buyer in amazon again. Good bye. You lost a loyal customer. I may not do anything for you except stop ordering from you. That enough to added advantage to your competitors.
1,Delivery boy not calling for pick up the product as I returned the item

No extra battery with package you have buy extra one for backup3. Don't come with screen protector, you have to buy it for LCD  display protection from scratches."
5,"# DSLR at feasible price# Excellent picture quality#Sturdy body with ergonomic design which is easy to grasp# Compatible with accessory lens like tele zoom lens and macro lens (which are not a part of standard lens kit)#Easy to operate#Fairly good battery life#Easy connectivity with multiple options- wireless, USB,HDMI etc"
1,"First of all. I ordered this product in Amazon great sale at 34000, but next day the price was 30000. I am very disappointed with it. Camera is for beginners, who wants to learn about basic photography. It's for casual use. If you want a proper professional camera for photography, then I would suggest go for 70d or further."
3,"I bought this camera, its was working well with 18-55 lens, but when i move to 55-255 the performance was low.battery backup also very less.But overall good camera. At night 55-255 lens take hell alot time to focus.So my suggestion is go for 200D. Amazon wont refund for it, so i sell the camera on OLX"
2,Camera is gud one..... But i brought it on 'no cost emi (970.86)' of 6months @25376.14 after the deduction of 970.86. Now my EMI is 4391.16 for 6months...that comes 26346.96...So my question is how will i get the no cost benefit of 970.86?
1,This camera is only for photography ...u can't record a good video... because it doesn't have continuous autofocus while video recording....even mobile phones have that function.... the auto focus is fixed while video recording...like if u move in your video..then u get out of focus...which is disgusting.. because video means a movie a moving object...
3,"The product is absolutely perfect but Amazon service is not professional. Don't buy this if you are going to shoot videos bcoz it doesn't support mic, Amazon will not tell you this in their description of product. I lost my 10k because of Amazon they mention ""10 days returnable"" but it is actually ""10 day exchangeable"". They totally denied to take it back. Be careful when you are buying it."
1,I have purchased this Canon DSLR after a small research. It's results were fantastic as a digital camera. But just after few months of purchase I found that sometimes it's shutter starts operating automatically without clicking any picture. Sometimes it worked ok but sometimes automatically opening and closing of shutter with annoying noice started. Then I contacted Canon serice centre. They gave me address of local service centre at Jabalpur MP. I gave them my camera for repairing. They sent it to Indore city workshop and it took nearly one and half month to return me. It was working ok at that time but after few days that shutter problem started again.Now I can not give this camera to workshop again and again so I am using this faulty camera as sometimes it works ok but sometimes it doesn't work due to shutter problem.I thought earlier that Canon was excellent brand but now my thinking is totally changed about it.

Bcz this camera doesn’t have mic input, and its also not takes a great videos, you’re not able to record great videos without mic input. No auto focus option in video recording, basic camera 📷!! This camera only good for pictures clicks!"
5,"This camera is a perfect choice if you are a beginner. The price range is decent, the camera is user friendly. I recommend everyone to buy this camera if you have a tight budget."
1,"I paid Rs 20240 for this product and have read some of the reviews, and  I can say I bought it expensive. Some people got it for Rs 18000 in the offer period. I tried some of its features and felt terribly disappointed. The autofocus is a joke here. It takes forever to click a photo in just slightest low light. I was very annoyed. I feel like I should have bought a cyber shot instead. Nikon D3500 is way better than it hands down in terms of clarity of photographs, quality, ISO, battery, grip and display. However, you'll have to pay Rs 3000-4000 more, but that's worth it. You don't buy DSLRs every day. Choose a better camera."
5,Good Product who are really have  passion for photography
4,Got dual lens with body in just 28K with SBI MASTERCARD. EXACTLY HALF OF SHOWROOM PRICE.Too early to comment.Excellent delivery within 2 days.I can say it is best for beginners with more natural photos than NIKONPros:HandyEasy to useBest blur with 55-250 lensVarious modesNatural ColourFast autofocusBest fit for beginnersCons:Lack of touchscreen (Look at the price)Bluetooth is not availableYou can't operate your Camera after connecting with smartphone.No WiFi connectivity is available with laptops.Suffer a bit at low light.Overall it is best for beginners and even upto semi pro level!!!!
4,"Thanks to amazon and the courier partner for the quick delivery. Well it was an awesome deal from amazon purchased it for around ₹21.5k with a free gift Motorola wired headphone worth ₹650.Coming to the camera it’s a great learning camera especially for the beginners who love photography and also want themselves to enhance here. My personal experience after using it for a week for now with the combination of shutter speed,aperture and ISO with a desired white balance you can be click practically any of the desired picture that you want to click.The camera comes with a 18-55 lens that is self acclaimed for beginners. Do master your parameters with this lens then you can obviously go for desired range of lens available in the market.The only shortcoming that I personally found was the focus which need to be adjusted manually/you need to have patience while clicking raw pictures. But this is again not a shortcoming for sure this is the area you need to improve yourself over the camera."
1,The camera is in good condition...I have received the charger and the battery but it doesn't charge the battery....charger received is faulty..don't know how to go about it....as really frustrated ..there is no return policy also....
5,"It's a best entry level DSLR camera if you have used only point and shoot or mobile. It has built in guide which makes it easier to use and learn. The auto focus and pictures quality is also very good but some time in low lit situations it generates noiy in pictures for that use extra flash other wise best. Videos are also very good for blogging video use manual focus which is very eyes to use with best results. It's better than Nikon d3500 as videos, auto focus and features are better in this camera. If your budget is limited and you are new in DSLR then it's a must buy."
1,"Amazon was dispatched this camera on 08.10.2019 at home and i went to some official trip on that time hence i was not able to check its operation. I came home on 23.10.2019 and opened this product, captured some images and it was good. Later i tried to transfer the images from Camera to mobile through Wifi and found the camera getting switched off. I tried several times and the problem remain same. Further i tried to return the camera and the seller is not accepting my request as the date of return is already crossed.I have contacted my friends who is working in photo studio regarding this and they have expressed that the Canon EOS 1500D is having such types of problem and we have seen many of the cameras having such problems.We request buyers who is willing to buy this product, pls avoid online purchases of this product. Verify before purchasing.Now i request Amazon to help us regarding this issue."
1,"This may be a good camera for the very experienced professional of photography. It is challenging for a newcomer in photography.1-Flash Makes too much noise2-You cannot record a  good quality of sound because it does not support any external mice.3-This camera does not support any audio jack for recording sound.4-Wifi does not control the video recording function5-No Bluetooth connection could be established with other devices.6-This camera is manufactured recently, but it does not have recent audio jack.7-They are using very old audio jack technology. If the external audio jack is compatible, then canon should give the one connectin cable and audio jack which complies with the camera, but unfortunately, the camera does not provide it.Thus it is concluded it is an outdated product is dumped in the Indian market through Amazon platform.if canon disprove me, I will remove this product review or update it"
5,"First of all thanks Amazon for giving such a wonderful offer , my dream comes true and finally I have dslr....Picture quite is awesome in both day light as well as low light. Still learning the different modes of camera for taking pictures. For beginners it's little difficult to handle but there is an auto mode  that can be used if you don't understand anything. But quality of pic comes better when you set the camera manually"
5,I have purchased this for my brother last year from Amazon.I got the single kit. slightly disappointed due to that. Otherwise....*Excellent DSLR for beginners.*Easy to use.*Good quality.*Decent battery backup.*Worth for moneyFact: If your expectations are high with the stabilization or photo output etc then please go for Canon 5D/7D. This is for beginners (21K) and so if you buy this then keep your expectations as much you pay. :p :)
5,"I had only 3 hours to make the decision. Next day I had my flight to Korea and we thought of buying a DSLR at night (didn't make a decision earlier, as we had One+ and iPhone which are kind of best in class for the camera). So, I quickly did research and found just 3-4 options. I watched 2-3 YouTube videos to make the final call and guess what I made the right choice. I took next day morning delivery paying 50 rs extra. The camera is superb (5 stars). Though I handled a Sony camera earlier, this is my first DSLR and believe me, it was quite easy to follow their instructions manual. I would highly recommend you to read the manual / try at home/rehearsal before you go out to capture actual pictures. I am attaching a few pics which I captured with just 2 hours of the experiment."
1,The battery is faulty .... It drains even when not in use
5,"WARRANTY CAN BE REGISTERED!! IT HAS 2 YRS WARRANTY!!!Just finished registering the camera and lens.Great camera. You will love it. Very steady. Great buy to start your hobby/profession. Don't compare to other cameras. At 26k good its a great dslr with 2yrs warranty. Should take care of parties, weddings and video shoots. Excellent battery life. The camera case is good.It has no external mic in."
1,I wanted to return this order on the same day and purchase Canon 200D as I did not like it.. but never had an option to do that. Tried contacting CX care a number times and nobody were of any help to me. Atlease got a chance to ask for assistance regarding the return. I still have it packed as it is.. I am not at all happy with the product and have not even charged the battery even once.
4,Picture quality fantastic and camera handling and features are very good which will attract a beginner.
5,"Let me explain.Yes, with 9 point AF with the OVF, you'll feel the AF a bit dated but does the job rather well. Live view has face detect but has a jerky continuous AF and is slow.But those are most of its negatives.The camera takes wonderful pictures and with digic 4+ image processor, the jpegs are perfectly usable. If you want perfection, shooting in RAW will give you what you need.The colors captured on this camera are perfect and natural, with settings to tweak them to your taste (see picture settings in menu).The build quality is solid and ergonomics of the camera, especially through its grip is wonderful. It feels perfect in my hands. The menu system is uncluttered and quite intuitive. It is very easy to customize the camera to your specific needs.You can shoot videos with this camera but without continuous AF, you'll get better results if you switch to manual focus during video.Why is it the best DSLR?Because of it's limitations in AF and simple straightforward usability it lets you take control over your photographs and videos unlike other advanced models which take control away from you and makes the choices for you. The result is you can get the exact photograph you intended to take. Combined with the 24 megapixel sensor, which is the same sensor found in almost all other canon APSC DSLRs, all the way upto 80D, the image quality is at par with much more expensive cameras.The digic 4+ processor is good for image processing, frankly the more advanced processors bring features such as 4K and such, which if you're not into video, you'll not miss it. The digic 4+ processor is more than adequate for your photography needs.With all the above considerations, it's the best DSLR you could get, in my opinion."
5,"Excellent camera for both beginners and advance users, 24.1 Mp gets your pictures crystal clear. I suggest to get this deal before it ends"
1,This amazon playing very cheap games to the customers. I have ordered this product on 29th for almost 29k and now the sale daybits cost around 23k. How fooling the customers for this kind of false pricings and every product has 10days return policy but now its not acceptable reurns it accepts only replacement. What a cheap gameplay amazon. If you really think about the customer do some promising thing not such kind of fraud things. Never ever i buyer in amazon again. Good bye. You lost a loyal customer. I may not do anything for you except stop ordering from you. That enough to added advantage to your competitors.
1,Delivery boy not calling for pick up the product as I returned the item
5,"Amazing product, got 1+1 extended warranty. Using it for a while- working good and got the product in clean and sealed condition.Pros:1.amazing picture quality2. Handy3.light weight4.gripping is good5. Best features with WiFi and nfc,can transfer images directly to phone or pc. 6. Memory card and one battery is includedCons:1. Camera carrying bag is small2. No extra battery with package you have buy extra one for backup3. Don't come with screen protector, you have to buy it for LCD  display protection from scratches."
5,"# DSLR at feasible price# Excellent picture quality#Sturdy body with ergonomic design which is easy to grasp# Compatible with accessory lens like tele zoom lens and macro lens (which are not a part of standard lens kit)#Easy to operate#Fairly good battery life#Easy connectivity with multiple options- wireless, USB,HDMI etc"
1,"First of all. I ordered this product in Amazon great sale at 34000, but next day the price was 30000. I am very disappointed with it. Camera is for beginners, who wants to learn about basic photography. It's for casual use. If you want a proper professional camera for photography, then I would suggest go for 70d or further."
3,"I bought this camera, its was working well with 18-55 lens, but when i move to 55-255 the performance was low.battery backup also very less.But overall good camera. At night 55-255 lens take hell alot time to focus.So my suggestion is go for 200D. Amazon wont refund for it, so i sell the camera on OLX"
2,Camera is gud one..... But i brought it on 'no cost emi (970.86)' of 6months @25376.14 after the deduction of 970.86. Now my EMI is 4391.16 for 6months...that comes 26346.96...So my question is how will i get the no cost benefit of 970.86?
1,This camera is only for photography ...u can't record a good video... because it doesn't have continuous autofocus while video recording....even mobile phones have that function.... the auto focus is fixed while video recording...like if u move in your video..then u get out of focus...which is disgusting.. because video means a movie a moving object...
3,"The product is absolutely perfect but Amazon service is not professional. Don't buy this if you are going to shoot videos bcoz it doesn't support mic, Amazon will not tell you this in their description of product. I lost my 10k because of Amazon they mention ""10 days returnable"" but it is actually ""10 day exchangeable"". They totally denied to take it back. Be careful when you are buying it."
1,I have purchased this Canon DSLR after a small research. It's results were fantastic as a digital camera. But just after few months of purchase I found that sometimes it's shutter starts operating automatically without clicking any picture. Sometimes it worked ok but sometimes automatically opening and closing of shutter with annoying noice started. Then I contacted Canon serice centre. They gave me address of local service centre at Jabalpur MP. I gave them my camera for repairing. They sent it to Indore city workshop and it took nearly one and half month to return me. It was working ok at that time but after few days that shutter problem started again.Now I can not give this camera to workshop again and again so I am using this faulty camera as sometimes it works ok but sometimes it doesn't work due to shutter problem.I thought earlier that Canon was excellent brand but now my thinking is totally changed about it.
4,"Over all does what it is suppose to be doing , built quality could have been better, as the magnets are just kept in places using basic stickers which loose it's place, the lights are prefect with the control option to dim and brighten the light as per requirement , foldio 360 is also good, but frankly I haven't yet tried it to the fullest , it's a great product photography studio , as Jewellery has the highest reflection and is difficult to shoot without a proper setup ,foldio does workUpdate: used foldio 360 it's a very simple app to connect and very easy to control the rotations , the entire setup is worth every penny spent"
1,"Product quality is ok... But I recived defective one, one of the leg is not foldable its stuck, and those 3 legs are usefull but its not friendly to use there are small button on each leg to fold and unfold... But its very hard to push... It cannon be done while holding camera on it.... To fold the legs we have to remove cam and fod the monopod to small size and go give maximum power to fold its..."
5,Bit heavy... But overall does what it is meant to do. .  don't leave it while using heavy lenses or camera bodies .
4,Too weighty to carry everywhere
3,Medium quality
5,Super
4,Good ones
5,Very very very good product
5,Excellent quality n product
1,"Ring light is not 18inches.Stand is not as strong as shown in the image, the phone holder is lose and does not hold the phone for long...I have oneplus 6 and it is umable to hold the weight of it. Brightness of the light is not good enough. Overall not satisfied with the product."
1,"First of all, the name of the light is misleading. It is not 18 inches but 10 inches only. amazon shound amend its name immediately. Secondly, it is not as bright as it claims. It does have several colour lights but no use if is not bright enough. They didn't provide vertical mobile .Tripod is flimsy and I could not took a chance to install my expensive camera on it. Plse read careful before you buy this flimsy and misleading Cowboy product. I was so disappointed that I gifted it to a young led living closeby."
5,Amazing product. The best about the product is that it is lighy weight with good metallic body.The light have 3 mode. Also you can suggest it's sharpness.Phone holder is also available inside. So it's good to go product.
2,I am highly disappointed. The reason is ring light. Amazon has not delivered ring light as per discription. 18 incg light is mentioned in description and only 10 inches was received by me. Tripod stand had dent already on its arm..
1,It's only 10inch with very less bright to click any pic ..But very well marketed here so that customers can buy this product**Don't know why Amazon is not taking any action as the seller is fooling the customers**
5,Mobile holder  & stand  is very goodBrightness  may be up to 10 wattsWith this price it is best
1,This is 9 inches ring not 18 inches wrong commitment very bad quality even the light dosen't take the weight of phoneChor ....
5,Nice product good reflection of light
1,"स्टैंड के पैर और इसका मेटेरियल बहुत ही नाजुक है,इसे खड़ा करने के लिये प्लास्टिक का क्लिप प्रयोग हुआ है जो जल्द ही टूट जाता है। The structure of the stand is so delicate that it is unable to hold the weight of a mobile and light.Its hinges and clips are also very delicate due to which it never lasts for more than 3 months.My Stan's leg broke twice .It is worthless purchasing this item."
3,Tripod is okish feels like it can break easily ring light is 10 inches not 18 inches brightness is fine but could be better.Good for beginners and those who have tight budget RGB lights are good.
5,"As a beginner, I found it really simple to use. The light source is incredibly bright and comes with an adjustable switch to increase or reduce brightness. If you are not sure what to buy, and with a limited budget, then this one is worth trying and gaining more experience with recording your videos or self-portraits."
1,Usually the seller say's that the Ringlight is 18 inch but i have got 10 inch i replaced it for 2 times then also they are giving 10inch only very disappointed with this Ringlight! Don't take you'll get 10 inch Ringlight waste of money
4,Everything is perfect.. lights are bright too.. however.. there is no stand in the middle of the ring light
4,I bought this product about a month back for recording videos. Its a good product however being light weight even a slight movement can cause it to fall. You may need to add some weights on the base to ensure its stability during use.
3,It is very good product i m satisfied this product quality and its features ...it is very simple to use ...and it is very useful for making makeup videos....and click perfect pictures...
5,"Best Product for Beginners of Tiktok,reels Vloggers and youtubers. Tripod is very light Weight and brightness of ring light is more than I expected. Good job COWBOY.If you're a beginner as I mentioned above then it's a must buy product."
5,Very helpful for online sellers..
2,Product had a number of nuts missing. There is no manual for guidance on how to use the same.
1,"Be Aware: this is not 18 inches light as mentioned but its 10 inches. Despite getting it exchanged under the category ""wrong product delivered"" I got 10 inches light again Thanks to professional approach of team Amazon that finally I am getting my money back."
5,"I was very reluctant about buying ring light online but this made it perfect....this is the best ring light you could ask for so my advice is go for it, the packaging is good the quality is good. Its a steal at this price👍❤️"
5,"The product is good for making short videos, it's easy to install and use, brightness is also very good with cool & warm options with brightness controller. it's very light to carry and install anywhere."
1,The light was nice for video call etc. But the quality wasnt up to mark. Stopped working within 1 month of me receiving the item (delayed due to covid). Disappointed.
4,It's good. Sturdy enough at this price. Can't expect anything more. Lighting is bright and adequate. Really good product tp save money.
3,The light is good but whereas the stand you get is not so sturdy and there are high chances of light falling because of this.
5,Very nice product ☺️ for me I start my you tube channel jyoti mangla for the help of ring light thanku so much this product is awesome and prize best 👍
5,Really liked the product Its perfect for those who are searching for something like this ......
5,The product doesn’t feel cheap at all. It’s handy and easy to carry aroundHas brightness levels with 2 shades
4,A lot shakey after fixing the light for 360° degree use as the key dosen't fix properly in stand overall product is good.
5,"Over all it’s a good product, would have preferred a longer cable though. Brightness could have been more but still it nails the output for both pictures and videos.Worth buy."
5,Product quality is really good then any branded one.
5,"Awesome packaging, my daughter fixed it very well shez just 7. It’s very easy to use easy to carry as well.Go for it and njoyyy"
2,I got this product a week back and it was working perfectly until I plugged it on a power bank it was not working the light on the remote was on but the main light wasn't working
5,"Convenient, easy to use , lightweight and has  3 different colour modes and levels of brightness. Perfect Product"
1,"It is a 10 inch Chinese ring light, don't order if you want a 18 inch ring light."
1,Not a reliable product
5,It's for starters who wants to kick in video or beauty business.
1,"Broken ring light, very cheap quality product, not satisfied only the brightness is little bit better, but didnt expected this type of low quality and packaging was also improper."
1,"Cheap quality and fragile light. It should not be labelled 18"" as it is definitely not.Returned it once and received a similar bad quality product again."
4,"Nice product. The brightness is ok, set up is ready. Easy to fold and carry. Serves my purpose well."
1,Effect is good but stand is not working properly its not user friendly..
1,"Its dangerous...see the pics, after 2 minutes use it burns like fire, spiled my 50000₹ sofa, my plastic chair... no protection from 1000w burning tube, 🔥🔥surely you will or your children will get hurt.☠️ Beware. Amazon, please note that this is a hazardous product. You cannot return, the seller only replace.☠️☠️☠️"
5,Loved it .  Nice stand and amazing quality
5,"This hiffin light stand is Very sturdy and it's very heavy almost 3 .5 kilo it's length is approximately 8 to 9 feet from the ground. that it's a great product cause i don't see any bad thing or point in it.Heavy duty product.This is the best stand you could get at this price point, period! It’s sturdy, not too heavy, goes up to a height of ~8 ft. and just a perfect stand to mount your fill or back lights.. Don’t spend your precious time comparing with other stands in this range, just go for it. You won’t be disappointed."
5,"Each individual product is good . No dispute from the seller . As professional photographer you need extra light along with porta . Stand , white umbrella are very good .You can avail a pair set within this price .As I said, being as professional you need more bright Modeling Lamp - for that you need to pay more . But you can do creative photography with this bulb . For Phone video recording, light is enough.Over all stand + umbrella are really awesome.. within this price .. need one more pair ."
4,"I wanted to buy a studio light for indoor photography and YT videos.However when I set up this it is observed thatthe lamp is overheating. However this may work well in air conditioned room.I have contacted customer care and detailed about this issue. Customer care service was pretty good and they credited back my refund with in 2 days.The packing , delivery and service was good and I furnish 4 star for appreciation."
5,The product is Amazing . The manufacturer will whatsapp you in advance about the purchase. Trust me they want the product to be good and useful more than you do.  I would highly recommend this for the new creators.
4,Great light for the price. I'm really happy only thing that they can include an extra bulb in the kit so that in case it need to be replaced we can replace it.
1,The light is too hot. Strange smell and smoke started coming... immediately switched off and placed request for return. Light looks cheap quality. Also it is warm light..not white light
1,It was working on the day I received but not working today. It has been only 10-15 days. Disappointed
5,Perfect set up. Value for money. Just the bulb you make hav to upgrade
5,Excellent product - value for money in this price. Stands are very sturdy. Everything including the bulb holder and carrybag looks premium. The seller is very supportive for any after sales service. I would for sure recommend it.

5,Product is good. Quality is good. Light and stand is good easy to use.
4,"This product is quite well built. No doubt and does what it is intended to. Took this with me to Thailand on a 14 day trip and it held up very well. Was riding a rental scooter all the time with the Camera dangling from my side. No issues.However, the design seems to be lacking somewhere, especially the 1/4"" bracket at the bottom is not ergonomic and you lose functionality of accessing the battery/card socket on a Canon M50. And is quite a pain while trying to mount the camera on a tripod.I will post and update if I decide to start liking it more.Edit: I have decided that I don't like it and will not be using it anymore. But still, it's a very well made product with some flaws."
5,It’s a steal for the price. Very well built and looks good. Worth every penny. Might not be a black rapid but for 10% of the price it’s way more bang for the buck.
5,Don't worry about the cheap priceIt is completely secureI trust this 💯 %Even use it with a 300 mm lensNo ProblemsMuch better than neck strap
5,Can walk around with my camera & telephoto lens strapped on to my shoulder for 4-5 hours comfortably.
3,"For my Canon 200D, it’s handy, amazing and dapper as well"
5,Amazon basics know how to stick to the basics and give us the best solutions. Loved the product. You can buy it
4,A good and sturdy one to protect my cam.
3,Think twice before getting this. It’s not comfortable. Pouch makes life easy though. Quality is mediocre!
5,Excellent product

3,"I had asked the seller if the light can be attached along with camera before ordering the item, and the seller replied it can be attached, but upon receiving the item I found out only mobile can be attached along with the light, and no provision for attaching camera is provided, u will have to buy another stand if you want to shoot on a camera. For people willing to shoot with mobile, no doubt this is the best overall item you will get with tripod, light, remote for clicking pictures and a phone holder in this price range. Less stars for seller giving wrong information, else its all good. The light has 3 shades."
1,"I got this item three weeks ago, i purchased it based on the reviews. It was a bit expensive at 2,199 but I got it anyway hoping it would last. To my surprise using it this morning the USB cable got melted and without that the lights can be turned on. Now I can't return or replace this, what a waste. I would not lie that quality of the tripod light was good, if not for this USB cable problem it would have really been a good choice. I don't know why it's difficult to get a good tripod light stand in Amazon.inI will try to get one for us or uk"
3,"I received the ring light and tripod in a bad condition. I mean the wires are not connected hence I couldn’t comment about brightness. Though the tripod stand is good, I can’t use the ring light as the wires are out. I don’t think it happened in transport as the wires seem straight and unused. I wish I received a good one."
5,"While ordering i was thinking like it will be a kind of cheap Chinese product. But yes, after getting it delivered, i must say it's quite good, impressed with the quality, the LED ring light is superb, you can switch the colours to White, warm white and blue and adjust the brightness as well. The stand is firm and made up of decent metal pipes and can adjust the height as per your need. You can click nice, bright selfies and can make videos. I just loved it."
4,For the price offered this ring light is a good buy ..Perfect for selfies and videos . it comes with the stand a Bluetooth remote for selfies only problem I have is you can’t use your camera on it ..if you are using your phone for pictures and videos then I say go for it ..
4,Selfie Ring Light is Great!! with 3 color setting..  Light control is also good one to fix the desired amount of light.Must buy for youtubers and online presenters.  One negative point is about tripod. It is flimsy and fasteners are not holding the light firm.
5,"Loved this led selfie ring light, good product value of money no damage nice packing 👍🏻👍🏻you can adjust the light dark to light and light to dark"
5,First received broken product then it was replaced as per request and in return got an excellent product 👍👍
3,There is no manual of how to set up the selfie ring and the stand. That is why it broke when we try to set up.The product was not upto my expectations.The quality was not that good comparing with the money.But i fixed it and still using till now.
1,"Very bad product don't buy it ring light only 10"" instead of 18""Not recommend to anyone for purches"
3,An average product. Not very durable.
3,Not great qualiy. But does the work. You may have to put tape / gum to fix the cover as by design the white cover does not have enough clip to hold on its own.
1,"Buy this product and return this product. Very bad and cheap quality product. It is not too strong and it can't even hold the mobile. And one more thing, the ring is only 10 inches."
4,"This is a good product in a budget,ring light,stand and cables were all good and very easy to use,however i am dissapointed that i did not recieve the bluetooth remote."
3,"Material quality is good, need to redesign in ball and socket construction. Grip is very less soo lead to slippage when placed with mobile."
5,Most useful product for me...I use this for my youtube videos...The best part is its height is adjusted to 7'. Very happy with the light👍
4,Price wise its good enough
4,Product is worth for money but it can be improve in terms of brightness and stability with stand. But although its overall good product.
3,"Ring light is not 18 inches, its 10 inchs... otherwise the quality is ok..."
4,Its pretty good item.Quality is good.Like it.

5,Awesome Product at best price
5,Quality is good nd worthy...now it's very easy to capture photos nd videos
4,It is an good quality productVery happy that I bought this product
3,"I had asked the seller if the light can be attached along with camera before ordering the item, and the seller replied it can be attached, but upon receiving the item I found out only mobile can be attached along with the light, and no provision for attaching camera is provided, u will have to buy another stand if you want to shoot on a camera. For people willing to shoot with mobile, no doubt this is the best overall item you will get with tripod, light, remote for clicking pictures and a phone holder in this price range. Less stars for seller giving wrong information, else its all good. The light has 3 shades."
1,"I got this item three weeks ago, i purchased it based on the reviews. It was a bit expensive at 2,199 but I got it anyway hoping it would last. To my surprise using it this morning the USB cable got melted and without that the lights can be turned on. Now I can't return or replace this, what a waste. I would not lie that quality of the tripod light was good, if not for this USB cable problem it would have really been a good choice. I don't know why it's difficult to get a good tripod light stand in Amazon.inI will try to get one for us or uk"
3,"I received the ring light and tripod in a bad condition. I mean the wires are not connected hence I couldn’t comment about brightness. Though the tripod stand is good, I can’t use the ring light as the wires are out. I don’t think it happened in transport as the wires seem straight and unused. I wish I received a good one."

5,Works well with my existing DVR . Good picture quality and night vision. Value for money with great build quality!
5,"Don't know how flycam managed to sell this $200 Redking for just 3050rs. If you're looking for the Redking, you already know how good of a stabilizer it is, so I won't get into that."
5,Cheap steadicam with a ton of features
5,"Buy it • Sweet.. Buy it, if you love to challenge yourself. It will help you become better for sure. It is heavy & handling it us a tough task for starters. Once you start using it, your body will adapt to that.Don’t Buy It • If you use light point & shoot camera or light weight DSLR. Buy Flycam Nano."
5,Bhai bohot Hard ❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥Is price me ye product milna Bohot Mushkil hai bhai ❤️❤️It is Good ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I loved it 🔥🔥
5,"Got it for ₹3050, I don't know how😂Worth the money of course but very heavy which is also a pro heavier setups are stable but you need good strong hands to use this.Thanks and regards"
5,Good for beginners but bit heavy to handle i think with flycam suit it could be easily accessible if you guys planning to buy for smaller cameras then its not convenient go for smaller flycam stabilizers
4,"It is for Heavier camera,s.  MINIMUM WEIGHT SHOULD BE 800 GRAMS.  IF UR CAMERA + LENS WEIGHT IS BELOW 800 GRAMS THEN DONT BUY IT BECAUSE IT IS LESS TO BALANCE"
4,"Its really a good product and yeah!  I got this exactly same like as shown.. But its  bit heavy in weight. Otherwise, it could be an excellent product. But i am happy with this."
3,very heavy
5,Value for money
5,It's Working well..
5,Value for money
5,Just amazing
2,"In the product page it is being said that this ring light is from digitek. But what i got is from some Chinese company. I felt like in cheated in this manner.The product is ok.But whatever it is ,try be genuine .Sell product with proper brand or else dont do it."
4,"Very good as of now....Has Light, a phone holder... and a tripod attachment hinge which has little issues of movement but with regular wear and tear it will be good enough ...Now the light has 10 levels of brightness adjustment with 3 color modes same as mentioned..Wanted to have the ring light effect in the eyes so moved the mobile attached to the back of the light rather than the front ...Used for 3 hours straight .. only thing is that due to the light being very bright it generates a lot of heat ... That's all folks ...."
1,After I recieved the packaging I wanted to check if it was working and it was looking good. After a couple of days I have again opened it up for a shoot and when j turn it on it suddenly turns off and it won't turn back on. The switch sucks. It won't turn on again and it glitches. The quality is also literally cheap plastic. I wanted to buy a higher priced product excpecting to be presented with good quality. If you want the same product there are cheaper ring lights with other sellers who sell the same ones for lesser price.
5,"It was sturdy and of good quality. The different types of lights available are also a very good idea to provide variety. This is a product which was worth the money and provides good value. Also, the customer care service of Digitek have to be commended, they were very helpful."
5,Nice product. Serves the purpose well.Request a clip on mechanism or holder mechanism for  bed head board.  Will double as a night time reading lamp.Also request souring a magnify lens so it can be used as a magnifier.
5,"The product works as promised. Here are a few of my findings.. //1// The light flickers in the bottom 2 levels of brightness. Not sure if its a defect or a side effect. //2// This does not fit the Digitek 9 feet light stand, not sure why as both hai ¼"" head. You'll have to buy a regular tripod for it."
3,"The light is missing the Cold shoe as shown in product photos, there are cheaper alternatives on Amazon itself without cold shoe mount which I specifically avoided, otherwise the light is bright and light. I hope the photos are fixed or the right product is sent to others."
3,"Overall a good product but looks like a fake product is delivered to me. There is no Digitek branding on the ring light. Mounting screw of mobile Holder is also missing.Requested a replacement, need to check the replaced product."
3,"The product is interesting, but it should contain all items as listed on the package. I had to return my product, and the replacement product came without any instructional manual."
5,"The product is good, the seller- Digitek was very helpful. He sent a video showing how to assemble the product. The bigger the ring light, the better output you get."
1,Not happy with the product this is the second time I returned this. First this the product box was damaged and there was some scratches on the ring light and second time when the package arrived hotshoe mount was missing.
4,"Nice quality product , light have 3 modes warm , normal and cool.Quality seem durable.Brightness is nit the best but good enough.Get the work done."
5,"The product is really nice. I had issues with the one I purchased , I spoke to the customer service and because it was in warranty period I got a new ring light exchanged as the earlier one was not in working condition.  Kudos to the customer support team. Thank you once again"
5,Nice light. Works flawlessly with all modes.One thing i didn't liked is the stand is not included in the package
2,"The product is good but they sent me a used one, it had scratches all over it's body also on the mounts. Delivery was delayed too. Very disappointed"
1,"Mobile holder screw is missing ,hotshoe mount is missing and the instructions manual is missing.Very upset with the service .the box is all torn mashed condition n was tempered n then taped up again...not original company packing.Hope after replacement i get a good piece n with all parts and working well"
3,Nice product only if u want to use it as a catch light u need to have other lights to support it this light isint bright enough i recommend save some more money and buy a 18 inch rimg light.
4,Its not bearing mobile to keep it straight. Managing for top view videos only. Slowly mobile falling down even after tightening the light and stand screw.
5,I purchased this product along with Digitek tripod. Both the products are good. The bigger the ring light the better. The seller Digiteks salesperson Arvind Kumar was very helpful and sent me a video showing me how to assemble the ring light and tripod. I got both the products at very affordable price. 👍
1,Don’t waste your money it won’t give results as per out expectations I suggest for results go for 18inch this is waste of money
2,"Not useful because of very low brightness, I had to buy another 18inch ring light.My opinion is if you want good brightness then go for 18 inch ring light but if you want this just as a ""Catch light in eyes"" to get ring shape in eyes then it might be useful....But you need to use some other light sources along with it."
5,Plug and play device with good data writing & recovery  speed. I found it very good for managing my photo library
5,It's super easy to use.. The light is bright enough.. And it comes in three different lighting settings... Very good for beginners.. Been using it for a couple months and I've faced no issue..
4,Brightness is great! Three coloured lights available and brightness can be adjusted according to usage and need for each coloured light. Extremely light weight so easy for portable use
5,Light weight and easy to use...Brightness is also good..I suggest you people to use this with a tripod of good height ao that you can make the most out of this product..Overall i guess this the cheap and best ring light available
1,"No screws are provided for mobile holder.Cheap plastic used for mobile holder as well.If you manage to purchase the screws afterwards separately, it doesn't have the identical fitting marks for the perfect alignment."
2,"Ring light brightness low..if u need to took pictures with ring light, u need to sit one feet distance near led light..review picture Led light very big and brightness too high..."
4,"I have bought 10"" ring light. The brightness of the ring light is good... It is easy to use and it is light weighted. I have bought this for making youtube vedios . If you are doing something in which you want more brightness then I would suggest you to buy 18 inch ring light.."
5,Its good and light is good as well have to use carefully plastic seems a little brittle
5,Okay so i want to tell you guys this ring light is worth buying i was also afraid before it came into my hand but talking about its light to its size everything is like perfect . I will for sure gonna reccomend you this ring light😍
4,Product is good but only little issue is that the screw isn't fitting into the stand though it's also of same brand (Digitek)
4,the brightness is OK . I will say not that good or also not that bad . but yeah the seller can definitely work on the price for the 10 inch coz in same price i have purchased a 12 inch one from the offline shop .;
1,I need a refund for this ring light 😤 this is not working from when I have bought it I swear on god this is real please 😠😠😠😠 . It looks fine but it's not working 😠😠😠😠😠😠🙏.
5,This ringlight is soo easy to use. Has an amazing quality. Love the fact that the intensity can increase as well as decrease. Also can change the colour of the light and it's is so affordable.
1,Don't buy this product after one week Stop working😖😖😖😖😖
5,This is proffesional lighting... Made for video purpose.. i will rule the darkness .. however the cap that holds the ball and socket to fit the smartphone is very fragile..
1,The light shuts off on its own after 5 minutes. It's ridiculous.In the middle of the shoot it switches off.
5,It's just perfect! quality is also amazing... must buy .
4,"User manual was missing, other than that the product is sooper.. Digitek is alway my preference for digital items..One star reduced for packaging and user manual missing."
1,"While the light does work fine, it is not at all sturdy to take the weight of the phone on the mount and is a task to keep adjusting the perfect angle due to the same"
1,Bad quality not at all sturdy
1,"I bought this camera from local Canon dealer. Quality issue just in first month itself. The upper layer of rubberized hand grip is peeling off by itself!Image quality is not good in this camera comparing to the ones taken from base Canon dslrs, with same lens, 18-135 and same settings. High resolution just for publicity. Low light performance is worst.Beware before spending more than a lakh on this."
4,Edit: Buy body only unless you need this travel lens.I bought the camera from a local canon store. Amazing performance with 18-135 combination. It is one of the best cameras anyone can buy without hesitation.Cons- 18-135mm performs far better on 80D than 90D ( Better shoot outdoors with enough light)- In low light Iso above 1600 is noisy with the 18-135 lens but the 80D got better image quality even at 2500 iso. 90D has more Megapixel but fails in low light when compared with 80D- Lacks ALL-I video processing- 120fps No Auto Focus & No stabilization
5,Great product the picture and video quality is pretty good it's an advance version of 80d damn great DSLR camera.
5,"The auto focus system, both via the viewfinder and the live view is something which is unheard of in sub 1-1.5L canon cameras and even can beat Sony upto a6600 with accurate eye detection from farther away and even face detection detects faces farther away with similar focal length lenses on 90d and Sony a6400/6500/6600 and focuses faster provided you have a nano usm lens or atleast a usm or stm lens. But there aren't good f/2.8lens for ef-s with f/2.8 in all focal length ranges and ef lenses have a crop of 1.6 factor.Anyway the af works seamlessly in photos and videos. But the iso performance isn't that great of an upgrade compared to my older 60D, or even worst in some shots especially in high shutter speed, high iso in photos. But the af is spot on and ease of use is unbelievable.. U can change and see settings in multiple ways.. Using tough screen, using all the control wheels, using top small lcd screen, using q button  + joystick.. Want more?  Need to try out all of them in different scenario to make a decision on which is faster, but with initial experience, all are fast and its a hard decision.The ergonomics is always great and similar to my older 60D with some minute improvements. You won't be able to feel the weight reduction from 60/70/80D. For me, that's a good thing and have a solid feel.. Havn't tested the weather sealing capabilities. Hope I wouldn't have to torture it anytime soon. Though it boasts to withstands such tortures, I dont trust its ruggedness as much compared to a 7D mii.4K is nice, but indoor medium to low light and especially under LED and LED tube light, the flicker warning will be shown always and the noise levels aren't great even though the colours and focus is amazing. Noise levels in indoor lighting is worse than my poco f1 indoor videos. Stabilization is decent though not in same league as a gopro hero 8 black with hypersmooth, even with IS on.. I know it lacks IBIS, and no cannon has it ATM.Anyway simply the best crop sensor canon or any crop sensor cam. Really wished it has the 65 af points from 7D mii. Anyway the af speed is as good or even faster, and live view just obliterates the 7dmii af system. Really wish canon brings 65 af points though a firmware update.. But chances are less as the hardware system is different.Anyway a good investment.. Sad canon has announced to stop producing EF lens. Hope they restart since they just recently announced 1DX miii and do they want to kill it before its even officially realised?? Its believed to be the king of all Dslrs and mirrorless alike.Canon.. Please listen to our call and restart production of all EF lenses if you care.Edit:About the noise, I was wrong. Initially felt the noise in photos in higher iso is bit higher than older gens like 80/70D. But if you zoom in pixel-peep into the pics, you can see some type of correction has been performed in the noise, and it looks much less like nos and blends with the background color. That will have a good impact n prints or when viewed on large high res screens.Also I am loving its AF capabilities and faster bursts. I am not missing any moments and every shot is in focus, especially in Live view. The bundled 18-135 is magnificent in focusing speed and accuracy, compared to older 18-135 (which I own and planning to sell off now). Its dead silent and super fast AF in photos or video odes."
5,Good to have
5,Fabulous
1,This is the old 90d model which doesn't have clean HDMI and 4k 24 frame recording. I had oredered this for clean HDMI options otherwise why would i upgrade from 80d to 90d.
5,Loved the camera. I upgraded from basic canon DSLR which was almost 10nyears old to this 90D. Great camera for ameteur like me. Video recording included is an added advantage.Cons - feels heavier than my previous rebel.
5,"Camera is excellent, There is a significant learning curve. Need to good lens to get extraordinary pictures. Liveview mode is awesome. It can work as mirroless too. All over a great allrounder.*Need good lenses to get good pictures because of it's 32 megap sensor"
5,I had been using canon1200D since 5 years and suddenly planned to buy canon 90D after reviewing this product. Extremely smooth performance. Video quality is also exclusive among all APS-C cameras. One of the best camera with better upgradation has been launched by canon.
1,"Red line appears in the pics I clicked before a month. No help from Amazon as their return policy is for 10 days. This might be manufacturing defect in the sensor, Amazon said contact seller for the replacement and seller said to get it replaced from Amazon. Better to buy offline."
5,"Love the camera. The detailing is amazing. 32MP, is great for landscape and wildlife photography. Works well the 18-135mm USM IS lens. Possibly a strong competition to expensive full frame mirrorless cameras, with extended range of affordable lens options."
5,This Dslr is extremely beutifully designed and a crystal clear picture camera and depends on person using it
5,Good quality of pictures
5,For beginners it is the only one.
5,I love this camera 110% better than 80d. No other camera match 90d's video performance. Camera little bit shows noise because of 33mp. but believe me you will not regret after seeing performance of this camera im useing this camera for wedding photography + videography.
5,"he Canon EOS 90D is a midrange DSLR that replaces the 3.5 year-old 80D and fits between the EOS 77D and the 'yes, it still exists' EOS 7D Mark II. It gains a new higher-resolution sensor with excellent Raw image quality, and offers competitive live view AF (with eye detect) as well as 4K video capture, all in a familiar package.The 90D is essentially the DSLR version of the mirrorless EOS M6 Mark II, which was introduced alongside it. Since the specs are nearly identical, it looks like Canon is letting potential buyers choose what type of shooting experience they want: a midsize DSLR with an optical viewfinder and more physical controls, or a smaller and lighter mirrorless model with a removable electronic finder. And, of course, the difference in native lens lineups between the EF and M mounts could attract different types of users, as well.Key features:32.5 Megapixel APS-C CMOS sensorDual Pixel autofocus (live view/video)45-point all cross-type AF (through the viewfinder)220k-pixel metering sensor w/face detection7 fps burst shooting w/continuous AFFully articulating 3"" touchscreen displayOptical viewfinder w/100% coverage4K/30p video capture with no cropUSB 2.0 port with Micro USB connectorWi-Fi + BluetoothWhile the external design of the 90D doesn't dramatically depart from the pattern set down by the 80D, the guts of the new camera are quite a bit different, which we'll cover on the next page."
1,"Facing problem (err 01)within first  5 months.. Service is also not good, even engineer don't know where problem is .. took more than 1 month.. and still problem is not solved..not getting support from Toll free number also.."
1,Not goodDon't purchase through Amazon
4,Loved this product ❤️I have bought this product at the local dealer with the same price 1.2lakhsPicture quality is amazingIn this product we have many predefined settings which helps not only to beginners but also to professionals for different photographyAnd it works perfectly with all the features as mentioned few clicks I have added below which I have captured using
5,I bought this Camera from Canon Verified Dealer and it's damn good clearity and it's high speed performed....video and photo quality is awesome..before I bought 90D I used Canon 1300D compare to this 90D is very attractive and helpful for capturing moments..
5,Please take time to read this I have sold my ktm bike to buy this cameraIt was worth but now i am sitting above the camera nd thinking y the hell this camera has no wheels..
5,"Great picture quality.. great tone, good sharpness..18-135 is best kit lens for itI recommend this dslr.. at this price range"
4,Good product
5,As expected. I bought this for my Canon lenses. They are very good and durable also. The thickness of the pouches is good and its like a cushion to the lenses. There are 4 pouches. The lenses fit well into the pouches. It is a decent product and value for money. Recommended product
4,"Pros:Liked the material, it is very soft on the inside to delicately hold the lens (shown in pic).Perfectly fits my lenses, had little more room for accomodating little broader lenses.The clips come in handy when we want to repeatedly change the lens, more than me my wife is happy about it as I used to ask her hold the lenses a lot.Definitely value for money.Cons:No option to choose and buy only certain sizes. I only have two lenses and I dont think I will buy any bigger lens soon. So the other two covers are just lying down unused."
3,These covers will provide adequate protection for transportation in a camera case. I am not very sure if the cover will provide adequate protection when slung around the body. The covers a bit too tight for comfort and I have to be very careful while putting the lenses into the covers or taking them out. I can recommend them for transportation of lens but not for outdoor use.
5,I bought this for my Nikon D3400 - kit lenses. The pouches are very good and they appear to be quite durable also. You will get 4 pouches. The most important thing is my D3400 kit lenses fit well into two of the pouches. It is a decent product and value for money. I would definitely recommend buying it.
3,I have a Canon 100-400 and was hoping the large pouch would fit the lens but it does not. It is too snug. Now I am not  if  the smaller ones fits smaller lens as I didn't have mine around.  The quality for fabric is good but sadly did not work for me. I am trying to return it but the option I receive is only for replacement.  Hopeful the service centre will be able to address that issue.
5,"This was my first AmazonBasic Product, I have always believed that, AmazonBasic Products are alternatives of original products and little less in quality compared to main leaders in each segment. I was wrong. The pouches are of Top notch quality, very sturdy, thick, Material offered in the prize was beyond expectations. Sizes are proper for my 17-55 mm & 30-700 mm lenses, Other 2 covers are even bigger.. so good for future lenses also.. All star Must have product"
5,"Don't know about water resistance since I haven't taken a risk yet. Quality is really good. It's very soft and seems like it will last for some time. Sinve lenses vary in size depending on the angle and make, it won't be exact size for any lens I guess. For me it fits a Sony FE 24-240, Sony FE 50mm, Tamron 28-70 and a Laowa 100mm."
5,"Brought this Camera Lens Protective Pouches paying Rs.699/-Indeed the product is of very good quality and it is a value for money.  I would say, it is a very good deal.Both the inner and outer material is made up of good quality fabric and you feel happy storing your expensive lenses in them.I need to check on the water resistance level but don't want to do that now but I will write again if I caught up in rain someday :)Thank youBest regards, Jag"
5,"Got the package deliverd on time. Has 4 bags, build quality is good, feels premium. The lenses fit in it very well and can be tightened with the strings on top. Easy to store and feels safe. Have not tested whether it is water proof or water resistant. Hope it lasts long. Better spend a few hundred rupees to keep the lenses safe. Definitely recommended."
4,"Product quality satisfactory.Suitable for kit lens, extension tubes, and smaller lens like 50mm, pancake lenses and other small accessories.Tokina 11-16mm lens won't fit as len cover diameter smaller than desired."
4,"A good accessory for keeping and handling the lenses, fits well with my collection, though, in some cases, are a bit  bigger.Great quality, ample cushioning to protect the lenses. Rain/drizzle protection is something that needs to be tested, but overall great option in the budget, can use them for carrying in non DSLR backpacks"
5,Real value for money product. Received this today. I must thank Amazon for such a nice packing. Really a worthy purchase. I have Nikon D 3500 camera with 18-55mm snd 70-300 mm Lens. I could use only 2 pouches .. Other 2 are not in use right now.  I am not satisfied with Water resistant quality. Still that doesn't matter becoz i used to keep lenses inside waterproof backpack.Cover Material is good enough to avoid damages . I would strongly recommend this product
1,"I am a Canon user and very disappointed to  realize that none of my lenses fit inside any on the pouches in the set.Unfortunatley I was abroad and my family recived the product and home and by the time I could test it if it fits my lenses it was too late for a return.It was a waste of money and just been useless.None of the Canon EF or EF-S lenses fit inside it.I hope i find a way seller takes a return, even if too late and it has been useless to me"
5,"Seems very sturdy and the felt surface on the inside and the waterproof stronger material on the outside is a potent combination, compared to a lot i have used, this is far-out in terms of quality at the given price range..Value for money!"
5,"Every DSLR owner must have Protective Cover,Its water resistant & awsm built quality..Sturdy Matte finish...i am happy. Just go for it. Nice packaging 👌"
5,The camera lens pouches are sturdy and look good. I have used them for 3 lenses so far. The clips are handy to fix the pouches to the camera case. Value for money
5,"Very thick neoprene obviously the best, its so thick that im sure the it may protect a fall. (dont try it though)"
5,Though they are soft and good carry bags. Some of them are universal size nad may or may not serve all  of lens storage.its for specicfic cameras only.
5,Fit and finish is very good. Can protect lens in case dropped.  Good price for this quality. I have used all the four to accommodate a collection of lenses I have.
5,"Best carry case for lense, best quality from Amazon.loved this. You don't need any other cases for lense trust me thish is vGood Quality product."
4,"Good sturdy pouches. Quality is good, but are too stiff. Will help to protect lenses, but adjustment in bag is bit tricky."
3,"Water resistance, yes. Water tight, no. As you could see in the picture, some water does sip inside."
5,"Really the product was good . excellent durability and value for money .four pouch in different sizes and perfectly fixed with Sony 50mm, samyang 14mm,sigma 35mm and canon135mm ."
5,"It’s so much better than I expected it to be. The quality is really sturdy and cushions is also thick. Definitely ll recommend to buy this one. Expect it to keep lens away from fungus but not sure of that, only time ll tell but product quality is top notch."
5,Amazing product. Soft but strong and good quality. Good padding and protecting. A must have for lenses
5,"It is such a soft pouch for DSLR lenses. I liked a lot. In the inside it is made up of soft cloth, also on outside it is a bit water resistant. Thanks for the product."
4,I had been looking for something like this gear for all the lenses I got. Wish it was a bit flexible in its size (not length) as well. Couldn’t find it for the same price though.
4,Quality is pretty good and sturdy too. It can be a saviour when you have to pack in a non- cabin luggage.Loved the purchase.
5,Wondering how the product is so good at this low cost. Kudos to the manufacturer and Amazon for making this product available for such a satisfying price.Product looks and quality are simply magnificent.
1,"The lens pouches are too narrow to fit the lenses. Only the smallest pouch size is ok for 50mm but the Canon L series EF lenses like 16-35,100, 24-105, 70-200 do not fit at all."
5,Very useful protects your valuable camera lenses against the damage
5,Worth your money. Durable with excellent quality n finish. Using it for my D5600 kit and prime lenses.
4,Good quality as expected from Amazon Basics
5,Good cushioning to take small drops or scratches. Not tested for water resistance. Liked it.
5,"Beautiful and super design, how long the material to last will only know as time goes. as of now Looks Great."
5,Quality of the pouch is very good. It definitely gives good resistance to absorb shock for the lens during travel.Quality product and worth the money.
5,Bigger cover should have larger diameter to accommodate large filter lenses. No cover for long primes or zooms. Quality is truly excellent.
5,Really.... I. Very Happy with this product specially my lens get water protection n also I like tht I hang tht bag with lock system.... Awesome....
5,"Smart, durable and well made covers. I’m sure it is water resistant. Worth the money."

1,When it came for the first time the size of stand was big and when i requested for a replacement and when it came back the size of stand was so small
4,Good for the price. It comes with a stand. No pouch
5,"Actually it was worth buying, this product.I searched for this lens ball and all of those products were above 1200/- .It's cheap and i guess people can afford to buy it rather than spending, a lot more money on the same product from other manufacturers.!I just have one request : you can provide a good and durable cover for the ball."
5,The product quality is really good.
4,Nice procduct at this price
5,Good product. Delivered as promised.
5,Great product. High quality glass. Added extra attraction in my Photography. Timely delivery. Thanks to the seller and Amazon for great shipping experience.

2,Could have been better for the price
5,Product as described but a bit costly
5,"Product is good and stand is also good but pouch is very low as compared to ball , please make a goor pouch"
4,"Nice add on to your photography tools. Easier to hold on to take pictures, as well as comes with a stand to place the crystal ball."
1,Found sent/scratch on ball

3,"I have already given my review on this and this is second time.The Tripod is good, easy to use and comes with accessories. No complaints. But this can be improved in the areas of sturdiness, the blanks at the bottom rods be made of rubber instead of hard plastic as it falls off and slips, the supporting ribs are all so flimsy, any hurried opening would make them come off the rivets and render the stand useless. There can be a cloth bag like havesacl to put the stand and accessories inside as they are now in three small pieces which could easily get slipped off.From amazon point, the packing alsi could have been atleast three inches longer so that the stand completely is inside the box when packed. Its not so"
5,"Super convenient ...ordered a cheaper one earlier from amazon only ...that was shaky and breaky hahahThis one is good :) I'll be using it for everything lectures, yoga videos"
3,"Very good tripod , especially if you are looking for recording at home. Its sturdy, and just fits the desprition mentioned by the buyer.It needs improvement with the mobile holder, could be of a better quality,especially if you use a Redmi Note etc, it doesn't hold well.Haven't tried using it on a windy day outside, but im sure it will di justice.Go for it !"
3,The product was damaged. The phone holder is weak and broken. My phone fell as soon as I put the phone in the holder. And now I have a scratch on my new phone because of the stand and the weak phone holder.
1,"Did not check it at the time of delivery. Later on when wanted to use, found that it is defective piece and seems it is delivered deliberately.Now Amazon says that it is out of the period of return. What to do ?"
5,"This is one of the best products that I've bought since I started taking online classes again. My first stand was something that could be attached to the board but it was too flexible and broke too soon, but this is perfect. It's adjustable and lightweight, and more than enough to support my phone without slipping through and breaking the screen like my old stand. No complaints from me. 10/10 would recommend."
5,"I am happy with the product , I needed it for fixing htc vive vr base station and it fits perfectly"
4,Product is working well I m satisfied but it's mobile catcher is small my mobile is 6 inches long it was not fitting in it overall tripod is working well.
5,Most affordable and value for money Tripod.. Satisfied and took my first YouTube video with it... Awesome😍
5,I do online yoga classes and this product is really helpful to me . It’s easy to set my phone Camera on it. It’s value money and plus I got it at a discounted price.  I have had no complains so far and it’s working well.
5,"I simply loved the tripod. It is kinda light and easily portable. I can carry the stuff to anywhere as the shoot requirement occurs. I recently moved from Delhi to Punjab for the shoot. It was just damn. Overall, great deal!"
4,"it's worth the money, adjusts nicely, lightweight, nice packaging-but  4 stars because it shakes when I use my phone and type on it while it's on the tripod"
2,This is not the best tripod for mobile but for the first time is amazing...
5,Gud one .. Go to it... But wen i ordered it was broken.. So am little upset.. Anyway am gone replace it.. Let me wait and see.. ✌
5,"Extremely durable, easy to use and versatile product. This is just what I needed to watch my lectures with. I am very happy with this tripod."
5,The purchased product (VKB 92 inch Heavy Duty Extendable Metal Tripod Stand)  has high quality .Very good product.

5,It's very good products. Very easy to install. Value for money.
5,Awesome product 👍 got it as I expected 😁 loved the product👍👍👍👍
5,"Thank you for letting me venture into the world of macro photography. Thi product is amazing, no wonder i can see so mamy photographers use it. It fits on lenses with filter size ranging from 52mm till 67mm, which covers almost all my lenses, especially on 85mm and 55-300mm thar i have is giving amazing reach. You can reduce min focal distance of all lenses considerably also the image is further zoomed in. So with 300mm i am able to get close as well as get an effevtive focal length of 300mm x 1.5 crop factor of my body x may be 2.5x zoom by Raynox, incredible. One thing I obserbed while using with 18-140 Nikon is that there is heavy vignetting but there is a trick to reduce it, take the focus to manual and get it to infinity, it will still focus close but you can move yourself back from the subject a bit to get it in focus but without the circular vignetting. Also there are significant colour fringing observable at highlighted area but that is ok, i am getting what i payed for. Autofocus works accurately even at low aparture no issues there, but macro is easier I guess focussing manyally and moving yourself to get intended focus. Overal am overjoyed with the purchase. Amazon packing and delivery is good, delivery has become even faster these days during Covid lockdown. Amazing guys  kudos to you all"
4,"This is a lens for super magnification of small n micro subjects, don't mistake it for macro lens or giving benefits of macro. U can use this as attachment in front of most of lenses and need to be very close to subject for getting good shots. And while it has certain technical difficulties especially in start, it's a good accessory for super macro user or high magnification picturesVignetting will almost always happen so just focus on good flash system for photography."
4,"Its worth if you have patience and want a frugal alternative of MACRO lens...Frugal because its way less costly than a proper MACRO lens and You need patience because due to narrow DOF (at higher zoom) and moving subject, you have to take multiple shots to get satisfactory Image. Offcourse you will need a Tripod and an ample light source (in order to widen the DOF, we need to shorten the aperture size thus we need pretty good amount of light, but that holds true for a macro lens too)My Observation :I used this snap on Lens on my 50mm prime and 18-135mm all in one lens.With 50mm it worked well but didn't get much magnification so I used extension tubes.7mm extension tube + 50mm + Tripod + Good Light + static object =  nice resultsWith  18-135 mm, @135 I observed some vignetting as the lens thread is 67mm (wider than 50mm lens), I think It should work well with any P&S ultra zoom camera and any DSLR lens having 150+ focal length.Lens is good in the terms of use and optical quality, easy to clip on my 52 mm and 67 mm lenses.Pros-1. Easy to use2. Nice optical qualityCons-1. Vignetting at small focal length. Ideal for 150+ zoom lenses"
5,"I used this with 18-140 Nikkor lense. Picture quality is too good, but make sure you have enough lighting. I have external flash and that may be a requirement to get some goo details and sharpness. Also, you need to go more closer to get some shot, so if the subject is shy then you may not get shot easily. But with respect to the prize it is always worth keeping it."
5,Just awesome.. When you able to set your hand...
1,Not usable.I purchased and kept it away uselessly.Regret to have purchased it.Never take it.IT is just a magnifying glass.
5,This macro lens is very good.Set your camera on shutter priority mode and use some external flash. I am using this with Nikon Coolpix p900 super zoom camera . Good results.
5,"Excellent product I using it. Excellent delivery only 3 days. I recommend all macro photographer to use this filter, Macro lens or 55-250, 70-300 outstanding results. Thank you Amazon."
5,It is an awesome product and works on any camera-lens combination if the front can be attached to the lens. Worth its money.Thank you.
5,"check for your filter size on your lens before purchasing raynox, if it fits. there is also a chart online where you can calculate your magnification ratio using your lens with the raynox 250. great quality add on !"
5,Nice product
5,"the glass quality is really good. and it produces nice sharp macros. I have made a video upon it . You can watch it on YouTube ,my channel Photography Freak by Subir Das"
4,"Using it with Nikon D3300(70-300mm) gives good results, purchase it around 6.8k approx"
5,"It's basically just a magnifying glass which attaches to your lens...But does the job..I use DCR 250 with 100mm Macro, and results were very good after few experiments"
4,"The only thing which is challenge when you are using it on a 70-300mm lens is the shallow depth of field, and sometimes camera auto focus cannot do the job."
5,Excellent piece of glass for extreme macro photography
5,I am using with Nikon 50mm f/1.8 lens. Very good result. If used with any macro lens result definitely best.
5,This product is so amazing. I take so many pictures... This month.... I am so happy.
5,High Quality Lance . Fit in canon PowerShot sx 540 hs .

5,Nice product.
1,Not worth to that cost
4,"Lens holder is quite small, difficult to attach and remove. But lens is good"
5,"Great Lens. If you are using this lens with Nikon P900, keep working distance 4-6 inches in Aperture mode with Auto-Focus."

1,The price is to high compared to other market and it around 2.6grand in US so SONY be carefull Panasonic S1 is winning market with 180fps and 4k60.
4,I'm serious if you are professional then you'll love this but if you somewhat beginner with 16-35mm lens you are going to freaking love thisPros* Comfortable grip* 61 MP full frame sensor* Image is crisp AFCons* Battery is less compared to A7 RIII
1,cost ' is very high
5,Unbeatable Camera
5,Best camera in the world seriously its soo good that when i brought it took the best footage of doctor removing my kidney... Just too happy with it.. :)))
5,How long battery life and charging time
4,"Looks like an used product. Paint has chipped off at the ends of all the three rods. Also the locking screws are missing from the package. The hole for the cross lock with the light stand is crudely made and needed hammering to make it usable. Overall, highly disappointed with the item. Not returning it since the requirement is urgent and can make it work with some effort and buying my own locking screws etc.17/6/21 - Replacement was promptly sent. The item is as advertised. No paint chips and looks new. Conversion adapter/lock screw is also present. Revising the rating to 4* from 1*. 1 lesser because it's not difficult to check if all the parts are packed properly or not. It would avoid unnecessary returns and replacements and other hassles.As for the item itself, it's pretty strong and sturdy. And very easy to install and use."
5,The stand is perfect and the material is also good. Complete value of money.
5,"The stand is perfect.But the white backdrop material is little transparent.Overall, I loved the product and it is worth buying."
4,It was well packed everything is of great quality but the nut was broken into half I had to use feviquick to glue it back !
5,Really good and sturdy construction! Very happy with the package & delivery also!
5,"The delivery was on time as expected, the packaging was ok as some part of the cover was out of the box fortunately there wasn’t any damage to the stand"
5,"I am using it to create background for my webcam.It is very compact, easy to install and excellently serves the purpose.Value for money."
5,"I checked price in lot of markeplace and shops, but the price is less here onlyAnd the quality also good as expectedWorth for money"
5,"I'm very much satisfied with this product, thank Amazon,must recommend product,best price best product."
5,Very thing is fine... Value of money....high quality..its very... Nd packinging was superb ❤️❤️❤️go for it...

5,It is of very good quality.
5,good product
5,Good product!!
5,Great product. customer friendly service and nice quality.would like to recommend for beginners as well as professional for indoor shoots.
5,"Perfect Holster for DSLR with zoom lens. Using it for Canon 1200D with 55-250mm lens and Canon 6D with 24-105mm lens including hood. Enough pockets for charger,wire,cards etc. Build quality is excellent and very sturdy. Solid plastic base, quality inner with cushioning."
5,"I am really surprised to find such a good quality bag for my LARGE Nikon p1000 at this price. Initially i was in two minds whether it can accommodate Nikon p1000. I got a positive review here and gave it a shot. It appears it won't fit Nikon p1000, but in reality , the camera is cozy and comfortable inside, even with the additional 77mm uv glass inside the lens cap. Quality is not compromised and rather it can challenge any of its big branded competitors. The battery can also be kept in side pockets. However, the charger is to be taken separately. It will definitely accommodate most of the DSLRs, but it seems to be tailor made for Nikon p1000.5 stars for.... 1) traveling 2) sturdiness 3) value for money.Thank you AMAZON, once again....."
5,"Hello guys,So I'm not going into dimensions of this bag,im telling about the use of it. First of all This is an Amazing bag for Dslr Cameras attached with One lens.You can not take 2 lens on it attached with lenshood. i have canon 77D camera and it fits well in the bag along with canon 85mm F/1.8 lens attached with lens hood.If i reverse the lens hood into the lense then i can carry 50mm lens also.If anyone have mirrorless Camera Body they can easily carry 2 lens along with the Body. the Quality of this Bag is Topnotch,It's lightweight and sturdy.I'm uploading a video so that you guys will have an idea of the space it has.Thank you Amazon for this Lovely product♥️"
4,"OK for casual use. Small bag which can accommodate medium size DSLRs. Small packets provided at 3 sides may not be useful except to hold smaller items like memory cards.For the price, the quality of materials used & making are great. The bottom portion is made out of some hard plastic material which is useful to protect the camera from hard hits against the surfaces on which the bag is kept casually.I had ordered for ""yantralay Reversible 2 Side Neoprene Waterproof DSLR Camera Liner Case Cover Pouch For Canon, Nikon & Other Cameras"" along with this. Keeping camera inside the pouch in this camera bag fits perfectly. Buying both of these items will be useful for various occasions."
5,"Ordered this with doubt for my Nikon Coolpix P1000 (23CM x 15CM x 12CM) but somehow this fitted it correctly even with the hood attached, the quality looks better than Lowepro and has a lot of chains but the only problem is I can’t keep my charger in it, pockets in it can only accomodate sleek items. If you are looking for the smallest bag for the huge Nikon P1000, it just fits it snugly, so the carry bag doesn’t look big but if you are someone who wants a big bag to keep multiple lenses, chargers and other stuff, go for the Amazonbasics - Rectangular bag, this is meant for high zoom cameras with lens attached to camera."
4,"I really loved this holster that got delivered in such a short span of time. I am using it for my Nikon D5100 that has an 18-55 lens. The base has got a  very nice density so you can place the lens in the downward position. The side walls are not very heavily cushioned though. You also have side pockets to store USB cable and battery charger. If you have got additional accessories or long lenses, then this holster is not for you."
5,"This is a very good bag. Keeps my DSLR safe. This is what I was looking for. The bag is stiff enough from outside and quite soft from inside, unlike the EOS bag which I got with camera.Only drawback is, the bag cannot hold extra lense. Somehow, if slight increase in bag size to enable carrying one more lense could have won 6th star for this product. Pockets are small too, but my battery charger fits easily in that.Please buy it for your DSLR..."
5,"Great Quality Bag with super quality chain and fibers,multiple pockets also was very useful,dedicated pocket for SD cards are helpful.Fitted my D 5200 with 82mm dia lens fitted very comfortably with addition 82 mm polarized filter/lens cap/cleaning cloth/Remote Shutter with cord.Good for a day trip with battery full charge.Very much reliable for camera safety from water and bumps.Very well recommended in this budget, i got a flash deal of 999/- which was great for me."
5,"I was very pleasantly surprised when I purchased this product. I love the hard bottom on this, not only does it provide safety and protection for the camera, but it allows you to just stand it up. The material is water-resistant from my experiences, I’ve had it on my shoulder in the rain and nothing got in. The inside of it is a lovely soft material, it’s..."
4,"Amazing built quality. Chains are flawless. I've given one less star because I feel it could have been made a little more spacious to keep an extra lens or other accessories. The special slot for keeping memory card slot is amazing ! The adjustable paddings are very useful ! The stand below the cover is great since you can keep it standing in one place. Mind you, one cannot carry more than the camera and the lens on the camera in this bag. Most lens would fit perfectly but cannot carry extra pair of lens in this. Great product overall. Feels premium. Better than lovpro bags."
4,"Good one for the price. Fits my D610 with 50mm. Any longer lens may not fit. I can squeeze in my charger and cables in the main compartment. The side compartments are too small, can be used only for memory cards and lens covers. The strap looks heavy duty and  well-made. The bag will be apt for Nikon 3000 and 5000 series."
5,"The quality of Amazon Basics product is very high. Very much satisfied with the product. The camera bag which I got with my Canon 1200D is a bit type of baggy. This product is perfect for 1200D with 18-55mm lens. The camera fits perfectly, without much gaps. Overall the quality of the product is good. Easily handled even during rain."
5,"I bought this 3 months back and already traveled twice with it. I have a 77d body with 18-200 tamron and 10-18 Canon.I can carry this setup within this bag very easily.  Padding quality is good.  Also possible to fit a gopro if needed. Check the photos for better clarification. Only need to add a padding in between extra lens and the camera, which I have arranged from my other large camera backpack."
5,"I'm getting impressed day by day with the Amazon Basics products. The quality they maintain is really good. When it comes to this products it's really value for money and I give it a thumbs up. I'm using a Canon 80d body with 18-135mm lens, which fits perfect in it's cabin. If you are traveling around with you camera on a bike or if you are doing trekking with you rug-sag then this bag offers you a lot of comfort to carry your camera. The downside to say is if you wish to stuff more of your accessories then it doesn't have any more space left & if you are handling even a mid range telephoto lens then it can't provide you any space."
5,"Very helpful for traveling, however I won't suggest you to take this thing out in your hands as it kinda looks weird but yea you can put your camera into this & carry it in a bag. This thing will protect your camera from medium impacts & dust. However this thing itself can't protect the camera from medium impacts but combining this with a backpack will be your ultimate travel + photography life hack."
5,"I have a liking for Amazon Basic products I must say. I was looking for similar product from Vanguard. But ended up buying this. Great quality, has a separator inside and I can fit in my D7100 with a small lens and still have space to fit in my tiny Nikon flash. Material is top notch. Very good price."
4,"Strong sturdy bag. Light enough without affecting the protection accorded. Surprisingly, an a6000 with a Sony 18-105 doesn't fit in easily. Just about fits without the lens hood/inverted hood. One star reduced thus!"
4,"Product is nice and durable. However, a bit more space to keep battery charger would have been appreciated. Have to carry the charger separately as the main cabin only holds the camera with lens. Cannot carry additional lenses. Pockets provided are too small and cannot hold much. Impractical to use.Besides product is expensive compared to the value"
4,The bag hass perfect design and it itself is very light weight so doesnt make it heavier once you put the camera in. There is sufficient space to fit camera perfectly. There are plently of storage area but the 2 side pockets could be bigger then it can be used to store charger in it.
5,Very durable and a good quality bag for DSLR. I am able to keep my NIkon D5600 with 18-55mm lens attached and 70-300mm zoom lens on top separated by two detachable straps. It is not water proof entirely except for the base. You can comfortably place the bag and it will stay upright.
5,"Looks good and safe , enough for DSLR with single lens, outer cover is solid so can handle impacts. Better than other available in this price."
5,"One of the best amazonbasics productWhich solves the purpose 100%Neat stitchesWell paddedAmple PocketsNicely done BaseRequired length of strapCute bag for travel purposeCan hold a dslr with a 70-200 lens mounted to bodyCan carry 1 body, 2 prime lens and a battery chargerConsNot until now"
5,Side pockets could have been made bigger and spacier to hold up to 82 mm  circular filters. A pocket could have been added at the back of the case to hold rectangular filters. Plastic fitments could have been replaced with metal ones.
5,Really a quality item. it is well built and durable. it fits Nikon d7200 with Tamron 18-400mm lens nicely. love to have it.
5,"Price could have been a bit less, but quality and compactness is good. Canfit only dslr body with one medium sized lens fitted togeter. Am using for Canon 90d with18-135 kit lens."
4,"Excellent quality bag with a lot of space for my P900, and velcro straps to hold the camera in place.Value for money. I would rate it 5 if the pockets were bigger. Right now they are almost useless."
5,Fits nikon d850 with 24 - 120 lens attached.Earlier I had to carry big camera bag when there was no need of bigger lens 200 500.Otherwise it used to sit open in car. Now that issue is resolved.
5,Amazon basics are really of great quality. I had to return it despite the quality as it was not solving the purpose.. Not for telephoto lens.. Can be used as an additional carrier.
5,By far the best camera bag i have had ever owned. This one is excellent when u r travelling because its a one sided small bag which can hold ur camera and one lens. I carry two along with Gopro and Wifi hotspot. Te side pockets are great to keep cards and spare batteries.
5,This product is so amazing. I have a Canon EOS T5 Rebel (1200D) with the standard 18mm-55mm lense and it fits so perfectly. The inside padding is sturdy and can protect the camera if there's a fall. The quality is so much better than I expected. Thank you Amazon :)
5,Amazing product. Fits my Nikon P900 perfectly along with HDMI cable and charger. Still remains one pocket empty which can carry additional battery and other stuff. Prompt delivery.
5,Packaging and delivery was goodQuality is goodIt has sufficient space to hold Sony A6000 with 55-210mm lens attached and opened fullyAlso the front compartment is sufficient to hold 16-50mm lensSide compartments is able to store cablesThere is also dedicated space for memory cardBase is strong and able to stand on its ownStrap is okOverall good product
3,The product quality is superb but it's much smaller than expected. It is able to carry camera body only and other accessories are difficult to fit. Additional lens or charger have no place in it. Far more useful if the size is somewhat bigger.
5,"Pros:1. Amazing padding/cushioning2. Pockets for keeping extra cards and batteries, wires3. Easy to carry, compact4. Camera with 18-105mm on extended zoom can be easily kept.Cons:1. The base is not so stable.2. Pockets not big enough for charger.3. No place for spare lens"
3,"upto 250 mm KIT lens will go fine . thats the max limit. cannot detach lens and keep.quality zoom lens of 250 mm and above, just forget."
5,Product as expected and too early to comment on durability. Bit pricey though but I still went for it since other ones weren't meeting my expectations.
2,Too bulky it's not at all compact instead the case which generally come with the camera is slimmer than this case. Built quality is average nothing premium and the strap cousion is hopeless it doesn't bend so instead of providing comfort it provides more of discomfort
5,"Its a good case but didnot fit my Nikon D3500 perfectly and hence I had to return it. But overall, its a nice comfortable and sturdy Cam accessory."
5,"Good bag, lens is very safe and comfortable in this bag. Nice for travell..hi)hly recomended."
4,"Fits well for mid size DSLR with 24-105mm lens. Three sides with bottom padded very well. Fourth side should have had some more padding but shouldn’t be a problem. The pockets can carry extra memory cards, filters but can’t carry a charger. Overall worth buying this."
1,"I had previously given a 5 star rating, but changing it now only after 2 days of use.The entire print has a grey undertone to it, and there are black bands on both edges of the paper.Have made repeated calls to Amazon to have the unit replaced, and they tell me that they have processed it, but no reply over email, no ticket number of the request or any communication regarding the replacement process. It feels like they are trying to stall so that the window to request replacement is over and I am stuck with a defective machine.Very disapoointed."
1,printer have manufactured defects. brother engineers say it physically damage. and it is now out of warranty. I am speechless. what a bad experience.
5,"This is a revolutionary product offering from Brother where in they have reduced the cost of printing in laser products similar to ink tank . The toner costs only 900 rs which is way cheaper than HP and canon toners which cost 4000 rs and the price of the prduct is also cheaper than HP and canon lasers. All in all a great product with god functionality and additional features like duplex printing. if you compare this to the top selling model in the market - hp 1005 , which is priced at 17k , this is a clear winner as it is multi function , plus duples , 3k cheaper plus cost of consumables is only 900 rs !!"
5,Awesome product got in just 11000 bucks a great deal and a great product.
1,Brother DCP-B7500D Multi-Function Centre with Automatic 2-Sided PrintingVERY BAD PRINTER & BAD SERVICE FOR SERVICE CENTER...DONT PURCHASE BRODHER PRODUCT......
4,"The print quality is great and it's quite fast too. Automatically prints both sides of the paper. Scanner and copier functions work fine. I had no trouble with installation. I'm quite surprised at the connectivity options though (the lack of them to be precise). It only has a USB port. And that's it. Not even an Ethernet port. If it had Wireless connectivity, it would have been ideal for me. But it doesn't. It's pretty expensive for what it has to offer, but it does print very well. I've had big problems with inkjet printers, and I've learnt that ink tank printers have problems with printer heads becoming bad in a year or so. So, laser was the only option for me. I don't print very often and I don't want to keep changing the cartridge  every time I want to use it. I hope it lasts a while - it looks quite sturdy."
1,"NEVER EVER PURCHASE THIS PRINTER, WORST EVER PRINTER I USED. PURCHASED 2 MONTHS BEFORE, CARTRIDGE AND DRUM DAMN LOW QUALITY"
5,Writing this review after two months of usage. Print quality is good. Its easy to install and I did not need an engineer from Brother to assemble it. Its very easy.  Printing speed is also good. Its easy to install and use. Scanner could be a bit faster. All in all its a good printer and great value for money. Very good for home or office use. Though I wish they had given some color options.
1,"this printer is after 5 months was given this xerox and print, every time change toner and their price is 1000 rs. I especially tell you didn't buy this printer"
5,Toner finished in only 12 days....i dont know how they said it print 2600 pages....i only printed arround 600 pages...It is completed one month again toner has finished by just taking fifteen pages daily...coste is 900...again we have to go on printing shop for cheapest print
5,Value for money...Very nice printer34 page per minute
5,"Having spent my life trying to get good prints from ink-jet printers, worrying of ink levels, getting my hands/clothes stained with ink and cost of cartridges, this Brother printer is now complete peace of mind, I have finally find found Nirvana. The duplex printing feature, the well designed backlit LCD with user-friendly menus, the auto wake-up and sleep, the fully covered bottom tray design, the 2 sided ID card copier on same page, clean backside, all are well designed features of this printer, go for it."
1,After using of 2 months the printer is asking for replacement of toner cartridge.Shall I have to refill or have to purchase a new one.Kindly suggest....
5,Best printer.Printing Speed is osmloaded with lots of features.User friendly software.Far better than HP Printers.
5,Very very best macheen i am very happy
5,"Super product without any problem, blindly trust in this printer if you are going to buy a new one. My first printer is from Hp but...after corona pandemic, i hate china and chinese products....so blindly trust in this japanese product."
3,Easy to install in computer. Print quality best. Price of toner is a little bit expensive as compared to the other models of brother.
1,"Brother after sale service is worst, after one month it's not working. To decline warranty brother company have many reasons."
1,"Second side printing is not working, paper always jams when both side print command is given. I brought it 5 days before only due to both side printing but not a good product for both side printing."
1,I only print 965 copies my printer toner is exhausted. It claims to print 2600pages but cant event print half the number of pages. Dont buy if considering cost effective printer else everything is fine.
1,Miss some line or words during printing
5,"After 5 days of use - Very much satisfied , thanks brother & Amazon for such beautiful product, I have a small business & it serves the needs perfectly, printing & copying is fast & perfect . Without any doubt go for it & brother is almost 110 years old company , Trust Brother . It will definitely make you Happy . 👍"
5,Best deal.  Waited for 10 days for price drop.  it fluctuated between 13000/- to 14500/- and finally purchased for 12500/-.  Best features among other similar printers.Delivered within less than 24 hrs.
5,"The printer has a good speed, The print quality is also very good ,the first toner given with the printer doesn't print up to the claimed 2600 pages."
2,"Ther is not wiFi.no EDF,Function is to difficult ."
5,"Yes, its on my side, my brother. Nice printer for professional work. As we need lot more prints due to Book Publishing work. Thanks amazon.in for prompt and secure delivery."
5,"1- QualityPrinter is very goodPrint quality is very fine2- User friendly3- Manual guide has perfectly explained each and every steps for installation. So, I have not faced any difficulty for installation."
3,Not at all value for money 1st cartridge over on only 1200 pages and it is mentioned 2800 pages  it cost appx 1.5rs per page not at all recommended.
4,"Does what it is supposed to do, really well.  But fit and finish not so great.  There are visible gaps and very tacky.  Also noisy during print.  But its a printer/scanner and it does its job really well."
3,Good Quality and easy to use
1,"Don't buy for business purpose,because 1 copy nearly 1.20 rupees,there is no possible change toner,cartridge change  every time (940/-)"
5,This machine is good quality but i fine out more cheaper price thats why i have return the printer
3,The product delivered is opened not seal  with brother tape  the seal is broken this is very disappointed for customer to received .
4,"Everything is good.but there is no official support for printing through mobile.However,u can use third party apps like NokoPrint for printing through mobile devices..."
4,Refilling ink cartridge is said to be not possible?
5,value for money
3,For printing it's a good product. Problem comes at the time of scanning multiple pages as the only drawback is it doesn't has the duplex scanning option.Overall it's a fine product.
5,"I purchased this printer in January 2020 , a month ago. It’s worth money spent. Only problem is of scanning of A5 or legal papers as the length of scanner glass do not support it. Installation is very easy."
3,"Three in one...Scan,print, Xerox for home use it's much useful for covid 19 epidemic situation.Print quality is excellent."
5,Very easy and yes value for money
4,"This is an amazing all in one printing-scanning-copying machine. Offers more than other models like HP.  Opted for this as it has an auto feeder, which makes copying/scanning of multiple pages much easy. In the HP machine, you had to insert and scan one page at a time. In this, you just load the pages on the feeder and it does it all automatically.The only downside was the default setup this machine comes with.  I would say its very user unfriendly. After spending few hours and browsing through all the forums and international Amazon site, I learnt how to set up this machine for best use. My printer was setup correctly, however on the wireless printing mode, it used to go to sleep mode after a few minutes, and none of my devices were able to detect the printer there after. This was a pain, as I had to eventually go to the machine and restart it to get it out of the sleep mode. Brother needs to fix this as not everyone is good with machines.Anyways, here is what you should do right after installing the software on your PC.EDIT: Before reading through the steps below. Make sure you update the firmware on the printer, as it might automatically solve the iissue. If it doesn't, then go through the steps. Firmware can be updated by downloading the Firmware update tool available here: http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadtop.aspx?prod=dcpl2541dw_as&c=as_ot&lang=en Go to the printer , Click on the Menu Button, and pull up ""Network"" settings using the buttons on the printer. Under that, go to WLAN and click on set up wizard. Use this to connect your printer to the router/wifi. Once you are connected, do the following steps.On your printer, press Menu button and :1. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP->Boot Method - Change it to Static2. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> APIPA - Change it to turn it OFF/Unchecked.3. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> IPv6 - Turn it ON.After following these steps, your printer will always stay connected to the network. If you don't follow these steps, then your printer will not show up while you try to wirelessly print/scan from your device(after few minutes of turning on the printer). I hope Brother sets up the machine to run these settings by default."
1,I strongly recommended you all dont buy very poor service from brother i purchase it before a month & i only 33 page print problem comes and 1 time motherboard changed but again problem come and no one listen even i call customer care but only delay delay delay from there sides
4,"First about price - >During Great Indian Festival Sale, I was able to get it at an unbelievable price of just Rs. 11600/- and considering its MRP is beyond 18000, its was just amazing. (10% bank discount+2k discount during lighting sale+1k cash back) Now About Delivery Experience -> Horrible. Order got lost during transit and after much request and followup Amazon ordered a new product for me at no additional cost. When the product did come after about 12 days, the delivery people were dropping the product box (which was again entirely sub-standard packing without any amazon boxing) as if it was a bag of cement.About the product ->Pros:1. A True All-in-One Laser Printer. If you do research before buying, its really hard to get every feature in a same printer. This is one such rare printer where you will get almost every feature which any average user can think of.2. The most useful feature among all is ofcourse the - Wifi & the ADF. Wifi allows you to print it from your laptop or mobile (or PC with wifi adapter). ADF allows you to copy documents by feeding them automatically. It saves a LOT of time than the conventional flatbed scanning and copying.3. It has Duplex Printing thus allowing to save time and paper both easily4. Setting up is easy just install using Drivers from CD provided or from the Website of Brother Printer and following the steps. Remember to update firmware as well.5. The Input tray is closed-type and can hold 250 pages6. At the risk of getting Warranty Void, Cartridge can be refilled as told by many. Haven't done it yet as I have just bought but YouTube is full of videos showing how to do it using any 3rd party toner powder.7. Fast and Decent Printing and Copying. Good Scanning as well.Cons:1. Costly. If compared to other brands it is costly. Toner and Drum are costly as well. But it has all features so I think its value for money.2. Cartridge cannot be refilled without getting Warranty Void. Brother Printers should provide Official Toner Powder for Refilling if not 3rd party ones.3. Delicate and a little flimsy. Quality of plastic is ok but parts are so delicate inside and out that you doubt about its durability.4. Drawing high electricity and hence cannot be used on UPS or even on most house-Inverters5. Wifi Setting up is glitchy and re-setting it up is a headache6. Noisy7.  No duplex Scanning. Only Duplex Printing. Thus while copying no use of auto-duplex feature. Auto-Duplex work only when printing.Verdict ->  If you get it within 15-16k ...go for it...Value for Money, fast and Heavy Duty Laser Printer"
5,It's Awesome.This Multifunction Printer is superb for Professionals. Printing speed and quality is really awesome and all other features add cherry on the cake.Packing of the product was fantabulous. Really well pracked with all sort of precautions taken.
1,I am an advocate by profession - this printer is not meant for advocates who requires to print pages on both the sides only on legal size papers. This is useless for me now. I am ready to sell it for half rate and the product is in warranty.
5,"I've ordered this multi function device for my home need and it does a fantastic job. Mostly I am using it for my kid's school assignments. The print quality, duplex printing option, Copy & scan function, Admin tool, etc is simply superb. It's easy to unpack, easy to install. The quality of the print is so neat. Device does not heat up too much and it's noise free operation. Wireless printing option is the added advantage because of which I can place the printer wherever I want and not necessarily in my working table.Initially I had some trouble in setting up the scanner function (it's my bad that I have used WiFi router's different frequency band in my laptop and in the printer so the scan was not working). I did not have time to explore by reading the [online] manuals so I casually emailed the customer care team just in case if they can send me a reply. Surprisingly, within 2 hours I got a call from them and they have assisted me in screen-sharing mode of all complete set of options available in all functions, the features, setting up various printing options, etc. It was like a one simple online demo. I am super happy and satisfied with this purchase. I will definitely recommend."
1,"U can't use without problem, regular problemsDefectives: adf reader stucks, line come on print out page, images come black, repair man from company can't solve problemAdvantages: super connecting WiFi, scan is good , customer care giving good service"
5,"Everything good except wifi direct printing from mobile.All type of printing and coping features works wellTakes 10-15 seconds while startup and then prints very fast.Bought only 10 days before so cant say about durability.Brother iprint &scan app on android is very very slow to work with while printing.I used many hp deskjets and inktank printers, all gave me mental tortures time to time  but this printer looks like my real friend i was looking for."
4,"First of all my reasons of buying this printer: (a) I don't print a lot; the inkjet and ink tank printer head clogs up if not used regularly (b) I hardly print colour but when I do, I wish quality (c) I wanted full networking - Ethernet/Wireless (d) I wanted ADF for scanning/copying and auto duplex printing. This printer ticked all requirements.The printer arrived today (20-Sep-2020). This is my very first observations review. I will update after 4-6 months.  The print quality is superb as with most laser printers.[A] Packaging & Unpacking: Printer comes with toner in sealed bag, USB cable, the main guide + CD ROM in a pouch, and very neatly packed in the huge box. It had sticker tapes to prevent movement of parts. The quick instruction sheet (A1 size) had neat explanation. There were no issues while unpacking. I installed the toner cartridge in a zilch. The printer is nearly 10 kg and must be ""installed"" at a fixed place - fairly heavy. It is bulky too like most laser printers.Rating: 5/5.[B] Setup and installation: The printer comes with a CD ROM. Most laptops today don't have a CD-ROM drive. Not a big issue. I downloaded the s/w from Brother website. I wanted to connect the printer over ethernet. I am fairly competent at networking having setup my complete home network with cable model, wifi router, wifi repeater, a NAS, assigning static IP addresses to important devices, etc. Printer must have a static IP address. I connected the printer via ethernet cable expecting automatic recognition and DHCP address assignment. But I had trouble figuring this out. I could finally enable the Wired Networking on. I enabled Wireless as well and manually set that up. All this one has to on the printer, using menu and +/- and OK keys. It is tedious.[C] Usage. I was able to print from laptop with no issues once the printer was setup. I have heard about the ""wake up from sleep"" issue. I did not face this issue either. After a good 45 minutes, I printed another page, the printer did take time to wake up but it was not showing offline. Maybe because I have to networked via ethernet. I could scan a legal size page using the ADF - no issues. I was facing this issue with my older Epson L210 printer.[D] Print from mobile. I was able to print from Samsung M30 and M31 with absolutely no issue. No ""wake up"" problem. The small irritating issue is that paper size defaults to ""Letter"" in mobile print option. But it is a mobile phone issue.[E] Amazon delivery: Great as always. Delivered in one day in spite of COVID issues.So far, I am fairly pleased. I am docking 1-star off for installation difficulty."
5,"Awesome quality printer under 16 to 17 k.. Best product from brother. I use various printer from various company,but this one is the best.. Thanks amazon and brother"
1,Performance very bad! Lines appearing while scanning & paper getting stuck after just two to three Printouts! Waste of time & money!Pls send your experienced engineer to set it up properly this Sun 10th June!
5,We are using this totally good. Compare with other brands it's 90 present dust free.
1,I strongly recommended you all dont buy very poor product. i purchase it before a month and motherboard changed(Installed  DCP-L2540DW instead of DCP-L2541DW)..Its Very big lie..
1,"*WARNING*: Amazon does not accept returns on this product. If you see the return button option, it will not accept it, rather the call will go to Amazon customer service which will say that returns are not possible. So the return button is highly misleading. Once you buy, you are going to be stuck with this product.As for the printer: It's problematic when a bygone era product is disguised as ""WiFi"" printer. Setup of WiFi is torturous. Connecting is painstakingly difficult. Keep the connection on is chore. The printer randomly goes to sleep mode.  WIFI once connected, forgets the connection, you have to go through the whole process again. Who have designed this monstrosity?If you are thinking that this is a WiFi printer: It's not easy to use the WiFi!Pros: Seems well made from outside. Test print had good quality. That is the only pro.Cons are many:WiFi printing is a hilarious joke. Not possible for average user, i would say difficult for even a little tech savy user.WiFi printing by Android is very difficult and does not work fast. If you want 5 copies, printer will keep displaying recieving data for eons, and then print one. The next one will then start ' recieving data' for a while and print. I was wrinting this review, and for being silent for a 5 mins the printer printed the 5th copy.Brother customer service in Pune: 3 phone numbers, none of them working.Brother customer service number : call any time you are 10th in the line.I tried to solve the problem by diving deep in my router settings, YouTube videos, internet forums etc. However can a average person have time to do this? Also why should I do this in the first place. I paid more that 17k to do hours of search?I have never reviewed a product this badly.And I can't even return this."
5,This is an absolutely great network printer for a small or medium sized office. It does duplex printing and will print on A4 or Legal Sized paper amongst other options. It has a nice large toner store so it will go for a long while before needing a refill and it does auto scanning as well as photocopying. I haven't had to get the ink refilled yet so I don't know how easy or cumbersome that is or how well that works.It's definitely better than anything I've used from HP or Canon.Note: Do check online about disabling sleep mode because some people have complained about that. When it goes to deep sleep if you give a print command it won't print unless you go to the printer and wake it up. I disabled it and I haven't had any issues.
4,"Firstly, since I was confused, this printer can handle legal size paper- print, copy and scan.Easy to set up the printer. Wireless is a bit tough to set, but once you're done, it works perfectly. Prints are great including the ones on Legal Size Paper. Scanning could have been faster, but can't complain much at this price. Photocopy is absolutely hassle free. ADF works great. I'll update the review after exhausting the first cartridge."
4,In with WiFi connecting my model is DCP L-2541DW..but it showing in display DCP L- 2540...Pls.clarify this..and there is no hologram to check the item whether it is zenune product or not....and one hook is not fitted correctly.... Pls give clarity... Item arrived in time...good service....
5,"Best printer. Much better than hp or samsung. There is no other feature left  other than color printing which a printer can have. It has adf, wireless printing and scanning that works flawlessly, copying and print speed is the best at 30ppm. Very easy to use nad setup. It has a very good range of wifi connectivity.  Got it for just rs.12000 in amazon great india festival."
3,"The print quality is about average, when compred to a simple HP 1020 printer.The speed of copying is very fast - photocopy is great. The speed when printing over wifi from iphone is slow, however from macbook or pc is as fast as usb (almost).Looks like its heavy duty stuff. The auto document feeder works flawlessly so far.The screen is dot matrix. I was expecting a more user friendly coloured lcd screen , like you get on inket brother printers. The options are hard to get and toggle with as its like a calculator screen which is outdated.So i like it , it does the job, and is sturdy. It also has a good deal of storage for sheets , so u dont have to refill paper too often."
4,Print quality is great. It is quite easy to install but if you are a non techie person it might me a bit tough. There no wireless printing issue. If you want to get the best wireless connection you need to set it up with a computer. It’s a great printer for its price. It is go to printer is you are a home user who prints 5to 10 pages per month as the the is no issue of ink drying like inkjet printer.
1,"Worse after sale service by Amazon,seller ,brand.Installation specifically written free of cost still brand ( brother) charging 500+ gst for installation n demo.Inspite complaints to Amazon n seller Neither of two concern about it. Amazon wants we to make complaints , writing mails instead self action.if owner of Amazon is viewing this my review please get into it on property to avoid negative publicity of Amazon.This is my last purchase from Amazon.Thanks..."
5,At this price point this is simply a wonderful printer with Wireless as well as Duplex feature. The only challenge is the LCD screen which is too small so installing the printer on the WLAN is bit of challenge especially when it comes to typing in the WLAN password. One needs to use the arrow keys provided on the right of the screen to navigate through the keyboard one charachter at a time.Barring this installing this printer on the wireless network was a breeze and hassle free.
1,"The photocopy machine (Brother DCP-L2541DW) which we have purchased from Amazon India, that said machine is damaged and poor quality."
2,"I bought this printer thinking its good tech and is wifi printing enabled, but the printers wifi settings constantly gives trouble. Everytime, we have to call customer service which charges money for every visit despite being in the first year of warranty. Better to go with companies like HP that are mass printers and don't give these problems"
5,"Earlier I gave a good review of the product but I was proven completely wrong. Printer needed service 3 times in 6 months for the same problem. Service engineer attended every time promptly, opened up the printer, scraped a few electronic points using a screwdriver and got it working. After the last service, there was no go. it still does not work and is in warranty. More so, Brother India senior management does not respond to emails nor do they take action. Avoidable, that all I would say."
5,"Amazing Japanese build quality. Easy to set up and use with minimalistic buttons. Its a black and white printer and does its job well. As long as you do not have children with heavy art project requirements, then then this is the perfect home home office printer for a working professional."
3,"It s a reasonably decent multifunctional printer and operates alright. However, do not buy if you want to connect wirelessly. The wireless network configuration and the connectivity are very unreliable and do not work for more than a few hours. You will have to repeatedly reconfigure the network configuration by selecting your Wifi Network SSID and entering the password/key using a hard to use interface."
5,"Great quality prints and very efficient system overall. If I get this on a discount, iTunes completely worth the purchase. I've been a HP user for many years, and I was fed up or changing printers and paying for expensive cartridges. Brother does a great job overall. I may update my review after one year of use. So far it has heen working really smooth."
3,"Print quality is nice but have to face lot of jerks for the installation. Setting up of port via switching on both Wifi button on the printer and WPS button on the router doesn't work and had to install through brother support. Moreover, if would need a copy of one side and two sides, the process is herculine and not automatic where I felt a lot of pain."
1,"don't buy this printer there have some technical issue like1, when we use refile cartage printer showing replace toner anytime on display and PC too where printer setup software installed.2, printer going on sleep mode after 1 hour,  and if printer in sleep mode printer not taking command for printing and scanning too after rebooting you can use again3, Cheques printing mode not in this printer, you can't print cheques4, technical service support also not good.5, You can't use Refiled cartage with in Warranty period. if you used refilled cartage Brother not give you service free service relented printing quality issue."
2,Well they advertise it as with wi fi printer but it's wi fi capabily hardly work. It rarely can work flawlessly on wi fi. Installing driver using wi fi is a hit or miss. Mobile app is DAMN slow and impossible to our practically.Please note that I am absolutely comfortable with setting up technical stuffs and I do understand how such devices work.
1,"After installing this printer, my Modem now only allows one device at a time to connect to wifi broadband.Earlier it used to allow multiple devices to connect.Otherwise there is no issue with this printer. It can be a bit slow in copying data over wireless from mobile but that is not an issue for me"
4,"I have been using this printer for 3 months, The print quality is awesome sometimes papers stuck for 1 sided prints but except that issue I didn't feel any bad thing about this product,I thought it would acan legal size papers but it doesn't, overall good product ."
5,"I bought the Brother DCP L2541DW laser printer a few days back. I am really impressed by its performance. This is my first Brother product, and I was really apprehensive to switch brands because I have been a fan of another brand for many years. However, my experience with Brother multifunction printer amazed me. The quality, ease of use and intuitive features are some of the advantages that I have noticed. It has wi-fi, auto duplex printing and many other features. If you own a small business or if you are a home user who has lot of print, scan, photocopy requirements, I would definitely recommend this Brother printer. It is affordable and easy to use. If you are a bit tech savvy, you can set it up yourself."
3,"The print quality does not Look like a Laser print quality , it is more likely a inkjet printer quality .Dissatisfied with the feedback. Just make sure if you want to invest such a huge amount for a inkjet type of printing ."
4,A bulky printer. The toner last for about 1600 prints only. And a replacement cost RS 3500/- Quite expensive. After sales service is poor. They are not prompt and take their own time to resolve the issues.
1,"While printing on a letterhead there are weird artifacts all over the paper. The service technician told us that this is ""normal"" as the printer is a ""hot roller"" one, whatever that means. His solution was not to print on letterheads but only on plain paper.We are going to take further action against this."
4,I have two printers variant one of is HP brand M126NW and another one is this DCP-L2541DW these both are like similar but BROTHER one is best with good connectivity and quality even speed is super as compare with hp one go with it blindly if u really need good printer .Order with Amazon always best Thanks to amazon service for bring this on time
5,"Perfect. ADB and dual side printing is awesome.Just one problem , it cant hold more than 14 to 15 pages print in continuous printing it starts falling off so you have to manually remove many time printing large documemt."
5,The best multifunction BW laser printer in the class when compared to HP MFP126nw and the canon pixma. It has auto duplex printing and the ADF is a great option to have. Can scan upto 35 sheets very fast.
4,I was looking for scanner and printer for home usage (for occasional printing). I decided the hp 2131 which was coasting around 3100 but shortly it became out of stock. So I went for this one and it costed me 3300 on freedom sale.Prints are clear and also the scanning quality is good I scanned my brother's college id card it was clear . Speed is also good and it is quite lightI will post full review after more testing.
4,"Good printing.good working.But,ink problem.....So,sad...This is good product."
3,"HP Printer is very good, no doubt and a buy at the price. The only problem is the ""loss-leader pricing"" of the replacement cartridges which become uneconomical in the long run..."
1,"I won't recommend this. Hardly it worked, it's not at all taking papers for print. Waste of money."
5,"Nice product. As usual printing cost will be high, though i bought it for scanning purpose. Okay for a4 size paper scanning but can't handle a3 or larger. At 300 dpi b/w scanning takes approx 10 second."
1,"Printer catridge 805 not available anywhere including hp store, without catridge the printer is idle no use.please don't cheat people like this.If the product has no support from its manufacturer please don't list it."
1,"Waste of money. Because I had printed around 75 pages with black and white,by that time ink is totally completed. And i didn't find 805 ink cartridges anywhere. Till now ......."
3,"HP All-In-One Printer price is very attractive but running cost of ink cartridges is very high.Scanning is good quality but can scan only one page at a time & you need a separate file binder software to merge all files in single document.Now coming to cost- (discounts can be available occasionally)Printer HP 2131 costs close to Rs 2,300 (under discount offers)It uses HP 803 Ink cartridge.B/w cartridge costs Rs 702 & colour cartridge costs Rs 836B/w cartridge can print around 60 pages for Rs 702 & colour cartridge can print max 40 pages for Rs 836thus cost of single print is Rs 11 Rs/page (B/W) & 21Rs/Page (Clr)HP's claims for number of pages are under economy mode & under lab test conditions - actual user will get above stated numbersrefill kits are available at half prices of original cartridges but quality of colour prints will be compromised.Thus recommended to purchase only for occasional users with low usage.Not cost effective for regular & heavy users.Please also check my review for HP Deskjet 2135 for cost per printYou can encourage me to write further reviews by hitting YES button :)"
4,Printer is good. Scan and print quality also good. But setup takes more time to understand the product and installation. I did myself and it's working fine. Thank you Amazon for the good product.
1,A very bad product. I can't imagine HP is selling such a part printer wherein the cost of one print out is almost 10 bucks. The ink cartridges are not even able to print 100 pages and cost of cartridge is 1000 bucks so it's cheaper to get print out from the shop then buy this piece of junk.We even went to the HP store to sort out this but they have no clue. ( Or sometime ignorance is bliss)
2,"Fantastic delivery by Amazon. BUT STRANGE, was not in normal Amazon packaging???USB cable faulty, careful study shows a duplicate as no ceramic finish, plus pins are not in line.Installation is done by me using old cable, printer working fine no problems there.WHY IS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO EXCHANGE CABLE ONLY? don't want to return whole product waste time, and had disposed of the original packing.Strongly recomend anyone, not to accept product if not in amazon packing, think this was my problem.however was in hp packing and sealed, but who knows who is responsible? all i need is a cable, price on amazon approx 1500, printer cost approx 3000. ""crazy"""
2,"Good decent printer. But difficult to find replacement cartridges. Made huge mistake by buying this printer. If you doubt me, check in Amazon for HP 805 cartridge. Even HP website don't have them. I can't even return the printer. When cartridge dries up, I can't buy original cartridges. May be have the printer as show piece."
1,"Worst printer. Just to check, gave a print for 50 black and white pages. The original cartridge got over. Original 805 model B&W cartridge would cost you around 800/-. Which means one black and white print will cost you 16/-. U can go to a photo shop and get a print on canvas at this price. Worst printer. I regret as there is no return only replacement. Please don't get cheated."
5,"FIrst of all a big thanks to Amazon for quick delivery (within 2 days). Also thanks to the delivery boy for his behavior and politeness. Really impressed.Now coming to the main topic.  I got HP Deskjet 2131 Printer at just ₹2699 during republic day sale.It is very easy to install the printer alongwith its cartridges. Its looks are superb. Printing quality is also great (I have attached the snapshot of sheet that I printed just!).  The scan feature is just rocking because it works very fast. But the printing quality should be improved.So friends, go for HP Deskjet 2131 printer without any tension."
1,"waste  of the money to buy this printer, the link will just dry within 2 weeks if you are not using it, the new cartridge cost is very high , you buy 2 cartridge at the same cost of printer, the cost of printer ink is more then human blood. better use your own blood for printing it will be much cheaper"
1,Per page is too costly approx 16 to 40 Rupees per page do not recommend for homeIts better print the pages from outside market.Also shared in the Facebook and recommend my friends and colleagues do not purchase this printers .
1,"Defective product, not able to print a single page. Carriage struck in the sides of the printer loudly. Now I have to contact HP service. Very painful process"
5,"Got New and good working Product,if you don't want to buy cartridges you can use ink to refill the cartridges,ink can be found in local stores.ink is 50% cheaper than cartridges and there is a lot of link in the bottles"
1,Don't ever buy this printer...instead go for ink tank ones...although this one is cheaper the ink cartridges will cost you the same amount in which u can buy a new printer again... not worthy from such a big brand HP...they made the printer price less but kept cartridge price the highest among all of its range...simply fooling customers..even cannot use any other cartridge and refilling was also complex.. sometimes works sometimes not :(
1,"Cartridge is very expensive....not recommended to buy this product .Not Cost effective at all ,Priniting from local shop will be cheaper than printing at home"
5,"All in One printer  which will scan,print and copy(Xerox) 👌👌😀I have done 100 printouts in 1 day, still ink level showing full.Photos are printing very nice.Xerox copies also giving good print.Scan we can do using hp smart app downloading in laptop/pc"
1,"I got a second hand product  the product was opened and on side the barcodes were torn and then everything was just rapped with a tapeI always thought when I read review that ""it would not happen to me I will get a good product"" but here we areAlso the main box was opened and over it there was a plastic tape put to show as if it was original seal u can make out with just the packingThe product looked as of the person has been using it and he soled itPlz think about this when u buy this product"
4,"Build quality is great, the design and colour looks great, printing cost is little high as it Is an inkjet printer so if you need a printer like for occasional use like in project time then you should go for it, else go for laser If only blank and white print is needed, else inktank, also keep a track of this printers price, as it keeps going up and down when i ordered it costed me around 3.9k but somedays later it was 3.7k so keep checking if you can wait for like 1 week or more then order from the official hp site, there you'll get it for more reasonable price, also the no external packaging was done or given in this printer which is bad, what if it got damaged during shipping, it would result in the seller losing money and also I'll end up losing my time and maybe money if i found the damage later on like internal or if i don't have a recording of me unboxing it and found it damaged, something like that."
4,Nice product but printing price is very high. Don't buy this product because its ink cost is very high . But in home use it's OK. So one star missing
5,I luv this i really luv the colour print its exactly the same we are about to wonder.... But im very sad when i come to know that the price of ink catridge is too high. Only we can take 100 copies using one catridge its price is nearly 1000rs. Im disappointed
1,Very poor product replacement needed immediately..no parts available & it’s a very of so let product
5,"Printer is good. Printing quality is remarkable. Cons- Ink exhausted very fastly.If you can arrange ink from any shop or online, compromising a slightly degraded quality, its printing would be much cheaper. But if you are bound to buy cartridge every time ink is low, it would definitely become an expensive deal on long run."
1,"Bought this printer on 19.08.20.After printing perfectly almost 10/12 pages , it is not working. Customer care suggests to visit a nearby service centre. If this is the after sales service, then I would definitely never ever opt to buy an headache with a handful of money."
1,"I sincerely regret purchasing this product. .there is a major flaw in design it self. Only from one side paper support is there in the tray. So there is no proper  ""driven in "" for paper into the printer. It is drawn into the printer  from unsupported side it goes on an angle. So print comes as spoiled. I talk to Amazon person they told only replacement is there for this printer ,no money back(may be because HP aware about the flaw in design) , they connect to HP support they told they will arrange a technician that day itself, but no one come for service until now(3 days). I don't know why a reputed company like HP is selling these type of products of no use & keeping their after sales support very bad. When you purchase a printer from HP ,please think twice"
3,Printer cost is low but ink cartridge cost is too high.
1,"Changing my review from good to bad. Because in just 7 months the printer started showing problems . Claiming warranty takes forever which FYI means a customer support executive to just hear your complain with nothing done in real.. The ink leaks . Printer throws out blank papers even after and keeps on automatically restarting. It doesn't even recognize new cartridge. Pathetic printer. DO NOT BUY IT IF ITS FOR DAILY USE. BECAUSE ONCE IT STOPS WORKING IT IS GOING TO SPOIL YOUR DAY, EVERYDAY"
5,Nice printerScanning quality is very goodColor printing is very good
4,I BOUGHT IT RS 2900/- ONLY ....THIS IS VALUE FOR MONEY ...WE CAN PRINT THE DOCUMENT THROUGH MOBILE PHONE ALSO WITH THE HELP OF OTGTO CONNECT THIS PRINTER WITH MOBILE PHONE FIRST WE HAVE TO INSTALL HP SMART PRINTER APP AND HP PRINTER APP FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE THAN WE CAN EASILY PRINT PHOTOS & DOCUMENTS FROM MOBILE PHONE ETC.
3,Product is good for the budget. Unable to get the specified 805 ink cartridges in any online sites including Hp store.Printer is ideal now without the relevant cartridges.
5,"stylish, good product, excellent printing quality and suitable price."
1,Cartridges are very very very little life...🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴Poor productDont buy...I am thinking to make the video..Where I throwing this printer from 5th floor..- 10 star
1,This product is a scam because it’s ink consumption is very high and demands constant change in cartridge and this results in excess expense. I have used this printer for hardly 2 weeks and I have changed the ink cartridge twice already (max 20-25 pages printed)Please don’t get tempered towards the product because of its brand and cheaper price. I hope my reviews helps both the seller and the buyer in their respective ways!!P.S - I look for the seller to contact me and compensate for this fault product.
1,There is No ink available for the product i have been sitting without ink from past 1 week wat is the use of buying such product
4,The scanning resolution is perfect and printing output is also good. The only problem lies with paper input tray. while pulling the paper inside sometimes the paper gets jammed.
3,"I got this one primarily for scanning the old photos and save them in PC. It does it's job. Nothing to complain about scanner. About the printing, good for few prints but really this is not a heavy duty printer. For serious printing and printing too many papers, go for some higher version or a laser jet. This printer is just for scanning and printing few papers and not for heavy use.Print quality: good but not for heavy useScan: Good and it does it's job.Durability: not that good for heavy printing, good for scanning. Body of the maching is not that heavy and not that sturdy.Installing: very easy to install, nothing special engineering really needed."
5,"after sales service is pathetic, service center in faridabad is pathetic, useless service center, i had to wait for 25 days for replacement of defective cartridge. after sales service has to be improved, need to improve service centers.HP 2332 Deskjet Colour Printer is Superb, Fantastic, Excellent, very nice looks."
5,Excellent product with good well packed... Very very satisfied.... Print catridge cost also lower than any ink advantage catridge.... BLINDLY GO FOR THIS PRINTER ONLY FROM AMAZON AS IN FLIPKART FAKE BRAND SOLD BEWARE...
5,"Easily the best printer in this price range. Bought it for 3.1kHuge upgrade over my old printer. Fast printing speed, no smudges, extremely good print quality. The scan quality is also extremely good. Scanned images have proper color ration and reproduction.The setup took a little more time than expected. Other than that, awesome machine."
3,"A little about this printer:1) Build quality: 3/5 - flimsy and prone to paper jams if paper is not inserted carefully.2) Scan quality: 4/5 - really impressed with this one.3) Print quality: 3/5 - OK for casual use. Not great, not bad either.4) Software and drivers: 3/5 - installs a lot of unnecessary plugins, which cannot be unselected during installation. You have to manually remove each one after installation (e.g FTP plugin, Dropbox plugin, etc.)5) Cartridges: 1/5 - no surprises here... 6 prints in, and the provided cartridges' ink levels have already dropped to 75%.6) Additional points - unlike Canon, HP has its own Android app to print from a mobile phone via USB OTG cable, so that's a plus.Since I only use a printer/scanner for emergencies (2-3 prints a month), I always go for the cheapest option, which in this case was this one for Rs. 3099/-. The only difference between HP DeskJet 2331 and 2332 is the colour (the former is violet-white and this one is grey-white) so grab whichever is cheaper. Inkjet printers are a scam in general - the printers are cheap but the cartridges are crazy expensive and the ink runs out before you can say the word 'PRINT'. If you're the type who prints a lot, better go for a laser printer. They are more cost efficient in the long run."
5,Excellent product for home use....you can print around 120pages in black and white...and 100pages in colur...if you are rich then use new cartridges....all the times....but if you are not then...buy hp oroginal inks.....and fillup the cartridges...each time...with injection.....this will let you to print 6000 pages in 600Rs ...wherelse if you use cartridges...then you can print only 120pages in 600 rupeesThank you.
1,This was the worst printer i have ever ordered.  Please dont buy this product at all. This product's ink cartridge finishes in less than month and with less than 100 prints. And if you buy a new cartridge then it will cost approx 1300 rs if bought of hp. That means it will cost approx half of the printer. Which means 1300 rs for just 100 prints. I would rather get it photocopied from a shop instead. 13rs per page . And I'm also very disappointed in hp co. Which is producing this product.  And  please consult any printer seller about this product and you definitely won't find any advantage.Its totally not worth the money .
5,"If you are doing regular printing or official work then I would not recommend this, as this does not have ADF.But if you print sometimes or occasionally like me for admit cards. train / plane tickets or other docs, then go for it. It has what it says, print, scan and copy features both color and black & white, I havee done all, no issues and comes at much lower price and that too from HP. So it is a good deal overall for home use.Before using it make sure to remove all tapes inside as well as outside (there will be a manual for it in package so don't worry), slide the shifter where you put blank pages as it is not adjusted for A4 sized papers, load the cartridges properly (comes with the printer and easy to load as well)  and register the product & install the software & drivers for it from HP site."
1,"The page started getting stuck from the very first day. Not a very good product from hp.As if having this printer is not bad enough the customer services sucks. It is like adding insult to injury. There is no way to contact seller to fix the issue, only channel of communication was Amazon's canned response chat, and that was pathetic as it didn't even give me option to list my issues.It just kept on cycling through the same responses.I'd give negative reviews if I could. AVOID AT ALL COSTS - NOT ONLY THIS PRINTER BUT THE SELLER AS WELL."
3,The look of the printer was great but the connection was vry poor when iwas connected to the laptop or phone . Other than the connection the remaining was great .
1,"Don't buy HP products. Learnt the hard way.Firstly this product will not work with latest mac version, at least I could not get it to work after spend 3 hours trying everything possible in hp site and other internet suggestions. HP customer care is absolutely pathetic. They will receive the call and pretend that they are not able to hear. So, forget any support from HP.Now amazon will say the the OS mentioned in the product is windows 10.7 so any other OS is your problem. There are answers here telling this product works with mac and even in HP site it is mentioned this series does not need a driver for mac (mac is preinstalled with the drivers) and can print/scan. But I doubt it works with the latest mac OS, maybe it works with older versions.My suggestion is avoid this unless you use windows 10.7 as you will not get any help from Amazon or HP.Also, preferably buy a wireless printer as that way you can try printing from your ipad or mobile other than you laptop, but for this wired dumbbox there's not much to do"
1,Product is not installing in my laptop. And neither I am able to replace the product nor I am getting any technical assistant help.
4,"I just received my printer today. After printer set up and driver installation,  I am providing my review.  I am very happy with the packaging,  printing and xerox quality. Though scanning quality is okay, can't say it superb. To conclude,  good printer at INR 3,099/-."
1,"Order was delivered in a day by Amazon. Great work. But the printer installation is so 90s work. You need to physically go to HP site, download drivers and complete the installation. Who does all this in 2021? But here, HP wants you to waste 2 hrs to do all of this. And then too, you cannot be sure that copies would be printed. Took me another 15 min to figure out why the hell scanner is working but printer is not- inspite of installing everything correctly as per the process. Absolutely disgusting. Pls don't go for this. Invest in buying somehting non-HP."
1,The printer is worst.And not returnable or refundable.My 3100RS are wasted.Please whoever it is of you are reading this comment I request you to not buying it.Go for Epson or Canon or Brother printers instead of this.
4,"Works fine for the price I paid as an entry level printer . Needed to do a few prints during WHF and supports that perfectly. Once you get the drivers downloaded and setup it works fine . Need to restart the laptop from time to time when prints don’t go through but I think it’s a common software issue I’ve faced with another HP deskjet printer tooI had to order ink cartridges again as the ones supplied are just for starting and don’t have a lot of ink , so if you plan on printing a lot it makes sense to order that when your buying the printer"
1,"I wanted a printer for occasional use that would be economical also , so basis the description went ahead with this one. It says it comes with a preloaded cartridge ( black and colour) and can print 100 pages with one cartridge ( black ). I printed max 15 pages in first use ( 12 black and white and 3 colour). The next time I had to print something was a month later and the cartridge was out of ink already even though the levels were still showing the same as before. By the way the ink levels were showing low even when the printer was installed after delivery. I didn’t have the time to fight with Amazon for that so just let it go. It’s the worst ever experience and so disappointing to see Hp and Amazon both get away by selling such a shoddy product and also cheating the customer by sending almost empty catridges with a new product ( also doubtful because the printer had some dust marks but Amazon wasn’t ready to exchange and wanted to dump another one which we denied ). Please don’t buy this printer from Amazon and if you do please ensure to check if the cartridge is full."
5,Nice printer easy to use . Just install drivers before using in laptop . Got for only 3100 . I like the product as it is best for home usage but yes it is going to little bit costly in term of refilling.
1,"Don't buy the printer, very bad experience over last two months.Update after using for few months:Print quality is getting worse despite running clean and alignment often with new cartridges.Both color and black printer cartridges cost about Rs 2500 each time since the default one that comes with printer doesn't last longer. You will end up spending several thousands of rupees on cartridges alone since this printer wastes ink and lot of pages with misprints as well as doesn't give good yield.I have been using several models of HP printers for more than 25 years.Doesn't work with Mac OS, works with Windows 10 only but takes a while to get the printer installed.Doesn't print anything some times.When it decided to print it takes forever to print a page most of the time.Doesn't get connected most of the time.Can't print resolutions above 300 most of the time.Haven't come across such basic printer in last 25 years."
1,"The product isn't good at all. They don't have a return policy, it takes lifetime to print a copy incase it decides to print or else it doesn't majority of the times."
4,"Writing review after a month. The print quality is good for general printing and also for photo printing on glossy papers. I printed almost 80 black and white pages and about 10 color pages. Yeah, the black cartridge is empty now. And by watching YouTube videos I refilled my black cartridge , with Aprodot ink (cost around Rs. 120) and it worked well. (Just put ~3 mL of ink in cartridge hole by a syringe). The printer costs me Rs. 3300.Overall good printer ... better if you buy a wireless printer else it is awesome. And don't believe if anyone says refilling a cartridge don't work , as long you would take necessary precautions (just watch YouTube video) it will work fine.JUST AN ADVICE - Cover your printer with cloth whenever you aren't using it :)"
4,It's nice product for commercial as well as for private use...I personally used it...worth for money...but it is china made...and there is no bluetooth or wifi connectivity...so I feel this 2 disadvantages...but overall very nice product..go for it
1,"This is about the HP AIO Desk jet printer  2332, I bought on Amazon  on 16th of Nov 2020.The claimed printer print yield is 120 pages Black & White.  Now, on 2nd of Dec'20, little over two weeks, I have so far printed about 55 pages , only text (no graphics so far) and Black and white.. and the printer reports no Black Ink.50 Pages per cartridge is atrocious; outright loot and doesn't even meet the claimed product specifications as per HP (120 pages). My print need is about 150-200 pages per month, mostly B&W.. and @ 750 per Black cartridge, every month I cannot invest Rs 1500 to Rs 2150 on Black cartridges alone... the Printer cost itself if Rs 3,000/-. HP IS LOOTING  CUSTOMERS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. But this is too much...@ claimed print yield of 120 pages @ cartridge price of Rs 750, PP Print cost is 6.25. a local xerox company offers service at Rs 6 per page. What use is owning the printer?.stop buying HP anymore..  Loyalty doesn't pay"
4,"First I got the message that the order is been delivered but in actual it's not then I raised a request for return since there is no option for complaint on the product delivery apart from phone number Hence Amazon team quickly resolved my query and then the printer is delivered within 4 hours that time I thought I got trapped but it gets resolved quickly Thanks for that. As of now, it is working as expected let's hope for the best in the future."
4,Mainly bought it for the scanner. Cartridges become dry if you don't use regularly. Mobile can't be connected to the printer. Every time you need a PC/Laptop for printing or scanning. But for copy/xerox you can use it directly.My advice is to go for a wireless one.
4,"It does what it says. It prints well, scans well & also copy well too. Its super easy to install. As the price is less, can't complain much but the printing cost is too high. Its good for occasional printing. I tried by printing color photos to glossy papers but the quality is not that good. Overall good experience."
4,I got 2 Cartridges with the Printer...one Black and One color plus I purchased one additional color Cartridge with offer...print scan and copy is very good quality for home use but for business use more good quality printer may be required...easy software installation and cartridge installation...Overall good Home use Printer in the market
1,If there is no internet availability the scanner wont scan even though the printer is DIRECTLY connected to desktop.  The software hangs multiple times. Something urgent to print or scan then expect delays. All works fine till you reach your 2nd or 3rd cartridge then all these troubles start for software hangs
1,"Started malfunctioning from day one; Amazon replaced it, and the new unit has now started malfunctioning in less than 3 weeks time. As the return window is closed, we are unable to get the same replaced."
2,"Never ever purchase any product from amazon. They hardly entertain refund request. After complaining the issues, they will trouble you a lot giving various instructions for troubleshooting, will ask for images and a lot more. Only replacement is available. Flipkart is much better in this sense."
5,Value for money device..very useful and reliable if your primary requirement is scanning and low volume printing. The functionality of the HP Smart app on non-HP systems needs to be impoved.
5,"Very nice delivery.... i am impressed with the delivery quality, one of the best printer for home and small office purpose.Blindly go for this printer its best among all."
3,"Printer is good, but the cartridges are very expensive, if you want more prints go for ink tank model."
5,"The all-in-one printer is a good value for money.The only catch is, if you need to print large number of pages, inkjet is not a choice. A Laser printer would be a better choice. Laser printers are costly, but economical for heavy loads.Another thing is, at least 1 color and 1 b/w print should be given per week to avoid the ink getting dried out."
5,Produt is good.... It is better than my old same model printer.
3,Very nice prouduct for office and home but delivary is not good
5,"I am very much satisfied with HP Deskjet printer purchased a month ago. It's very useful to my limited use of personal printing requirements. Though initially I had little problem with adding it to my Laptap, with the help of Support Team I could make it without much difficult. This product is very useful for personal use and also gives Value for money."
4,"Normally it is ok, but the USB cable is loose, very loose and I had to attach it with a cellotape"
4,Good product - the refill cartridges are costly - but value for money if you can refill at home.It is good for home use - scans upto A4 and Letter sized papers.I have been using this printer for a couple of months now and satisfied with the performance.
5,"Setting up was a bit difficult, but somehow I searched for the videos online and set it up. Took print out and scanned documents, at the rate it is worth it."
1,"I bought it on 15th April, this was delivered on 23rd April 2021. Since then, I have hardly printed 15-20 pages and its USB wire is not working.Don't know whom to contact, I will try reaching out to HP, but you guys don't waste your money purchasing this.Thanks,"
1,its only  print 3 to 4 page properly then started blur printing and no option for darkness and cartarage is very costly .
1,"Printer came damaged,While installing it gave errorWich means Scanner damages,Worst customers support by canon,new product now under replacement after several call annoying support..Will not recommend anyone to purchase printer online...Really disappointing"
3,It is good only for plain paper printing. If you print on glossy paper its color spreads. Buy it only If you want to print on plain paper otherwise not.
3,Prints 500 rs notes properly but 2000 rs notes are not the right color. Not worth the money spent.
5,"Very good product,Easy Installation, scanner picture quality is very good and printer quality also very very good, useful... Thank you Canon"
1,"Got a defective piece. Very bad packaging. As soon as I got the printer and turned it on, the yellow light started blinking and I had to call the service center and they told scanner is defective when I told them the support code - 5011. They informed me that scanner is defective maybe because of manufacturing or due to delivery."
1,Useless printer. Please dont take. I got for 2k and cartridge left nothing after 30 prints or less. You will go on spending on cartridges which is 600 to 900. So printing cost around 20 to 30 for a bnw paper. Such a useless printer dont take if you got for a rupee also. You cannot fill ink only cartridges work.
4,"This printer is very light weight. For Print quality you can see the image printed on A4 size paper I have attached. I liked the print quality at such low price. Honestly if you want an all in one printer in low price you should buy this. I got the delivery today and installed the printer myself. If you'll need any assistance you can call the canon service centre their engineer will install it for you at a certain charge. It's easy to install yourself all you need to do is to read the manual, instructions carefully and follow step by step. Print speed is also ok. You'll not get a laserjet printer speed but it's completely fair with its price tag."
3,"BUT NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING ON PHOTO GLOSSY PAPER AS INKS (ALL FOUR COLORS) DOES NOT TOTALLY STICK TO THE PAPER. WE SHOULD WAIT FOR AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES BELOW THE FAST ROTATING FAN TO DRY THE PAPER. EVEN THEN IF YOU MOVE YOUR FINGER ON THE GLOSSY SHEET THE INK GETS DISTURBED AND PICTURE QUALITY LOOKS SHABBY. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING ON GLOSSY SHEETS.REST ASSURED,  FOR DAY TO DAY PRINTING THIS IS THE BEST PRINTER I HAVE USED SINCE HP 300 ALL IN ONE WHICH I PURCHASED IN 2005."
1,"Printer is cheap as of 2500,but but butCost of cartridge is 2400 approxAnd if you want to buy cartridge daily then go for small cartridge which comes with this printer I.e extra small, which even fails to print 40pagesSo cost of printing 1 paper becomes 20 to 25 per page.Also very noisy in operations.Better to spend 7000 on laser printer or inktank printer."
4,"I bought it Amazon sale for scanning the documents. Even after two years it is working well. Though printing quality is average, and it's cartridges are very expensive, but for emergency it is good, and best for scanning the documents and books. Till today I have scanned more thank 25000 pages, but no problem occurred. The only problem is that after about 1 year it's usb cable became faulty and I purchased other usb cable from a local store, and printer is working fine."
1,"This product is not working after one month of use. After using for one month, it showed cartridges ink is over, after replacement of ink, it stopped printing, on showing it to local shop, I got to know that it's chip is damaged. Complete waste of money. When I called customer care of Canon, they said this product work like this only and is poor, I am shocked with response received from Canon. Will not recommend to anyone. I just want my money back or cannon/ Amazon should replace it."
4,Very handy and light weight product but this product not comparable for photo printing
1,Installation is not free - they have taken Rs 1000 for installation - Why should they take money for first time installation
1,I am regreting after buying this price of waste.i was very happy happy while i bought this but as soon as the time come when the this printer ink got over i try to get the same in market and believe me the pg-745 xl cost me somewhere between 2500 to 2600 ah! thats the price of actual machine i simply thrown this peice of wasre in the dustbin and i rather bought a laser printer and that too b/w although that's not colour but it done the job perfectly. If you are going to buy this product buy at your own risk because at first it will be treat you good but after you buy this you will end up losing a good amount of money from your pocket.
1,The printer works fine but it's inks are very expensive. I landed purchasing more than rs.5000 worth of ink in one year. It's color cartridge only contact 1500
2,Carrying ends after 20 prints. Refilling samagra the cartridge. New cartridge costs 1000 rs each. Spanning and print quality is ok.
1,"Item not working, no option to return or replace the items .. even though replace option is showing in Amazon, it won't allow to replace request .. it will redirect to cannon service centre. But after selecting the model in ivr call, call will diconnect automatically .. not recommend to buy . No proper service alao"
5,"100% satisfied with this product. The print & scan quality is excellent. Also the printing performance is super,  printing 10 to 15 documents per minute. Really awesome, just I want to say thank you Amazon. I can't imagine how canon supply the wonderful printer in such type of budget. Rs.2300/- . Dear friends if you want to purchase a printer for home use then this is the ultimate choice, don't loss the opertunity. Go to Amazon app & order now...."
4,"I needed a printer for home use. I was looking for something basic with all the three important features that a printer should have such as Printing, Copying and scanning. And like I said I needed something basic because for home use at best you're gonna need 4-5 prints in a month usually and not more. So I found this printer which I received just today. Does it do what it says? Yes, It does  and overall it's a great product and I am quite satisfied with it's quality and features. Although the print quality could've been slightly better. Don't get me wrong overall it's a great product for it's price and comes with all the necessary accessories that you would need for a printer but the print quality is just above average. It does the job and it doesn't look bad. Just not great like you can see in other slightly expensive brands. Anyway I don't regret buying it. I still got more than what I paid for, therefore I am quite satisfied."
3,Printer installation is easy 3/5.  printing speed is 3/5. Print quality is good 4/5. But worst thing is ink cartridge is getting low soon. Just for print of 6pages in which 3 are mix black and colour. It showed me the reduction of 10% of total ink.
1,Pathetic in the very beginning... Cannot be installed as the windows can't detect the printer. Canon customer care is useless. No support on call. Gave number of a local repair agency which is not recwiving the call. Waste of money and time.
1,"Very bad product.... Complete wastage of moneyThis product is not working After using for few pages your catrage is empty . after replacement of cartridge, it stopped printing. Complete waste of money. When I called customer care of Canon, they said this product work like this only and is poor, I am shocked with response received from Canon. No warranty this product in canon service center only show in .Will not recommend to anyone. I just want my money back or cannon/ Amazon should replace it."
4,"I ordered this on 23rd October and the ink(black) was over on 3rd November. I printed just 12-15 pages in total. Either the ink cartridge was old or that’s how all the cartridges are. I’ll know once I replace the cartridge, but by then I might have to change the colour cartridge as well. All in all disappointed.I’m still giving it 4 stars because the printer itself is easy to install and use. The print quality is good, too. I am using it for home use, so maybe I’ll use it for important documents only.YET, totally annoyed with the cartridges provided."
5,Good printer.I bought it for ₹2000/- only and had got ₹700/- cashback. Overall price of the printer for me was ₹1300/- .Prints pages at ₹0.50 each. Print quality is not too good but ok for home use. I donot change ink cartridge. I just refill them at home.Scan quality is excellent.Xerox is also good.Software is also easy to install and easy to use.
3,Low cost but Not recommended.Print per page cost is high.Only you will get 25 to 30 page.Printing quality is okay.Ink will quickly drain out.Document scanning quality is not upto the mark . My passport scanning and very old document scanning quality is not good with this printer.Other Document scanning quality is acceptable.
5,Very nice product..already used the same model for 5 years and now purchased again.good for use if you have to print 8-10 pages a day..cartridge are costly but can be refilled from any refill shop by paying 50/- rupees. Not very optimistic about color print since my requirement is for black and white prints daily.But you can definitely buy it if your usage is limited
5,"It's a great experience! It's my first Printer and enjoying the experience. Ease of use. Would upload the video on You Tube and update my review. I would appreciate if any IT support is provided for installation. I struggled a lot, but finally was able to when called up the IT support.At this price, great buy. Black ink cartridge got exhausted. Got it refilled via Cartridge World. A genuine store. Great Service."
1,What a crap.my catridge is low in just 15-20 printouts.LISTEN EVERYONE.DO NOT BUY ON AMAZON INDIA ANYTHING WHICH YOU THINK YOU CAN DIRECTLY PURCHASE FROM THE VENDOR NEAR YOU OR EVEN A STORE.AMAZON FO NOT CARE IF YOUR ITEM IS BAD...I PURCHASED A PRINTER N the ink finished in no time .whether you use the printer or no you still have to replace yr ink which finishes you use or no.Amazon please sell product which can value peoples money. Atleast now when people are jobless during this pendenic.Just dont sell product ehich put people hard earned money to a waste.
5,"Product is excellent with this price,easy to install and printing.picture quality is excellent,"
5,"First, its beautiful bit delicate though!Came well within quick time and had sturdy packaging, no complaints!Easy to install. Has color and black cartidges which need to be fitted, just follow picture instructions.CD for driver installation. If your laptop doesn't have CD player such as mine (surface pro 4), just google key words and download.Once you install, go in start menu and open canon printers to scan documents.To print, its ready to use without software installation. Print quality is good.But, remember its for home use, worth for ~100 pages per month.Use judiciously!I dont know why bad reviews. Its adequate.I purchased because i badly needed scan and print of my visa and option was same day delivery. I am happy.Thank you.If you want to purchase, go ahead!If your use is heavy, buy next heavy version. For me its enough."
1,"its not working properly not even a single button works nor USB ,various noise. the very first time showing the upper black and colour ink orange light., printing apps too donot recognise it,and bluetooth is not working either.its diffective,today on sunday i got some extra time to work on it but my whole day is wasted.remove this item from amazon ,i want my refund."
1,"Please do not buy this product even if the company gives u for free. The ink if it gets over, after refilling it the printer does not work. If we buy cartridge it will be costly and the outcome cost /print does not come good also. Though it looks cheap to buy. But later you will suffer with this. Please don't buy this product and waste your 2800 RS also. Utilize that money somewhere else."
3,"I bought this very recently.  So far so good.  It is economical. We can print, copy, scan is what I liked.What I didn't like is - the  USB cable from printer to connect to external device (computer) could have been longer that what is given.  It is tough sometimes to connect with laptop or computer which is placed just a bit longer to the printer.What is missing - WiFi. Hmm, need to spend some more money for this. But it could have come for this price itself given the technology advancements so far ! I know I shouldn't expect though!I'm happy as I've been using scan and prints (less) for a while. I used it for <2months now, since last week it won't turnon now :-) Not sure of the reason.  Time to contact the customer support now  :-).If I get quick resolution in few days, then I'd update here and improve the rating ! Hence giving less rating for now!"
1,Well this all in one printer seems cool for its price but it will cost you more than you think..  The ink cartridges can print only a few pages and you need to buy new cateidges every time which costs around 400 alone..  So it will cost you too much...  There is no refilling option you will have to buy a new cateidge itself...Apart from that the scanning is good but the scanner option in there app doesn't work all the time.. It keeps saying location undeminded and stuff but if you keep trying and trying it will scan ultimately..  Well I won't recommend this.. Go buy some good product.. They might be costly but they will be worth it.
4,Got it 4 days ago . Made in Vietnam(not chinnese crap).Automatically got detected by my laptop and able to print directly .For printing from mobile using poko print app . Colour Print quality is good and can be seen in attached picture.Printer needs to be handeled carefully especislly flips at top and bottom as they look fragile .Need to check how many prints i will get before cartridges exhaust as it was one negative thing i have seen in majority of reviews .Iam going to order inkjet 100ml bottles to fill cartridges following youtube videos
3,"Cheapest printer which contain scanner and worth it for occasional use besides print cost is high than other printers per page so this printer is not  for daily use . For students and other home stuffs this printer is worth to buy. Sometimes little minor issues can be happen but it can be solved by reading manual both offline and online. The print quality is ok , not so good but for occasional use its better to don't mind it . And the service it provides at this low price is worth it for buying."
1,I received twice and both time I received a defective product. Please Don't buy this product from Amazon
1,"Printer printed hardly 40 pages in draft mode and started displaying about exhausting condition of the black ink cartridges. While describing about the product, per page printing cost was not mentioned in the advertisement. This way an important aspect of per page printing cost or out put per cartridge was hidden. Such a high cost print can not be afforded, hence I would like to return the printer and get my money back. Would suggest to mention prints per cartridges or cost per print."
1,"update, it stopped working in less than 6 months. working fine for the price but manufacturer konwingly designed printer in a way that uses little colour ink for black print which u can clearly see as shadow and also in many reviews on internet so you get out of ink early, another thing is its catridge which is around half price of the printer which is also not available easily and printer is slower than tortoise. Good for small requirement in home and office or shop."
1,"Slowest printer , After giving print option you can make a hot green tea in your electric kettle and can complete your tea..But for every print cup of tea is not good to health"
5,"At this budget it is fantastic. It is efficient and easy to use. I do not know why some people are saying it is slow. Because it is not slow. You have to set ""plain paper"" in the properties before you start printing. It is very fast. I printed 80 black and white pages in around 9 minutes. The problem is by default it selects the glossy paper and takes a hell lot of time. Obviously, if you are not printing photos, why would you select glossy paper. For document printing select plain paper and see how fast it can print! Quality of print is also great. There are three options - draft, better and best. I was happy with the draft quality. I printed 450 pages on a single day. It did not give me any trouble at all."
1,"Please don't buy this printer, the paper gets jammed each time. Amazon customer care was good, they got a new replacement printer  which worked for around 2 weeks. Again the new printer is having the same problem. I've given to hp service centre, will update you soonUpdate: hp replaced it with a new printer-another model ( working)"
5,"I am so unlucky beacause when I ordered it after that day the of the printer discresed.  Ok, I am happy to share you that I received a very good printer. I want to tell you that if your buying price range is under 5,000/- then you can buy it.  It's printng cost is medium not so high or low( 1.4  & 5 ). I buy this in 4,814/-  & my purchase date is 23/11/2020. I get this printer in three days after order in Coochbehar, West Bengal.  I install it in pc in four minites. You can also do it. I am a boy of class 8. I can do it easliy."
3,Now i understood why this printer is rated 3 star on amazonVery slow printingNot good for office purposePrint quality is okayIt takes 2-3 minute to get ready once to switch it onYou may go for this printer if you print 50-100 pages a month
1,"Had a very bad experience with both the manufacturer and Amazon. After receiving the printer I wasted by complete one day to install the printer and software as no demo was provided. Finally, when started using the printer, I came across several issues like extremely slow, paper getting stucked and printer hanged and need restart. Hence, I replaced the printer. The another printer which I received was already broken so good that I didn't had to waste my time to install. But here comes the returning issue. At first the delivery person who came to take back the return refused to take it back saying the serial number is not matching. I immediately called the customer care but they couldn't communicate with the delivery person due to language issue. This all happened in between by office meeting. Then customer care re-scheduled the return and finally the same delivery person took the printer back and thankfully Amazon refunded my amount back with no more issues."
5,"Order experience - Ordered last night, arrived today morning. Unboxed - cardboard/thermacole suffered some tear but product was intact & plastic sealed with wires & both cartridges. Plugged in tested copy and print - works like a charm.After Sales Support - Did not know how to use manual duplex (print both-side), called tech support - he guided and explained me process/steps; tried it - worked as expected. 1 hour back got a call from tech support to confirm resolution before closing ticket. Really liked it.Overall feedback - I read so many negative reviews about paper jam, ink level and issues after few days. I got concerned but as everything is working seamlessly and got great support, I feel positive. This is my second HP printer; I don't think there would be a better product with such features at this price."
1,"I have received last week due to got busy in some family function didn't get time to open it. as return/placement date  mentioned 6/Jan/21, i opened last night and  found used product delivered.1) Only cartages wrapper present in box , cartages attached in to printer , cartages should be seal packed.2) as cartages are  attached to printer it means they are used.3) No information booklet present in box.4) printer inside box is opened without any wrapping. 100% sure this product is used and then return by someone, same has delivered to me.Although its mention on order ""HP DeskJet 2335 All-in-One Ink Advantage Colour PrinterReplacement may be possible through 06-Jan-2021""Amazon saying relacment is not possible as date has been passed although replacement request raised on 6th .Better not opt for amazon for costly product and specially this seller ""Appario Retail Private Ltd"" who has delivered this item._----------------------------------------_--+-++++-Update, got immediate replacement with new printer but new printer is not working copy and print function not working.Even after talking with hp support they are not able to solve the problem, somehow amazon ask to return the product."
1,Worse printer m facing problem now. The ink is full but it shows no print n no ink . the demo page can be print but . the light keeps blinking saying no ink.  HP is a cheater. Its waste of time as bought for college print works. This Printer is a scam. Check youtube as well it says this printer is always creating problem no use.  It was late to change as mine amazon package cover was thrown so. It won't be accepted to return. They said only can be replaced . so total waste of money and time
5,Good quality print. Good packing condition. Value for money.
1,"I purchased this product and was unable to install driver on my Windows 10 laptops. [Note: Both Windows 10] The call to HP was long wait and finally I got through. The person tried to install device driver but wasn't successful. He was installing HP 2300 series driver. After that I did some research and tried to install F2200/F2224 driver on my old Windows 10 laptop and it worked on one of the laptop. The message on newer windows 10 laptop was that you are using older version of device driver. A service engineer came but  couldn't do much. Surprisingly he told me that your laptop has a problem. I explained that it's a DELL laptop and not an assembled one and uses legitimate windows 10. I tried to tell him that windows 10 might have a newer patch and there might be a patch for driver as well. But he was not very keen probably trained by HP.  I am keeping printer and will update if at all HP sees this and comes back to me with resolution as I have told him that I can even wait for 15 days. He also said I am free to give whatever ratings I want. ??My service ID: BRFZ7243A descent product but extremely poor HP service. It's not a technician's fault but the attitude of parent company HP. They want to make money but don't care about educating their technicians. This is how they train people. There is no attitude to help customers, no desire to learn @ issues and no desire to solve issues, no log checking, poor debugging. They are taught to close the cases by parent company. HP wake up...  Don't be complacent ..."
2,Stopped working in couple of week. This is my third and HP s second printer. First I bought from store lasted like 7-8 years without any issue as I remember. And this time bought online. Printer got internally damaged and one gear stud got broken. I don't know how this could happen in such short time (couple of times only) use.
4,"I have been using this printer for taking print outs of my Kids home work and documents.The print quality is not good as we get in the shops or office, but this will be enough the above said uses. Prints are little lighter on black and greyscale. I tried changing the settings , but it did not help.The test print with colour looked good, but I have not taken any more colour printouts.Printing in greyscale can finish up the colour inks very quick, so use it only if required."
3,"It just meets expectations of printing and scanning. However, there are quite a few issues which are not that satisfactory.1. The paper gets stuck very often when it starts rolling into the printer. The paper tilts to a side and gets stuck. The print is just OK.2. The scanning takes very long. And after using it for nearly a month, I am still to figure out how to create a single file from multiple scans. And settings are too clumsy. Not user friendly settings.3. Product looks too brittle. Not sturdy/robust."
4,"Being HP product is good. However for scanning you are compelled to go online i.e. through HP App which is not desired and very cumbersome. During which a lot of HP updates squeeze-in in your system. This printer has an HP offer of free headset. Here is the problem. The invoice sent with the delivery is thermal print out and is difficult to read contents in that more particularly the serial number of printer which is must for redeeming offer. The invoice if downloaded come in two parts /pages, i.e Part-1 invoice without serial number of printer and Part-2 Packing slip with serial number of printer and HP redemption cell do not consider packing slip and also invoice without serial number of printer. Hence offer not allowed. Sorry."
1,"Cartridge printed only 40 pages, and it empty now.You mentioned wrong printing quantity.Cartridge cost is rupees1553 for 1 set which gives approx 40 pages print.  Print is very costly.Never buy HP printer.Printer is cost effective but ink cartridge is very costly.Never go for it."
1,"I bought this HP 2335 printer and regretted it. I wasted 2 days of my time fixing this printer. Nothing happened. Then I called Amazon for returning this product. The representative said she would replace this product with another one. The replacement arrived the next day. But the replacement is also a junk product and it does not work. So, I am again trying to reach Amazon and I am getting the message that the customer service call back service is not available.I am a busy executive and I don’t have time to waste like this. I regret buying this product!Don’t waste your money buying this product  and also don’t waste your precious time fixing this junk!I don’t understand why Amazons customer service call back Service is unavailable. So how can we return the defective product?"
1,"There are too many driver compatibility issue and lack of integration for apple devices. Customers should not be going through this kind of unnecessary hassle.Instead of making multiple printers with almost similar features and price range, HP should concentrate more on ease of usage and superior experience for end user with better product quality and support."
4,Please send me Installation disc as I am senior citizen so as to enable me to run.Product is Good.Awaiting favorable Installation disc to solve Scan Issues.
1,The HP DESKJET INK ADVANTAGE ALL IN ONE PRINTER delivered on 31 December 2020 (13 Days back) was a defective piece as paper was getting jammed. As per the policy return of such items within seven days only is permitted.
2,The printing speed is very slow and not WiFi version only usb connectivity.Their promise is fake they said the black cartridge print 480 pages but this print only 100-120 pages and cartridge is empty.Like that colour cartridge print only 30 pages . My money is worst / waste . So I want you that don't buy this product this is fake claim of cartridge and printing quality is very slow
1,This printer is one of the most inconvenient printers I have ever used. The manual doesn't give any information. And the print and scan function doesn't work. Only photocopy works.
4,Fast to print. Clear prints. Ver good after sales service also. I had to get a replacement as the first one I received had a problem with paper loading. It got replaced very fast and the Amazon technician was excellent
1,It is totaly bad product there was no ink in this cartridge cartridge was empty and the costumer care is not helping us I totally waste my money kindly costumer care please help me to change this product
5,"Works perfect for my usage, we need max 30-40 prints a month.This works perfectly well and print quality is good. It's a machine now give it time to do its job for printing for few seconds. Not an issue for me atleast."
3,This printer very reliable to use and printer quality is good(I am talking about black print only) but I got defected tricolor cartidge and I have given the cartridge for replacement to HP authorised service centre. I will update my review colour print quality after I get the new color cartidge from service centre.
4,"Easy to install,  photocopy and printing is easy but scanning is little cumbersome. But works well."
5,This is 1st reviewI want to tell you all guys that this also work on LINUX without any extra app.Very easy to use
2,Print quality is very poor. The cartridge gives very less number of prints. Nowhere near to the mentioned 100-300 pages. Scanner is good. Giving 2 stars just because of that. No value for the money paid...
1,"Tried to contact customer service, so many times!!. Amazon customer service will ask you to contact the HP service team to get a job sheet for return. Now the brand new printer is sitting in the storage room. Gave up the idea of returning it."
1,"Invariably paper gets stuck, twisted. Have to hold n guide it. Takes hours to print.  The worst printer i ever used in 3 decades!"
1,I've ordered it and firstly I wasn't working then I replaced it hopefully that good product will reach me out but unfortunately again the same problem... Printer isn't working and roller are jam and and somewhere there is hardware issue...and wasting my time with this product... think twice before you go for this product.😔
5,It's very easy to use. This product is cheap and best.
5,"Very helpful & awesome printer at a reasonable price. Printing speed as normal, very good packaging & safely delivered by Amazon. Thank You Amazon & HP"
1,Printer was for Home use. But Printer DEFECTIVE.... NO INVOICE SENT EITHER.LABEL SHOWING WRONG SERIAL NUMBER AS CONFIRMD BY MR SAMUEL OF HP AS WELL AS MS MUSHKANHP NOT WILLING TO RENDER SERVICS DUE TO WRONG SERIALNUMBER>DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS SERVICE OF AMAZON
1,Worst printer one can buy. Please don't buy. The paper gets stuck all the time. The color is getting dispersed on rubbing. Unfortunately my return window is over by the time i realized.Now the printer is showing error carriage stalled and not able to use it.
5,It's not slow. Change the settings of the printing then it will be faster.Initially I felt same with my experience.Later on after changing settings it is working faster like any other printer
3,The power supply cable is not fitting the printer its very loose ofter its comming out
1,Terrific Experience.....I received a used product yesterday....both ink cartridge is not in sealed pack .Ink cartridge already fitted in the printer and it was used product.I call customer care but they said they can't replace my product now
1,Currently the only option i have is to use it with phone.
1,its only  print 3 to 4 page properly then started blur printing and no option for darkness and cartarage is very costly .
1,"Printer came damaged,While installing it gave errorWich means Scanner damages,Worst customers support by canon,new product now under replacement after several call annoying support..Will not recommend anyone to purchase printer online...Really disappointing"
3,It is good only for plain paper printing. If you print on glossy paper its color spreads. Buy it only If you want to print on plain paper otherwise not.
3,Prints 500 rs notes properly but 2000 rs notes are not the right color. Not worth the money spent.
5,"Very good product,Easy Installation, scanner picture quality is very good and printer quality also very very good, useful... Thank you Canon"
1,"Got a defective piece. Very bad packaging. As soon as I got the printer and turned it on, the yellow light started blinking and I had to call the service center and they told scanner is defective when I told them the support code - 5011. They informed me that scanner is defective maybe because of manufacturing or due to delivery."
1,Useless printer. Please dont take. I got for 2k and cartridge left nothing after 30 prints or less. You will go on spending on cartridges which is 600 to 900. So printing cost around 20 to 30 for a bnw paper. Such a useless printer dont take if you got for a rupee also. You cannot fill ink only cartridges work.
4,"This printer is very light weight. For Print quality you can see the image printed on A4 size paper I have attached. I liked the print quality at such low price. Honestly if you want an all in one printer in low price you should buy this. I got the delivery today and installed the printer myself. If you'll need any assistance you can call the canon service centre their engineer will install it for you at a certain charge. It's easy to install yourself all you need to do is to read the manual, instructions carefully and follow step by step. Print speed is also ok. You'll not get a laserjet printer speed but it's completely fair with its price tag."
3,"BUT NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING ON PHOTO GLOSSY PAPER AS INKS (ALL FOUR COLORS) DOES NOT TOTALLY STICK TO THE PAPER. WE SHOULD WAIT FOR AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES BELOW THE FAST ROTATING FAN TO DRY THE PAPER. EVEN THEN IF YOU MOVE YOUR FINGER ON THE GLOSSY SHEET THE INK GETS DISTURBED AND PICTURE QUALITY LOOKS SHABBY. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING ON GLOSSY SHEETS.REST ASSURED,  FOR DAY TO DAY PRINTING THIS IS THE BEST PRINTER I HAVE USED SINCE HP 300 ALL IN ONE WHICH I PURCHASED IN 2005."
1,"Printer is cheap as of 2500,but but butCost of cartridge is 2400 approxAnd if you want to buy cartridge daily then go for small cartridge which comes with this printer I.e extra small, which even fails to print 40pagesSo cost of printing 1 paper becomes 20 to 25 per page.Also very noisy in operations.Better to spend 7000 on laser printer or inktank printer."
4,"I bought it Amazon sale for scanning the documents. Even after two years it is working well. Though printing quality is average, and it's cartridges are very expensive, but for emergency it is good, and best for scanning the documents and books. Till today I have scanned more thank 25000 pages, but no problem occurred. The only problem is that after about 1 year it's usb cable became faulty and I purchased other usb cable from a local store, and printer is working fine."
1,"This product is not working after one month of use. After using for one month, it showed cartridges ink is over, after replacement of ink, it stopped printing, on showing it to local shop, I got to know that it's chip is damaged. Complete waste of money. When I called customer care of Canon, they said this product work like this only and is poor, I am shocked with response received from Canon. Will not recommend to anyone. I just want my money back or cannon/ Amazon should replace it."
4,Very handy and light weight product but this product not comparable for photo printing
1,Installation is not free - they have taken Rs 1000 for installation - Why should they take money for first time installation
1,I am regreting after buying this price of waste.i was very happy happy while i bought this but as soon as the time come when the this printer ink got over i try to get the same in market and believe me the pg-745 xl cost me somewhere between 2500 to 2600 ah! thats the price of actual machine i simply thrown this peice of wasre in the dustbin and i rather bought a laser printer and that too b/w although that's not colour but it done the job perfectly. If you are going to buy this product buy at your own risk because at first it will be treat you good but after you buy this you will end up losing a good amount of money from your pocket.
1,The printer works fine but it's inks are very expensive. I landed purchasing more than rs.5000 worth of ink in one year. It's color cartridge only contact 1500
2,Carrying ends after 20 prints. Refilling samagra the cartridge. New cartridge costs 1000 rs each. Spanning and print quality is ok.
1,"Item not working, no option to return or replace the items .. even though replace option is showing in Amazon, it won't allow to replace request .. it will redirect to cannon service centre. But after selecting the model in ivr call, call will diconnect automatically .. not recommend to buy . No proper service alao"
5,"100% satisfied with this product. The print & scan quality is excellent. Also the printing performance is super,  printing 10 to 15 documents per minute. Really awesome, just I want to say thank you Amazon. I can't imagine how canon supply the wonderful printer in such type of budget. Rs.2300/- . Dear friends if you want to purchase a printer for home use then this is the ultimate choice, don't loss the opertunity. Go to Amazon app & order now...."
4,"I needed a printer for home use. I was looking for something basic with all the three important features that a printer should have such as Printing, Copying and scanning. And like I said I needed something basic because for home use at best you're gonna need 4-5 prints in a month usually and not more. So I found this printer which I received just today. Does it do what it says? Yes, It does  and overall it's a great product and I am quite satisfied with it's quality and features. Although the print quality could've been slightly better. Don't get me wrong overall it's a great product for it's price and comes with all the necessary accessories that you would need for a printer but the print quality is just above average. It does the job and it doesn't look bad. Just not great like you can see in other slightly expensive brands. Anyway I don't regret buying it. I still got more than what I paid for, therefore I am quite satisfied."
3,Printer installation is easy 3/5.  printing speed is 3/5. Print quality is good 4/5. But worst thing is ink cartridge is getting low soon. Just for print of 6pages in which 3 are mix black and colour. It showed me the reduction of 10% of total ink.
1,Pathetic in the very beginning... Cannot be installed as the windows can't detect the printer. Canon customer care is useless. No support on call. Gave number of a local repair agency which is not recwiving the call. Waste of money and time.
1,"Very bad product.... Complete wastage of moneyThis product is not working After using for few pages your catrage is empty . after replacement of cartridge, it stopped printing. Complete waste of money. When I called customer care of Canon, they said this product work like this only and is poor, I am shocked with response received from Canon. No warranty this product in canon service center only show in .Will not recommend to anyone. I just want my money back or cannon/ Amazon should replace it."
4,"I ordered this on 23rd October and the ink(black) was over on 3rd November. I printed just 12-15 pages in total. Either the ink cartridge was old or that’s how all the cartridges are. I’ll know once I replace the cartridge, but by then I might have to change the colour cartridge as well. All in all disappointed.I’m still giving it 4 stars because the printer itself is easy to install and use. The print quality is good, too. I am using it for home use, so maybe I’ll use it for important documents only.YET, totally annoyed with the cartridges provided."
5,Good printer.I bought it for ₹2000/- only and had got ₹700/- cashback. Overall price of the printer for me was ₹1300/- .Prints pages at ₹0.50 each. Print quality is not too good but ok for home use. I donot change ink cartridge. I just refill them at home.Scan quality is excellent.Xerox is also good.Software is also easy to install and easy to use.
3,Low cost but Not recommended.Print per page cost is high.Only you will get 25 to 30 page.Printing quality is okay.Ink will quickly drain out.Document scanning quality is not upto the mark . My passport scanning and very old document scanning quality is not good with this printer.Other Document scanning quality is acceptable.
5,Very nice product..already used the same model for 5 years and now purchased again.good for use if you have to print 8-10 pages a day..cartridge are costly but can be refilled from any refill shop by paying 50/- rupees. Not very optimistic about color print since my requirement is for black and white prints daily.But you can definitely buy it if your usage is limited
5,"It's a great experience! It's my first Printer and enjoying the experience. Ease of use. Would upload the video on You Tube and update my review. I would appreciate if any IT support is provided for installation. I struggled a lot, but finally was able to when called up the IT support.At this price, great buy. Black ink cartridge got exhausted. Got it refilled via Cartridge World. A genuine store. Great Service."
1,What a crap.my catridge is low in just 15-20 printouts.LISTEN EVERYONE.DO NOT BUY ON AMAZON INDIA ANYTHING WHICH YOU THINK YOU CAN DIRECTLY PURCHASE FROM THE VENDOR NEAR YOU OR EVEN A STORE.AMAZON FO NOT CARE IF YOUR ITEM IS BAD...I PURCHASED A PRINTER N the ink finished in no time .whether you use the printer or no you still have to replace yr ink which finishes you use or no.Amazon please sell product which can value peoples money. Atleast now when people are jobless during this pendenic.Just dont sell product ehich put people hard earned money to a waste.
5,"Product is excellent with this price,easy to install and printing.picture quality is excellent,"
5,"First, its beautiful bit delicate though!Came well within quick time and had sturdy packaging, no complaints!Easy to install. Has color and black cartidges which need to be fitted, just follow picture instructions.CD for driver installation. If your laptop doesn't have CD player such as mine (surface pro 4), just google key words and download.Once you install, go in start menu and open canon printers to scan documents.To print, its ready to use without software installation. Print quality is good.But, remember its for home use, worth for ~100 pages per month.Use judiciously!I dont know why bad reviews. Its adequate.I purchased because i badly needed scan and print of my visa and option was same day delivery. I am happy.Thank you.If you want to purchase, go ahead!If your use is heavy, buy next heavy version. For me its enough."
1,"its not working properly not even a single button works nor USB ,various noise. the very first time showing the upper black and colour ink orange light., printing apps too donot recognise it,and bluetooth is not working either.its diffective,today on sunday i got some extra time to work on it but my whole day is wasted.remove this item from amazon ,i want my refund."
1,"Please do not buy this product even if the company gives u for free. The ink if it gets over, after refilling it the printer does not work. If we buy cartridge it will be costly and the outcome cost /print does not come good also. Though it looks cheap to buy. But later you will suffer with this. Please don't buy this product and waste your 2800 RS also. Utilize that money somewhere else."
3,"I bought this very recently.  So far so good.  It is economical. We can print, copy, scan is what I liked.What I didn't like is - the  USB cable from printer to connect to external device (computer) could have been longer that what is given.  It is tough sometimes to connect with laptop or computer which is placed just a bit longer to the printer.What is missing - WiFi. Hmm, need to spend some more money for this. But it could have come for this price itself given the technology advancements so far ! I know I shouldn't expect though!I'm happy as I've been using scan and prints (less) for a while. I used it for <2months now, since last week it won't turnon now :-) Not sure of the reason.  Time to contact the customer support now  :-).If I get quick resolution in few days, then I'd update here and improve the rating ! Hence giving less rating for now!"
1,Well this all in one printer seems cool for its price but it will cost you more than you think..  The ink cartridges can print only a few pages and you need to buy new cateidges every time which costs around 400 alone..  So it will cost you too much...  There is no refilling option you will have to buy a new cateidge itself...Apart from that the scanning is good but the scanner option in there app doesn't work all the time.. It keeps saying location undeminded and stuff but if you keep trying and trying it will scan ultimately..  Well I won't recommend this.. Go buy some good product.. They might be costly but they will be worth it.
4,Got it 4 days ago . Made in Vietnam(not chinnese crap).Automatically got detected by my laptop and able to print directly .For printing from mobile using poko print app . Colour Print quality is good and can be seen in attached picture.Printer needs to be handeled carefully especislly flips at top and bottom as they look fragile .Need to check how many prints i will get before cartridges exhaust as it was one negative thing i have seen in majority of reviews .Iam going to order inkjet 100ml bottles to fill cartridges following youtube videos
3,"Cheapest printer which contain scanner and worth it for occasional use besides print cost is high than other printers per page so this printer is not  for daily use . For students and other home stuffs this printer is worth to buy. Sometimes little minor issues can be happen but it can be solved by reading manual both offline and online. The print quality is ok , not so good but for occasional use its better to don't mind it . And the service it provides at this low price is worth it for buying."
1,I received twice and both time I received a defective product. Please Don't buy this product from Amazon
1,"Printer printed hardly 40 pages in draft mode and started displaying about exhausting condition of the black ink cartridges. While describing about the product, per page printing cost was not mentioned in the advertisement. This way an important aspect of per page printing cost or out put per cartridge was hidden. Such a high cost print can not be afforded, hence I would like to return the printer and get my money back. Would suggest to mention prints per cartridges or cost per print."
1,"update, it stopped working in less than 6 months. working fine for the price but manufacturer konwingly designed printer in a way that uses little colour ink for black print which u can clearly see as shadow and also in many reviews on internet so you get out of ink early, another thing is its catridge which is around half price of the printer which is also not available easily and printer is slower than tortoise. Good for small requirement in home and office or shop."
3,I am writhing this review after using it a month. I purchased it for Rs. 8999.Pros:-1. Fast printing2. DuplexCons1. High printing cost2. 1 cartridge yield maximum 1500 pages only3. MonochroSince if you want very fast printing and duplex then go with it. But cost for this you have to pay approximately Rs 2.5 per page.And if time is not your concern then go with epson printer in the same price segment you will get all in one printer (print+copy+scan) and page yield is about 7000 page for colour and 6000 page of black. And even one refill cost around Rs.400.I am using both printer thats why I am able to compare both.
1,"I received this printer on 14 July 2019. After installing as guided i connected the printer it got switched on and immediately the fuse gone and trip off in main board. I called the amazon customer care. He advised to change the switch board. When changed it switched on again. Whenever the printer is plugged to switch, the main board gets trip off. Since the power connections are good and is three phase it is getting trip, otherwise there would have been electrical fire which is life threatening to family members. I called the amazon technical team again on 22 July 2019 and spoke to Mr.Vidhya (which is recorded by me). After putting me on hold for four times and extended the call for 30 minutes, he said he has applied for replacement and i will get the message shortly. Even after 24 hours I have not received any message. Today (23 July 2019) when I called for three times I am not at all connected to technical person. May be instead of applying replacement my number would be blacklisted. Once the product is received by us i don't think we will get a replacement. Is there anyone who got their electronic item replaced by Amazon. Please think twice before buying this product through online. Now the replacement date is also gone."
5,"I got this one at ₹ 6850 , which was great in worth for these type of printer ..."
5,"Since last several years I had been suffering a color printer. And since I don't use much, the color cartridges used to stale. All color printers have 4 cartridges and in old color printer, if one cartridge goes faulty, the printer stops. This is crazy. Besides, one color cartridge costs approx Rs. 1500. Multiply this by 4 and its Rs. 6000, just for the cartridges alone. And I never used color cartridge much. but I had to buy it because without it, the Black cartridge won't work. It was an expensive affair.Then I finally decided that enough is enough. I need a printer which is for home use, minimal use, and the cartridge should survive some long period of hibernation. And since I had burned my fingers with an expensive, famous, high end printer, I was looking for a printer with a reasonable budget, preferably below Rs. 10,000.The Brother printer is truly doing good. No hassles. And no paper jams as yet. It's very easy to install. There are youtube videos on how to assemble it. I could do it in less than 5 mins. And the best thing is, you power the printer, and insert usb in laptop/computer and goto printer settings, and when you add printer, the driver of the printer self-installs. I have also ordered ""Apple Leaders Printer Dust Cover for Brother HL-L2321D"". You see I have Brotherly feelings already towards this new possession."
5,"This is an efficient and reliable single function monochrome printer! I was looking for a good laser duplex printer. After a lot of search, I found this printer to be the most appropriate. In fact, I wanted to get a colour laser printer but found them to be very expensive and unnecessary as colour prints are rarely needed. The toner costs are astronomical! If a single original black toner cartridge costs half the cost of this printer, imagine the cost of coloured toners! Besides the initial cost of a laser colour printer is outrageously high. So unless you really need one, don’t waste your time looking for one. Inkjet colour printers are cheaper so you can opt for them. But be advised that they aren’t easy to maintain. Unlike inkjet printers, ink leaks won't occur even if the laser printer isn’t used for a long time.Setting up this printer was very easy and I had it running in minutes. Duplex printing is fantastic. It saves paper, time and energy. The paper tray stacks 250 papers neatly within the printer. Always use dual print compatible papers to avoid causing paper jams or poor quality prints. The toner (TN-2365) that comes with the printer has a stated capacity of 2,600 pages. But eventually the number will be close to 1,500 pages. If you use the toner saver mode then it may reach 2,000 pages. Additionally, the drum (DR-2365) which houses the toner will also have to be replaced after every 12,000 prints. The print speed is impressive. It can print 30 (A4) or 32 (Legal) pages in a minute. I have printed 750 pages at once all under 30 minutes. I haven’t had a single paper jam or any other issue while doing it and in all the 6 months use. This implies reliability.Compatible refills and cartridges are easily available for this model and costs a fraction of what an original toner cartridge (costs Rs. 3,000) would! Compatibles will affect the print quality to an extent and depending on their quality and how the cartridge is refilled, it may cause leaks within the printer. Therefore care should be taken regarding this. Do note that compatibles will void the printer’s warranty. So it would be better to go for compatibles after the warranty period. Being compact, it occupies less space. It comes in a two tone appearance (Black and Grey) and doesn't have wireless printing. The similar all black colour"
5,Print quality is supper.....Its easy to install......It's also a user friendly printer.....It will print only when the command is given from a computer...It will not support mobile printing....
5,"Purchased this superb printer in Diwali sale and got 10% off on price of 7499/- i.e at 674 effective price.. Today on Diwali, got it delivered..I must tell that I was and to some extent sceptical and scared that how will such a low cost printer handle duplex printing over the years.. Let's see..Initial thoughts :1. Installation was a breeze.. All the things were guided nicely by the guide papers, paper cut-out indicators etc.2. Print quality is awesome.. Printed around 500 pages as soon as I got hands over it..3. Single side print speed is around 30 ppm as advertised.. It litterally throws paper like bullets, such excellent sppeds..4. Double side print speed is on a little lower side at around 8 sec per print i.e around 7.5 ppm..5. All error handling lights and LEDs are very user friendly as well as status monitor (for Windows) is nice and concise way of seeing what printer is doing now..6. Build quality is as per the best printers in market.. no cheap material whatsoever at any part of the body.. (By looks, it looks like a 17k - 20k printer..More updates when I use it more.. ( I've at least 10k pages to print ASAP, that would test the printer and toner/drum extensively..😉"
1,1 Star for providing wrong info4 star for print qualityPrint quality is best but pls consider the following information1. U have mentioned that this printer contains 2600 pages inbox toner. But it failed to print even 1000 (includes back to back) pages. Til the replacement of new toner it wont works.2. Pls provide the correct information. If its potential is to print 1000 pages pls mention the same info. Providing of Wrong information may lead to loss reputation and sometimes would also leads to face the legal actions.Hence provide the guinuine info. As u advertise.Thank u
5,I have purchase this printer in May 2019 its more than 2 months and is working perfectly.No issue aroused so far.You can refill its cartridge by yourself or get it refilled in market which will cost around ₹300-400 which is 8 times cheaper than the new brother cartridge and print quality is almost same.It is a duplex printer i.e. prints simultaneously on both sides of paper. The print speed is highly satisfying.I have printed 550 pages at one go without any page stuck.The no. Of pages that can be printed in 1 cartridge depends on what you print i.e. printing text only will allow you to print around 1500-1600 pages (this is just an approx. idea as i have not counted the no. Of pages printed)if you print pages with images you will end up your cartridge with less no.  of printed pages.It also depends on whether you turned on toner saver mode or not.Also dont forget to turn on duplex mode before printing.I will update this review after some time when my cartridge will be finished and will let to know the no. Of pages it prints in 1 full cartridge.Hope it will help you.
1,"I am facing paper jam with this printer in the 2nd print itself from the date of purchase. Had registered the complain but no action is being taken. Wastege of time and money in total, would not recommend anyone to purchase it."
4,"Ordered Friday, received Monday, so amazing delivery right off the bat.Print quality is crisp and clear.I print a lot of documents and books hence the auto duplex. But when I gave an auto duplex print, it only printed half a page on one of the sides. Bummer!Called customer care. Very responsive. I was personally attended to the very next day and when I gave a print, the duplex worked just fine! Isn't that how it always goes?Pros:Cost, Print Quality, Customer CareCons:Expensive original cartridge, Single functionAll in all, when it comes to low end laser printers, this seems like a winner. I'll update my review after a couple of months or if I encounter any trouble."
3,I brought this in 8500 rs . At  this is  price this is the best .But I would suggest Invest some more . And you will get Inktank printer aroung 10k Which are much better than laser .printing cost is less in ink tank .Also you can get colour and other features like scan .The Toner refuling is headache for laser printer . and after 10000 print you have to replace the cartage . which costs around 2000 .But in inktank there is no headache . Easy to refiil .
5,At this price range Duplex printer means you put some 300 odd sheets and forget and give print command and it prints both front and back in a jiffy.I even printed my Study materials  PDF in a jiffy.Just combine all those study material pdf  and press print and rest it will do printing by itself no worry about paper reverse and all all done it itself .Just use it wisely easy to intall .At this prince range worth it .Don't worry about replacement cartridge even just as razor and blade marketing the toner is priced high .But still worth it.
1,"After warranty period ends, printer breaks down.Brother will charge 50% of printer cost to replace the circuit board.Avoid at all costs. Absolute junk"
5,Writing review after use of 1 year. Got best quality prints . Still not face  serious issue. Refilling is easy. Duplex printing is very fast.
1,"I have used printers from almost all brands be it HP, Samsung, Cannon etc. This is my second Brother printer. The first one worked for 7-8 months and then the printer died on us. This one has stopped working in a month. I strongly don't recommend Brother products just because of the built quality. They offer excellent value for money until they are working but unfortunately they dont work more than few months and in this case not even a month."
5,"I own several printers for my office and of each kind ink tank , laserjet , thermal etc and of every price point. but this baby  is awesome. it does the job perfectly and accurately. and those who think that its too expensive as its toner and drums cost more... you should never buy the original toner and drums. always go for a local printer shop and ask them for a refil.  200 rs is what i pay here for refill. Good day my nibbass"
5,Bought it after reading the reviews and considering my requirements which was small sce printing of study materials and stuff..So opted for this duplex model..very fast and prompt printing..once or twice faced paper jamming issue..Must use paper thickness above 70mm..otherwisethere are sligh chances of jammingduring duplex printing ..Anyway sorting out a paper jam was super easy as there are brother's own step by step YouTube tutorials..Avoid it all together by using good quality paper esp during duplex..I am quite satisfied with the product..
4,"I have used this product for a few days now, and admittedly, the printer does what it claims well. The printer produces relatively sharp pictures in black and white and is the ideal device for someone who needs a durable laser printer and does not want to spend to much on it. The printer supports double sided printing, which is common, but still a good feature to have nonetheless. The page tray claims to be able to hold above 200 pages, but it may vary based on the quality and thickness of the paper. The installation process was the easiest part and took nearly 10 minutes to get it up and running. The product is cost-efficient and can support office environment and house environment based on your requirements. One thing I do not particularly like about this product is the printing speed, however, given the price and the quality, its a forgivable factor.Overall recommend this product to any person who is looking for a basic printer that can help them with their black and white printing requirements."
5,Fully satisfied with the product.I think best duplex printer in this rate.Very good print.
1,"I received the printer day before yesterday. Yesterday I tried printing. But it always gives printer jam error. Followed all troubleshooting instructions. Checked paper tray, drum unit, back side. No paper found anywhere. Also tried different types of papers. No luck. Will try one more time today, then return it if it does not work still."
5,"Using it for last couple of months .. Great purchase .. Loving it.I have used multiple color printers before and most of them lasted for less than 2 years. The last one was HP Deskjet ink advantage 3525, which was working well for more than an year and then it stopped printing due to printer head malfunction as we couldn't use this printer for 2 to 3 months in between which may be the reason for this issue. I was kind of fed-up with these issues and thought of trying an economical laser printer as laser printer doesn't need the monthly duty cycle.Loving this Brother laser jet so far and as of know looks like a terrific purchase. Only one practical issue is that there is no WIFI and we need to use laptop or desktop with usb to print. But i am used to it now. Printed around 700 pages so far and still showing around 75% ink remaining.ProsEasy to installGreat quality printingFast printing compared to previously used color printersDuplex PrintingHaven't faced any paper jam issues so farEconomicalConsNo WiFiOverall great product!"
5,"Overall printer is a good choice for monochrome printing purposes.Pros:1) Functional-Printing Quality is very good with duplex printing. Duplex printing is fast, simple and well automated.2) Build Quality:- Printer is robust and have great build quality.3) Printing tray capacity: Qty I haven’t measured but it can take easily 100 sheets.4) Cartridge: Long Lasting Cartridge with very easy installation..Guided by there Manual.Cons:1) Space required: Lot of space is required around 500mm x 500mm.2) Connector cable: Since it is a wired printer Its cable is small in length."
5,Top class printer. I have total 3 Brother printers at my shop All are work horses. This is a sibling of 2541. But only print. No scan and xerox. 2541 I have still and it has printed more than 2 lakh pages. I know this printer also will go beyond 2 lakhs. Thank you brother.
5,Nice printer at a price of Rs.7379/- .Ordered on the 16th Oct just as soon as The Great Indian Shopping Festival started..They promised a same day delivery..But had delivered on the next day..Still thats awesome isnt it..Got an awesome Rs.1100/- discount due to the Festive Sale period..Non-offer price was 8499 then..Prints quite nice..just hope the machine lasts long enough..I chose Amazon because of the delivery speed promised and they have kept their promise quite well..Other apps were giving me a 12 day delivery period unlike Amazon..Amazon had given a same day delivery promise..The printer is also very easy to install..
5,"I have had 3 inkjet printers before this. 2 of HP and 1 of Lexmark. Initially all of them behaved well but as soon as the cartridge exhausted, with a refill, they started giving trouble. Finally with a couple of cartridge changes I had to throw them out as scrap.With a couple of thousands rupees more this is proving to be a delight. I am an author. I have already printed the manuscripts of 2 of my books with 272 and 230 pages respectively. Whereas printing a single book of 250 pages on inkjet used to prove to be a half day task, this did the job in 15 mins. flat.Pros- Installs like a breeze.- Easy to handle- High speed printing- Crisp and sharp prints- No need for frequent paper feeding(takes 250 sheets in the in-tray)- Automatic both side printing (Duplex printing. Especially beneficial for manuscript printing)Cons- No Wi-Fi connection- No scanner- Somewhat heavyBut then one cannot expect everything at this price point. I cost me a mere 8500/-."
3,called Brother to ask for return - no because I should have researched it myself - their site doesn't mention it DOES NOT support Chrome OS - work around? connect to a USB-router and hope for the best after configuring it with a win/mac laptopotherwise probably the best price/quality laser printer you can find - get the extra toner and refills...
5,"Good value product with duplex feature. With easy double side printing, it saves a lot on paper. So far no paper jams. Small minus is it’s a little noisy compared to my earlier HP."
5,"I'm using a laser printer for the first time. Installation was very easy - youtube videos by the manufacturer itself defines steps from unboxing to finish installing toner cartridge. Loading A4 paper is pretty simple.For Windows, driver and if needed additional printer management softwares can be downloaded from Brother website. I am able to print from Android phone via USB OTG using some software on play store, and it went well.I chose 600dpi medium quality setting before printing pages of text and mild graphics, and it all went well. Prefer draft mode or 300dpi for printing images, otherwise toner consumption rises and image may look too dark.This does automatic duplex printing and it works well. Very happy with the purchase. Printer is so simple, humble, capable and value for money. Also compatible toner cartridges are available but seeing so many complaints related to print quality and duplex printing; so better to stick with genuine toner cartridge (gives 2600 pages) from Brother and cost per page is very cheap as home use is concerned."
5,"Post lockdown, there were lot of printing to do for my kid.. I looked for ink jet and ink tank but every professional printer suggested to go for laser as if your weekly print count is 5-10 and u don't want to spent a lot on the long run then go for laser given its low maintenance. Brother was a good fit and they are durable."
4,"For those who want only black and white printouts, this is the best. Although the plastic made of the machine feels little delicate. Easy to install and use. There is no scanner and color print in this. Multifunctional printers only make the system more complicated when repairs come and expensive. Otherwise, you can buy them separately and use, all come to the same cost as a multifunctional printer."
5,7999/-24hr delivery and it's a first class product with good packaging.Worked on 1st attempt itself.Easy to install and use.Buy 1yr extended warranty at 349/- giving peace of mind.Register for warranty and support.Reliable brand like a Brother. I liked it
5,"I order Epson model first. It got stuck after printing 2 pages. Luckily, Amazon accepted the return.I had no idea about Brother brand. Boss, It's  a beast... ! My daughter put toothpick, plastic sheets etc into it.. still no damage.. no paper jamGreat product for familyPrinted 600 pages in one go.. not a single jam..Just go for it .."
4,"Very easy to use - very good black-and-white printer. But no wifi!!  So if you are looking for wifi laser printer, you have to spend more moneySometimes some black marks come - but you can clean it by removing and moving the green part shown on brother printer cartridge. Simple work to be done every 2-3 weeks or so."
5,"Excellent printer with auto duplex printing facility, highly reasonable price. Working very well. One of the oldest printer company. Very low priced cartridge. I would strongly recommend the printer. Just go ahead and buy it."
5,"This lazer printer is fantastic value for money. Printer is a USB only which is okay as I don't have more than one computer to connect to. However, recommend a wireless one if you have more than a single user at home.Otherwise, print quality is good - very quite and simply works the way it is designed. Not too many fancy buttons and easy to clean. Fits perfectly on the desk. Duplex printing is great too. No paper scrunching unlike other expensive printers still do it. Easy to install the cartridge by following instruction sheet. no loose parts.Highly recommend this product for a trouble free printing."
3,"I have brought this product after a lot of surfing and thinking.Brother is less in price compared to those pronounced brands. I m a student switched to laser printer because it's maintaince is very less compared to any other type of printer.I think this printer is ok with everything but it's price per page is high..Toner is not easily availableLet me use it for some time ..Next I will provide much better information with experience..1st Edit after 4 months of usage Well uptil now it has worked nice,"
1,The disappointment was that of the missing security label on the package. No where it was to be found after screening through the areas based on the instructions. Such experiences hinder online procurement and search for genuine products. I have requested for a replacement which I hope is up to the mark and policies of Brother.
4,"Hey, its better than i expected.  I used to have Canon LBP 2900 but after using this Brothers printer, i never touch that Canon.  It prints like a breeze, the print quality is superb.  Canon was very durable, i dont know if this Brothers printer is going to be durable or not.  So, in comparison, this printer is better in every way except for durability which is not yet known."
1,"I purchased this (as a stand-by) mainly because of many reviews saying they have experienced no paper jams. contrary to this claim, from the first day i am experiencing paper jams every time i use this machine. even now, after four months, after experimenting with various good quality printing papers, it jams at least once a day.. sometimes two sometimes four papers are dragged in. despite fanning all the sheets, etc this happens. useless brand. print quality, auto-duplex etc work well. i like the separate drum feature also. my first printer, ricoh 3510sf (also purchased on amazon in 2016) gave me hell with combined drum and cartridge."
4,"I was looking for good quality MFP in the 10k range and came across this model. HP name and its features were eye-catcher and I was able to finalize it soon.I am using this MFP for more than a year and so far had no issues, be it printing or scanning or copier. P.S. I use only genuine HP toner in it, so it’s quite a deal.HP 126nw, mark this nw in its name as it makes it super useful, giving it network capability in terms of LAN/Wi-Fi for both printing and scanning. This is really useful as you can keep it anywhere and print from virtually any location without any cable connected (other than power cable).Setting it up, in general, is a breeze while the Wi-Fi scan is a bit complicated. I will list the steps to make it easy for you.FYI, I got it from Cambium Retail seller.•••••••••••••••INSIDE BOX•••••••••••••••1. Printer2. Paper stack tray3. Print collection tray4.

Tiltable control panel for easy access.11. The good thing with a laser printer is that you don’t have to worry about drying ink or print head. I had 2 heads replaced in the earlier inkjet printer. So even if off for a month, laser one works instantly with the same good quality.••••••••CONS••••••••1. Scan quality is not crisp. On full zoom, I find it slightly blurry. But in regular day to day scanning tasks, you won’t even notice it. So not a big deal.2. No backlit LCD and it’s a pain to operate it without backlight unless you tilt it.3. No ADF for scanning, so you need feed in every single page to be scanned separately. (But you can’t get everything in this range)4.

Only printing works. I will take you through steps to enable wireless scanning which is really very handy. It took me a lot of time to figure it out.If already configured on network and you set it up via 2nd option, then scanning will work.1. Power on MFP. Do not connect it via LAN cable or USB cable for now.2. Use driver cd or download installer from the HP website. Run it.3. Choose USB based setup. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.4. Again run the installer and now choose the 3rd option, first-time wireless connection. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.5. Now when you run HP scan utility, it will be able to communicate to MFP via Wi-Fi.6. If you skip step 3 above, it won’t work and give communication error.▶ WITH WPS1. Power on MFP. USB or LAN cable is not required.2. Press the Wi-Fi button on MFP to start the WPS connection.3. Push the WPS button on your router.4. Let it connect to the router. Once successful, the IP address will be displayed on LCD.5. Now start setup and select 2nd option 'connect through the network'. It will search for the printer on the network.6. Once found, select it and proceed.•••••••••••••••••••FINAL VERDICT•••••••••••••••••••I am using it for more than a year and it never disappointed me in terms of usage, be it printing/scanning/copy task.▶ This device, M126nw is highly suitable for general home usage where you don’t print every day or light to medium office work where you print/scan daily.  You can very well go for it.▶ There used to be another model m126a without network capability. If you can find it, you can save some bucks. But a few bucks more get you a good deal of value proposition with m126nw."
5,"Model - M126nw. Pro-tip: Always buy an extra compatible toner with your new printer :)My Quick Find outs are --- pros:1. Compatible Toners easily available at just under 500 INR on Amazon so no worry about printing cost.2. WiFi setup and wireless printing is extremely easy (by phone or laptops)3. Using it as network printer atm (by LAN port in my small office)4. Print quality is awesome 5/5 for that5. Photo Copy /Xerox are so fine, get confused which one is original if I copy (if copy b/w)6. Scanning quality is nice too.Cons:Some things to consider before buying this printer:1. Unable to copy/scan large size of papers (legal size)2. No back-lit in digital display screen"
3,"1) The copy quality of the printer is horrible, Scan quality is just ok and print quality acceptable.2) It doesn't have led light in the display so its gonna be more difficult and annoying for you to operate this printer."
1,"Warning: No backlight on the display. On a printer of this price, what's the problem in putting some leds at the back??Another big warning: No flatbed in scanner. If you have 100 pages to scan, you need to do it one by one. A cheap 3k rupees printer does this.No return option in Amazon unless there is a technical defect. Make your choice clear before buying. I would have returned it if I was allowed.Not an good experience on Linux machine. Setup was not easy. I will couldn't connect it wirelessly. Need to run a ethernet from router.Only Good thing is, it's prints very fast. If you just do printing alone and nothing else, you can consider this."
5,"Fantastic Product. I haven't seen a better HP LaserJet Pro with such cool features. It has wifi, lan connectivity. I can print from my phone laptop any device wireless to the machine. And it shows up instantly. Moreover the whole setup process was a breeze. I would not have got a better HP Laserjet product with MFP capabilities at this price. Hats off!!"
2,"THE WORST PRINTER>I'll keep it short.PROS:-Prints at a good speed and good and easy Printing.  Get many pages from one Cartridge.-Good for printing a huge pdf at once.Cons:-Wi-Fi range is a line of sight. If Laptop in another room it would take a long time to get the information of data to print.- Blacks are not deep black, even if it's not on Eco mode.- I have a dual router at home that is 5Ghz and 2.4 GHz for my internet. So when you using this on wifi, the printer will only connect to the 2ghz one. So you have to disconnect the internet on your device and connect to the Printer wifi and then print.- Printing on wifi is a SLOW process. The times I needed to print something quick its never been able to just work.If you using only for USB or cable only then it might be good.- The scanner has been getting some black staining inside which doesn't reproduce the best quality scans.In short, this is the last time I am purchasing HP as a printer brand.The Fact that to print 1 page I have to go through so much, doesn't classify this a friendly printer at all."
5,"This Printer is best suitable for the Office purpose who can use Monochrome (Black & White) color printouts.PROS:1. Best Print Quality.2. Faster Printouts.3. Scanning - Quality is Good.NOTE: For getting the best scanning quality, we need to use the Software and Adjust the BRIGHTNESS and CONTRAST to get the Scanning with High Quality.PRINTER's DEFAULT SCAN SETTING WILL GIVE YOU THE WORST SCANNINGS. SO, BEFORE SCANNING PLEASE MAKE SURE, YOU HAVE SET THE BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST IN THE HP PRINTER SOFTWARE.4. Wifi - Connectivity - Best - Tested in Android Device through the App HP Service Plugin.CONS:1. Printer's Display doesn't have Back-Light. So it is very difficult to work in a dark environment. At this price range, they would have given the Back-Light for the Display.2.Unable to Update Printer Software. Whatever the software which comes in CD will be usable. This is the hassle which I faced."
5,"Print Quality :  Perfect print quality... don't know how many papers it I'll print...in printing reports it showing approxly 500 pages remaining to print...once the toner got over I'll update...Packing :  I didn't expect from Amazon, that packing was worst condition since it was Amazon fulfilled...just they sticking the shipping label over HP box and sent to me...due to this product can be easily damagedInstallation :  Easy to install...use you tube videos to install...WiFi:  Smart...very convenientAppearance : bit older model"
4,"Overall good quality ,have searched a lot about a printer with scanner for home usage purpose ,go through various products like intjet ,inktank and laser ,also have personal usage experience for the ink jet printers they are low price initially but the cartridge cost is high and u have to use it regularly otherwise its dried up ,So m confused between laser black and white or inktank colour ,but after going through various reviews online pushes me to buy laser printer ,black and white and i dont have much requirememt for colour printing ,so initial cost for this printer is some what higher then both other competitors but the maintainance cost is less as said overall ,so finally choose this one ,those who want to use colour printing photos prinitng can go with inktank also its printing cost is lesser then inkjet ,This is initial review will edit up after some more usage ,till now happy with my product ,as it has wifi connectivity ,also have scanning option ,and moreover easy to installl urself ,One kore thing want to add on this review for newbies like me u have to install urself no demo will be provided so go through material provided ,and thanks for making my review usefull ,enjoy"
1,"It actually took me more than 6-7 days to set this up before I finally tried to get some help here, no customer service at all! finally with permutations and combinations I was able to resolve it on my own. Print quality is ok, not that great. With wifi signal you have to struggle and find out IP conflicts etc, and its not easy to install at all. The print quality is ok. They send very less ink in the cartridge. within 3 days I had to buy a new cartridge."
5,"bets printer in this price rangepros:1.quality printing.2. comfortable weight and build.3.easy installation.4. wireless printing, mine is from iphone. hassle free connecting also from laptop and desktop.cons:1. display of details in the panel needs a torch pointed at it. should have had a better display.2. should have had a dust cover.Overall a great printer"
4,"I found the HP LaserJet Pro to have good printing, scanning and copying characteristics. However I was not happy with the LCD display which is given. It is very difficult to read the content given the size of the letters and the fact that it is dark. I think a backlit LCD would have made much better sense. I had to use a torch to read the content each time......"
1,"Easy to install , wifi hooked up easily.After a few pages , the print has become very light.Noway could the cartridge be over so soon.Has been very difficult to get in touch with hp service centre.No idea what to do. The 1800 number on Amazon is not working.. will have to go to local printer guy cause of no transparency in customer service."
4,"Model - M126nw. Professional tip: Always purchase an extra perfect toner with your new printer :)My Quick Find outs are - stars:1. Good Toners effectively accessible at just shy of 500 INR on Amazon so no stress over printing cost.2. WiFi arrangement and remote printing is very simple (by telephone or workstations)3. Utilizing it as system printer atm (by LAN port in my little office)4. Print quality is wonderful 5/5 for that5. Photograph Copy/Xerox are so fine, get befuddled which one is unique in the event that I duplicate (if duplicate b/w)6. Examining quality is pleasant as well.Cons:A few interesting points before purchasing this printer:1. Incapable to duplicate/examine huge size of papers (legitimate size)2. No backlight in computerized show screen"
4,"Great thing I feel is wifi printing and scanning. Good printing quality, easy to install, fast printing.I would like to tell you how to install printer through wireless at home1. Unbox your product and remove cartridge inserted in the printer2. Remove paper strip and a plastic cap from cartridge. Insert cartridge into the printer3. Keep your WiFi switched on and power on the printer. Do not connect printer to computer through usb cable4. On printer console switch on the WiFi switch. (There will be a WiFi icon on the button)5. On printer LED display you will see ""searching for WPS"".  Your WiFi has WPS switch so switch it on.6. Printer will be connected through WiFi and an  address will be displayed on printer LED.7. Insert your CD in the computer and do as directed. When it asks for Mode of connection then choose wireless instead of usb cable.8. Your computer will automatically detect printer then go next.9. After few minutes your printer will be ready  Any device (mobile, laptop) connected with your wifi can operate your printer."
2,"Wifi is for direct print/connection only, not to the wifi network. There is no duplex for this, and the latest HP Smart software does not work for this.Luckily we do not print much, so this printer does the job, but when you look at it, it feels that it was technology from 3-4 generations ago. It's a little expensive for what it is, but seems that when it comes to printers, India does not sell the latest printers/ranges at affordable prices when compared to purchasing in the UK.During scanning the printer sometimes resets itself, which is a pain when scanning 10+ pages manually and having to restart after the printer resets."
5,"Received printer in original packaged and good condition. Printer received before delivery date. After unpacked printer found intact and properly sealed. Printer is using since 3 days, running smoothly. I am happy and thanks to Amazon."
1,"Waste of such a huge amount of money as the print is not working when i fill up powder, when enquired with customer care they are just asking to buy Genuine cartridge which cost 4000/- which in no way a normal individual can afford."
1,Poor after sales service follow up. No representative of HP came even after following guidance given by Amazon executive of getting the product registered with HP. Had to separately spend Rs 1K to get someone from local market tech shop to help in the complex installations process. No one picks call at HP service customer care. Otherwise printer is as described and good. Installation with wifi and mobile installations are tricky
5,"It is a Back & White printer. I ordered thinking its a color printer..The Packaging and delivery was perfect no flaws in it. The installation was very tricky. Had to go through a lot of youtube videos to try setting it up using WiFi, but it did not work for me.Best thing to do is connect your printer to laptop using the cable and follow the instructions. Could setup the printer on my WiFi network without any issues. Print quality is ok may be because I am using a 100 gsm paper which is off white. But it does the job for home use or may be a small business setup."
1,"Beware , manual duplex printing means you have to physically turn the paper for back side print. Brother printers are better as same is available for much cheaper price. Don't commit the mistake what at least I did . Many Thanks . Cheers"
4,"I have been buying HP printers for last 15 years. This is my 4th product at home. Happy as always but the value for money is missing. Software are on CD and none of my family members have CD reader in laptops so had to download from internet on each system. Moreover setting up was little difficult, especially wifi printing setup. They did not provide any guide or tutorial for that."
1,"HP service is VERY POOR. This printer, is not a plug and play printer. It is impossible to install using the manuals which accompany the printer. One year Warrant covers only remote offsite support. Even after 4 months of purchase, HP could only establish printing and scanning through USB. The basic purpose of purchasing a printer with Wifi Connectivity is LOST, since the feature could not be configured by HP after repeated attempts.Providing FEEDBACK to HP is also to no avail. They are not proactive and have not ever bothered to check back with the customer based on feedback. DISAPPOINTED with HP service and support.I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PRINTER. If you do, please do so at your own risk.Print quality is good. Only One page at a time can be scanned. this is a limitation."
5,1. Easy to install. Just go through the instructions given in the booklet provided to you.2. Great look and attractive model from HP.3. Print from any device from anywhere.4. All in one printer makes your work easy going and hassle-free.5. WiFi connectivity help you go to wireless printing.6. Fast printing (only a few seconds)7. No printing noise8. Prints smooth like butter.9. Easy to operate an LCD panel with a clear display.This printer is suitable for offices only. Don't buy for home use at such a high price. I bought it at NO COST EMI. Thanks to Amazon Pay Later feature.
4,"Connect to it via USB or Wifi Direct and you are able to configure everything using a web browser.  You need to enable the Wifi Direct using the panel in front.The biggest problem comes afterwards from HP itself.  They have their own ""Easy Start"" software for the MacOS which is out dated and doesn't work with latest version of MacOS 10.15.7.  Moreover, it enables with HP web print service which is not required. My suggestion is not to install any custom HP software for this printer on the MacOS and just use the built-in drivers.Everything works fine once it is setup and it is surprisingly quick."
2,"It is very hard to setup. I am a techie and an engineer. Still, it is hard to set up this printer.1. It does not easily install drivers on computer.2. It does not connect easily to wifi for printing.3. It does not easily create a wifi hotspot to connect to for printing.The printing part if fine. There are not enough options for formatting what you have to print. It's all very basic printing.I would not recommend."
5,"Totally worth of buying and true justice of money. I loved the product, very nice printer in almost all aspects. I want to make clear it to all the others buyers that it don't print on both sides of paper you have do it manually by turning the pages otherwise it is very good especially the print quality."
5,"I was skeptical for buying such a costly, big amd an important electronic item online. But it was at very less price and a big discount. So i dared. To my surprise it came pretty soon and the package was well intact, the product was brand new, easy to install. The installation was done within half hour in my office."
2,"The print quality is pretty good however, the copy function is quite bad and disappointing. Direct wifi connect is really difficult to achieve. I even called a HP support personnel to get the direct wifi installed. But it still does not work. It is not compatible with all operating systems or even with Android phones. My personal recommendation would be to go for different printer."
4,"I was looking for laser jet without scanner and to my surprise not many options hence went ahead and bought this. I am glad that I have purchased this. The HP Smart app is simply amazing and with WiFi direct it works like a pro. I now use the scanner more than printer to scan and upload my kids h/w. Only disappointment is I am unable to pair with my WiFi, followed the steps but still doesn’t work. Got similar feedback when I did a google search. Another drawback is very expensive for a b/w printer."
1,"Worst worst worst, The print is very light colored, have to change drum within 2 days as drum is not ij warranty, photocopy is very light colored.... The input tray is damm loose built, you put the papers & it get shattered everytime ... If you keep it in idle mood, its get switched off easily and you have to turn it on again for work,Sometimes it doesn't print & you have to troubleshoot the program for printing.. not recommend for hig usage such as 700 print per month... Barcode not printing in .rpt files."
4,"I purchased this for home and very happy with this. Print quality is okay. What I liked is the wifi connectivity. Once connected using WPS on the router, it gives seamless printing access to all android mobiles, tabs and laptops in the same network. This is apart from the USB connectivity. One can print without connecting to router also - printer can be directly accessed through its wifi host from any device.However, HP's printer software suit installation took very long time. I think it is packed with so many unnecessary things. Once installed, my desktop and laptop started crashing and slowing down (Windows 10 OS). Issue got solved when I removed everything, retaining only the drivers. Not sure the criteria only with me!"
4,"Very much disappointed by the seller who didnt even pack such costly (to me at least dnt know about seller, he might have billions dollar) device in corrugated box or wrapper. It shows carelessness towards prepaid customers. I was not on sopt otherwise I would have returned the product and ask for refund. When I came to the place and opend the box what found is bottom side on top. Very bad experience so far with Amazon. I will never recommend and even if someone is going to buy from this seller make sure you select Cash on delivery bc once you pay them they will treat your products (basically your money) like wastage. So be careful.Now let jump straight to the product: Once you set your mind to purchase this model make sure you have good eye sight bc it doesn't have any light on screen which may affect your experience after purchase just like me. I didn't expect letters are such small so it's hard to see. Printing quality is moderate, have better experience with model M1136(very very satisfied, after 7 years and still running like a mad horse) which will save your 3k easily. Configuration of Wireless connection is really headache however somehow managed(you need seperate router), connection with smartphone: Haaaa!! I still wondering how it works, your phone could find the wifi of printer and ask for security password...but here is a twist..there is no password anywhere mentioned. You have to be Sherlock Holmes to find wifi password. Gist: Do not waste your hard earnings and go for Laserjet M1136 if you dnt need wireless printer and spend that extra 3k for poor old beggers or stray/injured animals through funding. BTW money is yours do whatever you want to do.."
3,"Printer is good . Very difficult to install on wifi . you need to see lot of YouTube videos . For MAC user its almost a headache to instal this printer and Eprint is almost impossible unless you are hardware engineer . There is specific ip address of printer , so every time you have to print you have to select  the ip and start the print . Wifi scan will to work on Mac ."
1,"This product is a big blunder. HP recommends the customer to change the toner if there is thin printing. If we look logically the printer costs around 16k and the toner costs around 4k, think of this, if a customer needs to change the toner as and when it gets finished for 5 cycles he need to spend more than the value of the asset on maintenance 😞😩😩. I strongly recommend not to purchase this."
1,"Printer stopped working after 2 weeks, when called HP support after 1hr of requesting, they agreed to send service guy.He gave us shock of life when he told Toner is empty, after printing only 200 pages.He said toner needs to be replaced.How it is possible?? I can’t return product as return window expired. What options I have??Never buy on Amazon.Never buy on Amazon."
4,"Just delivered the product yesterday... Installation process i found it difficult..The setup installation I installed from website since CD setup was showing error.Normal setup via USB was okay to setup.But I struggled a lot in setting up wifi...Gone through many YouTube videos for the same..Its working good now..Pros:Scan, copy,print in one deviceWireless option available.Cons:Device little heavy.Setup installation was difficult.Slightly pricey than other devices.Hopefully all should be worth it.Reducing one star due to setup installation."
4,"Pros:Works as expected.Wireless printing is supported on multiple platforms. Android, IOS and Windows.The HP smart app is really great.HP e-print service seems really helpful when not around the printer.Cons:Prints, especially the copies can lack contrast. A quick change in contrast settings should fix that immediately.The display has no back-light. Hard to see if the display isn't close (+- 30cms) to eye-level or when in dimly lit areas."
2,"I love the features of this printer, which have a WiFi connectivity, scan, copy and can add to a network.Printing Quality is good. Easy to use and there is no need of a technician for initial setup.The only disadvantage that I found was it's toner cartridge and display. Refilling the toner cartridge is disgusting. Display is same as Calculator displays. I don't recommend this printer."
5,Bought this printer as a replacement for another hp printer that I had. Was really impressed on how easy it was to set it up wirelessly. Used the wps button on my router and the whole process took less than 5 minutes. I have used it only for two days but the prints are very clear. I can print either from an Android phone or iPhone without any trouble.
1,"Don't  buy this printer, you can only print 20 to 30 A4 with a cartridge!"
1,"please do not purchase this printer, initially it works smoothly. I purchased it in 2016, in a year i printed only around 50-60 print. in 2017 i also printout only 10-15 copies. Now its not working  as shows continuously light blink and did not take print from computer. I have checked it various OS, other laptops,desktop also. But it wont print, only continuously blinking light. I asked to my friend who purchase same printer before 1 year. He is also facing the same problem. Even he exchanged new printer from thana office becaz his printer is in warranty. The new printer also shows same problem after 3-4 months. And this problem is not repaired, we also given for repaired but it doesnt solve."
4,"Price is so attractive, but consumes lots of ink. And picture quality is okay for this price. And best for office uses.Hp says ink cartridges need to be replaced but it could be refilled easily with the help of YouTube videos.I am satisfied with this product.But now a days better printers with ability to print from mobile devices are available in market with attractive prices.I just wanted a printer for emergency printing needs only so I bought it and I am happy with it."
1,I brought it for home use but product is not working... I try to call Amazon but there is no contact details. Try to refund/exchange it but i was told I can't exchange. How come company like HP and Amazon not responding for default product?? Very very dissatisfied.
1,making very ugly sound..and after print 20 pages shows low ink..worst printer ever
1,"प्रोडक्ट खराब है , चालू नहीं हो रहा है।"
5,Bought it for 1.7k worth for the money. I'm using HP laptop so no need of installation anything. Color and black cartridges available in the box. Checked both color and black and white print out. No issues at all.
5,"Call me old fashioned but i prefer paper over digital, so when it comes to read notes i want them in my hand , or when i want facts over a topic i want all the material in printed form, This printer helped me a lot in that , i got it for 1800 rs from Amazon, and it's worth so much than that , first of all its size is so compact and its built is very sturdy ,and i have a epson ink tank filter at office but this prints faster than that , speed is really impressive! Just go for it , pfa images depicting size of the printer"
5,"Good quality of printing,easy to install, getting colord  prinout eazliy at home use"
3,"Only buy if you know well about refilling cartridge and troubleshooting problems afterwards. Otherwise it will cost you a lot money. It only prints 100- 120 pages per cartridge. Replacing both cartridge may cost up 1500. So it costs 6-7 rupees per page. If you can refill the cartridge, then it's an value for money printer( then it will cost you time, lol)"
5,"Despite of all the negative reviews posted about of this product, I would say that this is a very good printer with competitive price. It always not true that cheap products perform bad. Yes, this one is a bit dedicated and you need to handle it very carefully.So far I have printed more than 100 pages black and white and more than 25 color pages including 6 full page images.You need to refill the cartridges at home, which as easy as to use the printer itself. After refilling black cartridge it is still working well.The only thing that you need to keep in mind that print at least one page daily, otherwise the cartridge will dry and that will create difficulties.Thank You..."
5,"If you are looking for a budget single use printer. This is best in the available products.My previous printer was also hp, but was very old, but there was no problem with it. Just Its cartridge cost was more than the price of this product, so bought this. Size is very small and it easily fits inside my almirah."
1,"It uses up a lot of ink while printing! And with pictures and double-sided printing, the paper (normal printing paper-A4, 70-75 GSM) takes a long time to even dry! Would not recommend it at all. Do not get lured by the cheap price of the printer. It ultimately is not at all an economical printer."
5,"working fine from last 15 days. took 10-15 colour prints and its doing good. not sure how long cartage will last but its good for now. Also, i noticed genuine cartage is as expensive as printer :)"
4,"First it is value of money 100 percentage,and thank u Amazon  delivered the item in 24hrs I unexpected, this printer advantage is print good quality, I print continually 20 pages the print is little bit slow and it's support android phone connect with otg cable working properly, I study many commands in this printer but 50percentage are fake comments iam thinking, we insert a4 size paper means it did not stuck so use a4 sheet paper for good use, and I print 20 pages in 1 day,  so it is good to use and we can refill the cartage easily it available in you tube you can see and fill the ink Easily, The we get 100 ml ink bottle in Amazon or flipksart at the prize just 250 rupees, and I use and command later✌"
5,NICE PRODUCT BUY EVERYONE ITS SMALL AND LOW WEIGHT OF PRINTER IT IS BUY THIS
5,"It does exactly what it says. I don't print often so I didn't want to invest in a costlier printer. This worked like a charm,  the colors are vivid, the B&W print is sharp. It's not too slow but it is a bit noisy which is ok. It was easy to set up. Happy with it so far."
5,"We print about 10 pages a month, so this printer is perfect. Yes, it's a bit slow (10 sec/ paper) and a little noisy, but honestly that's nitpicking. The speed or noise are not disturbing in any way. I also read a lot of reviews about cartridges not being available - not true. It was probably an issue in August alone from when the reviews are. Only problem with this printer - double sided printing is not fun. I'm still trying to figure out how it works when there are more than 2 pages."
4,"For very occasional home use, this is a very good printer - I previously had a MFP Inkjet that stopped working after a very long gap of not using it, For those who have very infrequent use, I think this small form factor is better. It is so light weight and fits just above my CPU - see pic! (so I can remember to take occasional prints to keep the printer live). Bigger printers (like Ink tank) definitely turn out cheaper per page in long run provided you have that much use/ year. But in a scenario of WFH in the corona lock down needing to take occasional prints for office and kids school use - this one is the best!"
5,The Printer is good for self home use . But the New Cartridge cost is more or less equal to Printer cost . HP should look in to Cartridges of Economical Printers should be cheap also
5,"Guyz. Dont go for any kind of cartage printer.. if you really need a printer, go for ink tank printers. I know its costlier, but almost 30 time (calculated) more efficient.. believe me of repent like me.. ,,🤣"
1,I am giving 1 star because its sucks inks like anything. Ink cartridge is too much costly and hence makes printer un usable and waste of monty
3,"I have been using this printer since 2019 and I just took prints and thought why not write the truth about it.I have printed over 2000 pages till now and I have been using the same Cartridge that came with the printer when I bought it.I just refill the Cartridge instead buying a new one. The New Cartridge by hp can only print 50-60 pages. You can refill and prints as many pages you want.Buy this printer and buy the ink bottles you get. 2ml of the refilled ink gives me at least 60-70 prints.The ink bottle will cost you around Rs. 150-200  and it will have 100ml. That's roughly 5000+ prints give and take.So total investment = 1500(Printer) + Ink(200) = 1700/-That's roughly 2 rupees per print! By the time you get around 2000 prints, your printer cost is covered and the next prints will be free of cost."
2,"This prints 20 to 30 pages only (incl.black and color print outs).The main drawback is once the original ink is over that's it..its a waste..either.You have to buy Hp black and hp color inks(price is higher than the printers price) or buy local brand inks and get an average colored print outs.My opinion is to better buy good printers which is more than rs.10,000/- so that the cartridges refilling costs you less and also you can take good qty and qlty color prints."
5,"Its good in this price range,  if you want to printer only 10-30 print in a month then buy otherwise go for laser printer if you need more printing as for more print , cost will be higher.Its for home usage"
5,Good for home use.its speed of printing is so best than other colour printer.its print quality is also best. but only one thing which is not good that it's cartridge cost is high.
4,Nice product
4,"It does the job alright. Easy to install on my dell laptop. As i use this to print confidential document occasionally( 3 to 4 per month) , it serves the purpose. Prints fast. Quality is also acceptable on Draft mode and Ink Saver mode. But the only downside is that although i used the black and white for printing 25 pages so far, the ink level on color catridge reduced to 50 %.  Not sure how this is possible. But black ink came down to only 75%."
2,Product are good but not CD drive and missing 1212 drive in online
1,Aftervtee prints only black cartridge stopped working properly. Printing half text. Did all trouble shoot n cleaning but it gives hard time
3,"Warning! It does not work with Mac. The printer was detected and job queued but nothing prints. I had to use a windows computer to print. In terms of quality, it is average. Cheap printer can't expect much. Black print few letters are smudged or unclear but acceptable. I'll probably throw it away once ink is over."
5,Awesome printer... Bought for only ₹1900 during the early benefits for prime members of Great Indian Sale Prime Benefits.. Must buy this printer for home use... Happy to use..
5,"Simply the best printer I've ever come across. I just needed a printer and not a scanner included which always malfunctions and ruins the entire product.The product was packed very well and was delivered within five hours of me having ordered it. Package included two 803 cartridges, one with black ink and the other coloured ink.Installation software was downloaded from the HP website and took a few minutes and I was ready to print within half an hour of halving received the product.It's been more than two weeks since I've been printing on and off and you don't need to print everyday to keep it going, once a week would be enough to keep the ink in the cartridge from drying up."
1,"Don't ever buy this printer, the catriges  will be empty just after 10 prints and no matter how many original Hp catriges you buy from Hp the printer never works. This printer is just a disposable printer. It never works after printing 10 pages. The seller didn't even gave me any invoice with the printer I am cheated by both Amazon and Hp."
1,"HP is selling absolute trash in the form of this printer.I have been hardly able to print a few pages and the printer is now not taking paper correctly.I tried all options but it always takes one end of the paper faster than the other and so the paper gets stranded in a slanted manner right at the tray, wont go in.Very disappointed customer, have been cheated before on HP laptops and now add a HP printer to the list. Never going to buy anything HP from now on, much better options out there.Stay away from this cheap excuse for a printer."
2,Read carefully before you buy. This seems to be an old model.
2,Software CD is damaged and I am unable to install the software. After printing 20 document pages the cartridge shown less than 50%. I wants to return the same but option is available in my order but it do not proceed after second step.
2,"Its cheaper to buy this entire printer again rather than buying it ink cartridges,One cartridge prints about 30  A4 pages at best quality, its a good emergency-use printer, but seriously dont waste your money, save up a little and go for an Ink-Tank printerThis has way too many problems for its costBut, the print quality is surprisingly amazing, the printer has that plug and play usability and its a one click print kind of a printer.Still the concept of ink cartridges has scared me enough after buying this printer.....would never recommend anyone else to buy this"
5,"I am writring this almost after 2.5 months of usage. The printer printed almont 100-120 black and white pages and only 10-15 colour pages. Those of you who are using windows10 on old laptop and PCs, installation can be a bit of a challenge. But the printer works fine even with old laptop models. Follow the following steps to installing printer drivers correctly:Go to : https://www8.hp.com1.Go to support option2.Click on Softwares & drivers3.Click on printer image4. Type ""HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1200 series"" full name (no initials) in the textbox5.Click Submit6.Download all the softwares, drivers and software utilities under drivers tab before installing for smooth installation.Note: Please check printer compatibility with your system before buying."
3,"Printer is good for home usage where u don't need to print daily or in bulk..its not for students wanting to printing study material, bcz it only prints 120 pages after that u need to refill cartridge..also since it's a basic printer, it's kinda slow.Otherwise print quality is good and colours are great and vibrant"
1,Today received package.. Setup done correctly.. but not single page came out printed.Printer unable to print pages ....blank pages comes out of tray every time !!!!Pls suggest any setting or thing need to done with initial setup which I might not done yet...OR is it defective piece ???
1,"This device is having a severe issue while connecting to Apple devices, namely apple iMac, Macbook Air.Its an issue with drivers as drivers are not functioning appropriately on apple devices.Logged a case with Epson technical support team and received pathetic response from them as they are saying that this is an issue with Apple devices and they want apple to create drivers for Epson product... Pathetic...Technical team is not a technical one.. worst experience.. Never go for this product if you want to use it on Apple device and also you are not bothered for any technical support may need in unavoidable circumstances. Pathetic experience..."
1,Epson L3110 printer is not good its worst printer please don't purchase this model go another model in this printed photos bad and not setting4/6 paper setting is problem West your money Epson service center said about this model is text printer only so not a photo printer please don't purchase this model i safar this
4,This is nice Printer which is very easy to install the process to be followed is given online in many videos. The process is very simple1) Unbox the entire printer with all wires2) Then find the 4 ink bottles & open the part to pour the same3) pour the ink in the right ink cartridge of the printer4) switch on the printer & then a long press of the red button post which it would take close to 7-10 minutes (ignore the different sounds)5) your printer is now ready once the lights stop blinking6) insert the cd & connect the printer to the computer7) follow the process as in the CD.Will take a good 20 mins if you plan to install all the drivers.The print quality is good. The price seems a little high but only time would tell if the printer is worth the money.Would have been a 5 star product except for the plastic used that looks a little flimsy. Plus have seen a lot of videos confirming that it can print only 30000 sheets.
5,"This Printer is awesome, and fully automatic, it can print HD quality photo without color distortion. Only one problem, regular printing is must, else printer head will jam with dry ink. Till 2 months, I have taken around 1100 pages color and b/w experience awesome pleasure. I will suggest to buy this rather previous models. Only black ink is reduced quickly."
5,"If you were using CHEAP Inkjet Printers with expensive Ink or EXPENSIVE Laserjet Printers with EXPENSIVE cartridge then it's about time you switched.Bought on 19th June 2019, Delivered on 24th June 2019.Used for 1 day, but took about 600 prints in a day. Both, coloured as well as black n white.Opinion - Excellent print quality and very cheap also.Basically, the print quality will not be upto the level of a laser jet but the cheap operational cost makes it worth buying. For whatever purpose you want to use it, the prints are awesome. Even the photos are printed in an excellent manner on any type of paper.Before judging the quality please ensure that you choose the correct type of paper you are using in the printer settings. Example - If you choose glossy paper in the settings for a photo but are using a normal A4 paper then the print will not be that great. Whereas, if you choose A4 paper (Plain Paper/Bright White Paper) the same print will come in an excellent quality.The printer has wifi direct option, if the printer is in range then kindly use the network of Printer itself, it is quite fast. If you are using it in an office then you can use it over a Wifi network (Setup can be done in a normal way using network SSID also and using WPS button on the router also).The printer is fast when Standard quality is selected for printing whereas the printing is slow when High Quality is selected as it takes more details into consideration (For reading purposes, not much difference between both, Standard is the option you should choose).For printing double sided, settings need to be selected from the printer properties. It is not automatic, so you yourself will have to take out the paper and input again in the manner shown in the dialogue box which appears automatically. It is hassle free and printing speed is good.I would definitely recommend buying this printer to everyone. It is economical, convenient and user friendly.PS - You might decide on the basis of other reviews also but then again I have tried and tested the printer. I bought Onsite extended warranty for 2 years also so I'm set for a period of 3 years without any hassles. I hope the review helps. If you have more money go for the one with digital display, but do check the quality of printing on that over youtube reviews before buying."
5,"This is currently the best inktank printer one can buy in this price range. Very satisfied. One would not miss the touch screen as once u connect the printer with ur phone with epson app, all the functions can be accessed and setting can be configured. Scan quality is very good and this is one of the best printers you could buy for photo printing. The quality is very good. There aren’t any problems but if I have to nitpick, I found that the print speed to be slow when u give colour print through phone. That might not be the case with everyone as I could have a problem with my network or it can be fixed in a software update. Other than that, this is the printer you can chose blindly for home and home office. Very satisfied and finally the per page cost is also very low compared to inkjet pronters. The right fit for my home and I believe for many homes too👍🏻"
1,"I have used purchased this product as a replacement for my Epson L220. After one month of use (around 1700 pages) I am not satisfied with this product. below are my experience in detail.SPEED: Speed is no way any improvement over its predecessors EPSON L220 or EPSON  L380. It has average printing speed with a very frustrating issue of  getting stuck between prints for 3/4 sec if you print more than 5 pages continuously. this problem really tests one's patience  specially when you have a lots of  color copies to do.PRINT QUALITY: Print quality is average.My previous L220 prints little better images than this model. document print is below average too.. photo print is not recommended. can not pull more than 180 gsm.  ONE MORE major  problem is print head need  to be cleaned every 2/3 days. line between texts is a common problem and text are not sharp as it should be.PAGE YIELD: I wonder why Epson mark this printer as eco print. I have print only 1700 pages (mostly text only) and as you can see in the image above the black ink level indicator is already down below the third level, means one more step down the tank is empty. As per the  EPSON web page , B&W page yield should be 4500 pages. I don't think it can print half of that count. its really very disappointing should be shame for EPSON.My verdict on this product is that this product is not suitable for high use, doesn't worth the money and totally not recommended for commercial use. One star as it goes."
1,"Very very bad product . Stay away from buying.1. Build Quality is very poor , very poor quality plastic used. feels like it may brake here and there.2. Initial Setup is very much difficult. there is no display so its really very hard to input ip address and ip details.3. Wifi direct is there. but no where the password is written.4. Wifi network address needs to be configured each time the printer is powered on.i am not able to take a colour print or scan a page as set up is yet to be done. will write the print quality after the setup and first use."
5,"Model : L 3152Seller : Appario RetailPrice : ₹10350Bought on : 30th Sep, 2019Extremely good product, print quality is excellent. Setup is also easy.This product is very similar to L3150 but it has a blue highlight.Before setting this up please read  comprehensive user guide which is available in L3150 product page in pdf format. Trust me setup is very easy.Many people are saying that WiFi setup is complicated but it's not. Using instruction anyone can setup wifi connection. From then it will connect automatically but it takes 1-2 minutes to connect. Till now I have not used the cable to connect the printer with computer, WiFi is all the thing.N.B. : I have used WiFi direct option only.Recap:1. Fill the ink2. Charge the ink3. Run nozzle test (1 page)4. Take a printout of WiFi password and all that stuff (3 pages)5. Setup WiFi5. Download Epson iPrint from Play store6. Start printing and scanning.Hit like if helpful.🙏🏼"
1,Don't buy. Not value for money. If you want multipurpose printer like Epson old L SERIES printer which can print on anything. This L3110 supports only on 70-80 GSM paper..
1,"photostat not working more then 4 pages same with the scan taking more then 3-4 minute for loading or i don't know why taking time so much, i am owner of my business facing everyday same issue. totally waste of money."
1,"I had HP 6830 before i got some printhead issue...Don't waste your moneyIt is not a good printerSpeed is slowPrint quality is lowWifi response time is slowU can not give continuous command.. u need to wait for previous task to complete...Black and white are okBut colour is not poor...Only good thing is ink tankThat's it!!I will update you more later..After my complaint..I m a prime customerI called in customer careThey saidIf it is damaged only then, we can take it..So suggest u to go for Hp ink tankHp ink tankHp has much much better quality.."
4,"Its working fine, speed is too good. Earlier I was using Leaser Printer. Leaser printer ke takkar ka hai speed main. I can also take print/ Scan while there is power cut. Best Printer for Small and Medium office, don't know why others putting adverse remarks perhaps they are using it as photo printer, actually its not a photo printer and not suitable for the people engaged in photography profession. but for others it is ultimate."
1,This thing does not work. I tried to reach Epson customer service but couldn't connect. Amazon customer service is also not helpful. Both Epson and Amazon are giving bad experience.
1,Don't ever go call your printer service man they will just waste your 50 percent of ink and there is no solution for good printDaily you have to do head cleaningNo worth of buying this
1,"L3150 is not a good printer , printing is very slow , scanning is also very slow copy is very very slow"
1,"This is  is not a user friendly product, trust me.I had an epson L150 -the ink tank non wifi one.The build quality of that product and print was excellent .This on the other hand was rubbish,If I print over wifi direct even if quality is set in high ,It still is a 5/10 print.The ink tank seems to finish ink fast.The epson app is the worst,so undeveloped and troublesome to use.I can't find a way to connect the printer to the  wifi ,I can't  find a way to use remote printing  or to even register my product on the epson site as INDIA is not listed in the countries allowed to register.It's low quality printer.And who uses a wps router? I don't see why I can't directly connect my printer to the wifi without that.The bottom line is ,unless you want to break your head using this product.Dont buy it,my cousins got an hp wifi printer and I used theirs ,setup was easy and overall side by side.I really realised how bad epson is at their tech.The last printer I had was good but this one is disgusting and low quality build.I REALLY REGRET BUYING THIS PRINTER AND I DON'T LIKE ITS BUILD QUALITY OR PRINT QUALITY."
5,Good
4,I think I had taken a very good decision buying this from amazon because The first printer I received was a bit defective and did not work properly but amazon helped me through that tough time they replaced it with a new one without any call or message they didn't even ask a question for replacing. I never thought amazon would give such service In these though times now the pros and the cons of the printerPros1.Epson customer service is very good2. Print speed is very fast and much better than canon and hp but the print quality is not that good if you compare with canon printers3.Now the best thing about the printer is hp andCanon use print head where the ink dries but this printer stores the ink where it has to print and then prints it that's the main reason why I bought it above hp and canonCons:-1.Very big compared to hp and canon printers2.Is a bit expensive than hp and canon3.Paper gets stuck if you a slight old paper and if you use a paper that is folded the ink gets printed in the paper you( can notice it in the first photo)And I see many people ask can you print with you mobile with the usb versionAns:Yes you can print with noko print application though you can see some adds in the appI have written by using 30 minutes of my time hope you find it helpfulAnd if you are confused where to buy from amazon or Flipkart I would recommend you to purchase it from amazon
1,Pls don't waste your money
5,Print quality  is really good. Budget and cost effective printing.
5,"Pros: 1.Very small size, Less weight,only 4.5 kgs. Brother Hp weighs 10 kgs in this category.2. Very cheap to refill. OEM epson inks are cheaper than competitors. Also duplicate inks are half the price and available easily. You cant get good duplicate inks for hp and brother models.3. Very fast Printing speed. 33 pages p/m in BW mode is amazing.4. Easy to refill ink tanks. Easier than filling a watterbottle😜5.multiple printing options ie. You can print even visting card using this printer.Cons: 1. Could have added PVC id printing options. Higher GSM card getting jammed.2. Sometimes full color printouts on 80GSM papers gets stuck and torn because of some exposed plastics under the printing headWill post a long term review after few months"
5,"It's amazing. This Ink Tank printer is so much better than my HP Deskjet 3630. Here's why -1. Printing speed is substantially faster2. Quality is superior.3. Build quality is great.4. The EPSON software is highly customizable5. The Noise is minimal, you won't even notice that your printer is doing its job unless you're in an extraordinary quiet environment.6. And most importantly, the COST OF PRINTING is way too low. The inkjets will burn your pocket if you print 100s of pages for your study or research or whatever. And believe me the injection process to reuse cartridges are just plain harassment. What you get with Ink Tank printers is cheap Ink bottles that are just too easy to refill and cost of printing will be like 1/500th compared to the inkjets, at least theoretically.So, don't think twice about the cost of the printer compared to the Deskjets, this one will save you a lot of money in the long run."
1,This printer is very problematic. The conventional Epson Blinking lights error is still existing on this model. Just after printing 10 gloss paper printing the printer doesn’t work. Now forever the lights on the printers blink and I cannot do anything about it as there are no solutions for this sort of error other than taking it to service. I requested for refund instead they providing me replacement. I just hope the other piece works just fine.
1,Pathetic support...Since last one week trying various options to install printer software and driver...but not getting through...eventhough service person temporarily managed but again failed to do setup...both online. And with CDs also... asked customer service agent also...got feedback that same problems with this series ....going to return the printer....Disappointed with EPSON....
1,Very bad product.. Printer printhead jam just within 3 months/500 pages. Very bad after sales service. Customer care executive are not supportive. And service technician doesnt come at scheduled time. Overall a very disappointing product.
1,"The printer was in good condition the delivery was quick and superb. I called up Epson technical team to send someone for installation. They responded quickly and the guy came in 2 hours.The bad part was that it took him around 1.5 hours to get this printer up and running since there were some initial firmware issues. Once it was resolved the printing was happening correctly but the scanner/copier failed to work at all. The technician tried several times but it did not work. I had to, unfortunately, return the item."
2,Scanner glass damaged ... on arrival..........
4,"WiFi connectivity from laptop to printer is really a difficult task but one thing you have to remember that if printer is connected to laptop through WiFi there are two options named as Epson l4150 and Epson 553D32 will be shown under printers and Faxes heading and whenever you want to print you have to opt EPSON L4150 Series for data cable connected process and EPSON553D32(L4150Series)for WiFi connected process under the heading ""How do you want to print your picture"""
1,"The printer is best for first 14 days (its my personal experience) afterwards its start showing problem of ‘both light blink’ i.e. paper jam, no printing no copy. After searching the solution in YouTube (due to pandemic situation onsite visit are hold by company) it came to know that, this is a universal problem in ‘EPSON’ printer and surprise that still the company not able to solve this.Once log the call, the call center revert quickly while discussion with the technician he confirm that it’s a hardware issue need to solve in service center only. My frank opinion before anyone wants to purchase this please visit YouTube and search ‘Problem in EPSON’."
1,"paper jam problem,head errors,malfunctioning"
4,"1st day experience. Info page showing fail status and wifi password cannot be retrieved. Lines appearing in prints and not solve even after head cleaning twice and waste lots of costly original ink. Printing stops in middle and paper has to pulled manually. Though to replace the printer and Amazon told to contact epson. Epson once disconnected my call saying techical problem. After called them they gave complain number. This printer was not in my budget still somehow managed it and this happening. Very important exam after 3 days. Now should i study or stress my head this box which epson calls printer. Aaa thuu. Will amazon or epson compensate for the lost ink or my precious time or my cool of mind to study.Update after 16 days usage.Printer is good. Print quality is good. Fast. No auto duplex is sad. Ink is costly.Advice: no screen so, installation was difficult. Better call technician for installtion. Will update later if any problem found"
5,"If we use normal paper to print black-n-white, quality is not same like my HP laser printer, but if we use glossy photo paper to print image, quality is just AWESOME! However, I am having problem to understand how it works in wireless mode, it's not very smooth to make it work from Mac or iPad or Android. I would give 10/10 for quality and cost, however ""Easy to use"": 6.5/10. May be we could not figure it out properly :("
4,Very easy to use and convenience of wifi. Easy setup. Good accurate color reproduction on photos. However on normal kodak photo paper (200gsm) it makes roller marks (multiple vertical lines due to pressure and not ink). I don't know why we can't improve this technology to use something like pinch rollers in cassette decks which dont scratch. Very silly to have this kind of issue in printers made in 2018.
1,"Amazon doesn’t allow me to return the product. I won’t be able to return the product after 24h September. They just hold the return date to be passed. The product is not convenient because when a paper is jammed, I have to open the front cover with a screwdriver. I am not willing to do that every time. Please support me for returning the product.Thanks!"
1,"CONNECTING TO WIFI EVERY TIME IS A HEADACHE , IT DOESN'T CONNECT AS QUICKLY AS A CELLPHONE, YOU HAVE TO ERASE THE OLD SETTINGS , SWITCH IT ON AND OFF SEVERAL TIMES TO GET IT CONNECTED. PRINT SPEED IS TOO SLOW. PRINT QUALITY IS OKAY. IF YOU GOING TO USE IS MAINLY AS A WIFI PRINTER , STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER. I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW AFTER 3 MONTHS USE AND I AM FED UP WITH THE CONNECTIVITY PROBLEM."
5,"Iam writing this after using this printer for a month. Before its purchase i was confused with other printers like most of us are in between hp 410, 415, brother t 510w.To be honest this epson l 3150 is best printer with minimum ink price. Best in class picture prints provided u use fujifilm glossy photopaper of 180 gsm.Very sharp and clear images with original color combination.Photocopy works well u are printing less than 25 prints at a time it works smooth under 60 seconds it will photocopy.All I can say it's the best wifi printer with very easy installation, one can install on his/her own. Wifi direct function is so easy to use.Finally dont read too much reviews  about this just go ahead. Iam using this in my hospital with daily 1 color print and 10 photocopies.Iam fully satisfied."
5,We purchased this printer and are happy with the value for money that it is providing us. THANK YOU Epson and Amazon...
4,This is a direct wifi printer and it's really worth having it. Wifi increased the usability by many fold. Epson creative print application is not supported by this model and to me it's a negative point for the printer. Scanning speed gets reduced after few continuous scan however for few scan it is ok. Photo quality is better then L380 and is acceptable. Roller mark as vertical lines are observed on photo that is negative for photo printing. Epson demo person are not equipped to give demo with demo photo print.
3,"I purchased this printer a few months ago and have used it for several printouts till now. I had to b really thoughtful about its feedback , simply because buying printers online is quite a challenging decision especially the notorious reviews posted by many. At the end you trust your gut and make a decision. For most of the time people desire everything for the lowest price possible however please bear in mind quality demands research and money! So this is what i feel about the printer -1. It looks great. Infact it looks pretty classy.2. I love the print quality. It does so much justice for the image you want to print.3.  I paid 4890/- for the printer. The image print output is pretty satisfactory.4. I printed a lot of sheets. Like, i totally went crazy with my print outs. I was working on a vision board project (more like a vision wall) and It required quite a bit of printouts. I hate going to the printer shops with the images I want to print as I have privacy issues. But so happy this printer did not even fuss once and facilitated smooth and steady printouts.5. The installation was a cakewalk. It is compatible with my iPhone and Mac. Easy peasy. I love user friendly technology.6. I have always inserted one sheet at a time. Why? because i find that arrangement quite hassle free and convenient.7. A couple of times the paper got jammed. #commonprinterproblems. I did not feel that I should mind that. Given the convenience of home printing. Everything is better at home.8. I took prints on regular sheets as well as glossy sheets. I would tell you this- , sheet type hardly made a difference. In future i'd use a regular sheet. Not a glossy one. I just tried glossy because may be I expected 'photo print quality'. While the print quality was great, the final print washed out the glossy effect. So it is redundant.9. The printer uses the 803 ink cartridge and that is where the catch is.10. 803 print cartridges clearly read that they are disposable and meant for single use only.11. The original cartridge exhausted quite early. I am able to say this as I later ordered the refill ink and refilled my cartridge and I was able to get more prints this time. (It might be because with the original cartridge I printed glossy papers and they consume more ink. MAY BE. I'm just guessing.)12. I watched a couple of Youtube videos and learnt how to refill the cartridge. I followed instructions and Viola! my printer started to shoot prints again.13. Now , when you refill the original cartridge the printer's ink indicator does not read it. Which you'll learn to adapt because in moments your printer will be shooting pages after pages.14. SO after several and many prints It was time to refill the cartridge. and Guess what...It did not work. I tried everything. The prints turned out horrible. The ink was spilling all over. Even inside the printer and that made me very sad. Nobody likes a tardy looking gadget!15. My conclusion is that HP is right. 803 does not allow a refill. Even though the ink sellers claim and list that it does...It does not.16. The first refill was may be a lucky shot. It worked. I was very happy. The second refill was a  complete fiasco.17. Eventually I discarded the cartridges.18. I logged in to Amazon and wanted to place order for fresh cartridges and guess what. Out of all the HP models , 803 has the most expensive cartridge. That made me very thoughtful and cautious.19. Unless HP does something about the price of the Ink cartridges, the ink will blot your enthusiasm.My verdict - It is a great printer. I love it. Love the print quality. But 803 is an EXORBITANTLY PRICED ink cartridge. May be i'll try the refills again when my next cartridge arrives and update my review just in case i am successful beyond the first refill attempt. (UPDATE- the refill completely did not work with next new cartridge ran dry. Also I noticed that the new cartridge printed half the amount of papers from last time. Not sure of the decline)I am not complaining because ultimately I have to take everything into consideration. But going to the printer shop is a BIG NO for me.Review Update 7th March- I realized the cartridge purchased from Amazon I.e 803 for this printer is not compatible. My printer didn’t read the color cartridge. It was an old generation piece and the black ink cartridge leaked during printing. It basically suggests that the cartridges are either refilled or not genuine. I later purchased them from HP website. Even though expensive I was content about the fact that they are genuine and have same business day delivery. I love the Amazon returns policy. They accepted the opened cartridge and refunded quite promptly.Review Update - Jan 24- it’s been six months the printer has been completely useless and I e been wondering what to do with it. Selling it on OLX seems like I’ll be cheating the buyer. I switched to a new ISP and the printer would not connect. I registered the call with HP CS . There was a lot of hassle. After spending around 72 hours back and forth they sent a technician. The printer just didn’t detect any connection with the phone, laptop and the WiFi. Technician refused to take any responsibility and said Ive been entering the password wrong. The technician and customer service people were so smart to place the blame because apparently the only device not connecting to the WiFi amongst the whole list of gadgets was the printer.Final Review is that as excited I was , it fizzled out so bad, that it is ridiculous to even think of giving the machine away for free as I’ll lose face if someone asks for a demo! I thought I’ll bear with the super highly priced ink but for a printer that doesn’t sync or connect, it’s a waste! It’s like a marriage which you realize is going bad within 6 months of being married! The benefit with the printer being - you have the freedom to discard it!Interestingly I also feel that the shelf life of this printer is meant to last only for one bundle of sheets you buy. The printer exhausts post that! If you’re looking for a heavy use...you must buy the really expensive ones! Yes. That’s true.HP customer service experience is 0/10."
5,"Printer Is Good But My Experience It Is Not For Heavy Use If You Use It Heavy,Large Documents Print Than It Is Surely Loose Your Pocket For Buying Ink Cartridges!!!..It Is Only For Home And Occasional use..I Am Buying It During Amazon Great India Sale Very Discounted Rate So It Is Awesome Deal For Me.Received New Hp Seal Pack.Pros:-1.Wi-Fi Range:-Its Cover My 2Bedroom and Hall Successfully But Little Bit Take Time To Connect My Wi-fi Dongle(My Desktop)2.Automatic Updates:-Printer Is Automatic Update When It's Connect To My Wi-Fi RouterA Little Bit Difficult Process To Add To Printer On Wi-fi Router And My Desktop ..After Some Try I am Successfully Connected To Printer With My Wi-Fi Router.CartigesBoth cartiges is original color print is good if you print branded photo color paper butI am not understand why my black color cartiges vaporize automaticaly and create light black spot on my new printer many places.Anyways this printer is good for light use and home use like personal photo print,personal printout,importent document to scan etc."
4,"The cost per print is very high , I hardly went up to 40 pages and the black ink is already depleted ! , the connectivity is not an issue seamlessly connects with your devices , but the rate at which the ink depletes is very fast , this is suited for people who print once in a while and also when they need the print to be confidential which you don’t get in an internet centre. Strictly not for people who print a lot."
3,"I bought this product and returned it after 4 days.Coming straight to the pros and cons :Pros :1.Its quite affordable in a price range of 5000-5400 ,given the multi functionality (print,scan and copy)it performs true to its claim.2.Its super light to carry around. Can be moved around easily if needed as it uses cartridge which is dry and does not form bubbles as in an ink tank printer.4.Gives good prints both coloured and b&w.5.You have the choice of purchasing either of the cartridges, depending upon your usage,  b&w or coloured,in case of find it costly to buy both,and still it would function absolutely well.6.Gets easily connected to a laptop by the USB.CONS:1.The most difficult part of this printer was connecting it with the mobile wifi or wifi direct as they call it in the absence of any physical technical support and one gets immensely hassled in this process,as they do not provide any demo or at home technician service to help you connect for the first time.It requires a whole lot of things like router,dual band wifi, and though they claim and try to enable an easy connectivity with wifi,which it isn't at all.After some time you almost give up on trying to connect with wifi and simply get your work done by directly connecting with laptop which it does good .2.It is not mentioned anywhere on the Amazon app the cartridge that you get with this printer are only dummies meant for 20-25 prints ,and not the real ones.And so you need to buy them along with this printer if you have got to print at least 50 pages.3.Though its inexpensive ,but its costly in the long term as it gives you only 100 bw pages per month with a newly bought cartridge which is way less than the ink tank printers.So this printer is budget friendly,and a good deal for low usage like occasional homework and assignments of children,or ticket prints etc."
5,"very nice air-printer.. no need of wire connection..  i connect it to my wifi router (wireless) & use that printer with all devices (mobiles, laptop & computer) which connected to wifi..."
1,"Never Buy this model for one reason :-original new cartridge gives hardly 20 color prints , even black color prints as well.  Print quality is VERY GOOD and BRIGHT.manufacture manual says 165 color prints ,it's NOT true ,they need to change this statement."
5,"The printer is super cool. Obviously the printing cost is very high, no doubt. But at the same time you should know how to get around it. I refill the cartridges myself.. And to be more specific, I refill with the original ink bottles HP Gt 52, yeah.. The print quality is awesome. If you want to further reduce the cost, use the local ink bottles that you get at around Rs 100 for 100 ml bottle. That would be much cheaper. One bottle gives a print capacity of 1000 pages. One time refill would give a print capacity of 100 pages. So technically, the print cost is reduced to as low as 10 paise. I am still using the cartridges that came with the factory shipping and have already printed more than 500 pages consuming only 50 ml of ink.."
5,Couldn't really pair using mobile but was able to pair with Mac using wifi Direct. Very limited instructions provided. Had to press a few buttons to print out instructions stored in the printer itself. So took some time to figure it out. Connection using usb was instantaneous. Works just fine. Cartridge was included and printer displays cartridge left. Happy with it for now.
4,"Very nice product. Wifi configuration took time, but results were amzing. printing directly from phone, makes life more easy. i  was expecting this to be duplex printer, but didnt find that feature, need to explore more.Recommended product for home purpose and small office purpose, Copy and scanning is easy through HP smart app on Mobile phone. Overall nice product"
5,Does what’s it’s intended to do . Setting up the app took a while but now it’s smooth . Print quality is better in this price range . Haven’t used it much extensively but whatever I did was smooth.
3,"I have been using this printer for the past 3 months and I am writing this review now as I wanted to give the other customers a very genuine review on this product after using it.First of all, this is not absolutely the best printer for daily use. The one and only reason for that is the ink price.The HP 803 cartridge used in this product will always give you a headache while buying a new one. The cartridges set (Black n color) will cost around 1800 rupees which is quite high for an ordinary customer, and the cartridges last for only 200-300 page prints in normal quality. There is an option to refill the cartridges after it is exhausted but it won't work after 2-3 refills probably.I used this product for my project printouts, study material printouts, making copies of documents, bills, etc in a regular basisfor the first time after the cartridge was empty, I was able to refill it using the ink bought from the Amazon.in site itself and was able to take another 150-200 printouts before it was empty again. The 600 rs ink bottles are enough for 10 refills. But on the second time after I refilled and started using, after few prints the cartridges were spilling out more ink and sometimes no ink at all which resulted in incomplete printouts and waste A4 sheets and i had to buy a new set of cartridges which was nearly 43% of the product costPROS1. Excellent Working2. Good Quality Printouts3. Easy to use3. Copy/Xerox Feature (Both color and B/W)4. Wireless connectivity (Very easy printout using phones directly: Requires HP Plugin installed in your phone)5. Good HardwareCONS1. Cartridge too costly"
4,"Cartridge rate is higher except that all are nice. It is nice printer for home use and price is also affordable. If the price rate is adjusted than this is the best wireless printer. It can scan,print and we can do xerox in it."
4,"I don't know why the seller has listed this product as HP Deskjet 2622, even though what I received is 2600.Anyways, for Rs. 3999/- it is not a bad product at all. Every feature is the same as mentioned in the description. The printer comes with 2 cartridges (color and black) that was very easy to install. The print and copy quality is perfect, and fast also.I am happy with the product, apart from the fact that it is giving some problem in connecting with my phone. Once I was able to print directly from phone, and the next time, the phone showed the printer is unavailable.OVERALL: Very good product for the price."
5,This printer HP Deskjet 2729 is really amazing. It's printing quality of both color and black &white is very very clear and good.I like printing quality of this printer.Dislike about this printer is that it is pretty slow during wireless connectivity.But I can say that just go for it...
1,"If you have no where to waste your money, this is the one. Most irritating product I have ever purchased on Amazon. The functionality of printer is hilarious and if you don't have patience, my advice, refrain from purchasing. The ink run at super fast like Jamaican Usain Bolt speed.Note: Amazon you should publish my review or don't wala such product."
1,"The product is not recommended at all whether you use it for home or office.best are ink tank printers. twice or max thrice the cost but worth it and effective plus cost saving.Color photo quality is worst of all the printers (Epson, HP, Canon) i have used on kodak paper.Cartridge charges (rs. 700 each) are too high and yield is like max 40 color photos/print and 80 Black n white prints.I had some urgent need of photos so took the printer in use and all i can see is the pink color photos.Very bad experience with HP this time."
1,Worst...after 20 pages b@w ink showing low...nd dat was only documents print out..
4,"Product is really nice, I have booked Canon first, but it was faulty. So ordered this HP2622. What I felt is the plastic quality is much better in HP.First when you on the printer, connect to the printer using Wifi, then one page will open there you can connect the printer to Wifi networkOnly problem I noticed is when I put single paper, the paper does not go properly inside and the printer throws feed error. After multiple attempts (30time) figured out that the paper to be inserted below the roller to have proper feed or else the roller will pull the paper one side, this is definitely some problem to fix or what I dont know"
2,"The printer is good, but the black cartridge got over in just about 45 pages printing, not satisfied with this though, haven’t counted on the colour printing yet..."
5,The colour cartridge sent with the printer is defective.So either replace the whole order or replace the cartridge by tomorrow.
4,"Many buyer's here complaining about wifi setup for printer is hard, Might be taken note of by HP. With hp smart setup application for mobile and desktop/laptop it was seamless experience and really easy to setup printer + wifi for wireless priniting without any  trouble. Infact, mentally i was ready to face same problem but no such problem faced by me luckily.As of now, I am not using any USB cable to take my printout, Everything via Wifi, Be it from laptop or Mobile. In case, Anyone still feels the same issue, Refer to the blue book titled Reference and Support. On 1st page in bottom you will find the solution itself.Cons -  For now only 1. Explained below.I gave 4 star because, Ink is fast depleting property be it color or black. In case you have daily print out of anything more then 5-6 pages, Don't opt for it. Otherwise, Excellent for Kid's homework and minimum printing job."
5,The printer is good obviously so no issues there but initially i was given a used product which i wasn't happy with i got the replacement and it was great. I liked the product as its compatible with all my devices as long as it's connected to my wifi. Without the wifi i can connect the printer to my laptop and presto!! It works. My advice please look up the setup videos by hp before you get started.
3,I've been reviewing it . After my 8 months of usage . This is a low load printer . I never expected slow print from this product . I've been looking for better one again .Pros:* Speed in Connectivity* Easy to access at low price* Compatibility* Easy to equip and less weight.* Colored printsCons:* No double side  print available* Sometimes we've to wait to load* Maintenance is bit high compare to laser jet
3,"I bought this printer for home use. The cost and features are good. You can print from mobile as well. The wireless printing works very well. The printer is quite good.Now comes the catch. The cartridge cost. HP 803 original black and color cartridge costs anywhere between 1200 to 1500 rupees. Contrary to the claim I was able to print not more than 50 pages before the ink dried. It could be that ink dried due to non usage for couple of months. However, the cost of new cartridge is mind blowing. Looks like companies make money out cartridges."
3,"HP needs to work on improving customer experience. It's a nightmare trying to get the drivers and getting the WiFi feature work with the product. I choose to use cable for quick printing. Print quality is ok ok. Packing was good. Comes with cartridge. For scanning, one need to have hp snart app installed and nedd to use it for giving scan command to printer."
1,"We received this product and unfortunately did not start using it within the 10 day period allotted for returns. So once we tried to use it we had continual issues printing, it actually didn't print. After many calls with HP support they agreed to send a technician after they realized it was a printer defect. The technician came and then said he would have to come back with a replacement part. After that visit he no longer responded to our calls or texts and we've been unable to get a hold of anyone from customer support. We've had this printer now for a month and it hasn't worked nor are we able to get it repaired or replaced. Terrible experience."
2,"ProsGood looking with pure white exteriorEasy to installConsLonger lasting cartridge is a false statement, i got the new printer with dry cartridge, had to order a new one, which dried out with 20 to 30 pagesBulkyWhite color sure looks good but prone to getting dustyAlways takes 2 to 3 attempts to connect with phone appI used the 3050 model prior to this for 6 years and still find print quality better in thatCartridge is difficult to find in ecommerce sites and even in HP onlineNo resale value - due to the cost of cartridge and very short self life, nobody wants this printer"
3,"Printer is really good, easy to setup and operate. Very handy with print copy and scan.Unfortunately soon after printing two papers, I started seeing problem with the default cartridges that came with the printer."
5,This is my favourite product that I brought in 2019. Easy to install and use and the wifi  connectivity is also strong. I brought it for printing homeschooling materials. And it’s working efficiently plus it’s budget friendly when you manually refill the ink. You need to be a little patience with the ink filling thing. Scanning & copy also functions smoothly.
3,Printer good.wifi function dont require other working hot spot as it has its own wifi to connect mobile or ipad.so nice use.Issue with hp 803 cartridge orignal orderd from amazon but printer didnt recognise it.techincal support team said to clean points of contact and all but nothing happnes now my printer is usless on table .just first cartridge change caused issue.also coslty cartridges .so not recomend
5,I bought it bcoz of brand name.And it provedGreat print quality but it could be better.It's easy to install.Easy to use.Effortlessly print.The cartridge should print more pages.The cost per print should be less.Overall it's best in its price range.
3,"A good printer for beginners or school kids, because it's very simple to setup and use, but the high CPP @Rs.5 to Rs.7 is not worth it. Will discard it very soon and get an ink tank all in one with auto duplex ADF. Don't let the low initial cost fool you, at best you can get about a yield of 100 b/w pages, so unless you absolutely need a printer immediately and can't afford the initial cost of an ink tank, I would strongly advise against buying this."
1,"I made a mistake... humble request to you please don't purchase this...Warranty got over its not working ( not turning on) machine has turned into a piece of junk .. after warranty service is too bad, no troubleshooting steps over the phone for every single thing you need to take it to the service center....Cartridges too costlyInstallation easy but print yeild is very low.Those who think that this printer's supplied cartridge will yeild around 50-60 pages(colour or black) are highly mistaken it didn't give me a yeild more than 10-15 pages (colour) & 20-25 pages(black) .So if you think that this is going to give you a high yeild so you must give a second thought about it.Wireless connectivity is easier but it goes worse if the button is pressed,creates problems in reconnecting with the wifiI requested for replacement but Amazon team cancelled and it's returning to seller now I can't get a replacement I need to wait for the sale so as to get it's price dropped bcoz it's the second time it's price has increased from 3699 to 4499 now..."
4,THE printer is fine .service was good but the problem is..IT IS BETTER TO BUY A NEW PRINTER THAN A NEW CARTRIDGE..i always use genuine things but this printer is only worth 3 colorful pictures..that is it..even black and white depletes before 40 prints..if the pictures are not that colorful then may be a few more..HP or any other printing companies needs to see this..the manufacturing costs for this cartridges are not that much..but still it is unfairly priced..you can not heavily print at all not even lightly..that is the problem..it has to be more efficient
5,I liked the printer for the price and quality. But the free cartridge which I received with the printer was defected. And had to buy a new cartridge. So just because of the black cartridge I wasted my 3 days thinking y the prints r not clear. And when I gave the colour ND black and white print separately I figured that the black cartridge is a defect that the seller has given me.
1,On receiving the printer I was able to connect the printer wirelessly and print copies without any issues. But the second time since I moved out to another Wi-Fi network I am unable bring the printer to set up more and connect the printer to the network. I tried a lot but unable to get the printer to connect to Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi light keeps blinking does not stay on.Can someone help me? I cannot return the product as the return Window is closed.
3,"Would suggest look for a notch upper hp printer. , this is for the basic home user , has WiFi connectivity for easy prints directly from mobile . Installation took a bit of time with WiFi not getting connected properly but once done then it was working fine . Too many pages get sometimes stuck though"
5,I bought this product yesterday and tested all its functions which are working perfectly. Results are very good. So far so good.......rest time will tell
1,"This is very worst product. Cartridge stopped working after 20 page print. And help line said go to service centre which is more than 90 km, and they said buy new cartridge which is 1800 INR cost. Now think guys printer is 3000 n cartridge is 2000. Don't buy this hp is robbing Indian customer s.Anyone can call meI want to sell this dabba for 1000. 2 months old.PRAFUL9818868839"
1,"Basic problem? The paper in mechanism. IT DOESN'T TAKE IN PAPER. Its a vertical feed at the rear, and horizontal out the front. Either the paper just dosen't get pulled in, OR gets pulled in titled to one side (right) and hence the printout is skewed, OR (USUALLY) the paper tilts a bit, then remains there, while the printer prints (no idea on what!) And shows the job done. In last 40 tries Ive only managed 1 print and 2 photocopies. DON'T BUY."
4,"Pros: Delivered in time. Setup is easy. Liked Mobile app feature. Did test prints and satisfied. Got full volume of ink in default print cartridges, which are 680 series. These cost RS 1150 as combo, for kind information to co-custumers.Cons: The power socket was wobbling, a poor design. But I managed with a tape inside so it holds good. This is on the down side.Caution: Any printer goes for a toss as the time passes because of dust accumulation. I had the experiences of dysfunction of wifi connection, double side printing, paper injection mechanism etc. This is my 4th printer in series. Bought printer cover as well because for me dust control is top priority given the worst experiences in the past.Value for money at the price of RS 5999/. Flipkart sells at RS 4999 or 5199. Amazon should compete here.Trust the above helps."
3,"My cartridge ink is over within a week, I have not taken even 100 prints also. Never used color as well. Bad quality cartridge. False promise on the number of prints it gives."
3,Print quality is good but the cartridge performace is so poor. Just print 75 paper and cartridge  empty.
5,Got the product with no cartridge and with one used cartridge in machine where black was empty and color was half.....also packing of old quality as if used piece
1,Worst product . Especially software for this product is very poor.Need 8 apps to run a simple printer.That too tiring steps that will take almost one day for successful installation if you are lucky.Cursing my self for buying this.Please buy some other PrinterI am using printers for past 20 years never faced such a tragedy
3,This is the position of the catridge after just one print. Totally dissatisfied with the catridge quality. Installation is way too easy. Printing directly from smartphone is also easy. Nice product but useless catridges.
1,"1 Printer Cartridge will print ~80-100 pages(one side only) only and that too when we took print in Economic mode, Plus if you try any hack to refill cartridge...It would not work at all. Every time you have to buy cartridge of Rs. 650-750 range... If u r ready to spend Rs. 8-10 per page(single side) you can go for it. They are earning money by selling highly priced cartridges and low cost printers...It is a trap..Don't buy, our most regretted shopping ever."
1,"Bought this product absolutely two months back, Now i am getting a error msg on the screen Cartridge is not compatible with this printer, and when i talk to the Hp Customer care and this is one of the worst customer support that they got. They are asking me to buy a new Cartridge, Very Funny.......Simple Words, Only worth for Two Months, If you got an extra day or Month you are very lucky.....Worst Product, and More Worst Customer Support..."
1,"It so harrasing ,not easy to set up ,it takes more time and total disappointed"
4,"Printing quality is very impressive, you can choose up to various printing modes like draft, normal & best, you can directly print by hp smart app from your phone, there is a mobile fax option too, Printing speed is also fast but not very fast, main problem I m facing is an alignment problem in an input tray, whenever I want one print out then additional sheets also come in an output tray automatically sometimes though they are not printed but still it's frustrating.  Overall it's a good printer by hp."
5,"Easy to handling and good connectivity throught WiFi and Easy to install and good product to use and maintain easy. Category also 680/- RS something, both black nd white and colour"
1,Very poor quality product. The printer was making loud noise and yesterday its stop working. I hardly printed 10 sheets. Yesterday when I was trying to Print a page i found its making a loud noise and on opening the front panel i found that cartridge was banging left and right and then came the shock i found two pieces of a platstic strip. On research i found it is called encoder strip. I am frustrated and don't know how to fix it.
5,Nice printer for home use at this price. Printing speed is little bit slow however for home use it's manageable. Overall printing quality is good.I am not sure how much prints we can get from one set of cartridge but as of now we took 50 prints and still the cartridge showing 75%.
1,"I received a very  cheap quality printer as i used only for one time second time it was not getting on, as I came to know  that mother board is out of service,worst! pls think before buying it."
4,"Althoughh the printer is very good, the promised extra black cartridge has not been sent along with the printer.the gift voucher of Rs. 1000/- which can be used in BATA  and other outlets not enclosed. Please arrange for immediate compliance."
5,"So far good prints. Didn't use high quality paper till now so can't give any review on that. 80 gsm paper prints are good. Good for school projects. Loving the scanner. Document feeder is a relief when scanning multiple papers. Photocopy print quality is manageable, definitely not great. Great thing is any material can be scanned, ofcourse that shouldn't exceed A4 size and shouldn't be sharp. I scanned the front of a purse and it came out very nice."
3,Not see
5,"I was confused with Canon pixma E560 and HP 3835 but after searching all reviews and HP support system I bought HP. Only disadvantage with this is that it does not have auto duplex feature. But other good features like print speed/no. pages weigh down that disadvantage. Go for it if you are looking for long term, home/small office use wireless printer."
1,"The product looks good and also i dont have any complain for quality but the issue is with the cost per print, i have installed 3 sets of cartridges and in one set not able to print more than 15 - 17 pages, so its better not to print anything on this, its a showcase product for me now... i strongly suggest not to but this product"
5,OUTSTANDING PRODUCT FROM HP VERY SATISFIED AND ULTRAFAST DELIVERY FROM AMAZON I ORDERED IT YESTERDAY IT SHIPED TODAY AT 12:02 AM AND GOT IT TODAY AT 4:42 PM VERY ULTRA FAST DELIVERY FROM AMAZON I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT ALL THE FEATURES ARE EASY AND USEFUL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE READING MY COMMENT TRUST ME IT IS THE OUTSTANDING PRODUCT FROM HP NO ISSUES WITH HARDWARE SYSTEM ALSO ACCEPTS IT EASILY YOU CAN BUT IT
5,Overall I am satisfied with this product. Did not check print quality for an image.Pros1. Value for money in this price range2. Easy to install3. Looks great4. Touch displayCons1. Copy quality is not sharp2. Eprint feature is not easy to configure. You need to assign static IP on your printer to use this feature.3. “Print anywhere” feature is not available on this model. The HP smart app on the mobile detects printer only on home network where the printer is available.
1,"This is one of the worst printers from hp. Installation, connection, ease of use everything is fine. BUT IT JUST DOES NOT PRINT IN COLOUR. I have been wasting days with tech support trying to resolve the issue, but nothing has happened till date. I asked for a replacement, they behave as if they can't even read that line. They just keep making case ids after case ids.I've been using hp printers for over 2 decades, never had any single issue with any of them.IF YOU WANT A HASSLEFREE PRINTER... PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER... REST IS YOUR CHOICE!"
5,"I bought it around 3 weeks ago, and found it really useful and up to the good standards. So far no problem. HP Smart print app enables print from anywhere. Dedicated printer email id enables me to print anything by sending the document to hpeprint.com email address.The size of the printer was a little larger than I expected, but that's fine. Also, not sure if anyone uses Fax these days.Overall a good buy."
5,Product is really good but No extra Black ink included
1,"2 days after buying the product i m facing printing issue for which i tried to contact to HP service care but they are just saying that , your call will be transferred to so called senior. and after that i waited for half an hour then they disconnect the call. this happens every time.when i asked that why u r not connecting after tranfering the call then they replied that its not my problem.who is responsible for it?now i will take some leagal action against it if i will not be served within 2 days."
2,"Print quality is great, very easy to install and operate but within two months of purchase the document feeder stopped working. Without document feeder we cannot copy legal size paper. This ghe major flaw I have faced using this printer otherwise ig is great."
4,Good product but connecting online with devices is bit of challenge. It appears apple devices synced very fast but windows taking time.
1,"Overall NOT Recommended.-Dosent work with Phones-Useless App doesn't work at all-Scanner is not working, App Dose not Support.Wasted loads of time make it work.-Dead Slow Printing-Does not work with Phones."
3,"Cons:Not worth the money. Problems with colour printing-sometimes it prints in grayscale. Driver needs to be reinstalled every time this issue occurs. There is no option to select colour and grayscale separately which means a colour document will always print in colour. It uses a lot of ink for colour prints. The power connector is loose.Pros:ADF is a great feature reducing manual work.Overall, if you do not need adf, you can always go for a cheaper model like 2621. HP as a brand is good and my previous model 2545 served for 7 years without many issues but this model certainly has its own problems and it is definitely overpriced."
1,Printer is extremely slow even from Laptop via WIFI. It takes ages to print. Want to get it replaced or corrected.Any help ? It does not respond at times and looks a complete waste of money.
4,"A great printer. Scans well, prints fast, works good online and offline. Connectivity options are best. The best part is the email id of the printer. We can send the documents via email directly to the personal email id of printer and it prints automatically.The problem is with the direct wifi connection. Prints takes too much time or often fails to print incase of wifi direct connection.Second thing which should be improved is the mobile app of the printer. App only shows some specific folders of internal storage. There is no option to find the documents stored in sd card memory. I can say app is a disaster while compared to printer functions.And yes, i like the touch screen as well."
4,"Scanning via Auto Document Feeder scans random parts of the page. No solution from HP support till date. This is an inherent flaw in this model that HP knows about since many years and has still not fixed it. You can see several threads about this problem in the HP forums, just google it. Other than this issue it works fine"
3,It's been exactly two months since I've purchased it... I'd not recommend it for colour prints since this really has too many issues. What I mean is that investment is really too high to what you get in return! Though I'd like to mention that the black and white print outs are Good and it is easy to install and use once you get it installed in all the aspects! I'd rather suggest everyone reading my review to invest in some ink tank printer cause it would be a one time investment and returns would be good!
4,"The printer is very good. Quality of print is nice. Installation is very easy as well. You will get lots of vedio in YouTube related to installation. One issue is that if you try to scan multiple documents at one go from top, the scanned pdf gets most of the images and data cropped. This issue is being reported by multiple user and whatever workaround given by HP didn't not work. So basically the multiple image scanning at one go functionality was not properly tested by HP before the product release. But if you are scanning individual document by opening the copier lid, it works fine.Apart no other issue. Printer is awesome for home use."
1,I get the order faster and then i used it for 2 days and 3rd days it's stoped working i don't know what's to do whether take it to hp care or return to get replacement .... I taken it to hp care .. after one week they handoverd it to me and again it's stoped working .....In hp care they suggested me to DON'T BUY AT ONLINE . Because they have sample items ... Ugh worst ever ..
4,"After using the 3830 extensively, got this. The usual HP issues with the cartidges being short on ink and running out just when you need them the most is present in this as well. What peeved me the most was the intermittent and unreliable printing over direct Wi-Fi or over the home network. Perhaps it's my printer, or something else.Why buy this? Document feeder for scanner. If you need to scan multiple pages, the document feeder is valuable feature.Also, re-filled cartidges can be used if needed. Don't go with the rated prints, you'll get about 150-200 B&W pages on the regular 640 cartridge and 120-130 pages on the color."
4,"This works well... initial setup is not cumbersome...better to connect to a computer and do the setup i recommend from my experience.. firmware update is necessary to enable the scan feature(in my case ).. print quality is ok ok , print alignment is not that great,may get better later I think.. copy black and color both works fine, quality is also good..."
1,"Cons and only cons1. Gave print in Black and white, it is printing in color.2. Too slow. Description mentioned 8 ppm for black white print. It is hardly 3 ppm.3. Black cartridge got over with mere 60 prints.4. HP Smart doesn't know what is happening to the printer.I have to find a way to return this god-awful product."
5,I purchased HP Deskjet 3835 All-in-One printer from Amazon 2 months ago and my review is based on my experience what I got from it.Pros-I myself installed the product and I had no problem installing that as I got irritating people printed with manual.Pages printing qualities superb and decent timing is taken to print a page.It is good for home purposes.(My opinion-you can go this for this printer it's good pages printing quality is also excellent .It can scan copy fax its wireless also can use it through mobile also using its app available on play store).@3999Cons-ink is little bit getting drained.
1,"Really bad quality product from HP and pathetic support.The paper gets jammed every time I try to print. (Se picture attached).I contacted HP support, the support engineers came after a week. They initially said a part is faulty, but later didn't change it. They said its fixed no need to replace the part. In few days the paper jam issue started happening again.Its really painful to contact, first they will make you talk to a bot. After 30 mins of chit chatting with the bot, if your session isn't timed out, you will receive the support phone number."
1,"Mac users beware! It doesn’t work on Mac and You cannot return this product. Although the description says eligibile to return within 10 days, Amazon just won’t accept a return. 1 star for not mentioning in the description that THIS PRINTER DOES NOT WORK ON MACUpdate: Brought up my old windows desktop and tested the printer. Prints came good but it has roller (continuous dot) marks when printed on glossy paper (see the attached image). Contacted Amazon and they replaced it. The new one again has the same problem! So, look like the issue is with the printer model/batch."
1,the Cyan ink bottle is only half in quantity I contacted cannon for this but there is no response from them this is a cheating of some kind.
5,I bought this printer for 7603/- Only With Extra 2 year OnSiteGO Warranty. I am using this printer for around 5 days and here it is my experience.The Look of this printer is very good.it comes with 2 Extra Bottle of Black Color. Installation of this printer is so easy follow the manual or call for support it takes around 10-15 min for Ready The Printer for work.Print Quality is very Good.Printing Speed is very good. For 1st Print it take 30-40 sec time but then it take around 10 sec for BW print and 30-40 sec (Based on your content) for COLOR print.Pros--Cost of printer is very less as compared to other ink tank printers.-Cost Per Page is less around 8-20 paisa per page.-Printing Speed is very Good (8-10sec for BW/10-20sec for COLOR)-Cleaning and manianting is easy-Borderless printing is avilable-Document Scan with MAX 600DPICons--SOme time it make NOISEOverall this product is very good : )
5,"Model: Canon pixma G2012.First of all, abt the printer: Its best at it's price segment .I got it for 8k...well it's orginal price was 11.5k.Along the box you get 3colour ink bottles, n 2+1 blk ink bottle, power cord, connector to pc cable, user guide, warranty card, install soft cd.Note: Canon Pixma G2010 n G2012 are same (only you get 2extra blk ink bottles in G2012)Pros:1)Canon colour prints are always best than it's competitors like epson n brothers printer.2) It's very durable n having less paper jam.3) print output is vast you can use the printer for abt 6months without refilling if you are using regularly also.Cons: (these are not actually problems or negative sides, rather these are customer points of valuation)1) bigger in size than other segment canon inkjet printers.2) print speed is 10pages/min, so it you want more faster prints then go for laser printers not inkjet ones.3) the supplier company doesnot provide extra package over the original printer box, (although canon company's package is quite enough).Apart from printer i wld like to mention the size of box is large n weights 10kg around (with printer itself 6.4kg). So you can guess it's bigger one but portable, thus shipping is done by surface shipment(means it comes by delivery truck) so it takes some time to arrive n be patient to wait.As air shipment doesn't assure the product to be received undamaged so amazon prefers to ship via surface shipment to assure it reaches customer end safely."
4,"This is a very economical and user friendly product.1) Ink Tank is integrated and filling ink is very convenient.2) Can make quick copies and operation is very easy. Can directly  take a color photocopy also...3) Saves a lot compared to Ink Catridge printers.4)Most importantly it works on Office/Home  Battery back up system, (remember  Laser printers require higher power and often don't work on UPS systems.)5) Cost per page is low.6) Scan quality is good.7) Allows manual duplex printing.Cons1) PC Hangs during high resolution scanning......2) Paper feeder on top , so cant leave the paper in the tray always (you can't close the protective flap when paper is in the feeder).3. Paper falls down after printing , if the paper holding tray is not pulled out.4. Not for professional, heavy use...."
1,Not working properly paper jam print quality low color print not proper mix colors print
1,This product isn't compatible with Mac OSX. Confirmed by Canon India. The older model G2000 is compatible with Mac OSX. Strange that the newer model isn't supported. Product video is misleading.
5,"Print quality is good.. i tested color printing on both A4 and 6*4 Photo glossy paper it is good i will rate 4 out of 5..you will get 3 bottles of Black ink, 1 Yellow, 1 Cyan, 1 Magenta.I strongly recommend you guys watch Canon Pixma G2000 series Installation videos on youtube. there are few complex steps while getting it to run correctly...."
3,"The item delivered at night.  Invoice provided with (downloaded) has no mention of product serial number.  For availing warranty, service centre matches product serial number printed on product with that of the product serial number mentioned in the invoice.  I requested invoice with product serial no.  but not provided till date."
1,For black and white printing this printer is good but color printing is really worst and not worth for color printing...no return policy makes buyers very difficult as this product really un-realible
5,"Reading all the mixed reviews I wasn't sure if I made the right choice. But now I can say that I was right. Packaging was good, installation was easy, took hardly 30min for the complete process and the prints are awesome. BW prints are crisp and clear, color reproduction is amazing. I have attached an image printed on normal paper at high quality. This image is blurry as my mobile camera is not good but the original image is a lot better. Scanned color image is almost similar to the original. Only issue is that the USB and the power cord are a short. And the best part is that I got it for less than 7,500 during Amazon prime sale under lightning deal and HDFC bank offer."
5,"Awesome print, standard color xerox has turned out to be so good and crisp with colours and details. Amazing product. Check out the picture. One on the left is colour copy and right one is magazine."
2,"I purchased canon pixma G2012 printer through online which is received on 30/06/2019 Sunday in good condition. But I am failed to install the printer to my windows 7 computer.  Because I think the installer CD drive was not sent for the machine, but it was for G2010/G22110/G2210/G2410/G2510/G2610/G2810/ & G2910. Photo of the CD is added. Now in this condition I wish to get your help and suggestion about easy installation of the machine to my windows 7 computer so that I can install and run it smoothly. I am a regular customer of amazon. When I insert the installer disk in my decktop com. and click on MsetUp4. exe it shows that 'this program can't be used with the current operating systems.Thanking youMatilal Debbarma, customer."
5,"Go for it ,No doubt bestI was shocked that people and shopping sites were giving very less feedback for this cannon product. Some people are following crowds , crowds are going for Epson then all following instead of applying their brain.I purchased it at price of 7199 after 10% cash back discount &and at this range no one can compared it with other . I am using it from 2mnth without any problem.Print quality =superColor/Black print= superScanning= superThe main advantage of this printer is that it compact Design you love it , it's ink tank was inside the printer so you can move printer easily without any disturbance."
5,"Works decently (using for 6 months or so). I'm down 2 bundles of printer paper already but the ink is more than 3/4 full even now. Of prints ~97% greyscale (B&W)(70% draft quality and 30% good quality print), 3% colour (varying qualities on printer paper). Not the most portable - because the ink tank printers are meant more for economy than portability - need to ensure every tank is locked down before moving to prevent ink spills. Had a few papers stuck up with cheap 65gsm paper. But no problems with standard 70gsm and above (most of what you get in shops.)Scanning works well too. Canon software works well for all basic purposes( that's as much as i need).All in all, i think, this is the cheapest home printing technology that you can get right now. I printed a bundle of paper in a day as i found its effectively cheaper than getting it all photocopied and definitely much cheaper than getting it printed in a dtp center. And canon functions well.Only thing I would have liked to have is wireless connectivity (could have got a higher model for a little more)."
2,Initially the printer was amazing purchased in October 2018 but now i.e. around July end i started faceing issues of paper jamming and then the color head of the printer is damaged according to me and i am unable to find any color head for this printer online even when i found one it costs 3.5k with many negative reviews. I would soon be calling canon customer care and then update the review. I wish they give some discounts regarding it's still in warranty period.
5,"The printer is very good. Easy to install and look wise is also very good. The print quality is very good; I do not understand why some people have said it is bad. It is very important that the manual is read while the installation is done though it is very easy, it is highly recommended to read the manual.Over all the printer is very good, works very nice, and quality of printout is excellent."
5,"The printer is very good and u will get 3 blank ink with box and one set of 3 colors, very easy to install and use the ink tank is inside printer which takes less space compared to HP where ink tank is outside"
1,print quality is worst... it gives zigzag printing... canon and amazon said that this is not fault. not considering it even issue...
1,It's a waste printer as before we learn printing one page we would have eventually wasted all the color ink. It's sprays the ink internally without a paper thus wasting the ink. Quite difficult to understand and adapt the behavior of the printer.
1,Product name is Canon Pixma g2012. And kit including warranty card is of Canon Pixma g 2010. Cross checked with Canon India. They refused to provide any service in warranty. Even serial number is also not matched to any of Canon product.
5,"Bought for home use, which could be an overkill!, but cost wise better than cartridge ones.Comes with 3 black ink bottles, which is a big plus.Easy to install on own, taking care when filling ink - and better opening one bottle at a time.Worked well with Linux , not needing any driver etc.At tank filling, and initialization, levels in drop by 15% for black ink, around 20% for colors, since some ink will get filled in tubes. No ink levels seen in Printer settings, obvious as its manual check, though it has low ink detection.Regular prints come out fine. Photo printing (on 150gsm) comes ok with no streaking, except for roller lines which etch onto the page but not noticeable from a distance. Photo printing would need some calibration wrt to Monitor & print color. Better to use either canon supplied software or other photo suite.Scanning utility interface (IJ Scan) is not that friendly with multiple dialogs coming up rather than managed it in a single app window.On Linux not yet gotten scan to work successfully."
5,"Good product overall. The only drawback I felt was the paper feeder. In this printer, the paper feeder is at the back of the printer. Because of this the paper feeder is open all the time and there are chances for dust to accumulate."
3,Writing review after using it for 2 years.Print quality is fineSpeed is a bit slowColours are perfectMajor drawbackDoesn't support mobile printing...which seems to be marketing strategy as it has usb...some software print using mobile seen it on youtube but it's disheartening that CANON cheated on this part as they excluded this model from their app of mobile printing...other brands of this range support this feature as its very basic one just need to update  software for it.But after repeated requests they denied that its not capable but I have seen a shop owner doing that perfectly using third party software...SO CANON IS AT FAULT THEY SEEM TO DELIBERATELY MAKING INCONVENIENCE FOR PEOPLE SO THAT THEY WILL GO FOR HEIGHER MODEL
5,"Hi Have reviewed multiple feedback and then placed my order and when i received the product, I was happy to see the performance.Quality is GoodPrinting time is also perfect and Black & White print is really fast with excellent quality.The most important part that I observed, is it through errors in details like : You did not power off properly and switched off directly from Plug, Paper Jammed, print quality change etc. I liked the printer, and would suggest people that opting this printer is not a loss.I know in this model Wifi is not available but happy to take a bit effort to print through USB as at this cost I cannot expect Wifi.....Thanks a I hope this review would help you to decide."
3,"Pros: Multifuntional, i.e. print-scan-copy or all in one printing machine, Low printing cost, good print quality.Cons: Ink blockage in pipeline if printer not used for few days and flushing is d only solution for recovery, and a huge amount of ink wastage/draining will be there for d flushing operation.Very much noise during paper intake.Sometimes paper jamming hazard.Power cable and usb cable orientation is improper and length is short.Verdict: Over all performance is better than other printers in d same price range and hence can be bought."
1,"Very much dissappointed with the performance os the printer. I installed it as per the guide book but lot of noise is coming and the printer is not responding at all. All sounds like kat kat kat is continuously coming and the error shows E03, sometimes E02, P02 etc etc. I specially ordered it for my 4years daughter so that she could have her exams smoothly during this lockdown period. But now I have no choice but just to wait for the replacement. I dont know when the replacement will be made but one thing is sure that CANNON cannot compensate the loss which my daughter will face because of the non availability of the printer. Very very sad experience."
5,"I had great confusion between Canon and Brother. Finally bought this Canon G2012Reviewing after using 3 weeks.1. The printer is Canon G2010 as model when connected. The only difference they added is there is a LCD display and copy + button. Else is same. But LCD is useful to know status. There are two blacks ink additionally in the box...which will face our black prints throughout years.2. Print Quality is awesome. You can expect a photo print quality when used glossy sheet (attached yellow poster).3. Normal sheet printing aslo great. (Attached vintage poster).4. Speed is as followsAn A4 borderless color printed at maximum of 40-60 seconds.An A4 document printed at 5-10 secondsAn A4 xerox at 2-10 Seconds.Speed varies based on colours used5. Connectivity - Laptop connectivity is good.. Use can also print from Android using OTG. (Nokoprint app recommended).6. Scanning - Quality is great... You can scan and print which looks like printout. We can also scan and store it as pdf.7. Canon software - There are A-Z printing functions available in the app... Only thing is the app is slow. There are options to print borderless, collage, passport size maxi, calendar, visiting card, pamplets.8. Overall you can go G2012 if you need multi-purpose printing. Scanning - Xerox - Print - Borderless - Mobile print.Highly recommended if you are more creative."
3,"it started making noises from paper feeder after 4 days of normal use, even with silent mode.color ink also makes good quality paper wet and deformed shape.i am okay with this just for using to print papers for reading offline. it may not suit to others for regular home use.it is also very bulky and heavy than shown in.pictures.i highly doubt the published pages per ink bottle. the color ink seems going away quickly."
5,"my usage is very less maximum 50 pages per month. its still running good quality of printing is great. black ink capacity is higher than epson, HP. two black ink bottles are bundled with this printer scanning is also very good. only problem after ink filled move this printer or when relocating take this printer very carefully to avoid ink spillage."
3,"PROBLEMS IN THIS PRINTER :-IF you use TNPL paper , the paper would get jam very often. Printer is a bit noisy too.The cartridge placing area and when you loadand lock the cartridge it automatically unlocks and black cartridge which result in paper jam and ink loss. If you do ink flush to fill the pipe with ink in case of removing and re inserting cartridge it would consume 30-40% of your ink within each ink flush .ROLLER JAM is a common issuePAPER LOADER JAM is another issueerrors that i received are E02, E03 , E04 etc. This is my replacement product for first G2012 .It is solely for WINDOWS No good ink tank printers in this price range other than hp 310 but their services are bad but Canon i think its better but I'm not sure . If budget is around 8300₹ there is no other options available than hp 310 and Pixma G2012 . Overall its a great choice for Students and Office work . Print speeds are slow but decent"
5,"Value for money product. Easy to use , ideal for sharpen high dpi photo printing... Always use genuine Canon ink to get accurate colour of photo printing...Very good quality scanner... At xerox time , if we print 2 or more copies of one document,1st page print needs some time but other pages other pages print quickly...3-4 A4 b&w pages/min & 2 A4 colour pages/min ; 1 4/6 inch borderless photo print with high resolution in a minute....It's don't have OCR & AI to clear background colour of documents & auto straight document facilities... Also, it has no wireless printing.... It has an advantage, to print on inverter during power cut...G2012 has no facilities to print from mobile & on internet , only usb printing is supported on windows (Mac not supported)...Overall , it justify it's price..."
4,"I loved print quality, I bought it mainly for my kid as we had to take print of his assignments and then scan them back in to laptop and send them to teachers, thans to corona :). Print is  very good, even color pring is very good, not too concentrated, just right amount of color is used by printer. I wish it had WIFI. Just because WIFI is missing I have to take my laptop and connect it with USB and then print scan what ever.  Well we can live with it though, not a big deal, but WIFI could have made things much flexible. Overall product is excellent and it wont disappoint you. Remember : No WIFI."
3,"After using it for more than 1 year, this is the update on the review:If you are not using atleast once per week, don't think about buying this printer. The ink gets dried inside the head and you need to do deep clean and refill the head with ink to mkae this work.During the lockdown period, when the printer was not used for just over 1 month, even after all kinds of cleaning and ink filling it did not worked for majenta ink color. Half the tank of ink hit consumed, but no improvement was seen.Had to take the head out and using the instructions on you tube clean the head. This and manual refill of the head got it working back.Now after the school holidays I have to do the same thing again as again the printer has stopped printing properly after being unused for 3 weeks.Old Review:Migrating from another Canon MP all in one printer with excellent photo printing capabilities with a high cartridge price to a ink tank printer these are my key observationsPros:>Very low print cost>quite fast at draft qualityCons:>Pictures are washed out and lacks colour depth like earlier canon printer (in both normal paper and coated photo paper)>install is not easy unless you use the video guides and are handy with computers and printers>Software is not as user friendly as it used to be"
5,I am using this printer for around 45 days on windows and here it is my experience.The Look of this printer is very good.it comes with 2 Extra Bottle of Black Color. Installation of this printer is so easy follow the manual it takes around 10-15 min for Ready the Printer for work.Print Quality is very Good. Printing Speed is very good. For 1st Print it take 30-40 sec time but then it take around 10 sec for BW print and 30-40 sec (Based on content) for COLOR print.Pros--Cost of printer is very less as compared to other ink tank printers.-very low ink consumption.-Printing Speed is very Good (8-10sec for BW/10-20sec for COLOR)-Cleaning and manianting is easy-Borderless printing is avilable-Document Scan with MAX 600DPICons--Some time it makes NOISE-Some time paper jam at colour printing on 75-80gsm normal paperOverall this product is very good
4,"Model: Canon Pixma G2012.I got it for 8635/-. This is a good printer at this price range.Pros:1. Fairly good print speed2. Two additional black ink bottles3. It produces high quality prints compared to many other brands I have used4. Original product from Vietnam, managed to register online easily for warrantyCons:1. Driver for G2012 seems to be not available. But I have used G2010 driver as it is compatible with this printer.2. Noise, noise, noise. What the hell is this Canon? This is the noisiest printer have I ever used. Those who like train's running sound will surely enjoy it.3. Borderless printing is not up to the mark. Borderless print is supported well on some types of papers. But it doesn't support well on normal paper and executive bond sheets. Therefore, those who want to use it for letter head printing might face some issue. Canon has to learn more about borderless printing from BROTHER printing company.4. Printer software is not up to the mark. I have used printers from multiple brands including Brother, Epson, Samsung, HP etc. I would say this is one of the worst have I ever come across. Software has to be more user friendly, with more features. In my experience BROTHER has better software.I will be updating this review after using for another 3 months. Anyway, irrespective of the flaws, considering the price and the print quality I would rate 4 Star for this machine."
5,"It is a multifunction printer it means you can use this for print, scan and copy (black and colour both)Print quality is goodEasy to install, just download drivers from Canon website or install from CD (included in box)I am attaching some photos and video of printerBox Contents : 1 printer1 bottle of cyan, magenta, yellow (for colour printing)3 bottles of black ink (you will get 2 bottles for FREE) :D1 User ManualAnd 1 CD for drivers (you can easily install drivers from Canon website if you don't have cd drive)I installed mine from their website.As I mentioned earlier you will get 2 bottles of black ink for FREE FREE FREECost of printing : As mentioned on boxBlack and white print - 9 paise per pageColour print - 21 paise per pageYou can print approx 5000 pages from 1 bottle of black inkAnd approx 4000 pages from bottles of colour ink (cyan, magenta, yellow) combine.Hope my review will help you.."
4,"One of the best and economical printers in the range. Has superb durability, I did 1500 pages in one go (colour n Black white mixed). No issues faced. The no. of pages that can be printed per cartridge is not as mentioned in the description. I used up 50% of the B/W cartridge for around 1200-1300 pages in one go.Colour printing is slow but can be managed. Will give best colour printing results on photographic paper ( even better than laser printer).Best suitable for small office n home setup.. heavy duty n easy to use."
5,"Canon Pixma G2012 wa delivered in one day, thanks Amazon for same.  Two additional black ink bottles provided in box. This adds to value of printer.InstalltionInstall instructions are clear. The booklet with printer has detailed instructions. There is also video available for installation steps. Steps are easy but it helps if you have some experience of working with electronic equipments. Be careful while putting print heads and filling up ink tanks.SetupWith Windows 10 there is no need to install drivers separately. Connect PC/laptop with provided USB cable and operating system will setup printer.Size and weightThe printer is larger than average home inkjet printer. You need to keep is horizontal while moving as it has fluid ink.Print QualityColor print quality is good. The print speed is also good. I printed couple of color prints and colors were pleasing. I need to check scanning and photo copy. That I will update after trying both functions."
5,"Value for money. Print quality is good.There is option for selecting couple of printing resolutions.Very helpful for printing my kids project work and other urgent documents.The scanner and copier options are also very helpful.I have stopped running around cyber cafes and photocopy shops as I am doing printing, scanning and copying in the comfort of my home.I am using it on my windows laptop. Wish I could have used it on my other Mac book air laptop too.May be Canon should include this option too in this model."
1,Inaccurate images of product. The first image is of hp smart 530 but why it Is placed in hp smart tank aio 500. As shown in first image it doesn't have touch screen
1,"This is not a wireless printer. However hp stores specification showing that this is a wireless printer and it has 7 button on control panel cancel,resume,colour print,black and white print,info,wifi and power button. Totally misguide customersI want to return this product. Hp support suggest me to return this product to amazon."
3,Printer work fine .colour combination very nice. Print quality also good. But build quality of the printer very bad .never expected this type of build quality from HP brand. Front door very loose. Better to buy in this price range canon or epson . Not recommended overall
2,"मैने hp स्मार्ट टैंक 500 लिया परन्तु उसमे wifi नही है,मुझे मोबाइल से प्रिंट निकालने मे दिक्कत आ रही है, मुझे 515 प्रिंटर चाहिए था ऊपर के पैसे मैं दे दूँगा।"
1,Didn't like the product.. amazon is not allowing me to return it also. Even if I have bought just 3days back the product.. Had called yup amaxon customer not even ready to share amazon customer care e-mail id ; this is real sad not allowing me to refund the product;
3,"Product's working is fine.But the build quality of the product is average, not so good as much expected.The company should improve the build quality of the HP 500 all in one smart tank printer.Working satisfactory, but the build quality is average...."
5,"I bought this for regular A4 size colour printing and occasional photo prints.Very satisfied with the print quality. I used professional quality photo paper. Borderless printing is a plus as it gives your photo a different feel.A bit on the expensive side, but additional scan and photocopy options are a plus. Print speed is good comparing other similar HP models specifications."
1,"Don't buy, Worked only for one month, now not even switching on. Booked a service call on 24th Nov still no response/update from service team till 9th Dec, 15 days later. Regretting the purchasee waste of time/energy"
5,"The printer is so good by body make, technology and the services it gives. Its faster than any other inktank printer I used previously. And the price is also reasonable. I found a printer that served my purpose."
4,It's in experience period so I can't say anything earlier but one thing is clear that this one isn't below average.
1,"Defective Product, Printer not working and I have to call HP Customer Care for this, and also there is no any bill of my product inside the box. Very Bad Experiance."

5,good
1,"First image is wrong. Just added to mislead . please search on google about this model, such a big mistake."
5,Awesome products  who thinks to buy a new printer I suggest them go for it and u would like this product
3,"It was delivered a few hours before the time given. I have just set it up and using the HP app on my phone to print, scan and copy. You can email and send documents on WhatsApp too. HP app is impressive. Responds to commands quickly.Packing was impressive. Unpacking not time consuming. Setting up through HP app on my iPhone was smooth. All functions work well. Connected it to Alexa and the voice commands works too. The only thing to note is the gap between claim of speed of printing and actual printing time it takes. If you are using it for personal use and are not in a hurry the printer speed will not annoy you. It's slow, very slow. I believe it prints not more than two pages b/w in 60 seconds."
1,"This  printer - HP DESKJET INK ADVANTAGE 2700 ALL IN ONE printer of HP make  was purchased on sale, but it ended up with worst product.  The paper jam occurs more frequently, the printer was very very very slow,  print on both pages option not available, and the top loading paper mode was giving more trouble.  The box was not opened for the first 4 days due to Covid pandemic instructions.  The courier boys were first source of spreading covid, and to take utmost care, we have not opened the box containing printer for the first 4 to 5 days till it is completely sanitized.  After installation we had faced so much of inconvenience in paper loading.  The printer is absolutely non-performing, and malfunctioning.  You are requested to immediately take back and give refund or give credit for future purchases.  I am a prime member and dont disappoint by claiming any excuses.  Simply the product (printer) which was purchased on sale was a dump product and is a totally mal-functioning and worst product.  Immediate necessary action may be taken at your end."
3,"Well, the hp 2700 delivered initially had problems with the paper feed. The paper was pulled to one side and got crumpled inside. Amazon team was kind to give replacement within 48 hours. The replacement (same model) was tested and is working fine. Quality control needs to be in place either at HP end and before delivery."
2,"Though the print quality is descent, I could only print 6 color and 24 black prints using the cartridge that came with the printer against the claim of 150color n 450 black prints...."
3,"If one is decently tech savvy, but without the knowledge of the inner workings of a printer the online demo of how to install a cartridge is not up to mark. Ideally it should have been a 5 minute job to download and set up the printer, but because this model is not listed on HP website it shows demo for other model and the cartridge installation section doesn't mention that you have to pull the cartridge insertion slot from the side where it is usually stuffed. I spent another 10 minutes wondering where the cartridge insertion slot was as per the web demo only to figure out myself it is tucked to one side and needs to be slid to the center to insert the cartridge."
2,Great service by Amazon surprise to see the delivery boy early in the morning...great lots of thanks for delivery person for delivery within 24 hrs and nice product received.But HP service has a big big issue.
5,"Very good quality printer and scanner. Easy to use, especially with the wireless connection. We are using this a lot for our work as well as for our kids online school assignments. This is especially helpful because we don't want to go to a cybercafe during pandemic."
5,This printer is working super duper. No catalogue is available with this product except the one featuring essential basic things. But it takes you to the website from where you can set up the entire matters. I am a layman  of 67 years with not much exposure to the nitty gritty of all these but I could manage the entire set up by myself and the printer was in action in less than one hour. Do not regret in purchasing this. I use it at my home ( no commercial need.)Satisfied. Worth the money spent.At this time of writing this review I do not know how much prints one can have from the first cartridge I got along with it.
5,"I initially hesitated to buy this printer reading the reviews,but as it was an emergency I bough it. It got delivered in 2 days, packing was flawless. The wifi setup is easy enough, It took me less than 15minutes to learn everything about it and print from my phone. The print quality is great and it's fast enough, atleast as fast as they claim, 7pages per minute(colour, std quality) ,best quality printing will take longer time and will be taxing for your cartridge, might not need that for most cases. Please ignore other reviews, You can trust me and have a wonderful experience with this printer. Btw I bought it for 5399 ₹, which is excellent value."
2,"Installation was not easy even for the person whose living is earned by working with all such devices. Before he could show me how to print, curfew & lockdown have kept him away. There's no manual in hard copy to help me. Instead of messages from the printer such as ""no paper"" etc there are symbols & they're placed on top, not facing the user. Crippled as I am, not knowing what is showing on top because I'm sitting in front of the desk, not able to ask someone to tell me what symbol is lighted up, & even if they tell me, having no manual to guide me, the printer is unusable at present.Online videos are focused on wireless use & using via phone. Nothing else seems to matter.Because I hadn't found another printer that's not designed similarly, & this was all I could afford, I bought it. Now I'm sorry I did."
4,"The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the first three pages that I printed, the ink smudged across the page. That apart, I am well-satisfied with this product. My usage is not heavy but I generally end up printing between 5-10 pages per week, and this is good enough for my purpose. Linked up well with the android phone also. I don't understand why the latest app was not available in the given HP page, but as soon as I installed the printer app, it blanked out my phone and asked me to install the ""new"" plugin. I mean, where's the point of having two different plugins for the same purpose. Would have been much better to update the main app, rather than force the users to install multiple plugins."
5,"In the past I have used printers of various brands as I do a lot of printing and scanning work. My two year old printer is an Epson ink tank. This is the first time I am using a wireless printer and I am satisfied with the ease of printing and scanning. No more wires required, just connect to the printer wifi and print. The set up was a bit confusing because they have not mentioned much on the printer's manual. The printer's wifi password is also not there on the manual, you will have to print the password from the printer itself. It's a combination of digits. I still have not figured out how to use my home's wifi to print using this printer. There are two ways I use this printer:1. By connecting usb cable from device to printer. This is wired printing.2. By connecting to the printer's inbuilt wifi from any device. This is wireless printing.The third way to print is using your home's wifi which I am not interested. The built quality of the printer is good. However, the color in the cartridge gets used up really quick. I bought this to get print quicky and wirelessly. I still have my Epson ink tank printer for heavy printing. All in all this is a good wireless printer in it's price range."
5,"The printer, scanner and copier, all the functions work very smoothly. You need to give it some time after proper setup so that you can get the best possible speed of printing.Don't fall for negative reviews. People don't understand how the things work in these printers, hence they assume that it doesn't work properly and give negative reviews. Yes, some of them might be genuine issues but I'm sure that not all of them are problematic.If you find problem in detection of page (wrong page size shown) then it is just because of that blue stopper marker, slide and fit it to the tightness, with the page width, I assure you the wrong page size problem will no longer be the problem anymore.Use it wisely to get the longest lifespan and also protect ot from dust to achieve the same...Thank you..."
1,"This is my second printer from HP. First one was 377x series and a best one. Got it for less than 5k. But had a manual hardware damage then I bought this one. Both are pure personal purpose. Highly overpriced with Less capabilities and a complicated one to use!! Very disappointing and regret now. Instaed of this headache , might by one more - but I doubt if it's from hp this time ..."
4,Easy to setup and was delivered next day. Additional black cartridge promised as part of the order was missing.. overall decent for home use.
5,". HP support videos are useful to setup the printer with cartridge etc.printer is easy to setup using hpsmart app on phone. Also once it's setup can be easily accessed from laptop,ipad when all are connected to same wifi.As of now cannot comment on cost of each print..since our usage is very low and just bought it 2 days ago."
1,This product is not user friendly specially through Wifi and mobile Hp app. When the product is purchased online the company or dealer should arrange for installation of the product through their engineer /staff. We are suffering a lot in the absence of this facility. It has become regular practice not to care for after sale service or follow up personally with customer by email or phone through their idle staff just to ask whether the product is working in good condition? and to the expectation? My product is not working till date. Although the cartridges are costly we must get the output as assured by the company. Since last 10 years I am using Hp printer but this time I am totally upset specially in current pandemic situation.
3,"Agree with another reviewer. The quality is questionable.The first printer I got had a defective paper feeder. The ink receptacle also had problems. After every print job E would flash on the printer display. HP support was useless.Fortunately, Amazon agreed to replace (no refund).The second printer set up and works fine."
5,"Quality 10/10Weight - lightSpeed per page - color print slow, black print good.Overall best printer for home usage (300 pages per month) best use.Wifi dual band, easy installation, HP Android application, Alexa, Google Assistant, LCD display Print, Scan, Copy . All in one best printer."
4,"I have ordered yesterday evening and recieved it today.User manual doesn't have much details but got installation demo video on YouTube for 2700 series which helps to get printer installed.Installation is very easy. As of now, printed few b&w and colour pages and happy with the quality of printing.Will write another review after using it for some more days."
2,I recently purchased HP printer 2788. It has printing issues as it prints only on fourth corner of page while rest remains blank. I called customer care of HP they informed about motherboard issue which is manufacturing defect. I asked them to replace the printer but they didn't agreed and said that someone will visit to fix it or I go myself to center to get it done. This is a really bad approach. My printer is under warranty thereby needs replacement on manufacturing defect. I am requesting Amazon as a seller to help with this and get the warranteed product replaced.
1,"Not detecting A4 size paper, no option to connect to agent on customer care, service centre in gurgaon does not have any provision of complaint registration, they don't know email id for complaint registration and very rude behavior by Ms. Babli who attended my call. She doesn't know anything on how to provide support if customer is facing any issue."
4,HP printer 2778 is great for wireless printing and features for wireless connectivity. Initially i had problems with slow printing issues abot 3.5 mins/page but calling up the HP customer care solved my issues on slow priting. Rest all is fine with this printer.
1,"Both HP & Amzon fooling customer. I started facing issue in product within 1 month of purchase but brand is not able to provide proper warranty services, they dont have any service center nearby my location & asking to visit 200kms away service center which is truly impossible for anyone. When approached Amazon for help, they too not able to help due to policy concerns. In short complete waste of money."
1,"After printing, almost 150 black cartridges are empty and colour after 20 pages (A4). The product description was around a rupee and few paise for black and 2 rupees for colour print. Nut in my experience, it is 5.30 rupee for black and white and 40 rupees for colour printer.A complete waste of moneyPrint quality was good, but the installation process was a little time-consuming (registration in the hp smart app and time taken to detect and register the printer)."
3,the printer keeps getting stuck as there is some glitch with windows 10. works fine with my pc's running older versions of windows. Just wont work well with pc's running on windows 10.Setting up the printer is simple and fast . just when printing there is a problem onec the first print job is given then you have to manually reset the print spooler service after every job .
1,"Very bad, it doesn't even get connected, worst product and worst support from Amazon as well as hp I have experienced so far"
2,"First Printer is made in China. It's language also comes in Chinese. Wifi connectivity is very poor, every time while you give print first pair your device it's taking to much time . In box showing Model No. 2770 but in software it's showing 2700 series, and printer also showing in Wifi 2700."
3,First time I received the printer was not even starting. Though it was brand new condition.I ordered replacement and had issues with print quality with stripes and mirror imaging of pictures. Bit shocked with hp quality and unnecessary taking all the troubles. May be I was having bad luck
1,Product does it job but overpriced during sale. Just a false hype created to sell this model.Also paper feeder seems defective getting paper size errors.
5,"Not so easy to install but manageable despite the lack of instructions for this model. Wireless works great but since my WiFi password changed I have been using with wire as am too lazy to figure out how to reinstall it. Print quality is great and I don’t use colour just black and white draft prints which give me 350-400 pages from new cartridge. I am happy with that. The ones that come with the printer are for test only and lasted less than 30 prints for me but the cartridge is pretty affordable so I am very happy with this buy. Would recommend as it’s lightweight, easy to use and prints regular pages pretty fast (not colour)."
3,"The specifications stated that the printer is compatible to windows 10 and 7 along with some other os. But the printer hp2778 which was supplied to me was not compatible to windows 7 and compatible to windows 10 only. Although at the time of ordering I got it clarified also. Moreover on the package carton also mentioned compatible to windows 10,7. Due to this non conformity I had plenty of trouble in installing the printer. Ultimately I have to get set with a laptop having windows 10 as os hence incurring additional costs and inconvenience."
5,"For home use it is very good printer. With Wifi feature I can shift my printer to any place in my home. I took photo prinout on A4 photo paper and print was very good, but it took lot of colour ink. Overall satisfied with the printer."
1,"This printer is not working properly. Not able to connect to wifi or laptop.  Not able to print documents from my laptop.  I want to replace it, if possible."
1,The product didn’t work after installation  - had to call hp engineer who said that the PCB is not working and they Would repair it instead of replacing the printer
5,"Very good product.Printer is light weight, easy to install n set up. Print quality very good. Got 2 cartridges with it. Compact.Highly recommended 👍"
1,IF I COULD GIVE LESS THAN 1 STAR I WOULD.THE PRINTER IS CONSTANTLY THROWING PAPER MISMATCH ERROR. TRIED DIFFERENT SETTINGS BUT TO NO AVAIL. COPY SIZE GETS RESIZED AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN SETTINGS.I AM FED UP OF THE PRODUCT.
2,"First paper will not get straight,it has lot of error,ink get half exhausted after 4 th colour print. I didn't like the product ..Not a value for money.."
5,Very compact lightweight printer. Wifi is working nicely. Installing HP smart in Laptop is a little tricky but at the end it's working fine.
4,"Vary wrost product, waste of money, cartridge ink finished within 15 days and unable to refill it, refilled but not getting actual colour. Very bad product. Not expected such thirdclass quality for HP"
2,"Didn't expect cannon to dispatch items without quality checks!The colour head was not working properly from day 1.Tried all software based ink flushing techniques, the ink totally flushed out and the colour stopped working there on..Ordered new head- Rs 3500/-Within 2 days, the led blinking indications started coming.decorded the code online and found it's an error which only service centre people can do. The ink drain was full.After a week, the printer is not powering on itself!!Service charge + replacement of printer board..Rs 5000/-Warranty not applicable on these sections..Had a great Cannon experience.."
5,"I opted to buy this printer over Epson or Brother or any other company becuase of 2 reason. 1. Price (same features model with wireless costed 3k more for Epson) and 2. this Supports Borderless printing from 4x6 size upto A4 size. meaning you don't need to cut of edges after printing as her wont be any borders, The Utility software along with the package is quite good. i used it to scan and print wirelessly and it worked like a charm. wireless connection is very stable. i bought this for 8500 for Great Indian Sale. it comes with 2 extra black and white ink bottles so its 18k black and prints out of the box! so if you compare it with printing cost outside  it straightaway negates the printer costs. overall a great buy! printed some color photos in glossy papers and it was fairly good. exceeded my expectations.NB: about seller and Amzon service. i have had a problem delivery of printer since they where flooded with deliveries during great indian sale, which never used to happen with amazon. but they sorted out everything quickly and made sure i receive it. So Kudos to Amazon Service.. Cheers!"
4,"The printer was easy to set up and use the Wifi direct paired to my phone. The app needs to be installed which isnt the best in UI but does the job.One odd thing i found (check pics) is that color inks werent upto the top arrow mark like the black ink. I'm not sure why bcoz i emptied the entire bottle into the tank. The color prints have not come out bright and they look a bit dull. Was expecting better print quality on white 75gsm paper. Black prints are quite good.Update:The photo print quality on 200gsm kodak 6x4 is quite good. Higher quality paper would also give good results. The speed of printing is impressive and no washout or anything observed. After printing 4 pics, the ink level is the same."
5,"Chose canon over others due to its mega reputation and Classy size & shape.Its all-in-one ability supersedes all contemporary brands.Here are my few observations of the product :1.) Its an ink tank printer that comes with separate ink tanks to be filled with ink red , yellow , blue & black .Its always considered to be more economical for per page printing and should be chosen if you have bulk work on a routine basis.In these ink tank printers, it is also required to take prints on a minimum weekly basis or prolonged non-usage may lead to drying of heads .2.) The construction of the printer is very elegant and solid and the ink tanks are absorbed in the regular chassis of the printer unlike HP brand, however it is my personal preference.Solid doesn't mean you can afford to drop it , it means the plastic used for construction feels very premium and rigid.3.) Regarding functionality - It can scan and print documents very fast .Page size supported is from 4.0""x 6.0"" photo paper to  A4 ,Letter ,Legal , A5 , B5 .I purchased glossy kodak photo papers 280 GSM &  paperone A4 100 GSM papers and the print quality was excellent.For pictures , it takes few minutes but its worth the wait .If you choose the right paper the photos are bound to be very good ,However at few places i found the shade of green slightly dark in print than in actual photo that was scanned.Resolution is good for both photos and documents.Printing makes slight noise but is tolerable , its not like neighbour or even other room person will be disturbed.4.) Got it with additional warranty for onsite repair for next 2 years.5.) I bought it first then realized i don't have that much work to use it on daily basis so i would ask my readers to buy only if you have routine works or make use of shops."
5,"I am writing this review on this printer after using it for over a year. In this year, I printed about 2000+ pages both color and black&white.  So my review is based on observations on them.=== Print Quality ===This is definitely the brightest point with this printer. I used Epson ink tank printer earlier and were not satisfied with the results of it. But this Canon printer makes the cut. I am amazed to see the results of the printing both color and B&W. I printed many photos on photo papers and the results were better than the inkjet printers.=== Ink Longevity ===This is another biggest selling point of this printer. The printer came with 4 ink bottles - Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow. After printing over 2000 pages so far (photos and documents) I still see 50% of the ink left.=== Ease of Use ===I can connect this to my wifi router and get started in 5 minutes. All I need is to read the instructions carefully. And voila, all my devices - Computer, Laptop, Mobile and iPad - can print without any hassles. They can detect the printer and starts printing just in minute.=== Paper Feeding ===In my more than one year experience with this printer, I never faced a single paper jam. If at all something happens, check paper feeder if any small objects stuck accidentally.=== Scanner ===Not used much but overall quality was ok. If you want crystal clear scans, this is not for you.=== Copier ===Its just a click of button. Keep your document inside the scanner and click on blabk or color button. Your document copy is ready.=== Issues ===So far I came across only one issue. The printer orange light starts blinking and the messages shows that the ink cleaner bed was overflown and needs a service. But I followed the instructions on Youtube videos, cleaned the ink cleaning bed and cartridges for 4 to 5 times and then the printer came back to normal. But this took over 4 hours to understand and solve the issue.=== Advice ===1. Do not perform system cleaning too many times. This will cause overflowing of tank on ink cleaner bed and malfunction your primter.2. Do not use cheap paper, use paper such as JK Sparkle etc.3. Do not print photo prints on normal paper, use photo paper or thick paper.4. Make sure to print few papers at least once a week with all colors. This will reduce color logging inside the tubes.Overall, I am very satisfied with this printer and the quality of prints it gives you.Update 11/11/19I faced one more issue after long time. The printer unable to feed the paper and I couldn't find any object inside the feed. After two days of struggling I came up with an idea of reverse feeding the paper from inside the printer, i.e. open the top box to see printer inside and switch off and onthe printer. While stopping, it reverses spinning wheel and load paper manually to it just in time. Voila, it started."
1,"The printer head has failed after about 1 year due to ink caking. While I can agree that ink caking can happen with less frequent use, I would prefer a model where issues due to ink caking/ drying can be resolved with servicing rather than having to replace the entire printer head - cost about Rs.4000+18%GST!"
1,"Printer stopped working in exactly 2 months.  Is throwing errors.  Calling tech support for 2 weeks and no one seems to be bothered.  Canon Support specializes in lying through their teeth and making false commitments of arranging a technician visit in 24 hours, which never happens."
1,"Very Expensive Ink from Canon, Printer already stopped working within 6 monthsIt never worked properly since day one, Had to follow all troubleshooting before every printIf used with any other Ink from Amazon then the printer stops working with Error Code: 5B00"
4,"The printer is smooth and the printing quality is nice.Don't find any difficulty with installation (Followed the installation steps from youtube)There are 2 issues:1. The printing speed via WIFI/SELPHY APP is very slow, my wifi connectivity is good. Seems the issue persists with printer data receiver.2. While installation/Initial Head setup, printer has consumed more ink from YELLOW tank. Almost 1/4 of the ink was gone during installation. But afterwards the ink usage looks normal.."
1,"After using the product for a few days one day when I turned it on to do a print the error light and the power were flashing in alternation. usually when I turn on the printer it makes some noise. the head moves back and forth, and it sets things up for a print. This time there was no sound and only the lights flashing. upon checking it showed up as error B202. which requires you to call cannon and ask for a repairs. I was surprised to see this. the printer is just a few days old.I tried turning it on and off a few times but it didn't work. then I pulled the plug, reinserted the plug and powered it on. and finally this time it made it noises and started setting itself up. I could use the printer for the rest of the day with out trouble.but then the next day they happened again..and then the day after this happened again.I'm quite upset with this product. remaining all functions and print quality is great for office use. but if the printer doesn't work then nothing else matters. id like to return this product but unfortunately I've crossed the return window.Im not sure what to do but to contact cannon now."
3,"I bought the product at a steal value, which is good.Although I was aware that there is no LCD screen to guide me thorough the menus, my geekiness will support me, I was sure.Installation with my computer via WiFi router was pretty easy. Did a few tries to locate the printer on my network and tried the button shortcuts and finally got it connected.Prints were good. Ink seems to be drained a lot as 3 prints on, I could see about 15 percent drop in the ink levels. Need to ascertain it in the long duration.Now comes the tricky part. I wanted to connect it to my phone and another phone not on my WiFi router network. I installed the Canon ""Print"" app and it was not detecting my printer.I tried detecting WiFi direct devices but was not able to see the printer. After a few tries with the button shortcuts, I was able to locate it in the regular WiFi devices. I connected to the WiFi printer and was able to at least connect the phone to the printer directly. Prints and scans were again possible.Then came the real headache. The printer was not getting detected by the computer now. By some unknown reasons, this printer is not able to connect to both services, WiFi direct (act as hotspot) and regular WiFi (access a hotspot) simultaneously.My previous WiFi MFD, a 5000 rupee HP was easier to install, easier to understand and connect and had none of the aforementioned WiFi issues!I called up the Canon customer care (18002083366) on Saturday and raised a service request. service guy will visit my in 24 hours, I was told. Come Tuesday, I still didn't get the service call atleast.I gave them a call on Tuesday morning and reiterated the issue. They gave me a local service number. After a few hours, I got a call and I had to tell them the whole story again. Second installation is not free, I was told. I said that the first installation was done by myself. They agreed to come by evening.Evening they gave excuses that they were caught up with other customers and don't even have the courtesy to lift my phone. I'm still waiting. Will update after they actual arrive. I just hope the service rep has better skills than myself.I'm pretty sure it's not an issue which can be sorted out onsite. There might be shop servicing needed. I should have gone with Amazon return as I'm still within that period. But I'm being a gentleman, for now.Update : Gentleman's patience broke. I got a replacement. Problem persists another way.I realised my 12k Canon printer can only act as either a wifi-direct printer or can access an external WiFi router, but cannot do both, like my 5k HP printer.The technicians reply made it clear. Sir, canon doesn't have any models in the sub-15k range which can be accessed by laptops vide wifi router and at the same time by accessed by phones vide wifi Direct! Thumbs down.The printer however served its purpose of printing well in standard and best modes. Draft mode had lines showing up on an otherwise splendid photo.Another irritating problem with this device is the scanning application. Competitors need to learn from HP. Their scanning apps were so user friendly. This one in yet to find easy ways to scan proud or documents readily with my required settings by default. Not at all user friendly. Instead it pops up like some irritating ads we get online!Overall, this is an ok device for the rate. The only saving grace are the ciss, which for now works great and the decent print quality for standard and best modes. So far so good."
4,"1) Print quality is good. 4.5/52) But it is too noisy. 1/53) Software need to be more user-friendly. 3/5Setup is easy: 4.5/54) Windows app and MAC OS apps are different a bit. MAC version can be improved.5) Scan quality is not at getting best. Widows app has better resolution options to get better quality Scan.: 3.5/56) Copy works good, for home use with limited copy requirements: 4/57) Over all easy setting up of printer, including ink and other parts. A person with limited knowledge can install it with ease, without expert support. Printer help doc can be improved though. 4/5"
5,"The delivery was excellent and reached on the next day. The contents of the packing includes, 3 black ink bottles, 3 color ink bottles (1 of each color), printer, manual with CD. Everything needed, and the installation was quite simple, apart from getting it connected to the WiFi. You will have to insert the CD and follow the process, to get it connected to the WiFi, which could be a little tricky.Once the installation is complete, it is a very  easy to connect to it if the device is on the same network. I haven't tried WiFi direct, so can't review about it.Speaking about the print quality, it is excellent. Keep in mind the quality of the paper, the quality of the source image and the App you use of printing makes a world of differences. I tried printing pictures on a Kodak Glossy paper using my phone and cannon printer app, the quality was not as much as I expected. Was a little disappointed, but when I used GIMP ( a free photo editing app ) on windows and selected the right size of the paper. The print quality was awesome.Document printing and Scanning is perfect, you can print through any app, even using mobile the quality is awesome.Overall a perfect product of printing at cheap rate and great quality."
3,"Print colur looking different with compare to epson color printer. Too much noice while printing, and very difficult to connect wifi with laptop. too much of noice coming when take a print out."
5,This is the best thing ever bought on Amazon. The print quality is good and it's very easy to install and use. It is printed about 3000 copies and yet it still printing.I recommend this to all the people who are looking for an economy printing solution. And not only printing it also is very quick in scanning and xerox.so I would like to give 9.9 out of 10 to this.don't think much if you want to buy this simply this .I  take the guarantee
1,"This is not a good printer.First, it has issues with MAC. Installation is painful.Then it has a special app that you  need to use on mobile phone.Then it just flat out doesn't work with Linux.Then setting up wifi printing is painful.Just walk away pal.And oh, darker images have parallel lines through out the page.And also, it cannot duplex print from Mac or Linux or Android (not sure about Windows). I think its hardware cannot support.And also, scanner generates potato quality scans.Just bad! Money loss."
4,"Got it on sale, so paid much lesser than the original price.Pros:1. Ink tank printers are money savers in the long run and work for longer as well.2. Premium body finish and look3. WiFi connectivity is the best thing you can go for, its future proof. If its linked on your router, you can print documents from any corner of the room via any device without having to go the printer. Even desktops dont need a cable to connect cause it prints via the local network so you can place the printer anywhere and use it flawlessly.4. You get additional black ink bottles which is a plus point.5. Lower maintenance needed than other printers.6. Borderless printing is great.7. Atleast 2 prints within a week is important to ensure the printer works at its full potential. Also, if printing is not possible, atleast switch on the printer once in 3 days to allow it to self clean itself. These practices will ensure your printer wont get any problems.8. Free installation provided by Canon which you should definitely avail.9. Refills are way cheaper than cartridges.Cons:1. Installation isn't very straightforward so even if you are a genius at figuring things out, I suggest you call the Canon service centre for a free installation setup. They are well versed with it so and its free so dont mess it up by doing it yourself.2. Print quality is, okaayyyy. Nothing WOW like. Haven't print photos yet so cant talk about that. But regular printing is lighter, as if its trying to save ink. Or maybe my setting is off, cant really say.3. Scans are really bright, high definition but sometimes light colours come off as white in an image due to bright illumination. Can be rectified via settings in the Scan utility interface.4. First print is slow. You have to wait for the printer to do its stuff before you print something. After that, the prints are quicker.5. Pretty noisy when the printer head undergoes adjustment before and after printing. Also during its self clean operation.6. Vertical paper inlet doesn't allow you to stick it against a wall so you'll need more space at the back.7. Print alignment occasionally gets angled but its kinda rare.Verdict :Although there are a few cons, the pros beat them anyday. If you're looking for a basic home printer or small office/shop printer where you can save money in the long run and still have a decent working product, then go for it. Plus Canons service is pretty fast and efficient so you can always avail their facilities if any problems arise."
4,I was confused between HP / EPSON / Cannon  models and based on various research went with Cannon G3000 finally.I had an HP one earlier and never remember  using it more than one week without troubles. So HP was out during the initial stage itself.  I did not configured the wireless  and was happy with USB printing but it looks like it is dhcp enabled and connected to my home wifi automatically. I realized only when I started getting additional printer option on my OS. Used for scanning/ printing / copying many times  in the last one moth and it do the job very easily.  Normally for any product I go with company where that product is their primary business. Looks like that policy was helpful in this purchase as well. Thanks for reading.
1,"It cost me INR 13K for this printer, but realized it was a waste of money just 1 month into owning it. It's wireless connectivity is a hit or miss most of the time and the printer frequently shows that it's Offline even though the Wifi LED on the printer indicates a good connection. Then we've to reboot it 2-3 times to make it work. Even when it shows Ready, it frequently hangs with the error 'Port is in use', whatever that means! Sometimes even when it's Ready and Connected, it doesn't print and just does nothing as if it's not receiving any signal !! Print quality is also sub-standard for an Ink-Tank printer. It does not even support Automatic Document Feed for 2-sided printing. Nor does it offer any AirPrint support for printing from Apple devices. Total waste of money !!"
5,"G3000 is a nice product.Its an ink-tank printer, that is, Inkjet with a tank to store the printing inks.Please note it doesn't support duplex printing. Duplex printing is automatic printing of both sides of the paper. G3000 is more of a manual duplex. You will have to pull out the paper after one side printing and then put in back into the printer to have it printed on the other side of the printer.Print quality is good. Please take 75 GSM papers or above ...If you use lesser GSM papers, it will feel like the printing is not good. Actually a lot depends on the paper type, as far as printing qualities are concerned.GSM stands for GRAMS PER SQUARE METER. It depicts the thickness and therefore the quality of the paper. Try buying 75 or above GSM papers from local market. The prices in Amazon are kind of at the higher sides.It support WI-FI connectivity , both over a Wifi router and wifi direct. If you have a router then try using it over the router , otherwise you will have to switch networks a lot between your router network and printer's network.The installation of the device is a little techie. If you are not comfortable let the support team carry out the installation. The installation is free.Scanner is pretty good too.The printer can be calibrated easily from the laptop or mobile application.Lastly, try to use the printer atleast twice a week. otherwise caking might occur.Overall its a good printer to use."
5,"I have been using it for about 5 months now and never faced any issue.  It is easy to install (installed it myself) and use.  Just read the instructions that come with the printer.  I bought it mainly to get rid of the printer cable due to limited space at home.  So the printer sits in its appointed place and I can take print from anywhere.  Prints from mobile using Canon App.  I have never faced any wifi connectivity related issue while using it with mobile phone or laptop.  The printer is meant for home use and I use for school projects, printing a few photos  and other small odd printing/photocopy jobs at home, and the print quality is suitable for the purpose.  Don't expect very high quality professional printing.  Would have given the printer 4 stars, but I am giving it additional 1 star as I got it for under Rs. 9000 during Amazon promotion sale."
1,"Inks drying problemIf you don’t use regularly, ink will dry in the pipes and print are not with all colours or blank sometimesI have to deep clean many times through windows maintenance tool.Overall otherwise no problem."
1,"I purchased this printer on Amazon on 12 Feb 19. As you can see from the picture, I have already landed it for repair at an authorised Canon service centre thrice since then, first time while it was still under warranty and later after expiry of warranty. For the third complaint, which is still appearing as ""Open"", the service centre has conveyed to me that the printer is beyond repair, and since there is no buy back available at my location, the only option I am left with is to throw it away and buy a new one.  This is a printer from a reputed brand (Canon) purchased from a reputed platform (Amazon). I am appalled, to say the least. I strongly recommend purchase of electronics and appliances from stores and not from Amazon, and I advise everyone to stay away from Canon products, which become e-hazard sooner than you buy them."
4,"The print quality is good and best i think for the price range,the built quality is also good,however to install wireless it took me some time,also to change the wireless user name and password had to download canon selphy app, the user manual is pathetic, i had to decipher some how to video made on youtube  that was in thai language......but once you are done you are set ....thanks to the seller for the two extra black ink bottles."
5,"1 year updateEasy to useDo not forget to cleanse all the tubes through system cleanser time to time..It's been almost 14 months I have been using it rigorously..It works great, though there have been minor problems of page congestions at rare times, but then you have troubleshooters for everything. There're YouTube for help as well, for every other situation.Refilled the colours once as well...Trust me there's no better printer+scanner+photocopying gadget at this range; even beyond this range for personal and office use.One of the best printers I have used!"
5,"The printer looks terrific and since I have used the earlier model in my office I can say that the ink tank lasts a long time bringing down the cost of printing. Tech support was great, arrived within 24 hours of call and installed the printer. The wi-fi function is very convenient and its working well (though there is a time lag between print command and printing - but I guess that's to be expected). The first page print takes a little time but there-after its fine. Over-all, very satisfied with the printer till now. I just hope that the ink doesn't dry up or the nozzles don't get clogged due to infrequent use."
4,"Received product from Amazon on time, but the support from canon was a bad experienceEngineer at the first seeing the printer mentioned this is not a good printer and you must have not bought this from Amazon that this and all. later he never was ready to explain anything and just set up everything on his own, when asked to explain the process if something goes wrong / how to connect to mobile... etc., he was never ready to answer and just told any problem you must call customer care and only we can do the setup... he did not even explain how to connect to wifi, mobile. Just did all by his own and left... Totally a bad experience from Canon. I must have gone to HP or another printer..."
1,It says its Mac and iOS compatible but I tried my best it won’t connect to either of the apple devices. I downloaded the Canon PRINT app on iPhone and also all drivers on my MacBook from Canon site.It’s amazing that Canon doesn’t try it connecting it to Mac before selling it ans labelling it Mac compatible.I  just couldn’t  connect wirelessly with iPhone or Macbook Even I when I  followed all instructions to book the alert light comes up again and again.I don’t know how it performs with windows but if you have a Mac system just keep away from it.Connecting to a Mac is complex and cumbersome and there is a big IF it would connect at all.Internet is full of frustrated people trying toConnect this printer to a Mac system.If you have a Mac system or an iOS device to use with this printer just don’t buy it.
5,"When the box arrived, I doubted the contents inside as it was just a big box taped only along it's length, with a gap on two sides. But upon opening, everything was found neatly sealed and in order. This is a totally value for money printer, as it comes with two extra black ink bottles. Scheduling of installation was easy. I called up Canon toll free number, obtained the contact of the service center, and called them up to schedule the installation. The service engineer arrived the next day and did the needful. The complete process took about half an hour. He asked if I wanted to install through the router, but I opted for simple installation, wherein I could print directly from my smartphone and by wiring the printer to my laptop. Print quality is excellent for both color and black and white. Got this one for a great price of 11690. I had gone to stores and checked out prices elsewhere, but at all other places the price difference was 2k or more. Got the best price on Amazon and went for it. This printer is excellent for home use and small businesses. I have not checked how many copies it gives with single cartridges, but it should easily give thousands of copies easily. Will give it's money's worth with the cartridges provided. The number of printed pages claimed for a single cartridge is for 7% print area. It is advised to take a few prints every month to avoid keeping the printer too idle."
1,"An utter waste of money for a wifi printer.No matter how many times you troubleshoot it, the wifi printing always gets stuck, whether i try to connect through a router or directly, the printing gets stuck in the muddle and then i have to print all the pages one by one manually.Print quality is just fine.The printer wire is too short, so now i""ve to stand up next to this printer with my laptop in one hand to print through usb, and stand like and idiot for an long time ( when the pages are large and it takes more time to print per page than others). If you are going to buy it for wifi convenience, then forget about it."
4,"For All looking for a long term investment into daily bulk printing or full HD photo printing please continue to read thisIf you are a newbie to printers some of this stuff won't be easy for youThe Canon Pixma is a Full Featured no hassle WiFi(LAN) and WiFi Direct P2P enabled monster.It prints seamlessly on regular 75GSM A4 paper with wonderful clarity in both black and colors.For Photos you can start from 180GSM Glossy Paper to 275GSM easily and depending  on your photo editing skills you can truly bring any picture to life.The printer has a 2 phase setup with comprehensive documentation in the boxEnglish Instructions are readily available for first time setup followed by how to sync with PC(Windows/MacOS). And Android iOS phones.Many folks have posted vague feedback stating they donot like print quality.Let me say categorically it is a very nice mid level printer and at 9K (Lightening Deal) quiet a steal.Please feel free to go ahead if you are a techie and enjoy using photo shop,GIMP or other image editors.This printer is not for newbiesAlso they have given 2 Xtraa blank ink refills with the box,I am very happy with it's build quality as well and have faced no issue s in printing over WiFi(LAN). Or via my Android Pie phoneIn short go for it if you love to print lots of photos or are interested in small office or WFH business.Good Luck will post some content printed with G3K soon.Happy Independence Day 2019."
4,"Stuck b/w choosing HP/Epson and Canon, I went with the Canon G3000 - this is just day 1 review. The main reason for leaving out HP was -  made in PRC. Epson ( made in Philippines) lost out due to overall build quality which is found was many notches below Canon's ( prints may be slightly better than canon - marginally only). Canon G3000 - MADE IN Vietnam - super easy self install which took about 20 min all in all. Already taken about 100 pages of print and the quality is just above average - not awesome, but that works as I mainly use this for some basic office printing and majorly for children's study materials. There may be some electronic parts in this which may have come from PRC but the main thing for me was a non PRC build and this one had it. I would suggest anyone looking at 150+ prints a month to go for this. Overall rating at 4 as its a very new product for me and may think about bumping it higher based on further usage........"
5,"I've been looking for a reasonably priced multifunction colour printer scanner copier. I must have gone through 50-60 choices before settling on the Canon Pixma G3000. I went through a lot of reviews and i'm glad I selected this one. The print quality is fantastic. Not only is the normal black and white print good but the colour printing is absolutely fantastic. I've already printed so many of photos (I used Kodak photo paper to print photos) and they have come out fantastic. Brilliant colour. The scan quality could be a bit better but I'm not complaining as it does its job well. Also, I checked on the ink refill cost and its much more economical as we simply need to pour the ink in from a bottle as opposed to changing the entire cartridge.  Another plus point is that you can connect this printer via wifi so you can print from your laptop/tablet/phone directly to the printer sitting clear across the room and not fuss with attaching usb cable. All in all a great printer. If you're looking for a multifunction colour printer please go ahead and buy this without a doubt. Installation is also very easy. You can either install software from the disk provided or go to the URL in the instruction manual and download from there (if your laptop doesn't have a CD drive then this is beneficial). Go for it!"
5,"I'll start with compatiblity issue. I have a Mac as well as Windows desktop so its compatible with Mac no issue there.Installation is not at all difficult, its best if you download the software first from the Cannon site.Follow the instructions given in the Manuel, its very easy to understand.For WiFi signal use the USB cord provided for quick connectivity.You don't need to watch any You tube videos for installation.Basic function of a good Printer for me is to give quality printing which I found with this printer.I have not used any glossy paper but with ordinary A4 size paper printing quality is very good.Till now no issues,Im pretty satisfied with the product"
1,"I have canon, epson, and hp printers.I have been using all the brands but canon disappointed me very much.First this printer starts giving issue within a year I have two one for personal one for office use.As soon as the warranty expires canon customer service guys are the most horrible fraudulent people i have come across.They will blame the ink is duplicate ( i bought it from amazon with registered dealer ). Or we have to replace this part and that without even looking. I took a cloth and cleaned the head and everything was working fine.For any small things which can be solved over phone they we will visit and charge you service fees.I have a hp and epson printers which are working fine since 4 yrs lilttle issue after two years but thats fine"
4,"The printer looks good aesthetically. Very good quality plastics used. Connecting to the printer is very easy, thanks to wifi and wifi direct built into it. Print quality is very good an 8/10. Scan quality is good 8/10. The scanner does not support the legal size. I will update the review on the ink usage. I just took about 4 prints and you can already see the ink usage. The Magenta color ink quantity was already 50% less out of the box for which I received compensation from Amazon. Manual duplex print option in the settings.B/W prints - 8/10Color Prints - 8.5/10Scan - 8.5/10That's all folks!"
4,"Canon G3000Pros: It well built. It prints well. It has lots of ink to store and it is cheap to operate.Cons:Setting up the WiFi was a headache. Finally managed it. The biggest drawback is either it is connected to wifi through router or each device independently. You cannot have both options at the same time. The second concern is there is no duplex printing so back to back printing has to be manual. The printer does take some long time to print and is little noisy too. The Canon Selphy app is fine but not very user-friendly in selecting the document and making the print setting changes.I have not called for the technician for the installation but it did take 2 days to set right my WiFi router connectivity. As I said I used it with direct connection until then, but once wifi router is connected this option is lost.Overall a recommend buy at this price just for the sake of cheap operating costs for this printer and print quality is definitely good if not the best at this price point."
1,"I have ordered it a few months before, and it's not giving proper printing.. it is in guarantee period so, I want to replace it with a new printer"
4,"Its been around 2 week I am using this printer. And I must say the document comes with it help you to install it easily with your own.Wireless connectivity is very good. Easy to connect with multiple device like I have connected with Phone and Laptop both.Color Print: Quality was good. In starting for few prints (first 10 print) would use lots of color and it look like it will finish early. But wait if we understand initially it use color to fill the tube that's why took lots of color in first few page. After that it work like charmIf you are using glossy paper then make sure after print put the paper aside atleast for 24 hour, to settle down the colors. Otherwise if you use your figures or anything it spread the color unevenly and damage your print.Limitation:1. Auto duplex printing is not available2. ADF feature not available.Overall I would say for home usage you can completely buy it. It worth it."
3,"Ordered this item in Amazon sale and got it for 8999/-. The item was delivered on time and installation is done after couple of follow ups.Printing quality is not up to the mark, the prints are coming in very very faded manner even though you select the bold font.Photo printing is also not up to the mark and definitely not suggestible for the people who wish take the photo printsIts really hard to set this up to print via cloud and even after one week also I was not able to set this up. This is really a complicated device to set up for cloud.Over all this is not a great choice!!!!!"
1,Highly annoyed. The seeker thought he would be able to cheat by packaging the product in such a way that he would be able to hide all the defects. It looks rather like a 3-4 year old second hand printer. The lid was broken. The parts looked worn outThere was no cartridge and USB cable in the box. I would rather buy from official HP site. It’s also cheaper over thereThis is in addition. It’s been over a week and the return has not been made so my money is stuck so I would recommend you guys not to buy from Amazon. I am one of the unlucky guy whose money is stuck. You could be the next one. I have called Amazon more the 10 times still no update from them.
1,"Do not purchase this product. Waste of money. It is having cartridge issues. Even though I installed SETUP cartridge which came along with the product, it is showing error to install SETUP cartridge."
5,Works very well! Print quality is good and speed also good. Works like a charm on wireless network via mobile app! Not tested via USB yet.Arrived on time thanks to amazon logistics!
5,"I don't know why people complaining about the speed of the printer. The printing speed is well upto the mark, even above the mark if it is printing in draft mode. Obviously it is not a laser printer.Installation is hassle-free. Connection is very stable (have not checked USB connection). Print quality is very good. I have also printed from different devices like mobile, laptop and tablet. Only thing is that for android devices, it is by default changing quality to Normal Mode, not Draft mode.Regarding cartridge, till date I have printed 20-25 A4 pages including 5-6 colour prints, still the printer is showing the cartridges are full. Will update when the cartridges empties."
1,"This printer is just a way for HP to make you their customer so that you have to buy their expensive cartridges (800 rupees) every week or so. One cartridge is able to print only 25-28 pages which makes the average cost of one page to almost rupees 30/page. This is the worst investment you can make for a printer. Don't get manipulated seeing the cost of the printer as eventual costs of running would be too high to sustain. Also, the return window closes in 7 days so until you realize how useless this printer is, the window will already been closed and you're now stuck with a useless, too-expensive-to-run printer."
3,Very cheap material used for paper feed tray holder. It was broken on first use to hold papers.  The two pieces that hold the paper tray to an angle were already broken. Packaging was not sealed at all.Interestingly printer was wrapped in a plastic cover making it look completely unused but it is hard to say if it is a refurbished or reused/returned product.Print Head alignment does not work easily.
1,I had huge connectivity issues and the there is no response from service of Hp . Pathetic . Don’t buy
5,Very good for home use.I am enjoying it well.Refilling shops are very less for this catridge which is the only problem I saw
5,Good print quality but installation process is very mind disturbing because when we want to give print via our mobile and at that time you have to face many problem in installation.
3,Suitable for home printing. Printing done only after connecting to computer. Wireless feature does not work.
1,Very bad experience . Not at  all good.Regret buying this.
5,good quality product value for money
4,Installation process is very difficult
2,Taking much time to print a single page.. unhappy
4,Good
5,Schoolwork sheet printout but not connecting n smart phone
5,Good
1,Didn’t work .
5,Nice
1,Ink cartridges are used
3,Randomly thros up an E1 error which is paper eroor. Anytime you try setting A4 as the paper size this error pops up. Unable to use the printer
1,"Don't buy this product. I bought same printer which has manufacturing defect . I raised a incident with HP but there is no resolution yet . HP is very poor in providing services .scanning is not working and to print one page , it takes 10 min . Most important , HP doesn't care after sales"
5,Best printer in Market. I will recommend this purchase to everyone. It is worth the value of your investment. Go ahead
5,"Best home printer, very useful, worth to have it. It is a very cost effective product . Print very well"
1,Broken printer. Replacement has been such a big hassle that I had to cancel and return. Scanner glass completely shattered om delivery.
5,"After some settings it started giving very good results... One thing I don't like I was unable to connect the printer through otg cable to my phone, over all its really value for money, I bought it in 5999"
5,Both Black and color print quality is just awesome . What a printer it is ! It's quality is just awesome . Both color and black and white . ...... So purchase this and enjoy . You can see my review at my channel ELECTRIC REVIEW . Thanks
5,Though the printing speed is not excellent but it is perfect for students who print out on regular basis.Easy setup and print quality is also good.
3,"This printer is fast, it prints real quick. Photo printing is also quite decent.I have tried it on Linux and Windows, both work, Linux however always prints in color even if settings are in grayscale.The ink leaks though from bottom, after that paper comes blotched on the edges.I am ok with it as my printing is not mission critical.I would suggest for a couple of thousand more, now you can get wireless inktank auto duplex printers in canon, in case you like more convenience.Overall an average normie printer for the average joe."
4,"After unpacking and installation, it was not printing , raised a complaint with HP support who said that  it’s a hardware issue and the service engineer will be sent to review the same. The engineer was very knowledgable , and he said the issue was owing to a connection that would probably not have been made inside  , and he opened  the printer and he was so right. The printer is working all well ."
2,"Letter size of below 9 is not printing properly, print as double or mirror type, which is not readable. So some PDF file can't print due to its small size of letter. Otherwise for 10 or above 10 size letter, it is good."
3,"Printer is very good. But recieved printer with ink already filled in printer and print head already seal broken and installed in printer. The ink bottles were leaking and ink was all over the printer and booklet, instruction manuals. I don't know if it's replacement printer or old piece. After plugin it is working smooth and producing good color. As the printer is ok n running am not returning but definitely wants to give one star to the seller."
1,"Initially the printer worked fine. But issue started after 2 weeks, once the return period was over.1. Issue related to paper handling. The printer was unable to pull paper properly from input tray, resulting in no printing and paper error. Seemingly the paper pulling roller was not able to make contact properly on the paper and hence not pulling it.2. Then trying to print a test page from HP printer utility, it did not print. Tried multiple times, no luck. As per the printer utility program, if test page do not print, it means that the printer is malfunctioning!Not expected from a new printer from reputed company like HP. Seems a loss of Rs. 7600/-."
4,"Good printer for value for money, good quality and value for money, cartridges are not jaming for seldom use..i use it rarely 1-2 time in a month, still working.Amazon did not provide full detail like product and serial number,i am struggling for warranty claim. the serial number provided is not working. also there is no product number on printer. waiting for amazon response..cons: printer is very very slow. in urgency you will get frustrated and will go to shop for print because it can take several minutes sometime to adjust and print so in urgency it can kill your plan....."
5,If u are looking for very rare use and ink tank and low cost printing.this is best. Just compare canon 1010 and Epson 130
5,"Such a nice product let us see it's all good working,!!adding after using...Best in this category and price as well..... forgot all BV colour printers and be the fan of hp115...g.. great performance and reliability as well!!!"
1,"HP customer service suks so bad , they bluntly said that they dont provide installation service for this model whereas it is mentioned in product video description that installation is provided by HP brand.Couldn't install it properly and couldn't take a single print.Had to return it on same day , thanks to Amazon A class service for accepting the return for this thrash from HP.P.S HP service sux better to go for any other brand other than HP"
1,Had been facing issues aince day 1.Firstly the power button started blinking even though ink levels were sufficient and print heads were properly installed.Then one day when i had to recheck and reinstall the printheads it just won't lock even if i press the blue latch. HP is also denying it to be a manufacturing issue and hence not covered under warranty. I think the seller has to own up else amazon must own responsibly for keeping this defective pieces on their market.
5,"Wanted printer for occasional printing for school work. Fits right for my expectation. Good quality print.Also printed some photos which turned out be good, though not that good.Didn't need any wifi feature, it takes just a second to connect USB wire, spending 2000 more for this feature does not make sense. Also, no need for photocopy as one as always take a photo and print any document.Will update the review after few months"
4,"Review (April 2021): I contacted the helpline (1800 number) and they gave me the contact for technical helpline, which is another 1800 number. The technical support engineer spent almost 30mins in call with me to find out the problem in my printer. We found two issues: (a) the paper feeder needed some cleaning, which was easy to clean with a cotton cloth wrapped in pencil sprayed with some sanitizer (b) the black printer head wasn't functioning at all. So, I was given a free visit to my door step the next day where the technician changed my black printer head for free. The reason for printer head to not function earlier was because the printer wasn't used every week to print and the printer head nozzle got ink clotted. Replacing the printer head solved the problem. I was able to print good quality prints after this. So 5 star rating for hp support and warranty coverage. Amazing job!Review (march 2021): Prints look terrible, if you stop using printer for 2 months - Unable to fix with diagnostic tools. I don't know if ink is getting dry. The hp diagnostic tool says that the ink is not genuine. But I only used hp ink since the purchase time *(aug 2020) and I have hardly done 100 pages of print during these many months with 10 photo prints. I am unable to fix the problem.Purchase-time Review (Aug 2020): Print quality is better if you keep printing more often. If you hardly print on daily basis, occasional printouts doesn't look perfect.  You have to keep using hp software to clean the head before prints."
3,"I thought it is good printer with less speed that's all but I was wrong, it is below average, very slow and not reliable. You can't use paper more than 100 gsm. Though print quality is good till now. Paper pulling mechanism is poorly built."
3,"I purchased hp115 ink tank printer, for 5499 in amazon , printer prints quality below average i print 200 pages all the pages are  not good , i change the cartridges also but print quality not change b/w is better than color print. If you want to but this printer choose another printer ..its only low cost to buy ......"
1,"Not able to start, power is not switching ON. It's been over month. They keep on telling do this do that on WhatsApp. But not willing to send technician. Please do the needful or replace faulty printer."
1,Useless printer.Impossible to take bothside printing. Print quality is good. But it has a paper jamming problem. Paper stuck almost every time if you want to take 8-10 pages printout which makes it useless printer.I'd not recommend to buy. Go for some better option.
1,Printer is goodBut i found the product delivered to me has already been registered for warranty and only 7 months are remaining
5,First of all its the cheapest available Ink tank option on the market. It does the job pretty well. The setup takes a while beyind that its a breeze. Have printed 100s of pages in past 3 months including photos and looks like it sill has ink left... very economical option and certainly a must have if someone is in the market for a printer that just does what it is supposed to do.
5,Awesome for economical printing.Best for home and small office use. Printing speed is moderate when printing @300 dpi and low speed for max dpi prints/ photos.Got 2000 prints as of now. Ink lasts for 3000 prints as per current rate.Best if you don't want additional features like scanning n wifi.Go for it!!
5,"Been using for 4 months as of now, print quality is very nice (Black & white as well as color prints), Installation was hassle free, in between did not use it for more than 20 days, after giving print lines appeared but after doing cleaning with HP software Voila! it started working perfectly.Delivery came on time, Packaging was very nice.Go for it."
1,"Delivered the printer on 6 June,afternoon, I've checked all installation manual even in youtube and followed the instructions,the cartridge was well installed but the paper feeding roller does not work and inside it does not feed in and print it.."
4,"Good printer, scanner is not there but now a days it's easy to scan any doc quickly and print it. Print quality is very good, easy to operate and best part is that running cost is very law. Black printing appx 10 to 12 paisa and colour 18 to 20 paisa and paper cost extra 40 -50 paisa.Thanks"
1,The Packaged arrived in a very poor condition.Packets inside the container were open.The ink tank was already filledThe ink bottles were empty.It couldn't even take the sample print.Continuosly showed error light right from first plug in.
1,Back side socket of plugin dock is got loose within the just 12 days.
1,"Received printer today and called HP support. Followed steps she told and found that power inlet  is moving up and down. Doesn't seem right and I let her know about it. Further setup was done under her guidance, all required software installed. Printer powers up, but doesn't work . Complaint filed. Once again precious time lost."
1,"Online classes in the entire country = bus printer demand. HP removed all discounts, printers are being sold at mrp. Very bad unethical practice."
5,I already have another brands wireless ink tank printer and was looking for a cheaper printer. Got this one as only printing was the sole purpose. Definitely a good buy if scanner functionality is not important.Only drawback is that there is wireless option.
1,I am unable to write this review at the moment because a printer is not even working this particular printer does not come under HPs fitting options that means they will not send somebody from their team to come and setup the printer you have to do it yourself the instructions for setting up the printer and not very complicated they can be done on their own but if there is any issue after setting up HP is not very helpful with it.
3,"I purchased in July 2020. But my warranty is till Feb 2021 which start from 2019 as per HP (OEM) website. Therefore, effectively you are receiving lesser warranty period."
4,Very cost effective and good b/w print quality...For color photos print one need to be spend time in selecting settings and paper quality matters alot.Overall a very good product around ₹6k. Have been using it for last 2 months...
4,Good. Once the paper got stuck. Color printing is damn slow and not that great print. Got it at 4899
5,"It's a good purchase. This printer is great if you are looking for a single function ie printing, printer. Any layman can install it since manuals and first set up tutorial videos are readily available."
5,Value for Money. Good print quality. No ink spill while filling. I personally think it is better than costly catridge based printers.
5,"Really like the product. In case interested in printing only can go for this product as the printing cost is low, quality is good."
1,It is not up to the mark. Very poor quality printing. Not at all advisable for students. Plz do not purchase it.Overall it is a waste product. Not worthy.
5,"good picture quality,easy to use"
1,Unable to use it. There was no installation CD in the packageHave tried & installed online software but the printer isnt working
3,Printer is good but ink runs out quickly especially Colour Cartridge ink.  The print quality is good.
4,"The product is overall good. Pretty decent for someone who has basic home requirements or small business. It does the job. A couple of things to keep in mind:1. Colour image print takes a lot of time. In some cases, it takes upto 3 minutes to print a page. This is mostly dependent upon the file size of the photo. Bigger the size, higher the time. At certain times the print quality may not be that impressive as you may expect.2. For setting up the printer, company has not given a user manual. This may get a little difficult for people who are not highly tech friendly, as bringing up the printer on your local LAN maybe some trouble. A printer on LAN helps you print pages with a lot of convenience.Other than that I found it quite decent!"
2,Printing quality is not good as expected. Disappointed.
3,"Writing this based on 7 days use experience.Pros1. Wifi Printer, having scanner, copy and Fax at low price.2. App based use for convenient print, scan, fax.Cons1. Colour print quality is just average.2. Ink provided along with Printer can last only less than 30 color print.3. Print speed is very slow over wifi. May be 2 paper in a minute4. Getting connected to wifi for printing is a painPersonal thoughts- My use is only 20 page print in a week currently and thus can live with this.Those expecting quality colour print, or high speed printing or print requirement is too much may search for other option, as ink cost will be too high comparing to getting printing outside.Yet to print photo paper to assess quality.More review after new ink installation and few months of use."
3,"1,Can be buy for Minimal uses purpose.2, scanner and printing is slow but reasonable price3, Worsted connection with wifi,many time disconnected , again it will take more time bro reconnect4, Print quality good.5,I purchased only for ADF scanner. That fullfilled.6, I bought 3 days before (6/11/2020) so i don't know reliability.7, cartridge - I taken 10 colour print copy but cartridge ink level shows less than 50% . May be  i can take another 6-7 copy only."
1,It doesn't have a scanner. We purchased a wrong product.It is a total waste of money.
5,"Actually it's a good product. Printing quality is also nice. But there is problem in connection with HP smart app (Mobile version) via ""Wifi Direct"". Actually it's not even a problem it's just a mistake. I had applied for return  and ordered another also. No doubt product is really nice. But now I came to know that it was not even a problem. I watched some videos contacted HP but nothing worked out well. Here's the solution:-1. First connect to a wifi network ( you can also use hotspot).2. Setup the app. Login to your HP account.3. Press Wireless and Resume buttons on printer at the same time for 3 seconds. You will see a small printer and mobile icon on the bottom of the screen (means ""Wifi Direct"" is on).4. Now disconnect you wifi and connect it with your printer.These steps are for the setup. Next time just directly connect to the printer. You will not be able to use internet while you are connected with the printer.I haven't tried it yet. But is 100000% correct. Hope this is helpful...PS: I sold it for Rs 4100, printing cost was so much I gave me around 400 pages for Rs 2000. I tried to refill the cartridge but I didn't worked. Cartridge got condemned. Think before you buy. Good for less use!"
1,"The software is very buggy. Even if paired and connected via WiFi, it does not detect the other 5 in on state even if printer is on. When detected and given print command via mobile it takes ages to transfer a single page document to the printer, and then it prints only half the document wasting the paper.. really frustrated with the printer, wasted almost half day for printing a 1 page document yet no luck..Edit: Updating review to 1 start as even replacement piece was faulty."
1,Can't access the value because no one from Amazon or HP has contacted for installation. Very poor service. A company person came and dumped it at office. No knowledge hot to connect because it's a technical product. It is not a child's play. Also while ordering extended warranty option was missing now it is reflecting. Very confused whom shall I call for the remedy. Either buy in directly from croma or Hp they provide full solution till installment and extended warranty
4,"1. Suitable for small office and home office2. Scanner is good.3. WiFi connectivity is not great4. HP smart is a cloud based app. If you install HP smart half the drivers do not get installed. Reliability is low.5. HP support was very helpful in getting the application package/drives/installation for this device. (Alternatively you can look for drives/set up for Hp 4100 family series drives/app and install)6. Post installation of dedicated app and drives, the device is working beautifully."
1,"I am totally disappointed with it so I replaced it bt after the  replacement while the verification they made cancelled so the product could not replaced. I lost my money 😭😢😢😢. And product is not working properly, while printing it takes whole papers and printing will be in the corner of paper."
1,"don't waste your money on this, within 10-15 pages your black cartridge will be over, and within 10 pages your color will also over, then after that, you cannot refill your cartridge, directly you have to purchase a new cartridge with cost 1400+ for 2 cartridges, wireless connectivity also not good, also it is very complicated to use, the best thing I can say about this is DONT PURCHASE IT."
1,"This is not working properly taking multisheet at a time, ink drying quickly even in black, setup is taking long time and not easy to understand,Quality of the priniting also very bad, it will trouble lot to normal printer user,Service center of hp is very pathetic not even bother about the customer..."
3,"HP DeskJet 4123 Multi-Function Inkjet Printer with ADFThere is absolutely no documentation with the printer. The one-page instruction takes you to a website that is not helpful. It took me a while to get it to work on Windows 10. USB connection didn't work. Can't comment on the quality of printing just yet, but looks pretty average.Do not buy if you don't know what a printer driver is, where to search for it, download and install it. Ideally, such ""home printers"" should have a plug and play installation."
1,"It's works very slowly , I don't like it ...I ordered it but when I connected it via wifi the name of this device is 4100 I don't understand what is happing here, bit confuse this product is real or fake the blue sticker which was their above it's surface in every product in the review. ...But in my product nothing shown like this..I don't no this product is real or not ?"
5,"speed of the print & cost per page print is what the major difference for model to model.At this price range, its decent one.Best for home usage(max 100-150 prints per month).Cons:* Configuring wifi is not simple(especially while using iPhone/Mac). Company can consider giving manual for the same."
5,"Works as expected. I'm totally satisfied with this printer. It's pretty good for home or personal use. And fully loaded features with ease like wireless printing, scan, copy and a 35 page auto document feeder. But it wolud have been better if the catrideges could have printed a few more pages."
5,Wireless printer with app for phone and email id to print from remote location. Other ways also for remote printing. You dont need any cable to print from phone or pc. Cartridge are cheap and print quality also good. Document feeder is a plus thing for hasel free copying or scanning
3,"When it works, its great. But that is exceedingly rare. Paper just keeps getting jammed over and over again. I am honestly trying everything I can to avoid having to get a print out because of the paper jamming issues. Guess it is more environmentally friendly because you will only get a print out when its the only option"
2,"When printing, it prints good but the cartridge finishes up fast though not many print outs taken.Another issue that the printer is not connected wirelessly... It connects on Wi-Fi once, then if I switch it off and on it again, I have to reconfigure it or use cable for printing."
1,No support from HP at all .. the Customer Care number provide in the site is not reachable.(1800-2000-047)
5,"Very satisfied with this printer, copier & scanner. Good part is it comes with ADF.Best multi function printer in this range."
4,The set up is not easy how ever once done especially the Direct WiFI once set up it becomes a good product.
5,Ordered this for my colleague and he loved the WiFi print option. He kept telling me how great the printer works.
5,"The product was delivered as mentioned. Packaging was good. Installation through the hp app and wifi connection was a little time consuming, however not that hard. The prints are good."
2,It's just been a month I bought this product and have us d it just twice and now getting issues with the connection issue printing issue and sometimes gets error as ink over where in ink is also there is cartridge. Really not happy with the product in just a month.
4,My criteria was once a page print per week or 15 days also it has xerox and wireless connectivity so m happyU need to call a technical guy for setup do book in advance wd hp its freeNot tried scanning rest all is good
4,Received the product well in time. Good product in this price range. Print quality is average. Driver is not included in this package. This is creating problem linking with PC. Otherwise it is a good deal.
5,Printer was well packed with safety. Configuration of wifi with HP smart App and Wifi-Direct is easy. i button helps in getting information or you can check YouTube videos also to setup. 805 cartridges are available tricolour and black both.
4,"It's a good Printer from HP, But consuming lot of Ink. If you are using very rarely you can prefer this printer and scanner is also Good. WiFi Tech is great and we can print from phone also through the connected router which is Good to use on the go."
1,This product is not working not working I said
1,Hp ka printer lena apne pese barbad krna h ....qki ek br ink khatam hone pr dubara ink nhi dal pati ..or to iske sare function sahi se kam nhi krte h....bs me itna khna chahunga ki ...hp ka koi bhi printer mt lena...vrna tumhare pese brbad ho jayegnge ...bs hp walo ko pesa kmana h ...
4,"Print quality is avarage, colour printing trough WiFi takes a lot of time and ink to complete. I have given 3 colour print and the output is good but after 3 prints colour fades on paper. I will recommend go for HP 2700 Series, and the document feeder is quiet useless because it damaged the corner of the pages."
2,No of prints per cartridge is very less. Color cartridge exausts very fast. Each prints costs you more than 10Rs.Technology wise it is good. You can fire prints via wifi. Setup is bit tricky
1,Printing or xeroxing output not clear...After 10pages of printing full dots appear ing....Paper getting stuck inside very often....Noise coming around while copying...Totally not compatible and user friendly...
1,First of all its wifi is not working properly.Secondly it's colour isn't that much good as per printing quality.Thirdly it's not cost efficient.Fourthly It would cost you around 3 INR to print a single page of sheet.Lastly it's not a good choice for me.
2,"Very slow , WiFi very poor performanceNot worth buyingAlso hardly 50 pages printed for 5th std school assignment, now the cartridge is empty."
5,मोबाइल से कनेक्ट करके मोबाइल में सेव डॉक्यूमेंट का प्रिंट कैसे निकाल सकते हैं समझ में नहीं आया बाकी पिक्चर क्वालिटी फोटो कॉपी प्रिंटिंग सही है
1,Printer is not easy to install.It doesn't accept the new cartridges.Cost of print is very high.Number of prints is very low. I wish to exchange this printer if possible.It is better to purchase ink tank printer which is economic.
2,Printing cost is very high go for ink tank printer
3,"It was delivered a few hours before the time given. I have just set it up and using the HP app on my phone to print, scan and copy. You can email and send documents on WhatsApp too. HP app is impressive. Responds to commands quickly.Packing was impressive. Unpacking not time consuming. Setting up through HP app on my iPhone was smooth. All functions work well. Connected it to Alexa and the voice commands works too. The only thing to note is the gap between claim of speed of printing and actual printing time it takes. If you are using it for personal use and are not in a hurry the printer speed will not annoy you. It's slow, very slow. I believe it prints not more than two pages b/w in 60 seconds."
1,"This  printer - HP DESKJET INK ADVANTAGE 2700 ALL IN ONE printer of HP make  was purchased on sale, but it ended up with worst product.  The paper jam occurs more frequently, the printer was very very very slow,  print on both pages option not available, and the top loading paper mode was giving more trouble.  The box was not opened for the first 4 days due to Covid pandemic instructions.  The courier boys were first source of spreading covid, and to take utmost care, we have not opened the box containing printer for the first 4 to 5 days till it is completely sanitized.  After installation we had faced so much of inconvenience in paper loading.  The printer is absolutely non-performing, and malfunctioning.  You are requested to immediately take back and give refund or give credit for future purchases.  I am a prime member and dont disappoint by claiming any excuses.  Simply the product (printer) which was purchased on sale was a dump product and is a totally mal-functioning and worst product.  Immediate necessary action may be taken at your end."
3,"Well, the hp 2700 delivered initially had problems with the paper feed. The paper was pulled to one side and got crumpled inside. Amazon team was kind to give replacement within 48 hours. The replacement (same model) was tested and is working fine. Quality control needs to be in place either at HP end and before delivery."
2,"Though the print quality is descent, I could only print 6 color and 24 black prints using the cartridge that came with the printer against the claim of 150color n 450 black prints...."
3,"If one is decently tech savvy, but without the knowledge of the inner workings of a printer the online demo of how to install a cartridge is not up to mark. Ideally it should have been a 5 minute job to download and set up the printer, but because this model is not listed on HP website it shows demo for other model and the cartridge installation section doesn't mention that you have to pull the cartridge insertion slot from the side where it is usually stuffed. I spent another 10 minutes wondering where the cartridge insertion slot was as per the web demo only to figure out myself it is tucked to one side and needs to be slid to the center to insert the cartridge."
2,Great service by Amazon surprise to see the delivery boy early in the morning...great lots of thanks for delivery person for delivery within 24 hrs and nice product received.But HP service has a big big issue.
5,"Very good quality printer and scanner. Easy to use, especially with the wireless connection. We are using this a lot for our work as well as for our kids online school assignments. This is especially helpful because we don't want to go to a cybercafe during pandemic."
5,This printer is working super duper. No catalogue is available with this product except the one featuring essential basic things. But it takes you to the website from where you can set up the entire matters. I am a layman  of 67 years with not much exposure to the nitty gritty of all these but I could manage the entire set up by myself and the printer was in action in less than one hour. Do not regret in purchasing this. I use it at my home ( no commercial need.)Satisfied. Worth the money spent.At this time of writing this review I do not know how much prints one can have from the first cartridge I got along with it.
5,"I initially hesitated to buy this printer reading the reviews,but as it was an emergency I bough it. It got delivered in 2 days, packing was flawless. The wifi setup is easy enough, It took me less than 15minutes to learn everything about it and print from my phone. The print quality is great and it's fast enough, atleast as fast as they claim, 7pages per minute(colour, std quality) ,best quality printing will take longer time and will be taxing for your cartridge, might not need that for most cases. Please ignore other reviews, You can trust me and have a wonderful experience with this printer. Btw I bought it for 5399 ₹, which is excellent value."
2,"Installation was not easy even for the person whose living is earned by working with all such devices. Before he could show me how to print, curfew & lockdown have kept him away. There's no manual in hard copy to help me. Instead of messages from the printer such as ""no paper"" etc there are symbols & they're placed on top, not facing the user. Crippled as I am, not knowing what is showing on top because I'm sitting in front of the desk, not able to ask someone to tell me what symbol is lighted up, & even if they tell me, having no manual to guide me, the printer is unusable at present.Online videos are focused on wireless use & using via phone. Nothing else seems to matter.Because I hadn't found another printer that's not designed similarly, & this was all I could afford, I bought it. Now I'm sorry I did."
4,"The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the first three pages that I printed, the ink smudged across the page. That apart, I am well-satisfied with this product. My usage is not heavy but I generally end up printing between 5-10 pages per week, and this is good enough for my purpose. Linked up well with the android phone also. I don't understand why the latest app was not available in the given HP page, but as soon as I installed the printer app, it blanked out my phone and asked me to install the ""new"" plugin. I mean, where's the point of having two different plugins for the same purpose. Would have been much better to update the main app, rather than force the users to install multiple plugins."
5,"In the past I have used printers of various brands as I do a lot of printing and scanning work. My two year old printer is an Epson ink tank. This is the first time I am using a wireless printer and I am satisfied with the ease of printing and scanning. No more wires required, just connect to the printer wifi and print. The set up was a bit confusing because they have not mentioned much on the printer's manual. The printer's wifi password is also not there on the manual, you will have to print the password from the printer itself. It's a combination of digits. I still have not figured out how to use my home's wifi to print using this printer. There are two ways I use this printer:1. By connecting usb cable from device to printer. This is wired printing.2. By connecting to the printer's inbuilt wifi from any device. This is wireless printing.The third way to print is using your home's wifi which I am not interested. The built quality of the printer is good. However, the color in the cartridge gets used up really quick. I bought this to get print quicky and wirelessly. I still have my Epson ink tank printer for heavy printing. All in all this is a good wireless printer in it's price range."
5,"The printer, scanner and copier, all the functions work very smoothly. You need to give it some time after proper setup so that you can get the best possible speed of printing.Don't fall for negative reviews. People don't understand how the things work in these printers, hence they assume that it doesn't work properly and give negative reviews. Yes, some of them might be genuine issues but I'm sure that not all of them are problematic.If you find problem in detection of page (wrong page size shown) then it is just because of that blue stopper marker, slide and fit it to the tightness, with the page width, I assure you the wrong page size problem will no longer be the problem anymore.Use it wisely to get the longest lifespan and also protect ot from dust to achieve the same...Thank you..."
1,"This is my second printer from HP. First one was 377x series and a best one. Got it for less than 5k. But had a manual hardware damage then I bought this one. Both are pure personal purpose. Highly overpriced with Less capabilities and a complicated one to use!! Very disappointing and regret now. Instaed of this headache , might by one more - but I doubt if it's from hp this time ..."
4,Easy to setup and was delivered next day. Additional black cartridge promised as part of the order was missing.. overall decent for home use.
5,". HP support videos are useful to setup the printer with cartridge etc.printer is easy to setup using hpsmart app on phone. Also once it's setup can be easily accessed from laptop,ipad when all are connected to same wifi.As of now cannot comment on cost of each print..since our usage is very low and just bought it 2 days ago."
1,This product is not user friendly specially through Wifi and mobile Hp app. When the product is purchased online the company or dealer should arrange for installation of the product through their engineer /staff. We are suffering a lot in the absence of this facility. It has become regular practice not to care for after sale service or follow up personally with customer by email or phone through their idle staff just to ask whether the product is working in good condition? and to the expectation? My product is not working till date. Although the cartridges are costly we must get the output as assured by the company. Since last 10 years I am using Hp printer but this time I am totally upset specially in current pandemic situation.
3,"Agree with another reviewer. The quality is questionable.The first printer I got had a defective paper feeder. The ink receptacle also had problems. After every print job E would flash on the printer display. HP support was useless.Fortunately, Amazon agreed to replace (no refund).The second printer set up and works fine."
5,"Quality 10/10Weight - lightSpeed per page - color print slow, black print good.Overall best printer for home usage (300 pages per month) best use.Wifi dual band, easy installation, HP Android application, Alexa, Google Assistant, LCD display Print, Scan, Copy . All in one best printer."
4,"I have ordered yesterday evening and recieved it today.User manual doesn't have much details but got installation demo video on YouTube for 2700 series which helps to get printer installed.Installation is very easy. As of now, printed few b&w and colour pages and happy with the quality of printing.Will write another review after using it for some more days."
2,I recently purchased HP printer 2788. It has printing issues as it prints only on fourth corner of page while rest remains blank. I called customer care of HP they informed about motherboard issue which is manufacturing defect. I asked them to replace the printer but they didn't agreed and said that someone will visit to fix it or I go myself to center to get it done. This is a really bad approach. My printer is under warranty thereby needs replacement on manufacturing defect. I am requesting Amazon as a seller to help with this and get the warranteed product replaced.
1,"Not detecting A4 size paper, no option to connect to agent on customer care, service centre in gurgaon does not have any provision of complaint registration, they don't know email id for complaint registration and very rude behavior by Ms. Babli who attended my call. She doesn't know anything on how to provide support if customer is facing any issue."
4,HP printer 2778 is great for wireless printing and features for wireless connectivity. Initially i had problems with slow printing issues abot 3.5 mins/page but calling up the HP customer care solved my issues on slow priting. Rest all is fine with this printer.
1,"Both HP & Amzon fooling customer. I started facing issue in product within 1 month of purchase but brand is not able to provide proper warranty services, they dont have any service center nearby my location & asking to visit 200kms away service center which is truly impossible for anyone. When approached Amazon for help, they too not able to help due to policy concerns. In short complete waste of money."
1,"After printing, almost 150 black cartridges are empty and colour after 20 pages (A4). The product description was around a rupee and few paise for black and 2 rupees for colour print. Nut in my experience, it is 5.30 rupee for black and white and 40 rupees for colour printer.A complete waste of moneyPrint quality was good, but the installation process was a little time-consuming (registration in the hp smart app and time taken to detect and register the printer)."
3,the printer keeps getting stuck as there is some glitch with windows 10. works fine with my pc's running older versions of windows. Just wont work well with pc's running on windows 10.Setting up the printer is simple and fast . just when printing there is a problem onec the first print job is given then you have to manually reset the print spooler service after every job .
1,"Very bad, it doesn't even get connected, worst product and worst support from Amazon as well as hp I have experienced so far"
2,"First Printer is made in China. It's language also comes in Chinese. Wifi connectivity is very poor, every time while you give print first pair your device it's taking to much time . In box showing Model No. 2770 but in software it's showing 2700 series, and printer also showing in Wifi 2700."
3,First time I received the printer was not even starting. Though it was brand new condition.I ordered replacement and had issues with print quality with stripes and mirror imaging of pictures. Bit shocked with hp quality and unnecessary taking all the troubles. May be I was having bad luck
1,Product does it job but overpriced during sale. Just a false hype created to sell this model.Also paper feeder seems defective getting paper size errors.
5,"Not so easy to install but manageable despite the lack of instructions for this model. Wireless works great but since my WiFi password changed I have been using with wire as am too lazy to figure out how to reinstall it. Print quality is great and I don’t use colour just black and white draft prints which give me 350-400 pages from new cartridge. I am happy with that. The ones that come with the printer are for test only and lasted less than 30 prints for me but the cartridge is pretty affordable so I am very happy with this buy. Would recommend as it’s lightweight, easy to use and prints regular pages pretty fast (not colour)."
3,"The specifications stated that the printer is compatible to windows 10 and 7 along with some other os. But the printer hp2778 which was supplied to me was not compatible to windows 7 and compatible to windows 10 only. Although at the time of ordering I got it clarified also. Moreover on the package carton also mentioned compatible to windows 10,7. Due to this non conformity I had plenty of trouble in installing the printer. Ultimately I have to get set with a laptop having windows 10 as os hence incurring additional costs and inconvenience."
5,"For home use it is very good printer. With Wifi feature I can shift my printer to any place in my home. I took photo prinout on A4 photo paper and print was very good, but it took lot of colour ink. Overall satisfied with the printer."
1,"This printer is not working properly. Not able to connect to wifi or laptop.  Not able to print documents from my laptop.  I want to replace it, if possible."
1,The product didn’t work after installation  - had to call hp engineer who said that the PCB is not working and they Would repair it instead of replacing the printer
5,"Very good product.Printer is light weight, easy to install n set up. Print quality very good. Got 2 cartridges with it. Compact.Highly recommended 👍"
1,IF I COULD GIVE LESS THAN 1 STAR I WOULD.THE PRINTER IS CONSTANTLY THROWING PAPER MISMATCH ERROR. TRIED DIFFERENT SETTINGS BUT TO NO AVAIL. COPY SIZE GETS RESIZED AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN SETTINGS.I AM FED UP OF THE PRODUCT.
2,"First paper will not get straight,it has lot of error,ink get half exhausted after 4 th colour print. I didn't like the product ..Not a value for money.."
5,Very compact lightweight printer. Wifi is working nicely. Installing HP smart in Laptop is a little tricky but at the end it's working fine.
4,"Vary wrost product, waste of money, cartridge ink finished within 15 days and unable to refill it, refilled but not getting actual colour. Very bad product. Not expected such thirdclass quality for HP"
1,Don't  buy it built in cartilage can't print more than  500 pages  new cartilage cost around  5000
3,Work fine with window laptop . No support mac book
1,Products not working paper jam in machine also heat machine we send complaint to HP but there is no response do not buy HP products
1,Don't buy this if you are finding a auto duplex printer.As written in specifications it is auto duplex but in real it is manual duplex printer.
4,"it is an easy to use, good entry level printer, adequate for home use, and most routine print jobs. somewhat too high priced for what it offers."
1,It doesn't have much options for this value. We will get the best printers than this with this rate & this is non-returnable item.
1,Bad quality China item
4,"Good product, very easy to use and install.Don't know about the cartridge refilling cost which will decide the complete review."
1,"Waist of money After 8-10 days printer not working, we trying to contact service center but still problem not solved need your support i want to replace this product."
5,Very Nice Product readable price
3,Good
5,"Nice printer, good printing speed and quality"
5,Still going good

2,No installation instructions and No CD is available for Drivers installation... Still trying to download if not so I can cancelled it
5,"Printer print quality is nice and very useful for office work, The device is small in size and does not take up much space."
5,Best printer in this price range...thanks to appario retail ltd. & to amazon as well!! 👍🏻

5,Awesome... Not problem at all... #Must buy.
1,Print quality is good
5,awesom
5,Excellent Product
5,Best
5,"I love this product, it is helpful and easy to print out , disadvantages:- both side print not automatic and watts not mention."
2,"Don't buy this printer bcoz cartridge is not refillable, every time u must have to spend approx 2100 for in built toner chip"
5,Good product 👍👌
1,"Within 2 hrs of purchase i realized and experienced that running cost of 6075 is BOMB. In a rate of if you keep printing 10 pages Blank and white and 5 color daily., cartige will drain out in week. So, maintenance Cost would be 6,000 Rs per month., as good as buying monthly printer.Other issue:Makes lots of noicePrinting is not crisp, has shadesSlow printingDemoed issues to Amazon support and asked if i can get replacement for other models and they said per policy they can replace with 6075 but not other models.Any selling has to help customers and their satisfaction, but here even if customer is offering more money for better product, Amazon is not willing to exchange.Honestly, get any printer which running cost is low and print quality is good and fast."
4,"Happy with the advertised features like auto duplexing of prints, printing with mobile, laptop over WiFi using the HP App, scan and copy. The most unique feature that I noticed while using the Printer, is the paper storage tray-box. The papers are stored in a box that is like a small drawer near the base of the printer. It’s like a hidden box and to me, it’s a nice invention to keep the papers tucked neatly and dust free. When it runs out of paper, apart from the notification that you get on the app, a light also starts blinking to remind of paper shortage. Also, the printer makes nice sound (wind chime) when it starts and also when it is turned off. A blue light keeps emanating from the point where the paper comes out after printing the documents and the light looks awesome and cool. In the past few weeks, I have taken over 200 prints and the cartridges are still holding up though the printer has been showing notifications of low ink level for last 10-12 pages. Not sure, if this helps - but you will need to disconnect from WiFi and connect to the printer when requesting print from laptop or mobile or tab. Another cool thing is, you can setup a unique email address of the printer and send a print over the email. I have not tried this feature yet but will do so in sometime. Attached are pictures and video for reference. ThanksPS: deducted one star for little struggle that I faced during installation as instructions were not clear and had to download updates and trouble shooter to complete the installation."
4,This is the latest model of HP printer launched in 2020 and the design is sleep look Compared to the old model also the led notifications are futuristic. Connects perfectly and the print quality of the paper is Good.. If you see any change is the warranty it might show bit old but when you call or check in the virtual chat it will reflect correct with your serial number. Will post my second review after a month to see if any issues in the future
5,"Looks classy & does the job well. No complaints!People complaining about the ink getting over quickly should realize that cartridge that came with the printer is a ""starter"" cartridge. The actual HP 682 that we would need to buy once the starter cartridge runs out would last much longer."
3,"The products build quality is superb, installation part is easy, but there are zero controls on the printer itself and all is controlled through an hp app, the color toner gets finished faster than you can imagine... Only 20 color print outs and it's already gone... So printing colored is expensive. Would recommend people to go for ink tank options as this one is having expensive printing."
5,"Jan 05, 2021So far I've printed only with regular paper and the prints are good. Will update the review about print samples when I get some good paper and print.Ink - runs out pretty fast. After some 12 to 15 prints the colour ink level is down by 10% so I'm guessing it will give me a total of about 100 prints before cartridge replacement is needed. thats about 7 to 10 bucks per colour print... not bad because any shop prints colour A4 for about Rs. 30 to 50 and this prints much better quality than the small shops that do these prints.WIFI - this is the most amazing part about the printer. Tried printing via Wifi from iPhone, windows 10 laptops and Desktop, and from Android phone and it works perfectly.Size and look - its really compact and looks slick! I looked at various ink tank printers and finally decided on this because whats obvious from the numerous reviews out there is that ink tanks are for the bulk printing folks. We will print 2 or 3 prints per week and at 7 to 10 rupees for a print in colour with all the features this printer offers us unparalleled value.the ink tanks seem to print duller colour prints because that for bulk low cost printing and not for a discerning buyer. So if you are looking for the best prints in a 10K  printer then this one is hard to beat!will upload photos of print soon.Auto duplex printing is an added advantage and works well too..."
5,"Printer is super easy to install. All the functions like copying, scanning, printing can be performed smoothly. Built is strong. Cartridge installation is also very easy. One can easily set up the printer by following installation guidelines on the HP Smart app. And one can also choose advanced settings on the app and it will take the user to the HP website. The user needs to log into the account and there are a lot of options for settings to choose from. Make the most of the app features to utilise the printer to the fullest."
3,"Printer looks premium but it functions erratically. When papers in the tray are less than 15-20, it won't recognize the same and we have to add more papers. Even after adding papers it will show error and than we have to clear the ""paper jam"" by opening the top cover of the printer (though physically there was no paper jam). Moreover 1st page printing takes longer than the expected time."
5,"Best feature is auto-duplexWifi works flawlesslythe lighting and sound features make it look premium and cutting edge.fits really well with the aesthetics of the room.idk why people are giving it a bad rating. i was reluctant to buy it looking at the ratings, but then i saw some youtube unboxing and bought this with fingers crossed. Im more than happy with my purchase."
4,"It was easy to install. Took just 15mins to complete the process. Print quality and speed looks okay.They provided only starter ink cartridges so I suggest people to not judge the printing cost per page by using starter cartridge.Need to check after using originl cartridge for the cost effectiveness.Overall, I found this printer good. It is the only model with auto duplex (2 sided printing). So I am happy about it."
5,"Very budget friendly yet very economic printer. We get auto duplex printing below 10k price range which is the main point inspired me to purchase this one after reviewing so many printer models from different brands.One may think that cartridge type inkjet printer may not be economoc when compared to ink tank inkjet printers. Well partially it is true when your printing volume is very high compared to occassional printing.One thing is that this model comes only on white. Hence, care has to be taken to keep it clean. Setting it up is very very easy. Before everything you have to download hp smart app in your phone. It supports Bluetooth printing also. Hence, turn on the Bluetooth first, open hp smart amd it will detect your printer. Once hp smart detects it it will ask for you to setup wifi connection for your printer. Requirement of laptop is not essential to setup this printer. That is one of the biggest point of buying it. A mobile/tablet/ipad is enough to get things done."
5,"Strictly for home user who wants no headaches and prints occasionally. Very easy to setup using HP smart App. Did not face a single hiccup while setting up or using it till now.I have taken around 30 prints till now, print quality is very good. Build quality is very good, scan lid could be more sturdy. contemporary design, look and feel. Paper tray is tucked in at the bottom very nicely.Print speed is Ok, not great and not bad either. Duplex printing is awesome. Scanning with high resolution takes time, but usual day-to-day documents which we want to scan with medium or low resolutions, the speed is decent. It came with starter cartridge, so cant expect it to last long,If you are using office laptop for work from home, Its better to set it it up first time using your personal Mobile first. Install HP Smart App and set up the printer. Once done try using add printer wizard in office laptop and add it. HP smart app might not get installed in office laptop as most of the time MS App Store is blocked.Printer maintenance (cartridges) is a not very economical. But for a low usage home user it does not matter would not even notice it. For a low usage Home user who wants all features (Auto Duplex, document feeder, scanner, copier, High quality prints) with great looks, compact design AND is not too pricey this is the best fit."
1,"Worst product from HP. Even though I managed to print 3-4 pages, the printer failed to initialize right from the moment I switched it on. Even HP engineer visited my place that too AFTER 8 DAYs(lodged complaint on 9th Nov 2020 and he came on 18th Nov 2020) of complaining and gave up on it saying we'll issue a DoI and take the product back."
2,"I will mention only one point which is horrible,in this printer according to me,u cannot connect it via USB cable only,it won't work,u cannot connect it with cellphone or laptop directly via wifi.It will connect only with a third party wifi signal to which the laptop or signal is connected.lastly the worst part u cannot connect two devices one after another if u connect second device then the first device won't connect again.Start up is also very slow and takes a lot of time,there is no screen on the printer touch screen panel"
1,"Cartridges are outdated (just like filament bulbs in the age of LED bulbs). Check the cost from HP itself:Cartridge: Rs 5 per page (see below for more)Ink tank: 18 paise per pageThere is no comparison !!The above cartridge cost as per yield of the HP 682 cartridges ~ 480 pages (Black & White) & ~150 pages (Colour). This is like a petrol car giving 30kmpl in city traffic. It is less than half. If you get 200 pages (black - Rs 792) or 75 pages (color - Rs 972), you are lucky.HP is fooling people by still selling the cartridge printers. These are best seen in museums.~*~"
1,"I was delivered HP 6075 printer with only one black cartridge installed. The colour was missing. A brand new hp printer does not have cartridge installed, else how will we know if the cartridge inside is genuine not refurbished. Amazon support team is excellent in helping with return. But this kind of experience is bad. Eventually I will be buying offline from one of the malls."
4,The printer does the job as in the description. The reason i chose this model was only because of the auto-duplex feature which saves a lot of time and effoet. No problems whats so ever. Had a complication in setting up the printer for wireless access. The connectivity is not consistent. You need to assign a static ip address to the printer for it to work properly. Apart from the wireless connectivity there are no other complaints I've.
4,"After reading the mixed reviews about print quality ,installation and catridge issue, I was a bit skeptical to buy this printer. But after using the printer for a week now, I can say it is the best choice I have made for my needs of home printing. The printer is  very nice, sleek and is light weight. Installation was bit of a struggle as there were no clear instructions and I had to google to figure out the steps after the app is installed on phone. But once it got connected it has been running smoothly. I have used all the functions - printing, scanning and copy and all are working smoothly. I would recommend this printer for people who wants a printer for home i.e for school project/ scanning/ copying few documents. It occupies less place and not very huge as compared to other printers."
3,Bought this close to 10k rupees. Overall it’s for home purpose only. Print quality is good.I went to high price just for duplex printing.Con:Scanner is just ok. I say it has bad scanning capability. 300ppi scanning is good. 600ppi takes 40 seconds. For 1200 ppi one must die and take rebirth to see it.Don’t thing scanning is fast like what we see at xerox shop
5,Installation was smooth and didn't take much time to sort things out and make it working. HP smart app is pretty user friendly that way.4.2* from 328k reviews does say the app is good enough to do what is expected out of it.My 5 stars is purely on the value for money it carries with wifi and auto duplex features.
5,Pro'sThe size is very sleekThe light indications for various events and errorsThe paper tray has a yellow light indicating the tray is not closedDuplex printingGood quality photo printsEasy to Print using phoneCon'sThe cost of ink and prints are bit expensive but that a case for any inkjet
4,Good print quality and easy to print.The main disadvantage with the printer is its very hard to install/Setup. Got no installation manual with the printer..and the one available online doesn't help.with the wifi set up. Had to do lot of trial and error methods to make the printer work on wifi.Also no specific set-up videos onYou Tube for this particular model.
2,"The printer is not as user friendly as claimed. Event after following all the prompted actions, it encountered problems while connecting through HP app on IOS. With much effort, the printer finally started but still did not receive print command from mobiles. Had to connect to PC using USB for printing. So much for dual band direct WIFI feature. Will update review after using it for a month or two."
1,Had to return because the product was damaged and had black ink marks
1,"I thought the low cost printer, might be equivalent to 4279 printer. But this one very downgraded model. DO NOT BUY and DON'T GOI Feel bad  why brought this mud boxBetter go for INKTANK printers"
5,Received the product in good condition.. Packing was good.. Print quality is also good.. Fully satisfied with product.. Would recommend others to buy Hp products...
5,"Wanted a printer for home and home office use. Max usage of 200-300 pages per month. Delivery on time, setup/installation was simple and without any hitches. Printing smooth, already printed 200 pages with the cartridge supplied along with the printer. Overall satisfied."
3,The cartridge printed only 20 black pages before starting to display that printer is low on inksThis is suprirngly odd as I bought same printer for myself 1 month back - and the Catridge is still running good despite being printed 200 pages.
4,Please HELP!I need a cover for the printer HP Ink advantage 6750 I just bought from Amazon. I dont see a compatible cover online for this printer model.
5,"First day usage review:Got early delivery. Thanks to Amazon.Packaging was good and device is very light weight.Configuration and setup was very easy.Tested colour, B/W printing - working fine.Tested photo copying - working fine.Tested scanning - working fine.This works fine with USB cable and WiFi on Windows 10 laptop.Working good from iPhone mobile too.Thanks to HP and Amazon."
1,It's Very Bakbass Product I Ever Purchased From Amazone. The print Quality is very Pood.  It's had not All colours. Bad Product. Plz donot purchase it. Go for another lazier prienter. I want my money back
5,"Good product for home and children use. Print quality is fine. Not like laser printing or professional work, but good for students. Color printing is also good. Wireless printing gives a good overall experience and easyness."
1,"First printer worked perfectly. The second printer is defective, the cartridges that came with it were dry, its a month now and even after repeated calls there is no response from the customer support.I have had excellent experience with hp products but this last product and after sale support is such a disappointment ."
4,"Hello everyone,Just received the printer. Printing, scanning & copying works fine from mobile & PC. To have auto duplex function, please install the correct driver from the HP website. So far the printer works good. Need to check how many pages it prints per cartridges."
1,It's printing cost is very high.It Cartridge cost approx INR 800/=each (Black & Tri Colour).Company wrote that u can print 480 pages from Black Cartridge and 150 pages from tri colour but it's not true. After 200-250 print app will show u very low on ink.I will not recommend any one to buy this product.
1,"This is a horrible product, doesn’t detect your mobile or any other device it takes hours to print or scan a single page. It is easier to go to a market and get it the print than priting from this useless machine . I would give a 0 out of 5 star to this. Doesn’t work on a 300 mbps connection. Dont buy!"
5,"Setup was a bit time consuming. Google cloud print, Airprint setups are a little tricky. Printer works well. It is opted to use WiFi always."
5,Good product. Works flawless as advertised.
1,ultimate third class product. none of the option is esay to install nor east to take care of it. printing cost too high. company making customers fool by making false statement regarding cost of printing . its not at  all cheap or user friendly . WORST IS THE IDEAL WORD TO EXPLAIN it
5,Very easy to install . Running very smoothly.
1,"Slowest printer , After giving print option you can make a hot green tea in your electric kettle and can complete your tea..But for every print cup of tea is not good to health"
5,"At this budget it is fantastic. It is efficient and easy to use. I do not know why some people are saying it is slow. Because it is not slow. You have to set ""plain paper"" in the properties before you start printing. It is very fast. I printed 80 black and white pages in around 9 minutes. The problem is by default it selects the glossy paper and takes a hell lot of time. Obviously, if you are not printing photos, why would you select glossy paper. For document printing select plain paper and see how fast it can print! Quality of print is also great. There are three options - draft, better and best. I was happy with the draft quality. I printed 450 pages on a single day. It did not give me any trouble at all."
1,"Please don't buy this printer, the paper gets jammed each time. Amazon customer care was good, they got a new replacement printer  which worked for around 2 weeks. Again the new printer is having the same problem. I've given to hp service centre, will update you soonUpdate: hp replaced it with a new printer-another model ( working)"
5,"I am so unlucky beacause when I ordered it after that day the of the printer discresed.  Ok, I am happy to share you that I received a very good printer. I want to tell you that if your buying price range is under 5,000/- then you can buy it.  It's printng cost is medium not so high or low( 1.4  & 5 ). I buy this in 4,814/-  & my purchase date is 23/11/2020. I get this printer in three days after order in Coochbehar, West Bengal.  I install it in pc in four minites. You can also do it. I am a boy of class 8. I can do it easliy."
3,Now i understood why this printer is rated 3 star on amazonVery slow printingNot good for office purposePrint quality is okayIt takes 2-3 minute to get ready once to switch it onYou may go for this printer if you print 50-100 pages a month
1,"Had a very bad experience with both the manufacturer and Amazon. After receiving the printer I wasted by complete one day to install the printer and software as no demo was provided. Finally, when started using the printer, I came across several issues like extremely slow, paper getting stucked and printer hanged and need restart. Hence, I replaced the printer. The another printer which I received was already broken so good that I didn't had to waste my time to install. But here comes the returning issue. At first the delivery person who came to take back the return refused to take it back saying the serial number is not matching. I immediately called the customer care but they couldn't communicate with the delivery person due to language issue. This all happened in between by office meeting. Then customer care re-scheduled the return and finally the same delivery person took the printer back and thankfully Amazon refunded my amount back with no more issues."
5,"Order experience - Ordered last night, arrived today morning. Unboxed - cardboard/thermacole suffered some tear but product was intact & plastic sealed with wires & both cartridges. Plugged in tested copy and print - works like a charm.After Sales Support - Did not know how to use manual duplex (print both-side), called tech support - he guided and explained me process/steps; tried it - worked as expected. 1 hour back got a call from tech support to confirm resolution before closing ticket. Really liked it.Overall feedback - I read so many negative reviews about paper jam, ink level and issues after few days. I got concerned but as everything is working seamlessly and got great support, I feel positive. This is my second HP printer; I don't think there would be a better product with such features at this price."
1,"I have received last week due to got busy in some family function didn't get time to open it. as return/placement date  mentioned 6/Jan/21, i opened last night and  found used product delivered.1) Only cartages wrapper present in box , cartages attached in to printer , cartages should be seal packed.2) as cartages are  attached to printer it means they are used.3) No information booklet present in box.4) printer inside box is opened without any wrapping. 100% sure this product is used and then return by someone, same has delivered to me.Although its mention on order ""HP DeskJet 2335 All-in-One Ink Advantage Colour PrinterReplacement may be possible through 06-Jan-2021""Amazon saying relacment is not possible as date has been passed although replacement request raised on 6th .Better not opt for amazon for costly product and specially this seller ""Appario Retail Private Ltd"" who has delivered this item._----------------------------------------_--+-++++-Update, got immediate replacement with new printer but new printer is not working copy and print function not working.Even after talking with hp support they are not able to solve the problem, somehow amazon ask to return the product."
1,Worse printer m facing problem now. The ink is full but it shows no print n no ink . the demo page can be print but . the light keeps blinking saying no ink.  HP is a cheater. Its waste of time as bought for college print works. This Printer is a scam. Check youtube as well it says this printer is always creating problem no use.  It was late to change as mine amazon package cover was thrown so. It won't be accepted to return. They said only can be replaced . so total waste of money and time
5,Good quality print. Good packing condition. Value for money.
1,"I purchased this product and was unable to install driver on my Windows 10 laptops. [Note: Both Windows 10] The call to HP was long wait and finally I got through. The person tried to install device driver but wasn't successful. He was installing HP 2300 series driver. After that I did some research and tried to install F2200/F2224 driver on my old Windows 10 laptop and it worked on one of the laptop. The message on newer windows 10 laptop was that you are using older version of device driver. A service engineer came but  couldn't do much. Surprisingly he told me that your laptop has a problem. I explained that it's a DELL laptop and not an assembled one and uses legitimate windows 10. I tried to tell him that windows 10 might have a newer patch and there might be a patch for driver as well. But he was not very keen probably trained by HP.  I am keeping printer and will update if at all HP sees this and comes back to me with resolution as I have told him that I can even wait for 15 days. He also said I am free to give whatever ratings I want. ??My service ID: BRFZ7243A descent product but extremely poor HP service. It's not a technician's fault but the attitude of parent company HP. They want to make money but don't care about educating their technicians. This is how they train people. There is no attitude to help customers, no desire to learn @ issues and no desire to solve issues, no log checking, poor debugging. They are taught to close the cases by parent company. HP wake up...  Don't be complacent ..."
2,Stopped working in couple of week. This is my third and HP s second printer. First I bought from store lasted like 7-8 years without any issue as I remember. And this time bought online. Printer got internally damaged and one gear stud got broken. I don't know how this could happen in such short time (couple of times only) use.
4,"I have been using this printer for taking print outs of my Kids home work and documents.The print quality is not good as we get in the shops or office, but this will be enough the above said uses. Prints are little lighter on black and greyscale. I tried changing the settings , but it did not help.The test print with colour looked good, but I have not taken any more colour printouts.Printing in greyscale can finish up the colour inks very quick, so use it only if required."
3,"It just meets expectations of printing and scanning. However, there are quite a few issues which are not that satisfactory.1. The paper gets stuck very often when it starts rolling into the printer. The paper tilts to a side and gets stuck. The print is just OK.2. The scanning takes very long. And after using it for nearly a month, I am still to figure out how to create a single file from multiple scans. And settings are too clumsy. Not user friendly settings.3. Product looks too brittle. Not sturdy/robust."
4,"Being HP product is good. However for scanning you are compelled to go online i.e. through HP App which is not desired and very cumbersome. During which a lot of HP updates squeeze-in in your system. This printer has an HP offer of free headset. Here is the problem. The invoice sent with the delivery is thermal print out and is difficult to read contents in that more particularly the serial number of printer which is must for redeeming offer. The invoice if downloaded come in two parts /pages, i.e Part-1 invoice without serial number of printer and Part-2 Packing slip with serial number of printer and HP redemption cell do not consider packing slip and also invoice without serial number of printer. Hence offer not allowed. Sorry."
1,"Cartridge printed only 40 pages, and it empty now.You mentioned wrong printing quantity.Cartridge cost is rupees1553 for 1 set which gives approx 40 pages print.  Print is very costly.Never buy HP printer.Printer is cost effective but ink cartridge is very costly.Never go for it."
1,"I bought this HP 2335 printer and regretted it. I wasted 2 days of my time fixing this printer. Nothing happened. Then I called Amazon for returning this product. The representative said she would replace this product with another one. The replacement arrived the next day. But the replacement is also a junk product and it does not work. So, I am again trying to reach Amazon and I am getting the message that the customer service call back service is not available.I am a busy executive and I don’t have time to waste like this. I regret buying this product!Don’t waste your money buying this product  and also don’t waste your precious time fixing this junk!I don’t understand why Amazons customer service call back Service is unavailable. So how can we return the defective product?"
1,"There are too many driver compatibility issue and lack of integration for apple devices. Customers should not be going through this kind of unnecessary hassle.Instead of making multiple printers with almost similar features and price range, HP should concentrate more on ease of usage and superior experience for end user with better product quality and support."
4,Please send me Installation disc as I am senior citizen so as to enable me to run.Product is Good.Awaiting favorable Installation disc to solve Scan Issues.
1,The HP DESKJET INK ADVANTAGE ALL IN ONE PRINTER delivered on 31 December 2020 (13 Days back) was a defective piece as paper was getting jammed. As per the policy return of such items within seven days only is permitted.
2,The printing speed is very slow and not WiFi version only usb connectivity.Their promise is fake they said the black cartridge print 480 pages but this print only 100-120 pages and cartridge is empty.Like that colour cartridge print only 30 pages . My money is worst / waste . So I want you that don't buy this product this is fake claim of cartridge and printing quality is very slow
1,This printer is one of the most inconvenient printers I have ever used. The manual doesn't give any information. And the print and scan function doesn't work. Only photocopy works.
4,Fast to print. Clear prints. Ver good after sales service also. I had to get a replacement as the first one I received had a problem with paper loading. It got replaced very fast and the Amazon technician was excellent
1,It is totaly bad product there was no ink in this cartridge cartridge was empty and the costumer care is not helping us I totally waste my money kindly costumer care please help me to change this product
5,"Works perfect for my usage, we need max 30-40 prints a month.This works perfectly well and print quality is good. It's a machine now give it time to do its job for printing for few seconds. Not an issue for me atleast."
3,This printer very reliable to use and printer quality is good(I am talking about black print only) but I got defected tricolor cartidge and I have given the cartridge for replacement to HP authorised service centre. I will update my review colour print quality after I get the new color cartidge from service centre.
4,"Easy to install,  photocopy and printing is easy but scanning is little cumbersome. But works well."
5,This is 1st reviewI want to tell you all guys that this also work on LINUX without any extra app.Very easy to use
2,Print quality is very poor. The cartridge gives very less number of prints. Nowhere near to the mentioned 100-300 pages. Scanner is good. Giving 2 stars just because of that. No value for the money paid...
1,"Tried to contact customer service, so many times!!. Amazon customer service will ask you to contact the HP service team to get a job sheet for return. Now the brand new printer is sitting in the storage room. Gave up the idea of returning it."
1,"Invariably paper gets stuck, twisted. Have to hold n guide it. Takes hours to print.  The worst printer i ever used in 3 decades!"
1,I've ordered it and firstly I wasn't working then I replaced it hopefully that good product will reach me out but unfortunately again the same problem... Printer isn't working and roller are jam and and somewhere there is hardware issue...and wasting my time with this product... think twice before you go for this product.😔
5,It's very easy to use. This product is cheap and best.
5,"Very helpful & awesome printer at a reasonable price. Printing speed as normal, very good packaging & safely delivered by Amazon. Thank You Amazon & HP"
1,Printer was for Home use. But Printer DEFECTIVE.... NO INVOICE SENT EITHER.LABEL SHOWING WRONG SERIAL NUMBER AS CONFIRMD BY MR SAMUEL OF HP AS WELL AS MS MUSHKANHP NOT WILLING TO RENDER SERVICS DUE TO WRONG SERIALNUMBER>DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS SERVICE OF AMAZON
1,Worst printer one can buy. Please don't buy. The paper gets stuck all the time. The color is getting dispersed on rubbing. Unfortunately my return window is over by the time i realized.Now the printer is showing error carriage stalled and not able to use it.
5,It's not slow. Change the settings of the printing then it will be faster.Initially I felt same with my experience.Later on after changing settings it is working faster like any other printer
3,The power supply cable is not fitting the printer its very loose ofter its comming out
1,Terrific Experience.....I received a used product yesterday....both ink cartridge is not in sealed pack .Ink cartridge already fitted in the printer and it was used product.I call customer care but they said they can't replace my product now
1,Currently the only option i have is to use it with phone.
5,"After some settings it started giving very good results... One thing I don't like I was unable to connect the printer through otg cable to my phone, over all its really value for money, I bought it in 5999"
5,Both Black and color print quality is just awesome . What a printer it is ! It's quality is just awesome . Both color and black and white . ...... So purchase this and enjoy . You can see my review at my channel ELECTRIC REVIEW . Thanks
5,Though the printing speed is not excellent but it is perfect for students who print out on regular basis.Easy setup and print quality is also good.
3,"This printer is fast, it prints real quick. Photo printing is also quite decent.I have tried it on Linux and Windows, both work, Linux however always prints in color even if settings are in grayscale.The ink leaks though from bottom, after that paper comes blotched on the edges.I am ok with it as my printing is not mission critical.I would suggest for a couple of thousand more, now you can get wireless inktank auto duplex printers in canon, in case you like more convenience.Overall an average normie printer for the average joe."
4,"After unpacking and installation, it was not printing , raised a complaint with HP support who said that  it’s a hardware issue and the service engineer will be sent to review the same. The engineer was very knowledgable , and he said the issue was owing to a connection that would probably not have been made inside  , and he opened  the printer and he was so right. The printer is working all well ."
2,"Letter size of below 9 is not printing properly, print as double or mirror type, which is not readable. So some PDF file can't print due to its small size of letter. Otherwise for 10 or above 10 size letter, it is good."
3,"Printer is very good. But recieved printer with ink already filled in printer and print head already seal broken and installed in printer. The ink bottles were leaking and ink was all over the printer and booklet, instruction manuals. I don't know if it's replacement printer or old piece. After plugin it is working smooth and producing good color. As the printer is ok n running am not returning but definitely wants to give one star to the seller."
1,"Initially the printer worked fine. But issue started after 2 weeks, once the return period was over.1. Issue related to paper handling. The printer was unable to pull paper properly from input tray, resulting in no printing and paper error. Seemingly the paper pulling roller was not able to make contact properly on the paper and hence not pulling it.2. Then trying to print a test page from HP printer utility, it did not print. Tried multiple times, no luck. As per the printer utility program, if test page do not print, it means that the printer is malfunctioning!Not expected from a new printer from reputed company like HP. Seems a loss of Rs. 7600/-."
4,"Good printer for value for money, good quality and value for money, cartridges are not jaming for seldom use..i use it rarely 1-2 time in a month, still working.Amazon did not provide full detail like product and serial number,i am struggling for warranty claim. the serial number provided is not working. also there is no product number on printer. waiting for amazon response..cons: printer is very very slow. in urgency you will get frustrated and will go to shop for print because it can take several minutes sometime to adjust and print so in urgency it can kill your plan....."
5,If u are looking for very rare use and ink tank and low cost printing.this is best. Just compare canon 1010 and Epson 130
5,"Such a nice product let us see it's all good working,!!adding after using...Best in this category and price as well..... forgot all BV colour printers and be the fan of hp115...g.. great performance and reliability as well!!!"
1,"HP customer service suks so bad , they bluntly said that they dont provide installation service for this model whereas it is mentioned in product video description that installation is provided by HP brand.Couldn't install it properly and couldn't take a single print.Had to return it on same day , thanks to Amazon A class service for accepting the return for this thrash from HP.P.S HP service sux better to go for any other brand other than HP"
1,Had been facing issues aince day 1.Firstly the power button started blinking even though ink levels were sufficient and print heads were properly installed.Then one day when i had to recheck and reinstall the printheads it just won't lock even if i press the blue latch. HP is also denying it to be a manufacturing issue and hence not covered under warranty. I think the seller has to own up else amazon must own responsibly for keeping this defective pieces on their market.
5,"Wanted printer for occasional printing for school work. Fits right for my expectation. Good quality print.Also printed some photos which turned out be good, though not that good.Didn't need any wifi feature, it takes just a second to connect USB wire, spending 2000 more for this feature does not make sense. Also, no need for photocopy as one as always take a photo and print any document.Will update the review after few months"
4,"Review (April 2021): I contacted the helpline (1800 number) and they gave me the contact for technical helpline, which is another 1800 number. The technical support engineer spent almost 30mins in call with me to find out the problem in my printer. We found two issues: (a) the paper feeder needed some cleaning, which was easy to clean with a cotton cloth wrapped in pencil sprayed with some sanitizer (b) the black printer head wasn't functioning at all. So, I was given a free visit to my door step the next day where the technician changed my black printer head for free. The reason for printer head to not function earlier was because the printer wasn't used every week to print and the printer head nozzle got ink clotted. Replacing the printer head solved the problem. I was able to print good quality prints after this. So 5 star rating for hp support and warranty coverage. Amazing job!Review (march 2021): Prints look terrible, if you stop using printer for 2 months - Unable to fix with diagnostic tools. I don't know if ink is getting dry. The hp diagnostic tool says that the ink is not genuine. But I only used hp ink since the purchase time *(aug 2020) and I have hardly done 100 pages of print during these many months with 10 photo prints. I am unable to fix the problem.Purchase-time Review (Aug 2020): Print quality is better if you keep printing more often. If you hardly print on daily basis, occasional printouts doesn't look perfect.  You have to keep using hp software to clean the head before prints."
3,"I thought it is good printer with less speed that's all but I was wrong, it is below average, very slow and not reliable. You can't use paper more than 100 gsm. Though print quality is good till now. Paper pulling mechanism is poorly built."
3,"I purchased hp115 ink tank printer, for 5499 in amazon , printer prints quality below average i print 200 pages all the pages are  not good , i change the cartridges also but print quality not change b/w is better than color print. If you want to but this printer choose another printer ..its only low cost to buy ......"
1,"Not able to start, power is not switching ON. It's been over month. They keep on telling do this do that on WhatsApp. But not willing to send technician. Please do the needful or replace faulty printer."
1,Useless printer.Impossible to take bothside printing. Print quality is good. But it has a paper jamming problem. Paper stuck almost every time if you want to take 8-10 pages printout which makes it useless printer.I'd not recommend to buy. Go for some better option.
1,Printer is goodBut i found the product delivered to me has already been registered for warranty and only 7 months are remaining
5,First of all its the cheapest available Ink tank option on the market. It does the job pretty well. The setup takes a while beyind that its a breeze. Have printed 100s of pages in past 3 months including photos and looks like it sill has ink left... very economical option and certainly a must have if someone is in the market for a printer that just does what it is supposed to do.
5,Awesome for economical printing.Best for home and small office use. Printing speed is moderate when printing @300 dpi and low speed for max dpi prints/ photos.Got 2000 prints as of now. Ink lasts for 3000 prints as per current rate.Best if you don't want additional features like scanning n wifi.Go for it!!
5,"Been using for 4 months as of now, print quality is very nice (Black & white as well as color prints), Installation was hassle free, in between did not use it for more than 20 days, after giving print lines appeared but after doing cleaning with HP software Voila! it started working perfectly.Delivery came on time, Packaging was very nice.Go for it."
1,"Delivered the printer on 6 June,afternoon, I've checked all installation manual even in youtube and followed the instructions,the cartridge was well installed but the paper feeding roller does not work and inside it does not feed in and print it.."
4,"Good printer, scanner is not there but now a days it's easy to scan any doc quickly and print it. Print quality is very good, easy to operate and best part is that running cost is very law. Black printing appx 10 to 12 paisa and colour 18 to 20 paisa and paper cost extra 40 -50 paisa.Thanks"
1,The Packaged arrived in a very poor condition.Packets inside the container were open.The ink tank was already filledThe ink bottles were empty.It couldn't even take the sample print.Continuosly showed error light right from first plug in.
1,Back side socket of plugin dock is got loose within the just 12 days.
1,"Received printer today and called HP support. Followed steps she told and found that power inlet  is moving up and down. Doesn't seem right and I let her know about it. Further setup was done under her guidance, all required software installed. Printer powers up, but doesn't work . Complaint filed. Once again precious time lost."
1,"Online classes in the entire country = bus printer demand. HP removed all discounts, printers are being sold at mrp. Very bad unethical practice."
5,I already have another brands wireless ink tank printer and was looking for a cheaper printer. Got this one as only printing was the sole purpose. Definitely a good buy if scanner functionality is not important.Only drawback is that there is wireless option.
1,I am unable to write this review at the moment because a printer is not even working this particular printer does not come under HPs fitting options that means they will not send somebody from their team to come and setup the printer you have to do it yourself the instructions for setting up the printer and not very complicated they can be done on their own but if there is any issue after setting up HP is not very helpful with it.
3,"I purchased in July 2020. But my warranty is till Feb 2021 which start from 2019 as per HP (OEM) website. Therefore, effectively you are receiving lesser warranty period."
4,Very cost effective and good b/w print quality...For color photos print one need to be spend time in selecting settings and paper quality matters alot.Overall a very good product around ₹6k. Have been using it for last 2 months...
4,Good. Once the paper got stuck. Color printing is damn slow and not that great print. Got it at 4899
5,"It's a good purchase. This printer is great if you are looking for a single function ie printing, printer. Any layman can install it since manuals and first set up tutorial videos are readily available."
5,Value for Money. Good print quality. No ink spill while filling. I personally think it is better than costly catridge based printers.
5,"Really like the product. In case interested in printing only can go for this product as the printing cost is low, quality is good."
1,It is not up to the mark. Very poor quality printing. Not at all advisable for students. Plz do not purchase it.Overall it is a waste product. Not worthy.
5,"good picture quality,easy to use"
1,Unable to use it. There was no installation CD in the packageHave tried & installed online software but the printer isnt working
1,"This product does not even have a LAN port. It is completely misleading product description. I just wasted my 12,000 bugs in this useless machine. Unfortunately Amazon didnt honour return and I ended up keeping this useless product in my office."
5,"When I was needing for a printer which suits me , then I went on searching for many blogs, articles and videos that which printer should I buy then I ordered this one .My requirements was - ( for a research student )1) Fast Printing ( Duplex- both sides)2) For longer use ( I don't use printer daily , that's why I neglected ink-based printers)3)Servicing and Brand ( Servicing means , cartridge is easily available and affordable and the printer have brand )So , I came with this one having all functions that I needed.Now , Pros -1) All above three2) Better printing quality3) Very easy to use , plug and play , can print 200 pages in one goCons -1) Not have led lights .2) I bought @13k , which I think is bit more ... It should be somewhere between @11.5kI have used HP m1136, and other HP products , but 'brother' can beat them in Quality , Fast printing , Auto duplex and Servicing .Go for it ."
5,"I have been racking my brains for the last few days since I received the printer to find a fault with the machine; disappointed that I cannot find any. This machine has more sophisticated functionality than I require for my limited home office needs; the two- sided scanning and printing, the two-sided scanning of Id cards and printing of both sides on a single page are some of features that I can think of. Kudos to Amazon to make it affordable to me via its red hot summer sale."
1,"The toner cant be refilled only replacement, its cost is Rs. 3500/- every time. Pathetic after sales support.Strictly dont buy this scrap."
1,"The description doesn't say this cannot be connected to LAN which is a basic feature for a printer. This neither has WiFi nor the LAN port. It's just useless and Amazon cannot accept the return. Its waste of money, NEVER buy this useless printer."
4,"Lot of people are complaining that it doesn’t have wifi or LAN. For their information, the connectivity type is already mentioned, that is USB only. It’s a nice product in 11k price range."
5,Writing this after 8month usage product is good but tonor filling is not easy if you do your self u need assistance for tonor filling so in this range there is no wifi but i print with otg cable print quality is good i daily print a book product is fine but i will be disappointed by that there is no backlight on lcd which is bad
3,"Product is good but its not yielding  as many prints as they mentioned, not even near by the number 2600. in my first full toner it yielded 1600 pages only.kindly provide me invoice bill once again."
5,Very good product.Auto-rotate feature.Easy Installation.Plug and print.
3,"Tldr: Printer is good, the software isn't great.Bought the printer for home use. It was very easy to install. The instruction manual was detailed and the instructions to download and install the drivers on Windows 10 were simple. Installs easily on MacOS also.Prints well, and is quite fast.The Interface to scan is not too great. It's easy if you want to scan a document into a pdf, but images are a bit complicated. It was easier on my old Canon Deskjet.Copy function doesn't work great with IDs. The photos usually end up with high contrast and black out at times. One workaround is to scan and then print.Overall, the printer is good if using primarily to print/scan documents."
5,"This is my first Brother made printer, found complete satisfaction, print quality is clean, sharp. Design is so nice. So many features available. I like duplex printing feature. software is also easy and user friendly. Scanning is just perfect. Speed of scanner and printer is fast as they mentioned. overall good deal."
1,worthless printer and seller distributed wrong information on amazon portal about wireless connection and product other features related.Please amazon check all details regarding products .i am not happy purchase this printer its just like a black marketing
5,I had this printer when I was in Canada. Hence I bought it here too. Amazing print quality as expected. Scanning and software installation is much easier. I have hp mx1130 laser jet. Compared to hp this is way better.
5,Very good product and fast delivery by Amazon and very good paking . product is too good than comparison. And lot's of options available in brother printer...thank you Amazon and thank you brother
4,"Excellent printer. Does the job. Consistent print quality and fairly easy to use. The parts feel made with fragile plastic but for the price I dont think I should complain.The only problem is the LCD display. It’s very hard to read the display and this is a real shame as this is the only “user interface” and I believe Brother should introduce a backlit display or something similar.The other disadvantage is that the software that comes with this printer (also available for download from the internet), is heavy and tends to make your computer very slow."
5,"If you require an easy to use, office like print operation and quality at affordable price, look no further, this is the printer for you. The installation was hasslefree, you can download drivers from the link provided in the manual and within 30 minutes the printer is installed. The cartridge drum has a orange locator and the manual has markings and depictions to help you place the toner cartridge in the cartridge drum. The entire process of setting up the printer was a smooth experience. Press the start button, press the print on the PC and the printer starts in a jiffy, the speed of printing is lightning fast and the two sided print happens automatically and seamlessly. Overall, the print quality and the print operation and installation is superb and plug and play. Have to test the scanner though. This is a very capable printer for a home office and can print in bulk and fast. Go for it."
5,"Setup is a breeze thanks to the included CD. If a CD/DVD drive is not available, then the drivers have to be downloaded from the Brother Support Website. The size is around 200MB.TIP: When choosing the printer model to download the drivers from their website, choose Asian Region and then select Indian Specific Models and you will find the drivers there."
5,"Overall a good printer.  I had some initial set up issues.  Could not control the contrast and the darkness of the prints.  Learning the ID printing and dual page printing techniques were a bit involved.  It took a few attempts to get them right.These features were very useful and most used.  I am quite satisfied with this printer now.  I do not know the support available for this printer in India, but let us hope that I do not need one. :-)"
5,Excellent printer for both home and office use. Crystal clear prints till now.very good printing speed.Overall highly recommended.
4,"So advantages are already mentioned so I am talking about it. What I observe is it requires a amt of space and also draws a large amt of current.. Another thing is that if using an extension box, even if the switch is off,due to large drawing of current you can get small shock if the laptop material is  metal... These are not the disadvantages but something you need to care about.The print quality is awesome and don't forget to register the product in brother site to check it's authenticity."
3,"Pros:Easy very good Black Prints and fast prints , dual side always a plus. ( Brother quality print are always good)Easy installation!Cons are no WIFI (Big-ve for today) , no EthernetStill you can make wifi prints via shared router, youtube if you want."
5,"I am fan of brother products since last 12 year first i bought only laser jet with tonner it printed 2600 copy in single tonner , in monsoon this printer dont spread ink like other printers do , never heat and auto updated driver"
5,"It's the most amazing printer at this price, I've been using laser printers since 94, the beg. Era of printers, but brother has simply outclassed HP etc, just don't, think twice , if u wanna have monochrome printing needs."
4,Price print quality it's ok but display have not visible no back light .direct print fast .but using from computer  its take first scanning then Printing take too much time.for 10 print its take 8 minutes . I am not satisfied with this  I am RETURN  I am buy little more price  around 20000 .
5,"It's a mind blowing fantastic printer for office and business use,  print quality is excellent,  and duplex printing add extra advantage to this printer,  double side printing is awesome,  everything is goodCon--- it needs good maintaince,  so use properly,  don't play game with it, I mean don't take it lightly,It's not working in inverter,  if you still use using high power inverter then may be internal parts damages"
5,"Brother printer is good,"
2,"1. ABNORMAL MACHINE RUNNING NOISE WHILE COPYING / PRINTING DOCUMENT2. CD RECEIVED WITH PRODUCT IS NOT WORKING, DRIVERS DOWNLOADED FROM NET.3. LCD - DIM SO NOT READABLE EASILY4. INVOICE RECEIVED, IS NOT LEGIBLE AND NOT COMPLETE."
5,"This is my first Brother made printer, found complete satisfaction, print quality is clean, sharp. Design is so nice. So many features available. I like duplex printing feature. software is also easy and user friendly. Scanning is just perfect. Speed of scanner and printer is fast as they mentioned. overall good deal."
5,Got this for home use. It does exactly as it says and the printer is rather fast than the printers I have used before. The duplex printing facility is also very helpful.
5,"If I have to rate this product across all catagories on a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate it 9 out of 10. Delivery was well in time as it appeared at the time of ordering it. Quality of the printer and print is great in its class. It is indeed a product with good value for money. I am completely satisfied with this laser printer so far."
2,Better write the try HP laser printer with auto duplex or cannon. I have proof don't neglect this review.  It won't print 2000 copies
2,It's display is so poor... We can't see things in its display properly. They also didn't provide return or replacement. software installation is also a difficult task as the cd along with it won't run.We have to go to the website and download it.Overall Printing quality is good.
1,"It has been mentioned on the printer itself that 2600 pages minimum it would print, however, it was able to print only 2000 pages. i am suprised on seeing the differences."
4,Since last 5 years am using Brother Printers .i am telling simply its Pretty hardworker.... But its very impossible to get  Customer care support  .. I tried and installed myself ....
5,"Very Good ,Value for Money Product."
5,Value for money. Easy to use. Good quality printing. Had my doubts before purchase. But it is all clear now.
4,"Nice and convenient printer, user friendly and economical"
5,Excellent printoutsOnly Black and white printouts
4,"The product was packed very well... The setup was very easy. The print quality was great. I bought it for School use, overall a good product"
1,Sacner is not that good at the time of photo coping.  Scan to pc is ok
5,"Robustly built printer, resulting in good quality prints and zero failures. I love this printer."
1,"Slowest printer , After giving print option you can make a hot green tea in your electric kettle and can complete your tea..But for every print cup of tea is not good to health"
5,"At this budget it is fantastic. It is efficient and easy to use. I do not know why some people are saying it is slow. Because it is not slow. You have to set ""plain paper"" in the properties before you start printing. It is very fast. I printed 80 black and white pages in around 9 minutes. The problem is by default it selects the glossy paper and takes a hell lot of time. Obviously, if you are not printing photos, why would you select glossy paper. For document printing select plain paper and see how fast it can print! Quality of print is also great. There are three options - draft, better and best. I was happy with the draft quality. I printed 450 pages on a single day. It did not give me any trouble at all."
1,"Please don't buy this printer, the paper gets jammed each time. Amazon customer care was good, they got a new replacement printer  which worked for around 2 weeks. Again the new printer is having the same problem. I've given to hp service centre, will update you soonUpdate: hp replaced it with a new printer-another model ( working)"
5,"I am so unlucky beacause when I ordered it after that day the of the printer discresed.  Ok, I am happy to share you that I received a very good printer. I want to tell you that if your buying price range is under 5,000/- then you can buy it.  It's printng cost is medium not so high or low( 1.4  & 5 ). I buy this in 4,814/-  & my purchase date is 23/11/2020. I get this printer in three days after order in Coochbehar, West Bengal.  I install it in pc in four minites. You can also do it. I am a boy of class 8. I can do it easliy."
3,Now i understood why this printer is rated 3 star on amazonVery slow printingNot good for office purposePrint quality is okayIt takes 2-3 minute to get ready once to switch it onYou may go for this printer if you print 50-100 pages a month
1,"Had a very bad experience with both the manufacturer and Amazon. After receiving the printer I wasted by complete one day to install the printer and software as no demo was provided. Finally, when started using the printer, I came across several issues like extremely slow, paper getting stucked and printer hanged and need restart. Hence, I replaced the printer. The another printer which I received was already broken so good that I didn't had to waste my time to install. But here comes the returning issue. At first the delivery person who came to take back the return refused to take it back saying the serial number is not matching. I immediately called the customer care but they couldn't communicate with the delivery person due to language issue. This all happened in between by office meeting. Then customer care re-scheduled the return and finally the same delivery person took the printer back and thankfully Amazon refunded my amount back with no more issues."
5,"Order experience - Ordered last night, arrived today morning. Unboxed - cardboard/thermacole suffered some tear but product was intact & plastic sealed with wires & both cartridges. Plugged in tested copy and print - works like a charm.After Sales Support - Did not know how to use manual duplex (print both-side), called tech support - he guided and explained me process/steps; tried it - worked as expected. 1 hour back got a call from tech support to confirm resolution before closing ticket. Really liked it.Overall feedback - I read so many negative reviews about paper jam, ink level and issues after few days. I got concerned but as everything is working seamlessly and got great support, I feel positive. This is my second HP printer; I don't think there would be a better product with such features at this price."
1,"I have received last week due to got busy in some family function didn't get time to open it. as return/placement date  mentioned 6/Jan/21, i opened last night and  found used product delivered.1) Only cartages wrapper present in box , cartages attached in to printer , cartages should be seal packed.2) as cartages are  attached to printer it means they are used.3) No information booklet present in box.4) printer inside box is opened without any wrapping. 100% sure this product is used and then return by someone, same has delivered to me.Although its mention on order ""HP DeskJet 2335 All-in-One Ink Advantage Colour PrinterReplacement may be possible through 06-Jan-2021""Amazon saying relacment is not possible as date has been passed although replacement request raised on 6th .Better not opt for amazon for costly product and specially this seller ""Appario Retail Private Ltd"" who has delivered this item._----------------------------------------_--+-++++-Update, got immediate replacement with new printer but new printer is not working copy and print function not working.Even after talking with hp support they are not able to solve the problem, somehow amazon ask to return the product."
1,Worse printer m facing problem now. The ink is full but it shows no print n no ink . the demo page can be print but . the light keeps blinking saying no ink.  HP is a cheater. Its waste of time as bought for college print works. This Printer is a scam. Check youtube as well it says this printer is always creating problem no use.  It was late to change as mine amazon package cover was thrown so. It won't be accepted to return. They said only can be replaced . so total waste of money and time
5,Good quality print. Good packing condition. Value for money.
1,"I purchased this product and was unable to install driver on my Windows 10 laptops. [Note: Both Windows 10] The call to HP was long wait and finally I got through. The person tried to install device driver but wasn't successful. He was installing HP 2300 series driver. After that I did some research and tried to install F2200/F2224 driver on my old Windows 10 laptop and it worked on one of the laptop. The message on newer windows 10 laptop was that you are using older version of device driver. A service engineer came but  couldn't do much. Surprisingly he told me that your laptop has a problem. I explained that it's a DELL laptop and not an assembled one and uses legitimate windows 10. I tried to tell him that windows 10 might have a newer patch and there might be a patch for driver as well. But he was not very keen probably trained by HP.  I am keeping printer and will update if at all HP sees this and comes back to me with resolution as I have told him that I can even wait for 15 days. He also said I am free to give whatever ratings I want. ??My service ID: BRFZ7243A descent product but extremely poor HP service. It's not a technician's fault but the attitude of parent company HP. They want to make money but don't care about educating their technicians. This is how they train people. There is no attitude to help customers, no desire to learn @ issues and no desire to solve issues, no log checking, poor debugging. They are taught to close the cases by parent company. HP wake up...  Don't be complacent ..."
2,Stopped working in couple of week. This is my third and HP s second printer. First I bought from store lasted like 7-8 years without any issue as I remember. And this time bought online. Printer got internally damaged and one gear stud got broken. I don't know how this could happen in such short time (couple of times only) use.
4,"I have been using this printer for taking print outs of my Kids home work and documents.The print quality is not good as we get in the shops or office, but this will be enough the above said uses. Prints are little lighter on black and greyscale. I tried changing the settings , but it did not help.The test print with colour looked good, but I have not taken any more colour printouts.Printing in greyscale can finish up the colour inks very quick, so use it only if required."
3,"It just meets expectations of printing and scanning. However, there are quite a few issues which are not that satisfactory.1. The paper gets stuck very often when it starts rolling into the printer. The paper tilts to a side and gets stuck. The print is just OK.2. The scanning takes very long. And after using it for nearly a month, I am still to figure out how to create a single file from multiple scans. And settings are too clumsy. Not user friendly settings.3. Product looks too brittle. Not sturdy/robust."
4,"Being HP product is good. However for scanning you are compelled to go online i.e. through HP App which is not desired and very cumbersome. During which a lot of HP updates squeeze-in in your system. This printer has an HP offer of free headset. Here is the problem. The invoice sent with the delivery is thermal print out and is difficult to read contents in that more particularly the serial number of printer which is must for redeeming offer. The invoice if downloaded come in two parts /pages, i.e Part-1 invoice without serial number of printer and Part-2 Packing slip with serial number of printer and HP redemption cell do not consider packing slip and also invoice without serial number of printer. Hence offer not allowed. Sorry."
1,"Cartridge printed only 40 pages, and it empty now.You mentioned wrong printing quantity.Cartridge cost is rupees1553 for 1 set which gives approx 40 pages print.  Print is very costly.Never buy HP printer.Printer is cost effective but ink cartridge is very costly.Never go for it."
1,"I bought this HP 2335 printer and regretted it. I wasted 2 days of my time fixing this printer. Nothing happened. Then I called Amazon for returning this product. The representative said she would replace this product with another one. The replacement arrived the next day. But the replacement is also a junk product and it does not work. So, I am again trying to reach Amazon and I am getting the message that the customer service call back service is not available.I am a busy executive and I don’t have time to waste like this. I regret buying this product!Don’t waste your money buying this product  and also don’t waste your precious time fixing this junk!I don’t understand why Amazons customer service call back Service is unavailable. So how can we return the defective product?"
1,"There are too many driver compatibility issue and lack of integration for apple devices. Customers should not be going through this kind of unnecessary hassle.Instead of making multiple printers with almost similar features and price range, HP should concentrate more on ease of usage and superior experience for end user with better product quality and support."
4,Please send me Installation disc as I am senior citizen so as to enable me to run.Product is Good.Awaiting favorable Installation disc to solve Scan Issues.
1,The HP DESKJET INK ADVANTAGE ALL IN ONE PRINTER delivered on 31 December 2020 (13 Days back) was a defective piece as paper was getting jammed. As per the policy return of such items within seven days only is permitted.
2,The printing speed is very slow and not WiFi version only usb connectivity.Their promise is fake they said the black cartridge print 480 pages but this print only 100-120 pages and cartridge is empty.Like that colour cartridge print only 30 pages . My money is worst / waste . So I want you that don't buy this product this is fake claim of cartridge and printing quality is very slow
1,This printer is one of the most inconvenient printers I have ever used. The manual doesn't give any information. And the print and scan function doesn't work. Only photocopy works.
4,Fast to print. Clear prints. Ver good after sales service also. I had to get a replacement as the first one I received had a problem with paper loading. It got replaced very fast and the Amazon technician was excellent
1,It is totaly bad product there was no ink in this cartridge cartridge was empty and the costumer care is not helping us I totally waste my money kindly costumer care please help me to change this product
5,"Works perfect for my usage, we need max 30-40 prints a month.This works perfectly well and print quality is good. It's a machine now give it time to do its job for printing for few seconds. Not an issue for me atleast."
3,This printer very reliable to use and printer quality is good(I am talking about black print only) but I got defected tricolor cartidge and I have given the cartridge for replacement to HP authorised service centre. I will update my review colour print quality after I get the new color cartidge from service centre.
4,"Easy to install,  photocopy and printing is easy but scanning is little cumbersome. But works well."
5,This is 1st reviewI want to tell you all guys that this also work on LINUX without any extra app.Very easy to use
2,Print quality is very poor. The cartridge gives very less number of prints. Nowhere near to the mentioned 100-300 pages. Scanner is good. Giving 2 stars just because of that. No value for the money paid...
1,"Tried to contact customer service, so many times!!. Amazon customer service will ask you to contact the HP service team to get a job sheet for return. Now the brand new printer is sitting in the storage room. Gave up the idea of returning it."
1,"Invariably paper gets stuck, twisted. Have to hold n guide it. Takes hours to print.  The worst printer i ever used in 3 decades!"
1,I've ordered it and firstly I wasn't working then I replaced it hopefully that good product will reach me out but unfortunately again the same problem... Printer isn't working and roller are jam and and somewhere there is hardware issue...and wasting my time with this product... think twice before you go for this product.😔
5,It's very easy to use. This product is cheap and best.
5,"Very helpful & awesome printer at a reasonable price. Printing speed as normal, very good packaging & safely delivered by Amazon. Thank You Amazon & HP"
1,Printer was for Home use. But Printer DEFECTIVE.... NO INVOICE SENT EITHER.LABEL SHOWING WRONG SERIAL NUMBER AS CONFIRMD BY MR SAMUEL OF HP AS WELL AS MS MUSHKANHP NOT WILLING TO RENDER SERVICS DUE TO WRONG SERIALNUMBER>DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS SERVICE OF AMAZON
1,Worst printer one can buy. Please don't buy. The paper gets stuck all the time. The color is getting dispersed on rubbing. Unfortunately my return window is over by the time i realized.Now the printer is showing error carriage stalled and not able to use it.
5,It's not slow. Change the settings of the printing then it will be faster.Initially I felt same with my experience.Later on after changing settings it is working faster like any other printer
3,The power supply cable is not fitting the printer its very loose ofter its comming out
1,Terrific Experience.....I received a used product yesterday....both ink cartridge is not in sealed pack .Ink cartridge already fitted in the printer and it was used product.I call customer care but they said they can't replace my product now
1,Currently the only option i have is to use it with phone.
1,The printing is very poor with a missing horizontal central gap.Surprised at how Everycom packs with out checking and verifying the performance.
1,"1.no support from seller, he is least bothered about consumers difficulties2 . doesn't work with Bluetooth, Android mobile3.lots of difficulties in working with kiosk portal settings is very difficult and disappointing too4.not a worthwhile product there are better products than this one"
4,The cd provided contains software for pc. The only thing I didn't like is I had no cd slot and I asked the seller to give me the software through mail but there was no reply. They have a site but they don't have the app there.Anyway I found a way to run the cd and the printer is ok. The print quality has no issues and it is veryeasy to setup. The cost of printing is virtually non existent as paper offline costs about 20 to 30 RS in retail. No ink is required. I just wonder how long the printer can work.
5,Must buy product....for missing lines complaint install latest drivers...call customer care for latest driver's
2,"Hi, I have purchased this non bluetooth thermal printer recently.I am using vyapar pos  app in my android mobile but it can't print due to no Bluetooth connection. OTG cable also not supporting in that pos vyapar app. Everytime when I go for receipt printing, bluetooth ask to turn on and searching for Bluetooth device.  What to do:-) .If I can resolve this problem I will give 5 star surely."
5,I was confused before purchasing but I gave it a shot and Item received in good condition with Free Software for Accounting.Initially there was problem in line brokage but customer care helped me by installing new driver now print is good no line break and software is awesome.Highly recommended..!
5,Excellent product. I am using this post printer in my CSC (common service centre) for printing the receipt of Electricity bill.
5,Print quality is very low for csc usersThe alphabet s not to be identied in minimum width
5,I have been using this printer for almost 3 months now.First I would mention that I haven't got any single problem  till date.At this price point it's a big luxury.Got the delivery early too.Frankly nothing to complain.
5,"I needed to print from Microsoft Word. had lot of doubts and some people helped me with responses, but was not getting a clear response. Bought it, tried it, and works perfectly. Moment you select the printer in MS word, the page becomes 2 inches in breadth and you can adjust margins and directly print. Pure plug and play, no issues, though download the latest drivers from their site and install it. Very good printer. I did not get the test paper roll. Anyway i was buying new ones"
3,Great printer at a good priceBut states that it is Bluetooth printing also but Bluetooth does not work at all nor with that app nor with Normal phone Bluetooth
1,"I ordered this product to use with Loyverse on Chromebook (Which works in the same way as an Android Phone). There are several problems:1. It doesn't connect with the phone or with the Chromebook. It only works with a windows computer2. It doesn't work with bluetooth or OTG cable on Android devices, even though the seller commented on several reviews saying that it works after we contact support and follow their instructions3. Support is bad. I called their number. They sent me a download link and they have no clue what I should do next! I tried everything and nothing works.Don't waste your time on this product."
5,It is so good for kiosk banking txn slip.
1,Worst customer support. They don't know how to connect with Android smart phones. There is no Bluetooth connectivity. This product is fooling us and wasting our money. So please don't buy this waste product.
5,I had to do a lot of research to buy a thermal printer which is efficient in both cost and usability. This is my first Thermal printer and I am fully satisfied.I will give another review after 6 months.
1,Printer output is not good from day 1. Blank lines coming in between printing. I verified after the return duration.  Tried for the service and always getting irritated auto emails from support. Zero support. I bought this scrab and wasted rs. 2000. Blutooth also not working
5,I received this product on time as expected and printer is working fine. I am happy with this purchase. I am thinking to purchase another one. Thank you.
5,"This is a very easy to use and install. You just need to install the drivers from the CD provided and start using it instantly.On print quality I would give 4 on 5 as there were a few gaps, that too only when you try to print a large or bold character.  Rest every thing is perfect.Look no further in this price range. IT IS THE BEST..! :)"
5,Bought it for my cafe. Prints perfect and accurate. You just need to have proper software to use the printer more efficiently.Easy to install.For people having no cd reader in their pc you just to Google the product name with model nd you'll be able to download from their website. It's very easy n simple.
5,"It is very easy to install this printer and the cost of this printer is very low  Any shopkeeper who does billing work or who works as kiosk They have to give receipt to their customers, in such a situation these printer are very usefull because with this printer we can work at less cost. That is why I want to tell those who do thermal printer that the best printer of everycom. Especially for those running a kiosk these printer are the best because has to give a receipt and the charge and paper of a large printer is also expensive"
5,Easy to connect with any device and also easy to use. Print quality is the brightest point with this printer.I'm writing this review on 5his printer after using it for one month. It is a perfect product.
4,Print is very good. Very easy installation. Working nicely.
5,Awesome product for small restaurants and POS.
5,Prints Receipt in High Quality. Good and Fast printer. Though initial setup is bit tricky.
5,"Quick Printer driver installation and setup, also drivers available on website.Power cable and USB cable quality is assu"
1,.  The toll free no is not picked by anyone. 8895430161. Do call me. This is the 2nd time I am bringing this printer. But no support.
1,"Worst printer!Do not buy this crap, lots of misprinting issues. go for a good company printer.Almost all the reviews are not genuine. They call the customer after delivery of product and represents themselves from Amazon and ask to rate the product 5*.They share the link on whatsapp to give ratings.So do not go on ratings."
5,"I lve the product. I am very satisfied with product, paisa vasool product"
1,Software comes with  this is a crap after 15 day data will delete automatically .Every time I add data n after someday it delate automatically .I try to talk with customers care but no one reply .Waste of money n time don't buy it
5,Product was good. And the since it includes invoicing software I didn't had to spend more money for software.
4,"Installed the driver given on the cd and encountered some issues (like gap in the middle of printed lines) . Decided to contact seller and they installed latest driver and the issue was solved. Print quality wise, it is good enough."
1,"The printing quality is too bad and doesnt work at all, better to go for other options"
4,you can connect this printer with your computer as well as with your android mobile too.lightning print speed with android phonewonderful printer.i am so happy..
5,Very good thermal receipt printer and print quelity. I bought one other printer berofe it and I got this much better.

5,This is is full in kiosk banking it's reduce printing costs and save paper
5,very good prodect .custmor support is also very good
5,Nice product and as expected.working nicely.cost effective.nice customer support.
5,"Namaste!Glad to help others by way of sharing experience with this printer. Got it at a discounted price of ₹12059 (sbi credit card discount). Its installation was very easy and required no much ado. Its operation too, is very easy and convenient. I'm currently using it for printing study materials from mobile only. The performance is really admirable. Initially gave command to print some PDFs of 2 or 3,4 pages and it printed very fast. Afterwards I willingly downloaded brother plugins and mopria print service which also helped me print smoothly but one day when commanded to print PDFs of pages more than 25, it took very considerable time to respond. I was troubled a little bit but soon, I uninstalled all plugins and operated with the help of android printing service itself. It gave wonderful response. Since then, I'm very happily printing my docs.Now come to its printing quality. It yields high quality printing both in color and mono.Time: In my case, black and white print rate is more than 20 ppm (average) while a color photo took me 12 minutes to print.The best thing for me is that this printer does not annoy you by taking too much time in warming up each time you start this. It instantly becomes ready to print ASAP you turn it on. It automatically cleans the heads. Print, scan and copy quality is the best. Moreover, it is manufactured in the Philippines with no equipments from PRC.I don't have experience of printing through laptop or PC, but I say that this is the best printer for printing purpose. If it is functioning very fast even wirelessly, then what about USB connection? Surely, it will not disappoint you.So kindly go for it.Dhanyawad!"
3,"Big drawback is paper feeding tray,If you want take print two sides , we have to open tray every time , that means for 30 papers we have open the paper feeding tray fifteen timesIf we take multiple prints at a time the papers are getting sticking together ( for that reason we have to open the tray every time if you want o print the two sides of paperI have purchased this for to save the time, but it went in vain because of the paper tray, because of opening the paper tray every"
5,"This is a awesome product by Brother. Newly released with best in class features along with WIFI  capabilities. All in one printer with good print, scan and copy quality. Delivery was on time. Very easy self installation and setup process. Connected seamlessly with Mac and iPhone. I’m very happy with this purchase."
5,"Packing : 2/5 very poor packing the cardboard box had holes and looked dirtyPrinter look and feel: 4/5 like the look but wished they had backlight led lights on the buttons. The plastic is Okish and prone to break/crash if not handled properPrinter setup : 4/5 breeze acessing from PCPrinter Mobile setup: 2/5 pain in the *****Print quality: 3.75/5 can't expect more than this. Refer a color print taken in best settings (used 75gsm) . B&W is more greyish (refer image) when printed normally but,  the best setting makes it look better (refer 3rd pic)Honestly , you can't expect more from this price range. Will update after a month's use. Once I had everything setup it's working without any issues.FYI: I use ubuntu in PC and didn't face any issues setting it up. Most of the printers have issues with Linux"
5,"This is I guess the best printer ever. I’ve had hp canon before , but brother is a different league. If your budget allows go for it you’ll not regret."
4,"Print quality is really good. Nice supporting software. I can scan from mobile as well. Only missing is printing on both side of paper. This feature available on printer with cost less than 7k, so I thought its default feature and not checked at product description. Anyway there is tedious manual both side printing option."
4,Great product. Print quality is excellent. Easy to setup and very convenient to print over WiFi. Overall ver satisfied with the purchase.Few things which I expected at this price : - ability to print dual side automatically - baclit LCD display. Its an ordinary lcd and very difficult to read in low light.
5,"You will like everything about this printer.Speed,design, No frequent ink cartridge refill, Inexpensive ink.This looks like hero honda of printers.Fill it>Shut it>>Forget it.At least we have someone to challange HP on the costly ink cartridge they have sold till now."
5,"I was using hp ink advantage printer till date but as time passed it started to become a disadvantage😂 for use due to increase in price of catridges every few months and less nos of prints. I was looking for economic printer and then came accross this one. I had used brother printers at work, so knew its a trust worthy japanese brand.It prints almost every single type & sizes of paper and printing speed is just wow.I like bottom load tray and that is why did not go with canon brand (Canon has topload). I am sure this is going to be a popular model of brother because of its so many features.Only con is it does not have duplex printing but you can’t complain in this price range.Wifi print and air print is pretty fast and flawless. Photocopy is very fast. Scanner is also very easy to use.Very Happy with purchase and thanks to amazon for speedy 1 day delivery.Highly Recommend. Value for money.Happy Printing."
5,Good printer with average print speed and decent print qualityThe USP of this over a canon /Hp is you can store 100-150 sheets of paper in a tray in the printer so you don’t have to load pages in a tray at the back every time you have to print. it’s overall space required to operate is also less. The WiFi connectivity is superb. And the setup was very easy.
5,The printer is excellent when it comes to regular text printing. Borderless Color printing and photo printing is good.printing  is fast and the wireless option makes it even more convenient.The printer can be simultaneously connected to PC and WiFi.Printer is available as “airprinter” in iPhone and network printer in android phones and works without any additional app installation when connected to home WiFi.For scanning app is a must on mobile phone. windows 10 and Linux recognises the printer without any issues.Only inconvenience is with no duplex printing. Manually the printed pages have to reversed and fed along with doing an odd/even page printing.Otherwise great option for home & small office use.
5,This is a very good printer and really good for home use..I was really worried that it might be not good but it changed my mind it's really good.. If you are thinking to buy this printer go for itPhoto quality is good
4,brother printer is good. easy to use. But Price was high compare MRP . sellers remove original MRP 14999. I buy this printer Rs.16000. it was against to conusumer Act.
2,Manual feed is not working properly.
5,"I liked the printer set up, printer speed and print quality even in color and black and white. I used Wi-Fi printing option. It takes lot of time to spool the print. The color printing option takes a lot of time over WiFi probably again due to spooling of data using Wi-Fi. Overall the performance is satisfactory. I have got good quantity of ink left even after regular use. So I guess the default ink would serve 6 months of 'normal' use or more than that. I still got a spare black ink bottle received during purchase. So probably plenty of time left till black and white print color needs replacement."
5,It is a very nice printer. I bought this printer for printing photos mostly. The printing resolution is very nice as the images are very sharp.Also it is very easy to use as it has wifi. You dont need to connect any extra wires apart from power cable. Juat connect the printer to home wifi and give the print command from any device having the brother app. Also you can adjust and edit the pics to some extent on the apps.Loved it.
2,"Quite impressive features, But seems like quality control is in bad shape, received 2 printer in 4 days, both the printer is having the same problem. After 2-3 mins, It displays ""Cannot Print E3"" and there is no resolution to this problem,Thanks to Amazon, Printer is already returned to amazon."
1,"Actually the product is good, but the piece which was delivered to me was detected. And had some hardware issues in the scanner. Bought it from the seller Appario from West Bengal. Unfortunately that was the last piece, so I wasn't able to get an replacement, instead of that received cashback.I bought so many things from this same seller(banglore).I request to take required action on the distributor ( West Bengal), who wasted my time almost a week on a defected piece.But if you have receive perfectly working piece then you are lucky 😉."
1,"In addition to my dics level CD device drivers INSTALLS.Requires,Extra charges for subscription modules and  link of online installation suppot drivers downloads to process printouts.Return and replacement must be extra time upto 30 days.The device as to be runed,tuned and tested.Scanner and printing works well.But features as detailed are few.It doesn't work for bulk,book printing.Ideal for multimedia visiting/Invitations sizes cards.One page at time.Makes awesome.Kindly arrange for replacement for other make printer.As 11th march 2021 is too early to test the device,Also inconveinance of brother supports and customer care.And,11th march 2021 being a general festival holiday.I have regerts in buying this device.Its my sincere request and beg your pardon to replace the BROTHER DCPT540W printer."
3,"The printer was configured and connected to my mac using wifi very easily.It's very slow, to print 1 normal page takes more than 30 seconds, color it takes at least 1 min.To scan also takes at least 1 min sometimes getting hanged while scanningSo, I will say it's easy to use but sometimes very irritating."
4,Nice
4,Build quality us good.Processing speed is too good.Printing speed is normal..The quality of the printer will be fine as long as you use the original ink( applicable on all printers)Overall nice.
5,"One of the best product in this range. I too compared many products. But found this good.Firstly it asked to update the printer, the process to update via app is very simple.And instructions ate simple.Print quality is very good.If you want to take color printout photo, then I would suggedt you to buy kotak photo paper.Rest everythis is good.I too canpare with other brands especially Hp nd erricson.But this is really far far better."
4,"Brother printers is much better than cannon, easy to install. Print quality is super. You get a manual feed slot, integrated paper tray. Easy refill system, and the ink is cheap too. The wireless printing is a lil finicky something otherwise a good product."
5,I am writing this after 3 months of using this printer. Ideal for home and small office use. Best in this price range. Wi-Fi printing works fine with laptop and mobile. Mobile scanning is one feature which I found very useful for me (directly scan to mobile and send email or Whatsapp).
5,"Considering the current scenario when we are reluctant in going outside for print outs, this printer serves its job to your utmost satisfaction. Starting from setting up the device to using it, this printer won’t let you struggle. Please do follow the user manual and you are all set to have printouts. Japan anyways can’t be beaten in its quality technology."
4,"In general ,happy with the printer for the price and the ink cost ,if Brother could have added ADF (automatic document feeder for  two sided printing ) DCP-T520W should have been the best printer for economical printing  .I think buyers dont mind pay little more  for ADF  feature .Brother do have ADF with other model ,but its only monochrome (no colour) .So brother is one step behind to be the best printer of this range .Hence I rate **** ."
1,"New Brand, while setting displays cannot print E3. Google search says it is a mechanical malfunction"
3,"Printer is fine to use. But the black print is not black, it has somewhat greyish shade to it, even on ""Best Quality print"". Connectivity and other things weren't a problem, only print quality is of subpar quality."
5,Awesome quality and printer at this price of great brand
5,Sturdy and meant for rough use. Print quality is good and very to setup .... Paper storage makes it super convenient. Tried borderless printing and that works well too....
4,Print quality is really nice and it is very easy to use. Print speed is very fast for black and white whereas it is slow for color print. Have to enter password everytime u connect to different phones. Overall it is amazing.
1,Didn't work at all.  Kept showing an error during the setup itself. Had to return it
5,Easy to use. Value for money.
5,Perfect print quality. Easy to install & Value for money.
5,Worth to buy... wonderful photo quality... good printing... friendly for my iPhone...
5,Nice product 👍
5,The best
5,"Easy to use ,good for home and office use."
4,"OVER all good product, easy installation, in printing quality is OK ."
5,It is perfectly good printer for home use.Printing is fairly fast. For home users it will be more than enough.I have attached a pic which compares printing in b/w and colour with original. Middle one is the original.
4,"Received in one piece, good for home purpose use. Using just first day, took some printouts both color and black, it's quiet decent. Don't know how many printouts i can get in one cartridge. Thanks amazon. Got on freedom sale only for ₹3400.Add on: Using the printer over a month and the cartridges gave me more than 350 pages of printout. I am happy with the printer."
3,"printer is good. there are some issues i faced that it can connect only with laptop via usb,no lan port. colour printing takes huge amount of ink and cost/page becomes more. try to purchase wireless printer. cartridge of this printer cost more than 650."
5,"HP Deskjet 2138 is a good printer for home use. I received the printer in good condition. Installed in few steps with the CD which was given along with printer. Received a colour and a black cartridge along with the printer and its easy to fix the cartridges.Print quality is not super good but good enough for home use.Print speed is actually better than i expect. ( i have used canon printer before and Hp is better than that).Scan quality and speed is average.  When you increase the quality(dpi), the scanning is even slower. ( canon was faster).  Still not bad.printer is compact light weight and its easy to use.For those  who wanna decide between inktank printer and cartridge printer like this one.... If you are looking for a printer for home use such as, ticket printing, school projects printing, occational document printing ..go for cartridge printer. If you are looking for printer for printing few hundreds of pages every month , all year, then go for ink tank printers.  Note that, most common problem in a inkjet printer is print head stuck with dried ink. this happens when printer is not used for a while. When you change the cartridge, you are actually changing the print head.  But with ink tank printer, print head is fixed and it requires service when its not used for a long time.Warranty issue.... when I checked for the warranty in HP website, it says only three months remaining. I called up the customer care and after sharing the invoice copy they assured me that warranty info will be reset.Edit/update :. After 10 days the warranty was updated correctly. So changing my 4 star rating to 5 star."
1,"I ordered the printer on 6-July-2020 and it arrived on 8th. Due to COVID-19, I kept it in a corner for a day. On 9th, I opened the package. The quality of packaging was good and no damage was observed.It took a minute for me to figure out how the vertical paper feed works. I then plugged in the system to my windows 10 laptop. The laptop was not able to detect and hence did not  automatically download the drivers.I then visited the concerned drivers website that came with the product flyer. This site redirected me to Microsoft store. Since I do not possess Windows store account, I was not able to install any driver software.I then googled for the drivers using the model name. It took me to a site where I could download the individual software components manually.I downloaded the installer. HP software is notoriously bloated and the software installation experience is poor. Please look at the images. First, it downloads software components which I do not need, then asks unnecessary questions, shows unwanted popups and post installation exit from the installer is not smooth.After a lengthy installation process, the first print failed. I had to then download Print and Scan Doctor from HP website. After a lot of time, it showed two errors. After fixing these and was able to print.However, the printout was black-n-white. I could not fix it.Visited the website. HP uses chat bot, so it was not able to help me. I was given 1800 toll free number. However Airtel blocks 1800 numbers, so I was not able to reach customer support. I then tried WhatsApp chat. A bot told me to wait on WhatsApp and that was it. I waited for an hour. None of the toll free numbers worked. Tried couple of times, but no response.I finally tried the 1800 number from my maid's phone (idea network) and it connected! Had to wait for 15 mins. When I finally reached the right person, she helped me in debugging the printer. I uninstalled and reinstalled the software. Post this, my laptop was unable to detect the printer. When I clicked on color management in printer settings, it opened Windows 10 display color management.Finally the lady booked a HP technical support for home visit. Now I have to wait for a few days.I have not tested Scanning or Xerox, yet. The paper on the vertical tray goes faster on one side than the other. Could be a hardware issue, but have to wait for the HP support person to comment.Please do not buy HP printers! They just do not work as expected."
1,Listed item description is completely false.....No any option for Wifi connectivity.
3,"Printer looks good , easy to use , all functionality available , xerox ,scan , print.But it is not value for money as cartridge cost is more and print per page cost is more.It print 260 black pages and 20-25 colour for me  . ON complaining to HP customer care they said as per standard it say it print 480 black and 150 color page  but quality/quantity  should be 5% of A4 size with draft quality. SO it means it should print 5% of 480 pages.so ideally we can say not value for money by spending 1100 rupees ( 2 cartridge cost) for 280 page total . So cost for page is  -  Rs 4/- approx  avergae in totaland cost for black page print - Rs  2.88 /-and cost for color page print - Rs 28/-"
3,"I am using this printer from 1 month & i found, it work good while scanning, Copy & printing. But the cartridge performance is very bad, Black cartridge even did not print 100 Pages. I am very much disappoint with the purchase because the time when I was willing to print my important documents, the cartridge gets over & you can not expect, it will over within a month when you are using only for home purpose."
5,"I was worried since there were so many complaints for this printer. But this was easy to install and worked easily and quickly. The ink cartridges that came with the printer has already printed about 10 4x6 colour prints on HP photo paper, and about 25 sheets.I did a lot of research on what kind of printer to buy, based on what I expect my usage to be. I expect my usage to be minimal... maybe 5-6 pages every week on an average. But I may not print anything for many weeks also. It's mostly to be used for my kid's school assignment work etc. And I can take some prints from my workplace too. So this is more for emergencies, and when colour printing is required.Every type of printer has a hidden cost associated with it. It seems the ink in the Ink tank printers do not dry easily. So that is good. but the Ink tank printers can have their printer heads clogged, due to no usage. That can be a substantial cost.The MFP printers is not value for money if you have very little usage, and it's no help if suddenly you need to take a colour print for a school project the next day!After evaluatign all types of printers, I decided that the inkjet ones were the most appropriate for me:- Was okay will low usage.- Had a colour option too.- The printer nozzle heads are in-built with the ink cartridge. So if one goes bad, I can quickly/easily fix it, instead of having to take it to a service centre.Of the inkjet printers, I analyzed the whole range and decided that I should buy the cheapest one. The savings can be used to buy the expensive ink cartridges. While there were printers (only) available for sub-2000 rupees, i bought this, since this was the cheapest with the Ink Advantage technology, which I hope uses ink more efficiently.I initially had wanted to spend on the wireless versions, but I realized that I don't have a desktop anymore. I just have laptops, so it's not too much effort to take my laptop where the printer is! I just need to plug in the USB cable, and switch on the printer. And voila, I'm ready to print."
4,"Good Quality, but only problem is that unable to print pdf files from Adobe Acrobat Reader.  Contacted HP support forum, did reinstall Adobe Reader and all other alternatives as suggested.  Nothing worked.  Only alternative to print pdf is to open the file in Browser and print it from there.  Googled about this issue and it seems this issue is there for many users and both HP and Adobe are not providing any right solution for this issue."
1,Printing cost very high. Even with original black cartridge hardly print 70 copies  rather than 400 copies. Colorado only 8 copies. Very disappointed. Never go for this .
5,The ink is good for at least 200 copies in black and white. I don't use colour prints much but it lasted for a year and the black and white for 6 months. The scan function is really useful and I scanned all my old photos many of them more than 30 years old. The copy function is useful too.i refilled the black and white one locally but it lasted for about 50 copies only. Maybe only the original cartridges are good for more copies. Definitely worth owning for the scan function and occasional printing.Also it can print only with the black and white cartridge. The HP 680 black and white cartridge costs about 600 only
1,The paper tray cannot take adequate number of pages
4,As the printer is good but my self used it and as my experience those who buy this product should know thant catridge come with box can only print 70 to 80 B&W Prints an 50 colour print and new catridge is about  700 rs so this printer is not for mass printing you can buy ink tank or laser printer1 print goes about 1.4+.5 =1.9 rs soThink thrice before buying
1,"I am very sad to see such a big brand 'HP' and 'Amazon' have delivered broken printer at the time when I was planning to provide it as gift to one of my cousins. I requested multiple times that provide new one as early as possible as I had 2 days in backup.. These guys even did't deliver it again and funny part was that, it was available in one day delivery. Till now waiting for that and could n't give it to her that gift at her birthday. I seriously very sad and want any action by these big brand who make such a mistakes."
3,If you can afford 5-6 rs per page than buy this printer. Otherwise there are no added benefits. It consumes ink too much and moreover the reward was not given by HP stating that they need printer serial number on invoice. How can I arrange something on invoice that is generated by seller. These people just protect seller and steal reward from customers.
4,"The printer is great. The print quality is excellent. The scanning function also works like a dream. And the ink is widely available. But the main problem lies with the ink. The ink just costs way too much, nothing like the number of pages mentioned in the promotional materials. Also, if you plan on printing just black and white text, make sure to find and turn on monochrome option. If you just use greyscale, it will use the colour ink along with the black ink for unnecessary reasons."
5,"Bought a printer for first time. Superb choice. There are options for printing quality in the laptop when conneted to it for best quality or normal quality. Just one con that it is a wired one, you have to connect the usb cable to the laptop or computer if you want to print what you want, there was no app in the playstore which could help with a printer with a usb connector the hp smart app on the playstore only prints in the bluetooth Or wifi printing. Except that everything fine nice delivery with no damage but there was no outer cover provided by amazon should have provided cause of safety from 😷 u know... Although amazing product with good printing..."
5,"I really did not expect this printer to be much, but it's actually very nice. The setup is super easy, the print quality (even in draft mode), is very good - for both color and B&W prints. The ink consumption also seems to be not very heavy, because it's been more than 45 days since I have been using it, and the original setup ink is still working fine."
3,Disappointed with HP again. The colur catriage that came with the printer stopped working within couple of days and I didn't even print 6 pages.Atleast black catriage is working!Apart from that it's all fine.It is value for money and the catriage is reasonably priced.Try and avoid HP printers this is the second time it has happend to me.
4,"Setup: The Printer is easy to setup, even on Linux. Though linux is supported through hplib, and not through HP official drivers, it was easy to setup, share via file sharing as well as google cloud connector.Remote Usage: Would have been great if HP would have provided support for using it over the network using HP's own mobile apps instead of forcing users to use google cloud for printing from mobile.Printing cost: It is cheaper to get printouts/ copies at nearby cybercafe/ copier shops than on this printer. So buy this all-in-one only if you have low volumes but still need the convenience.Overall, a good buy for the price."
2,"Overall a very flimsy product which will work well only for a year to a year and half. Had purchased this product in May 2018. I always kept it covered with dust proof cover when not in use. And I am also gentle in operating it. But inspite of that, by around Jun of 2019 the print quality started to deteriorate. I changed the ink cartridge and a few more pages printed well after that it has become very bad with portions of the paper totally blank. The product lacks overall build quality"
1,The product was either damaged during shipment or a defective product.The product arrived as promisedThe outside box was fine but the styrofoam that is placed on either side of the printer was broken. Didn't think much of it when i setup the printer.Installed the software from the CD and installed the print catridges.The first copy i tried to make came out blank paperThe second copy was smudged.I tried to print and that was smudged as wellIt is of no use if it cannot do the basic function i bought it for. Return started. Waste of time waiting for it and setting it up.
1,It seems defective products are sold through Amazon and becomes useless. The printer gave me trouble within 2 months of purchase and the service department of hp was not ready to send a technician. But after much hassle and arguing they sent one technician who made a fool of me and it worked well only when he was there. I took it to the local repair shop and they told me that the problem is with logicard and it’s not available. Even after buying a new printer I was unable to use it after 3 months. Please don’t cheat people with great discounts and sell defective products.
1,I bought this printer last year in June and it stopped working last month giving blank printouts although the ink and all is there. It was supposed to be in warranty till June 21 but the warranty in system is already expired in Apr 21. Looks like Amazon has given old product which doesn't have full year warranty left. Very disappointed.
3,So it was right that It prints only 20-30 pages color print and 50-80 pages black printso it costs you more than outside xerox shopsbcs one cartridge is worth 650/- and both cost you 1200/- means 26/- for a color print (25 pages avg) and 8/ for a black printso please buy on your on risk1 more thing when you copy it cuts your boarder writings so please leave 1 inch on each side or place it on uppper cornersPlese go for Inktank(more costly but worth) if you can otherwise it's okk
1,Printer attached colour cartridge within 15 prints over black cartridge also same. In open market new colour and black cartridge's also very cost.so don't by this product and amazon not accept return also.very bad experience.so don't buy.
4,"Size of the printer is relatively small and comparatively lighter than other ink advantage printers.The print quality is good.It can take scan,copy(xerox) also.It has only wired connectivity. It doesn't support wireless connectivity.The cartridge model number is 680."
5,"Nice printer if you want only black and white print for office use. Colour print is good but not great, scan quality is satisfactory, and main thing is the cartridges are run out very quickly, but if you refill your cartridges then it's not an issue. In this price range for normal office use this is best printer, and build quality is not good like average and looks is really very nice."
5,There was no outer packaging but the printer received safely without any damagePrinter is good. I have used it for the past three days working greatHP is always goodOverall product is goodThanks AmazonI would definitely suggest this for anyone who is buying it for scanning purposeif printing is the main activity then can go for some ink tank printers
3,"The printer is simple, easy to install, drinks less ink and is overall economical with good quality output.However, this good quality is maintained as long as you are giving prints on regular A4 paper (both color and b/w).As soon as you put in a higher GSM paper, particularly photo paper or sticker paper, the ink starts spreading or the output colours don't match the soft copy. This is especially true for color printouts. So, do not fall for the official specs of the product which mentions higher GSM print out possible till A4 size.This is a good product and definitely is easy on the ink consumption than other printers as long as you need only regular A4 printouts."
1,"I purchase this printer one year back, it worked ok for me for one year. And exactly after one year, it did not work. It was not switching on. I checked with service guy and asked for a dashboard replacement which cost above 50 percent of printer cost. It is phetic HP is selling such kind of product, which did not last above one year. My suggestion don't buy any HP product."
4,The printer is good and does the printing and scanning job well.The only issue I came across was the software and device detection
4,"H.p is always the best, This product is good"
5,"Nice product at this price. I got it for ₹3150 during GIF . Nice product . But cd is missing in the package. But I easily installed the software using the user guide. For those who want information about the software installation(in absence of cd), whatsapp me on 9847052995"
1,"With a low volume of printing (less than 100 pages in a year) and after replacing cartridges with company originals, the printer has failed."
1,"The print quality is utter pathetic and cartridges have syringe holes when took out...used piece... already a year, so can't return...check your piece after buying"
3,This model has no Wi-Fi feature as described by amazon
4,"Cartridge is expensive BUT you can easily refill this by yourself , buy ink from market and refill it manually. But yeah Don't panic if you're doing it for the first time.Print quality is Good.Easy to install and use. Looks cool but not for heavy usage. Just for personal use only."
2,The printer is compact and light.. But the real problem lies in its paper tray.  Suited for one sided printing only.  Duplex is manual and messy.  Paper needs to be inserted correctly only then it is useful.  Cartridges are economical and long lasting in Draft print.

4,"I was looking for good quality MFP in the 10k range and came across this model. HP name and its features were eye-catcher and I was able to finalize it soon.I am using this MFP for more than a year and so far had no issues, be it printing or scanning or copier. P.S. I use only genuine HP toner in it, so it’s quite a deal.HP 126nw, mark this nw in its name as it makes it super useful, giving it network capability in terms of LAN/Wi-Fi for both printing and scanning. This is really useful as you can keep it anywhere and print from virtually any location without any cable connected (other than power cable).Setting it up, in general, is a breeze while the Wi-Fi scan is a bit complicated. I will list the steps to make it easy for you.FYI, I got it from Cambium Retail seller.•••••••••••••••INSIDE BOX•••••••••••••••1. Printer2. Paper stack tray3. Print collection tray4.

A wonderful multifunction device with laser printing.2. Detailed control panel with 2 line LCD text display3. Good print & scan speed/resolution. Print (up to 20ppm, 1200 dpi) & scan (up to 7ppm b/w, 5ppm colour, 1200 dpi).4. Multiple connectivity options for print/scan. USB/LAN/Wi-Fi.5. Set up anywhere, thanks to its Wi-Fi connectivity. Just a power source required.5. Print using smartphone directly via Wi-Di i.e. Smartphone → Printer6. Print using smartphone via network i.e. Smartphone → Router → Printer (Download HP print service plugin from app store)8. It can be used as a standalone photocopy machine using the control panel with an extra double side photocopy feature for ID cards etc.9. All photocopy related controls are available on panel, like one-touch photocopy button, no of copies, light-dark with 11 steps, reduce/enlarge, optimization, paper setting, etc10. Tiltable control panel for easy access.11. The good thing with a laser printer is that you don’t have to worry about drying ink or print head. I had 2 heads replaced in the earlier inkjet printer. So even if off for a month, laser one works instantly with the same good quality.••••••••CONS••••••••1. Scan quality is not crisp. On full zoom, I find it slightly blurry. But in regular day to day scanning tasks, you won’t even notice it. So not a big deal.2. No backlit LCD and it’s a pain to operate it without backlight unless you tilt it.3. No ADF for scanning, so you need feed in every single page to be scanned separately. (But you can’t get everything in this range)4.

Only printing works. I will take you through steps to enable wireless scanning which is really very handy. It took me a lot of time to figure it out.If already configured on network and you set it up via 2nd option, then scanning will work.1. Power on MFP. Do not connect it via LAN cable or USB cable for now.2. Use driver cd or download installer from the HP website. Run it.3. Choose USB based setup. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.4. Again run the installer and now choose the 3rd option, first-time wireless connection. Follow on-screen instructions and complete it.5. Now when you run HP scan utility, it will be able to communicate to MFP via Wi-Fi.6. If you skip step 3 above, it won’t work and give communication error.▶ WITH WPS1. Power on MFP. USB or LAN cable is not required.2. Press the Wi-Fi button on MFP to start the WPS connection.3. Push the WPS button on your router.4. Let it connect to the router. Once successful, the IP address will be displayed on LCD.5. Now start setup and select 2nd option 'connect through the network'. It will search for the printer on the network.6. Once found, select it and proceed.•••••••••••••••••••FINAL VERDICT•••••••••••••••••••I am using it for more than a year and it never disappointed me in terms of usage, be it printing/scanning/copy task.▶ This device, M126nw is highly suitable for general home usage where you don’t print every day or light to medium office work where you print/scan daily.  You can very well go for it.▶ There used to be another model m126a without network capability. If you can find it, you can save some bucks. But a few bucks more get you a good deal of value proposition with m126nw."
5,"Model - M126nw. Pro-tip: Always buy an extra compatible toner with your new printer :)My Quick Find outs are --- pros:1. Compatible Toners easily available at just under 500 INR on Amazon so no worry about printing cost.2. WiFi setup and wireless printing is extremely easy (by phone or laptops)3. Using it as network printer atm (by LAN port in my small office)4. Print quality is awesome 5/5 for that5. Photo Copy /Xerox are so fine, get confused which one is original if I copy (if copy b/w)6. Scanning quality is nice too.Cons:Some things to consider before buying this printer:1. Unable to copy/scan large size of papers (legal size)2. No back-lit in digital display screen"
3,"1) The copy quality of the printer is horrible, Scan quality is just ok and print quality acceptable.2) It doesn't have led light in the display so its gonna be more difficult and annoying for you to operate this printer."
1,"Warning: No backlight on the display. On a printer of this price, what's the problem in putting some leds at the back??Another big warning: No flatbed in scanner. If you have 100 pages to scan, you need to do it one by one. A cheap 3k rupees printer does this.No return option in Amazon unless there is a technical defect. Make your choice clear before buying. I would have returned it if I was allowed.Not an good experience on Linux machine. Setup was not easy. I will couldn't connect it wirelessly. Need to run a ethernet from router.Only Good thing is, it's prints very fast. If you just do printing alone and nothing else, you can consider this."
5,"Fantastic Product. I haven't seen a better HP LaserJet Pro with such cool features. It has wifi, lan connectivity. I can print from my phone laptop any device wireless to the machine. And it shows up instantly. Moreover the whole setup process was a breeze. I would not have got a better HP Laserjet product with MFP capabilities at this price. Hats off!!"
2,"THE WORST PRINTER>I'll keep it short.PROS:-Prints at a good speed and good and easy Printing.  Get many pages from one Cartridge.-Good for printing a huge pdf at once.Cons:-Wi-Fi range is a line of sight. If Laptop in another room it would take a long time to get the information of data to print.- Blacks are not deep black, even if it's not on Eco mode.- I have a dual router at home that is 5Ghz and 2.4 GHz for my internet. So when you using this on wifi, the printer will only connect to the 2ghz one. So you have to disconnect the internet on your device and connect to the Printer wifi and then print.- Printing on wifi is a SLOW process. The times I needed to print something quick its never been able to just work.If you using only for USB or cable only then it might be good.- The scanner has been getting some black staining inside which doesn't reproduce the best quality scans.In short, this is the last time I am purchasing HP as a printer brand.The Fact that to print 1 page I have to go through so much, doesn't classify this a friendly printer at all."
5,"This Printer is best suitable for the Office purpose who can use Monochrome (Black & White) color printouts.PROS:1. Best Print Quality.2. Faster Printouts.3. Scanning - Quality is Good.NOTE: For getting the best scanning quality, we need to use the Software and Adjust the BRIGHTNESS and CONTRAST to get the Scanning with High Quality.PRINTER's DEFAULT SCAN SETTING WILL GIVE YOU THE WORST SCANNINGS. SO, BEFORE SCANNING PLEASE MAKE SURE, YOU HAVE SET THE BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST IN THE HP PRINTER SOFTWARE.4. Wifi - Connectivity - Best - Tested in Android Device through the App HP Service Plugin.CONS:1. Printer's Display doesn't have Back-Light. So it is very difficult to work in a dark environment. At this price range, they would have given the Back-Light for the Display.2.Unable to Update Printer Software. Whatever the software which comes in CD will be usable. This is the hassle which I faced."
5,"Print Quality :  Perfect print quality... don't know how many papers it I'll print...in printing reports it showing approxly 500 pages remaining to print...once the toner got over I'll update...Packing :  I didn't expect from Amazon, that packing was worst condition since it was Amazon fulfilled...just they sticking the shipping label over HP box and sent to me...due to this product can be easily damagedInstallation :  Easy to install...use you tube videos to install...WiFi:  Smart...very convenientAppearance : bit older model"
4,"Overall good quality ,have searched a lot about a printer with scanner for home usage purpose ,go through various products like intjet ,inktank and laser ,also have personal usage experience for the ink jet printers they are low price initially but the cartridge cost is high and u have to use it regularly otherwise its dried up ,So m confused between laser black and white or inktank colour ,but after going through various reviews online pushes me to buy laser printer ,black and white and i dont have much requirememt for colour printing ,so initial cost for this printer is some what higher then both other competitors but the maintainance cost is less as said overall ,so finally choose this one ,those who want to use colour printing photos prinitng can go with inktank also its printing cost is lesser then inkjet ,This is initial review will edit up after some more usage ,till now happy with my product ,as it has wifi connectivity ,also have scanning option ,and moreover easy to installl urself ,One kore thing want to add on this review for newbies like me u have to install urself no demo will be provided so go through material provided ,and thanks for making my review usefull ,enjoy"
1,"It actually took me more than 6-7 days to set this up before I finally tried to get some help here, no customer service at all! finally with permutations and combinations I was able to resolve it on my own. Print quality is ok, not that great. With wifi signal you have to struggle and find out IP conflicts etc, and its not easy to install at all. The print quality is ok. They send very less ink in the cartridge. within 3 days I had to buy a new cartridge."
5,"bets printer in this price rangepros:1.quality printing.2. comfortable weight and build.3.easy installation.4. wireless printing, mine is from iphone. hassle free connecting also from laptop and desktop.cons:1. display of details in the panel needs a torch pointed at it. should have had a better display.2. should have had a dust cover.Overall a great printer"
4,"I found the HP LaserJet Pro to have good printing, scanning and copying characteristics. However I was not happy with the LCD display which is given. It is very difficult to read the content given the size of the letters and the fact that it is dark. I think a backlit LCD would have made much better sense. I had to use a torch to read the content each time......"
1,"Easy to install , wifi hooked up easily.After a few pages , the print has become very light.Noway could the cartridge be over so soon.Has been very difficult to get in touch with hp service centre.No idea what to do. The 1800 number on Amazon is not working.. will have to go to local printer guy cause of no transparency in customer service."
4,"Model - M126nw. Professional tip: Always purchase an extra perfect toner with your new printer :)My Quick Find outs are - stars:1. Good Toners effectively accessible at just shy of 500 INR on Amazon so no stress over printing cost.2. WiFi arrangement and remote printing is very simple (by telephone or workstations)3. Utilizing it as system printer atm (by LAN port in my little office)4. Print quality is wonderful 5/5 for that5. Photograph Copy/Xerox are so fine, get befuddled which one is unique in the event that I duplicate (if duplicate b/w)6. Examining quality is pleasant as well.Cons:A few interesting points before purchasing this printer:1. Incapable to duplicate/examine huge size of papers (legitimate size)2. No backlight in computerized show screen"
4,"Great thing I feel is wifi printing and scanning. Good printing quality, easy to install, fast printing.I would like to tell you how to install printer through wireless at home1. Unbox your product and remove cartridge inserted in the printer2. Remove paper strip and a plastic cap from cartridge. Insert cartridge into the printer3. Keep your WiFi switched on and power on the printer. Do not connect printer to computer through usb cable4. On printer console switch on the WiFi switch. (There will be a WiFi icon on the button)5. On printer LED display you will see ""searching for WPS"".  Your WiFi has WPS switch so switch it on.6. Printer will be connected through WiFi and an  address will be displayed on printer LED.7. Insert your CD in the computer and do as directed. When it asks for Mode of connection then choose wireless instead of usb cable.8. Your computer will automatically detect printer then go next.9. After few minutes your printer will be ready  Any device (mobile, laptop) connected with your wifi can operate your printer."
2,"Wifi is for direct print/connection only, not to the wifi network. There is no duplex for this, and the latest HP Smart software does not work for this.Luckily we do not print much, so this printer does the job, but when you look at it, it feels that it was technology from 3-4 generations ago. It's a little expensive for what it is, but seems that when it comes to printers, India does not sell the latest printers/ranges at affordable prices when compared to purchasing in the UK.During scanning the printer sometimes resets itself, which is a pain when scanning 10+ pages manually and having to restart after the printer resets."
5,"Received printer in original packaged and good condition. Printer received before delivery date. After unpacked printer found intact and properly sealed. Printer is using since 3 days, running smoothly. I am happy and thanks to Amazon."
1,"Waste of such a huge amount of money as the print is not working when i fill up powder, when enquired with customer care they are just asking to buy Genuine cartridge which cost 4000/- which in no way a normal individual can afford."
1,Poor after sales service follow up. No representative of HP came even after following guidance given by Amazon executive of getting the product registered with HP. Had to separately spend Rs 1K to get someone from local market tech shop to help in the complex installations process. No one picks call at HP service customer care. Otherwise printer is as described and good. Installation with wifi and mobile installations are tricky
5,"It is a Back & White printer. I ordered thinking its a color printer..The Packaging and delivery was perfect no flaws in it. The installation was very tricky. Had to go through a lot of youtube videos to try setting it up using WiFi, but it did not work for me.Best thing to do is connect your printer to laptop using the cable and follow the instructions. Could setup the printer on my WiFi network without any issues. Print quality is ok may be because I am using a 100 gsm paper which is off white. But it does the job for home use or may be a small business setup."
1,"Beware , manual duplex printing means you have to physically turn the paper for back side print. Brother printers are better as same is available for much cheaper price. Don't commit the mistake what at least I did . Many Thanks . Cheers"
4,"I have been buying HP printers for last 15 years. This is my 4th product at home. Happy as always but the value for money is missing. Software are on CD and none of my family members have CD reader in laptops so had to download from internet on each system. Moreover setting up was little difficult, especially wifi printing setup. They did not provide any guide or tutorial for that."
1,"HP service is VERY POOR. This printer, is not a plug and play printer. It is impossible to install using the manuals which accompany the printer. One year Warrant covers only remote offsite support. Even after 4 months of purchase, HP could only establish printing and scanning through USB. The basic purpose of purchasing a printer with Wifi Connectivity is LOST, since the feature could not be configured by HP after repeated attempts.Providing FEEDBACK to HP is also to no avail. They are not proactive and have not ever bothered to check back with the customer based on feedback. DISAPPOINTED with HP service and support.I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PRINTER. If you do, please do so at your own risk.Print quality is good. Only One page at a time can be scanned. this is a limitation."
5,1. Easy to install. Just go through the instructions given in the booklet provided to you.2. Great look and attractive model from HP.3. Print from any device from anywhere.4. All in one printer makes your work easy going and hassle-free.5. WiFi connectivity help you go to wireless printing.6. Fast printing (only a few seconds)7. No printing noise8. Prints smooth like butter.9. Easy to operate an LCD panel with a clear display.This printer is suitable for offices only. Don't buy for home use at such a high price. I bought it at NO COST EMI. Thanks to Amazon Pay Later feature.
4,"Connect to it via USB or Wifi Direct and you are able to configure everything using a web browser.  You need to enable the Wifi Direct using the panel in front.The biggest problem comes afterwards from HP itself.  They have their own ""Easy Start"" software for the MacOS which is out dated and doesn't work with latest version of MacOS 10.15.7.  Moreover, it enables with HP web print service which is not required. My suggestion is not to install any custom HP software for this printer on the MacOS and just use the built-in drivers.Everything works fine once it is setup and it is surprisingly quick."
2,"It is very hard to setup. I am a techie and an engineer. Still, it is hard to set up this printer.1. It does not easily install drivers on computer.2. It does not connect easily to wifi for printing.3. It does not easily create a wifi hotspot to connect to for printing.The printing part if fine. There are not enough options for formatting what you have to print. It's all very basic printing.I would not recommend."
5,"Totally worth of buying and true justice of money. I loved the product, very nice printer in almost all aspects. I want to make clear it to all the others buyers that it don't print on both sides of paper you have do it manually by turning the pages otherwise it is very good especially the print quality."
5,"I was skeptical for buying such a costly, big amd an important electronic item online. But it was at very less price and a big discount. So i dared. To my surprise it came pretty soon and the package was well intact, the product was brand new, easy to install. The installation was done within half hour in my office."
2,"The print quality is pretty good however, the copy function is quite bad and disappointing. Direct wifi connect is really difficult to achieve. I even called a HP support personnel to get the direct wifi installed. But it still does not work. It is not compatible with all operating systems or even with Android phones. My personal recommendation would be to go for different printer."
4,"I was looking for laser jet without scanner and to my surprise not many options hence went ahead and bought this. I am glad that I have purchased this. The HP Smart app is simply amazing and with WiFi direct it works like a pro. I now use the scanner more than printer to scan and upload my kids h/w. Only disappointment is I am unable to pair with my WiFi, followed the steps but still doesn’t work. Got similar feedback when I did a google search. Another drawback is very expensive for a b/w printer."
1,"Worst worst worst, The print is very light colored, have to change drum within 2 days as drum is not ij warranty, photocopy is very light colored.... The input tray is damm loose built, you put the papers & it get shattered everytime ... If you keep it in idle mood, its get switched off easily and you have to turn it on again for work,Sometimes it doesn't print & you have to troubleshoot the program for printing.. not recommend for hig usage such as 700 print per month... Barcode not printing in .rpt files."
4,"I purchased this for home and very happy with this. Print quality is okay. What I liked is the wifi connectivity. Once connected using WPS on the router, it gives seamless printing access to all android mobiles, tabs and laptops in the same network. This is apart from the USB connectivity. One can print without connecting to router also - printer can be directly accessed through its wifi host from any device.However, HP's printer software suit installation took very long time. I think it is packed with so many unnecessary things. Once installed, my desktop and laptop started crashing and slowing down (Windows 10 OS). Issue got solved when I removed everything, retaining only the drivers. Not sure the criteria only with me!"
4,"Very much disappointed by the seller who didnt even pack such costly (to me at least dnt know about seller, he might have billions dollar) device in corrugated box or wrapper. It shows carelessness towards prepaid customers. I was not on sopt otherwise I would have returned the product and ask for refund. When I came to the place and opend the box what found is bottom side on top. Very bad experience so far with Amazon. I will never recommend and even if someone is going to buy from this seller make sure you select Cash on delivery bc once you pay them they will treat your products (basically your money) like wastage. So be careful.Now let jump straight to the product: Once you set your mind to purchase this model make sure you have good eye sight bc it doesn't have any light on screen which may affect your experience after purchase just like me. I didn't expect letters are such small so it's hard to see. Printing quality is moderate, have better experience with model M1136(very very satisfied, after 7 years and still running like a mad horse) which will save your 3k easily. Configuration of Wireless connection is really headache however somehow managed(you need seperate router), connection with smartphone: Haaaa!! I still wondering how it works, your phone could find the wifi of printer and ask for security password...but here is a twist..there is no password anywhere mentioned. You have to be Sherlock Holmes to find wifi password. Gist: Do not waste your hard earnings and go for Laserjet M1136 if you dnt need wireless printer and spend that extra 3k for poor old beggers or stray/injured animals through funding. BTW money is yours do whatever you want to do.."
3,"Printer is good . Very difficult to install on wifi . you need to see lot of YouTube videos . For MAC user its almost a headache to instal this printer and Eprint is almost impossible unless you are hardware engineer . There is specific ip address of printer , so every time you have to print you have to select  the ip and start the print . Wifi scan will to work on Mac ."
1,"This product is a big blunder. HP recommends the customer to change the toner if there is thin printing. If we look logically the printer costs around 16k and the toner costs around 4k, think of this, if a customer needs to change the toner as and when it gets finished for 5 cycles he need to spend more than the value of the asset on maintenance 😞😩😩. I strongly recommend not to purchase this."
1,"Printer stopped working after 2 weeks, when called HP support after 1hr of requesting, they agreed to send service guy.He gave us shock of life when he told Toner is empty, after printing only 200 pages.He said toner needs to be replaced.How it is possible?? I can’t return product as return window expired. What options I have??Never buy on Amazon.Never buy on Amazon."
4,"Just delivered the product yesterday... Installation process i found it difficult..The setup installation I installed from website since CD setup was showing error.Normal setup via USB was okay to setup.But I struggled a lot in setting up wifi...Gone through many YouTube videos for the same..Its working good now..Pros:Scan, copy,print in one deviceWireless option available.Cons:Device little heavy.Setup installation was difficult.Slightly pricey than other devices.Hopefully all should be worth it.Reducing one star due to setup installation."
4,"Pros:Works as expected.Wireless printing is supported on multiple platforms. Android, IOS and Windows.The HP smart app is really great.HP e-print service seems really helpful when not around the printer.Cons:Prints, especially the copies can lack contrast. A quick change in contrast settings should fix that immediately.The display has no back-light. Hard to see if the display isn't close (+- 30cms) to eye-level or when in dimly lit areas."
2,"I love the features of this printer, which have a WiFi connectivity, scan, copy and can add to a network.Printing Quality is good. Easy to use and there is no need of a technician for initial setup.The only disadvantage that I found was it's toner cartridge and display. Refilling the toner cartridge is disgusting. Display is same as Calculator displays. I don't recommend this printer."
5,Bought this printer as a replacement for another hp printer that I had. Was really impressed on how easy it was to set it up wirelessly. Used the wps button on my router and the whole process took less than 5 minutes. I have used it only for two days but the prints are very clear. I can print either from an Android phone or iPhone without any trouble.
5,Wish I could have purchased it earlier - I already purchased 4 deskjets/inkjets from last 10 yrs - but I don't know why they eat so much ink - I got tired of ordering its cateridges - Also my kids are in school (11yrs & 6 yrs) and they get something to get print out every second day and during exams - you can understand. This serves my black and white printouts (almost 90% of requirement) and I have HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4335) that serves colored printout (10% of requirement). the print quality and speed is great ! and energy save option is also cool - it remains on standby and whenever you need a printout from your phone or laptop - just give a command and in less than 30 secs you will have your printout :) Amazing. Hassle free. Very satisfied with the product and its features
4,"The printer was easy to install including the wireless settings and I was able to print over Wi-Fi. The catridge life was showing as 10% on the new printer which didn't sound right. So ordered another one (Thanks to Amazon Return policy) which got delivered and old one was picked. Installed all over again and went straight to check the catridge life and it shows 100% now. So make sure you check the catridge life and get it replacedpromptly. Other than that one issue, it seems to be working fine. Have tried both printing and copying. Quality is good."
3,Canon is not giving installation n demo serviceIt takes charges for demo n installationThat's not fair
5,"The product was delivered before time. Excellent printing and quality of the scanner is also pretty good. The machine is the latest in its class and wireless connectivity, printing from smart phone features are superb. All-in-one unit Canon i-SENSYS MF 232w is ideal machine for home. amazon.in has wide variety of products and fully satisfied with their services.Rajendra Joshi17/05/2017"
1,"This was my worst decission to buy a printer from amazon. The product which i received from amazon was a defective one. The box was wet and damaged also the print quality was not as expected so i requested a replace. The replaced product which i received was a 2nd hand product. No seal, broken plastic, used cartridges, all transparent papers removed, no driver cd, no user manual. Be cautious while getting this product as amazon has now started delivering used product."
5,I'm stisfied this has WiFi & usb interface. We can scan and print from mobile phone. No need to switch  on the computer. We can print direct via wi fi without a router connection.
1,There is no two sided printing it's major drawbackFor only office purpose not for commercial purposes
4,"Excellent quality output, i was looking all in one printer for small business with ethernet setup and this suits it. But still i see manufacturing date was 2019 and looks like old stock. Also the cartridge comes inbuilt has only 20% so you have to purchase additional cartridge. Overall product is good hope after sales service also good."
5,I got this printer on 25 th August morning.  I called Canon service Center and requested for sending a person for installation.  They registered my request and on same day I got it installed from Service Center. There were no charges for installation.  Very professional service personnel.  Would recommend everyone to download Canon app register the product and call for service help.First day my rating is 5 star.
5,Decent printer with superb features like wifi features.....makes it's more convenient to be use it while placing it in any corner of room/house.Also one more thing first one have some issues Amazon as well as seller simply replace it and suggest replacement by their own means not unnecessary bothering me...So it's superb deal for me....10/10Printing quality is acceptable....Also many other features like printer screen advised every time if printing matter is outnof paper range...Printer-cum-Scanner also it's  upside...So it's highly recommended.....Canon's machine.....
5,Very good product from canon.This is not Chinese product. This made by south koria. And Japan based Company. It's Good think.Toner used 337.
5,"Mass productIt does not support duplex printing.It is faster when we connect to ur computer or mobile wired or wireless.And we can make certain paper setting in the printer itself instead of doing it in ms word.There is a difficulty to setup a CD drive in computer,if u look and read the guide properly you will be able to setup .Thatsall"
4,Canon should send its person to install the new printer and sync it with our existing network systems.We had to unnecessarily pay extra Rs.1500.00 to our maintenance person.The cartridge given with printer had very short life of few days of normal printing of about 10-15 pages/day.
3,"Printer is good, however, getting its toner cartridge is a challenge. Canon website also not been of any help. I didn’t find their website providing option for purchasing original cartridges. Looks like this printer has to be scrapped due to non availability of original cartridges. Suggest avoid any Canon printers in India. Thanks"
1,Item is faulty and fake cartridge inside. The printer shows a counterfeit cartridge message and doesn't print a single page. Very disappointed with Amazon. Expected better.
5,"I was little confused before I order this printer. There's so many options available claiming to be best but I chose to buy this printer. Entirely satisfied. It's fast, print quality is brilliant, cost of printing is low. Anyone without 0 technical knowledge can install it."
5,The printer is amazing. Thank you Amazon for a very lovely product once again. The printing is absolutely hassle free. The packing was good. A major saviour in these pandemic times.
4,good printer only issue is that it is not auto duplex printer . no slot for pen drive for scanning. as scanning can be done trough computer only
5,I took this printer and superb and nice features. Before buying this I had tried other printer very tough to install for both Mac and Windows 10. But this CANON Printer is superb easy to install for both Mac and Win
1,My  product is not operte in first timeSome technical issuesPlease solve this in urgency

5,Good quality print .No delay in printing.Easy to use. Quality product. Timely delivery .
3,Expected a lot from a cannon but this printer seems to be very lame and not worth the money they are charging
5,Go for it! Both printing and scanning is good. Easy to print from phone. No need to talk about quality as it is a Canon's product.
4,"There is no dilike point noticed by me .Smooth running & paper printing quality good .After all ,I like this model."

I am not technical expert but giving advice, if you need 100 -200 printing pages per month then pantum p2200 is best."
5,"Hi All,  After finalizing that I have to buy laser printer to make cost effective printing, I did lot of research and found that other brands are very expensive, went for Pantom printer after seeing YouTube videos. Got the delivery on 21st Jan 2019 and found the printer setup to absolutely smooth. The print came out very nice and found much better than my expectations.Recommend others if you are not looking for only branded products."
4,Good printer but only thing missing is that  you can't do WiFi printing unlike other modern printer but for that you can spend more if you want WiFi printer.
1,The Things i dislike about it is that the printer doesn't worth the value it was sold because it is very very slow and generate lots of heat please if there is any help you to assit me i will welcome it
1,This Printer is best in all aspects but the only reason for which I have to return it is ..you cannot easily get it's refil toner and when I tried it was not available in India only.So what's the use of having a printer when you can't refill it's toner.
1,I have used printer rarely and that too for only 6 months. First paper started printed crocked and after 20 to 25 prints it started getting blocked inside the printer. It's getting jammed. Plus tried technical support number 1800-419-3160 from their website and its not valid number. It's better to spend 1K to 2K more and buy better printers rather than going for this one.
5,"I was initially skeptical about buying this printer as it was low budget and a laser printer, but this is turning out to be perfect for the last 2 months I have been using it.  I can say I am happy with it till now and no problems.  Lets see how it holds out and how much prints its able to give genuinely."
5,Small sturdy economical . windows 10 drivers not in the CD but not a big issue. Easily downloaded from official site.
3,Quality of printer is not so good than other branded lazer printer as printer is much lighter. It is economic than inkjet and deskjet printer. Overall good.Refillable cartridge in it but slightly costly and branded lazer printer. So if you have heavy printing usethan don't buy this printer. But I'd you have less than 5 page per day work than you can buy it.
1,Worst product. I ran out in all ink filling shops to fill the toner and no one is filling the toner and nearly 20 days I used this product and I was compelled to buy another branded printer for my use. Useless product
3,"SLOW PRINTING SPEED, ONLY STARTER CARTRIDGE PROVIDED, NO PUSH BUTTON ON/OFF ON FRONT PANEL, ECONOMICAL MODEL, SPACE SAVING, DURABILITY YET TO BE ASCERTAINED. OVERALL A SATISFACTORY PRODUCT."
4,"This is the best laser printer for small office or home. Looks like very good and compact. Easy to install to computer. So, this is the best laser printer in 6000 cost."
5,Using the printer for few months. Print quality is good. It is value for  money. My usage is 5 to 8 prints per week. So not sure of toner capacity.
1,For personal works and light duty this printer is the best.
5,"Nice product, print quality is better, but you have to download driver from website, Driver CD provided is not running in my system."
4,"Nice printer fast, competitively priced well built. Print quality is also good. Regarding toner cost,refilling etc only time will tell."

4,"Print quality is good, but shining is missing. Overall this is a good product."
5,Installation process seems quite confusing initially. But after installation so easy to use
1,Within 3 months the drum became defective. In the centre the it does not print at all(Checkphotos). Totally worthless product. Go for HP or canon. They have better customer care.

4,This machine for service contact meprajapatip507@gmail.com genuine sevice cheap cost and diccount this product this product printer copier and scanner
4,Good xerox machine.
3,"The market price is 28000 to maximum 32000 Rs (depends on location ), I am using one and I am from a very small town.The print quality is good. But the original cartridge (ink) cost around 2400-2600 Rs. This machine has sensor chip, which identifies refill or duplicate ink, so it can't be refilled. and customer has to end up buying a new cartridge. Some people suggests refill ink, but it will not work permanently, after 100-200 prints it will pop up a message saying unknown toner, or duplicate ink. Hence has to be replaced with a original cartridge, than print couple of copies, take out the original cartridge, re insert the refilled one continue for next 100-200 copies. This process has to repeated again & again to use a refilled cartridge or toner. But if you buy in 2800-3200, than its a good one."
5,after filling toner power and chip the printing quality is light only what can i do please answer  me

1,"Oct 24, 2019: Printer seems like a waste of money.Tri-Colour print head seems to have failed in a new device purchased in Mar 2019. No way of emailing HP product support. One of the ways I seemed to have done it from HP site (from my login there) never got me a response!=======The printer works extremely well & silently except for the following (note: All my devices are either MacOS or IOS):1. This printer was purchased from Amazon in March 2019, the warranty for the product (as per HP site) had started in December 2018!2. It does not switch off automatically in 2 hours - as per printer web-page this feature is pre-setup & cannot be altered3. No instructions on how to make the Manual Duplex feature work from a Print option (at least on MacOS)4. Knowledgeable/ trouble shooting guides have no information on this5. Due to Ink-Tank feature, it is not easy to just ""pick-up"" the printer & carry it - it has to be kept horizontal to avoid ink spills, so carrying to an HP service centre is out of question.6. The Chat Bot on HP website cannot answer anything that you cannot read in a manual - it is totally useless & does not even recognise that it should redirect the person to a human.7. All support information is for Windows devices - not help for Mac OS is available8. Still trying to figure out how to talk to a support representative as they are available only during my working hours or shorter & I have not been able to find an option to leave a message/ email for help.In short - very good product when it works, but support seems to suck. Also, some problem of seller (assuming warranty start date is their issue), published features (switching off - everybody is now lazy to switch off a shared printer/ Manual duplex) do not always work."
1,First of all it's not worthy for the money you pay!! The color prints smurge. The plug is not stable to put in the socket . To print off it asks to install plug-in besides HP smart app.it will take time to print . sometimes it doesn't print at all and the paper comes empty . I just got fooled by the good reviews . Even after the ink dries up it smurge .waste of money
5,Excellent product.  Bought it during Diwali offer...
5,"My Views:LIKE:Faster print than earlier inkjet HP printer, wireless connection is easy to configure.Print quality is good with the speed of Print.Resolution of scan is acceptable.HP smart Print or scan feature is icing on cake.Very good facility of Scan n share with mobile HP smart app.Same day of receipt from Amazon, HP Engineer did Installation ..Great work.Spare Ink bottle would be sufficient for atleast 1.5 years for my printing need.Packing condition of Printer was safe enough..DISLIKE:Manual Duplex: need to feed the paperNot sturdy built quality but ok. Need to keep it safe.Protusion out of Ink tanks from main body of Printer.Conclusion: Recommend to buy"
5,"So,let me give you  true review. Packing by Amazon was awsome. Let me directly tell you about best , best , best feature about this printer 1) wi-fi direct, you can directly take prints wirelesly using smartphone , pc , laptops. No need to use datacable, pen drive etc , this device is completly wire free.Another most most amazing feature is, you can even scan docoments using smartphone, laptop ,pc. Scaned copy will directly be sent to your device wirelesly. Print quality is awsome, and fast."
4,"I am writing a review for HP 419 AIO printer. Package arrived early, installation was quite easy, did it myself.• Wireless connectivity works well• It's not that heavy, comes with 2 black bottles and 3 bottles (cyan, magenta, yellow), they were spill resistant, didn't cause a mess• Got printheads, easy to installOnto print quality• It's great for text• Photo prints are alright, if you only want to print photos, I recommend not going for it unless you use high GSM paper• Scanning & copying is great, works pretty wellOne thing though when it printed out the guide, it said HP 410 printer, so if you want to spend lesser money, go for 410, it's literally the same except for having an extra black bottle that you can purchase for less than the extra amount I had to pay for 419Overall, it's nice. Go for it."
5,"HP printer is very good product.  But the HP dealer/service centre of Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands is not supported for service.  They are shown the HP company letter that if HP printer purchased from online is not covered warranty.  I was purchased HP printer 410 which is warranty period is upto 28 December 2019.  But they are not accepted the warranty and charged for Rs 3000/- (Rupees three thousand only).  So it is my advice to customer don't purchase HP printer.  The warranty period showed the online is making fool to customer.  PLEASE DON'T PURCHASE HP PRINTER"
1,"Lot of instructions and still difficult to install. When I called their helpline, the agent told me I am not supposed to install by myself!!!! Like, how is anybody supposed to know. Once you open the packaging all it says in big font is instructions of how to install. The printer head gets stuck when you connect to power. But why???  And amazon pickup guy canceled thrice. But why???  Overall not a great experience."

5,Great product and the printing speed is much better than Epson tank printers
5,I bought because my sister using it for 1 year and is showing excellent prints and no doubt you can buy it .... and installation done by myself using YouTube videos as I don’t want to invite an anonimous person from ho for free installation and the installation for this very easy .. just followed the YouTube videos .. and it’s been working good ... don’t follow the low reviews just buy it ... and you yourself can install it not a big problem at all ..
5,"I got this printer yesterday and it is working as expected. Do not see any issues until now.Also, got two Black Ink bottle along with colors bottle. And black Ink bottles are of 170 ml while the ink tank capacity of the printer is 80 ml. So even after filling the ink tank, I have half of the ink left in the opened bottle and another unopened bottle. So definitely I can do a lot of printing before I need to buy ink bottles."
4,Overall good only for home use . Inks used are cheaper compared to toner. Easy to install and just need to be carful first time while installing header. The biggest draw back is its take more time to print the colour. secondly be careful to give number of copies while shifting between colour or black/white. Rest good if you can bear with your time.
5,"I am more than satisfied with the product. once installed with guidance mentioned in the user manual, it's all easy to take printouts, when ever you need that, either from your PC or mobile.Now my 7 year kid to find it straight forward to get a print for his school projects."
5,"Print quality is amazing , a durable product and installation is also easy"
5,I ordered this printer after tatacliq couldn't deliver after a month . This came within a week of ordering. It's easy to install. You can either refer to the manual provided or you can see installation videos from youtube. Took an hour to install. It's easy to use. Print quality is good. It's WiFi enabled also.
1,"Totally harassed to operate the printer, wifi not working properly, both side printing not performing, paper cost raised caused to interrupted printing and damage of papers. searching alternative. very unfortunate. HP make me offended by through this printer."
4,"The printer is quite good with relatively fast printing speed and better print quality. It's easy to install if you follow the manual thorougly or watch some YouTube videos and once connected to PC/Mobile app, easy to use too. However, I don't like the fact that the ink storage tank is protuding out of the main body which makes is vulnerable to impacts and, HP's policy about the phone app is absolutely nonsensical I don't see a reason why I need to sign-in with my email in order to print my private documents via my private printer in my own domicile."
1,This has to be the dumbest piece of machine I have every come across. I have been struggling with this even after weeks of purchasing it. Even I connect the USB cable the HP smart app cannot find the printer. Connecting with wifi worked fine for the first few days. Now it takes many minutes for the printer to come online after I switch it on. Real waste of money!
5,"Printing is so smooth and easy.Color prints (kids school project) were good enough. I haven't tried to take photo printouts yet . Many have complained about paper Jams , let's hope it doesn't happen :).  So far I am loving it for the economical prints and the ease of refilling ink in the ink tanks. I would recommend this printer to others."
2,It is 4 days from delivery and HP engineer is not turned up for installation. Service number is 166244.  Need urgent support to get this installed . Then only quality will be rated.
1,"I purchase this printer for my father office, but since it arrived its not working properly. I setup my father office after 10 days printer arrived so return window closed.So I contact hp support but from there also 2 times enginner comes but nothing works.I got defective product from seller himself so I Would say purchase from offline , you can check other reviews mostly all negative I make mistake so be carefull.whenever I print all pages stuck in printer. I wasted my 13000 Rs Wanted to sell at 5000 also if someone ready. so much tired from this garbage."
1,This is the most worst product I have seen ever..
5,Only issue is a print sent to HP Email address. Takes like about 5 minuted for a full page. Very slow. Anything connected on the network or directly with a calble is very good and fast.Dint try printing photos yet... shall try ot soon and update the revire. For now.. i dont see a reason to remove a star off.
5,This inktank hp 419 printer is good enough for home use and office use as well. It has a fault when you print many pages such as 20-30 at a time it takes a time gap after printing 10-12pages and automatically print the remaining.  Otherwise this printer is low cost both black and color print.
2,"Document printing is up to mark.but don't expect pro level photos prints. The biggest issue with this printer is setting up wireless printing (hp 419) .I tried everything I could to set-up wireless printing but failed. I called the customer care and they tried to remote assist and set up the same and they failed. Then they literally said that I have to use USB printing as they are not able to set up wireless printing.So , DON'T BUY THIS WIRELESS SERIES HP PRINTER.  Opt for usb printing or if you really need wireless printing then go for other brands.Such a disappointing experience."
1,"Please do not buy this because  installation local team is very poor,After so many follow up they just came start and go away.I can't able to print and i called them they blocked me."
2,"Well...bought this printer as a mistake and totally regret the decision. Print quality is trash duplex printing doesn't work at all and really slow. Overall just a really really bad printer. Please go for Epson or cannon, trust me this has been a waste of 15k rsCustomer service is also bad they take min 30mins to respond and iam not able to get product support for this issue.Really disappointed with hp for this one"
2,We ordered the printer and it was delivered properly. Installation was done by us as no one from HP called for scheduling installation. The network feature does not work. There is no installation guide on how to use it with HP App or how to set up on office wifi networkPrint quality is OK. Must use regularly else ink chokes the printer nozzle.
2,Network wireless printing became dysfunctional within a few days of installation in December. Have been operating with a USB cable connection. Now it has stopped working at all for past two months.
4,"You will have to watch youtube videos to install it perfectly by yourself. But once successfully installed it is a good buy. To register you have to search product no which is inside of front cover lid. Must register the product. While print quality is good , there is no duplex printing, no duplex ID scan (available in bro printer) and no paper tray, which is a drawback."
5,"Nice printer. Prints are clean and sharp. Very easy to install and use. Has option for b&w as well as colour photocopy.Installation was very easy. Having hpsmart app helps a lot to give print, scan or copy. Have used this with desktop as well as mobile."
5,Works perfectly! If you are looking for a home or small office colour printer..go for it. Print quality is good. Speed is good. Has WiFi/ WiFi direct and E print. Easy to install and connect. Comes with 5 bottles of ink. 2 black and 3 coloured.
5,The printer is one of the best printers I used.No marks or nothing. And also the printer is very easy to use. But however when we colour print a photo the result is a little darker than the real image. I think that happens because we have to use a proper photo paper for it. For me the printer is outstanding
2,"I was expecting much better print quality for a 14K printer, whilst the BW prints are still not bad the color prints are pathetic. Its okay if your looking for low cost color printing but if you are looking for good quality color printing then go for the inkjets, they are far far better even at a price point of 3-4 thousand for the printer."
2,Product is fine. Good and compactLooks 4/5Performance 3/5Speed of printing 2/5 (not expected that slow)Overall a decent product but when it cone to packaging there is no amazon packing and it came as it is as shown in the picture and there are minor torn covers here and there. Please check before accepting it.
4,The HP smart app needs some improvement. I have observed that while scanning more than 45 to 50 page at a time the the app sometimes crashes and you need to redo the scanning. The print quality is very good. You may need help in first time installation of the device. However HP support will help you out instantly and the customer service is also good.
5,Build quality awesome (Plastic Quality)Easy yo use with help of wireless connectivity and USBVery superior Print Quality especially for photo print awesomeVery silent and fast printing within budgetInk tank and sorounding is full of hard plasticReverse printing enabled
4,Works fine. Wireless feature is just great. It took me time to set up completly. office laptops didnt allow new printer set up. Installed it on mobile and then on ipad .Don't install on your own. Works fine. Great for office docs and kid school project .
5,Decent prints. A4 photos are not great. Use high quality photo paper for good pictures on 5/7 photos. Otherwise printer is great. I don't see a LAN port. That should have been there.Overall good one for student and personal printing.
1,Pls dont buy this printer from amazon.we bought in amazon sale for 5999.the printer doesnt work and the canon person is saying some part is broken.very bad support from amazon and canon.neither amazon nor canon will replaCe now.
4,Need a WiFi router to connect via smart phone. And about connectivity through a WiFi router is not mention in product description. Print quality is good. Back to back printout feature is also good. Overall good product I got under 5000/-.
5,"Excellent product and Superb Canon Service.Let me give few clarifications here -1. I got free remote online help from Canon support for complete installation with WIFI, wired and mobile. It made the whole process looked very easy. UNLIKE what some of the comments given here as its very tedious.Its completely hassle free and easy. Canon remote support is completely free and you could call in their customer care number.2. I got the free gift offer as per the Canon offer. Its very simple as you need to register a site as given in the details and I got the Philips Head Phone in 2 weeks time.So I would advice that DO NOT go by the negative remarks given here regarding the above 2 points."
4,"I purchased the printer in 2016 and the printer has been performing well. I have used it for printing documents and sometimes photographs as well. It is easy to install and works well over the wifi network. Another important point to note is that the printer works well even if not used everyday - I have not used the printer for 2 months and after that when I used it one day, I found that the print quality is good as with regular use - No ink blots, no ink skipping from the printer. On the negative side the print speed is slow and this printer model - E560 from canon is not compatible with the Apple Ipad or Iphone. Scanning is a little complex process as it requires a Canon app to be installed which although scans properly, does not have good functionality to share the scanned document as email attachment. The Canon app  is not so feature rich and offers basic functionality. One very important point to be kept in mind is that for Wifi Printing the device from which document will be sent to the printer should be in the same Wifi network as the printer, if the printer and the device are in different Wifi network then the printer will not receive the documents for print over Wifi.I would recommend this printer/scanner for home use only with low volume prints and occasional printing of photographs. If you are a Apple user ( Ipad, Macbook, Iphone)  i would recommend a printer with Airprint feature enabled."
5,"Pros: 1.we can print wireless with laptop and mobile, scanning can also be done wireless. 2. Printing with mobile phone takes less time compared to wireless printing with laptop. 3.  Wired printing is faster. 4.AUTO DUPLEX PRINTING is good option at this cost. 5. No other printer at this cost(i got it for 5499 that to at No cost EMI) with color, wirelss & Auto duplex printing optionsCons:1. wireless printing takes a bit more time. 2.printer Size is bigger3. Makes noise while starting/Printing."
1,"Received it on 20thJune. Started installation based on instructions but printer would not be detected by windows 10 laptop, iphoneX, iphone5s and Nokia Android mobile. It would work only if you connect USB cable to pc.  Called Canon customer care, they gave me service Center number but no one answered on given numbers.  Called cannon customer care again and they told me someone will contact me. Canon engineer came next day wednesday evening, spent few hours getting it to work but did not succeed. Canon engineer told he would come back again. It is 28th june when i am writing this review bu canon engineer has not come to fix the printer wifi issue. After getting frustrated for a week, i have initiated refund of this printer.  I would suggest anyone to stay away from canon printers because their customer service is third class.  I hope my review saves your time and energy."
2,Since i bought the printer day 1 it has been having issues. I spoke to the engineer and he said that they don't do the AMC of the product as they don't have spares readily available for the product and in last 4 months have registered 3 complaints once the Wifi detection was not working on the other the papers were loaded but the printer does not detect the printers loaded in the printer. Earlier had an HP printer gave issues after 5 years and Canon started giving from day 1. I would not recommend the Canon printer to anyone.
4,"1) Easy to use and print quality is excellent for black and white print but colour print on A4 size paper is little full and consumes lot of colour ink.2) The colour ink cartridge received along with the printer lasted for not more than 50 colour prints unlike the 100 prints guaranteed.3) A photo or a multicolour printing will consume more coloured ink. A A4 size full page colour print takes about 3 minutes or more if say you are printing a scenery or a group photo.4) Scan and print feature is very good particular the dedicated colour and black scan & print button. PC not required for scan and print but command can also be given using pc software provided for scan and print.5) The pc printing software provided is complicated, little confusing and printer response is little sluggish thru pc.A must buy for home and small businesses use."
1,Wifi connectivity is of low grade 802.11b/g/n. output tray arrangement is nu sense. you will always forget to open it and have to attend the printer every time. Last but important you can not use refilled cartridge in this printer at-tall.Even you can use its scanner if their is cartridge error. Each time you have to spend 1800/- for new cartridges. This printer is meant for cartridge selling only
5,"First of all,the installation process,i installed the printer and ink catridges as per manual instruction steps without much difficulty.For configuring wifi settings ,i had to connect printer to laptop using USB Cable provided ,while software setup,The other ways of configurring wifi settings was no successfulNow my  printer is accessible from mobile phones and other computers and laptops in my wifi networkThe auto duplex printing function is really helpful ,and very difficult to find in this price rangeBased on my experience with an older model E510,Canon printers lasts longer my previous printer Canon  E510 lasted for more than 6 Years .The catridge output is ok as i dont take too much printouts now a days,but the catridges are  expensive.Ididnt concidered ink tank printers as i heard few complaints about them arising due to not using printer for long time.i will update the review later using this printer long time....--An Update on 17-01-21I am seeing a  few negative reviews regarding wifi connectivity and secondly operation of printer from few usersThe Wifi Setup of this printer  may need some technical expertise and its difficult to do with a layman perspective as this printer dont have an inbuilt display(as compared to  HP printers i have used),i were able to succefully configure it ,and once i configured it inever encountered any issue,One should know How to use IJ network tool etc to succesfylly  configure the printer,and this one model is one of earlier wifi printers from canoni have used many HP printers  since 2004 and faced many issues related to its operation and maintenance ,none of them lasted  as much as My canon printers,My last printer before this one was a canon E510  lasted around 6+ years now--An Updateon 19-06-2021---the printer works perfectly ok and there are no issues so far, pre installed catridge stillnot exhausted"
3,I rarely used this printer for 2-3 years. After that it's power supply goes off. I called Canon officials and they told me that it's usb power card is not working and will cost you 2600rs. Canon spares parts are costly so think before you buy. 3 stars just for print quality...
1,Adding a few more points after further use1. Canon and amazon tech support are not helpful2. The wifi printing/scanning is very slow. The usb connection is also very unstable. I had to purchase a new cable for it to work.3. You can't seamlessly change between usb and wifi connection. You have to run installation every time. I am finally using only usb connection. So money paid for wifi is waste.There are several problems.1.  installation is not at all easy and instruction manual doesn't help you at all.2. Installation from brand is chargeable which is not nominal at all.3. The page doesn't dry quickly and I can already see ink getting smeared in some colour prints.4. User interface and software is the worst. My previous Hp printer which must be 8 years old came with a better software support.5. There should be a scan button on the printer itself. What is the point of buying a wifi printer if I have to be near the printer and laptop both. Then I can as well connect with a usb. You can't operate scan function without being on laptop. Also even at 600dpi the result is not good.6. Printing from mobile is quite cumbersome. Again app is not good. And there are too many clicks before and after the print which slows down the process a lot.
5,Worthy product at this price. Very decent specifications. Printouts are really fast and good clarity. It has duplex printing option its really good one. And also wifi option. We can get easy print from mobile and laptop. For wifi printout first we need to connect the printer and wirless devices to the router. After that we can use wireless printouts. Overall satisfied very much....
2,"Cons:1. The printer is not sturdy.2. There is no scan button/option available in the Printer Menus.3. The quality of the print is not up to the mark.4. The border less printing doesn't work for high quality prints, Auto option is default for border-less print.5. Setting-up the printer takes time, it would have been better a technician was arranged by canon after delivering product.Pros:1. Border less printing2. Duplex printing3. WiFi feature"
5,"Very good product. Easy to use. Wifi connectivity is very good. You can print easily from your android, laptop. Purchased in nov 2016 since then it is working well. Just attach easy ink tank for rs 600 and it will compete with other wifi ink tank printers that cost more than 10k. Double side printing is also very usefull as it saves lot of time."
2,"I wanted a printer for home use (Less prints) and being a first time user this printed attracted me. I bought this product and over a period of more than six months, I don't think this printer has given me 800 b/w prints or 250 color prints as mentioned. Moreover, these cartridges cost around 2000₹! And that price for the number of prints you're getting is not sufficient."
1,"I am using a replaced e560 due to faulty first one. The second one also is giving only complaints like paper stuck inside and not responding to print request etc. Their customer suppport is terrible, they are asking a serial number to register complaint. I have told them all the numbers behind and undeneath the printer but they want something else. i dont know where will i go for that number!!!. Finally they have advised their Chennai Customer care numbre and i have lodged a complaint for almost 10 days. Nobody has  attended so far. I think of throwing it to junk and go back to HP."
1,This is the second printer received after I had same WiFi connectivity set up failures on first one. Attached are failed to communicate or connect messages I repeatedly got.Printer doesn't seem to connect at all. Tried various methods of WPS connection.
1,"I am on of those who has received potentially defective printer. It doesn't print properly. I have spent almost 8 hours to see if I can fix it by head cleaning, deep head cleaning, nozel check, head alignment (both automatic and manual), and rest of the maintenance tasks.I wouldn't recommend buying this product."
2,"I hade several printers during the last decades from different manufacturers, but that one take the highest step in the non user friendly category. So complicated to setup, lose link with network daily , so many and heavy softwares, jam for no reason on every use, lose scanner connection... I simply regret a lot that purchase."
5,"One great advantage is that the printer need not be connected to any PC / Laptop, even while setup and can be kept in any convenient place. Though wifi connection ( with WPS) took 2 tries, otherwise setup was a breeze. Efficient and silent operation.  Print can be issued from any PC / Laptop / Phone (with Canon Print Service app installed) on the same wifi network. Auto Duplex feature is very convenient and print quality is quite good for the price. Overall, VFM."
1,Already disappointed. The printer does not have an option to configure WiFi in the device itself like how it’s available in HP printers. Called in tech support and they had to replace the printer. The new printer is again worthless because it will detect wifi when it feels like doing so. Papers have jammed while doing a scan 3 times now. somehow I feel like I was scammed to buy a printer that came to this market 15 years ago !!!!
1,"Not sure if I got the rotten egg from the basket but the printer that I got was plain pathetic. Stopped working within 3 months. Then on and off it worked. Canon support helped 2 times after that they even stopped responding as they probably realised it's a loss case. They never suggested it to replace it though, which would have been a nice thing to do from Canon's side but nope. I used it between 5-10 times.There are better printers available."
1,"This particular model has a fault in one of its parts, Canon won't tell you that, if you're lucky it might work for 3 months max, post that it would either not take in pages or return torn prints. Get ready for replace-fault- replace cycle till warranty, after that you're left with an irreparable & irreplaceable printer which is of no use, visit a canon service centre & you'll find this model lying everywhere, waiting to be replaced."
4,"Did a lot of research before buying this printer and it really worth the work done. Was in a doubt to buy either a canon printer or hp. Went by total customer ratings and reviews. Basically bought this product for home and some office work and printer bang on its work. Print quality is superb, prints every single detail perfectly. Color print 9/10, scaning 9/10. Wifi connectivity was a lil bit tricky as not much or nothing is mentioned on the product manual. A very handy product for office works. Printer is light weight and looks glossy. Functions are just enough to fulfil your day to day requirement. Easy to install. However canon selphy app is a lil disappointing as not much of print and scan options are there. Final wording - higly recommended at this price band...9/10"
1,ProsDuplex printing is a good featurePrint quality is goodConsCostly printsThe cartridge don't last long. Even after printing in black and white mode the colour cartridge which is almost half of the cost of new printer gets over2.pick up roller problemThe pick up roller does not pick up the paper automatically after some time.The replacement is also hard to get.The local mechanics say it is frequent problem of canon printers.3. Wifi set up issuesAfter some time of usage the setting up of wifi is problem which is at times nerve wrecking.
4,"Bought this during the lockdown as it was getting difficult to get printouts.The first product which got delivered was defective, but amazon and canon customer service helped to promptly order a replacement within 4 days.The replaced one worked like a charm.Installation setup was easy, faced hiccups on connecting the printer with wifi but it went through after couple of tries. Print quality is good for normal usage, haven't printed pictures to compare the print quality but should be fine for normal use.Overall happy with the product."
1,I would not recommend this printer to anyone because the colour cartridge finish just 30-40 prints and cartridge is cost is very high around 1200 rupees. They mentioned this for office and home printer but really it is not useful even at home. For monochrome print it is ok no issue with that. I purchased this printer in june and starting of july its ink light start glowing hardly i take colour print but I guess i took around less than 30 colour prints and ink has been finished. Really find a bad quality of this printer. Print quality is fine but Nobody going to pay every month 1200 rupees
3,It's just ok kind of printer.. Colors print out quality is very worst. Printer setup may not be successful for the first time. You may have to redo the setup. I was using HP printer earlier. I feel like HP printer is more user friendly and better quality than cannon. You cannot close the tray along with remaining paper.. but in HP printer it is possible.
1,"Don't buy it. First time I was able to connect through wifi and able to print from my android phones. After two days when I try to print second time, phone is not able to find the printer on the NW. Tried to install drivers on Windows 10. And their user interface is of 90s and waiting for 30 mins to download and install drivers it can't find the printer on the NetWork. Atlast tried connecting physically through USB cable provided by Canon along with printer. Even USB driver not able to find the printer. I spent literally 3hrs to print 1 page but couldn't print. Thanks to Amazon, they accepted return."
5,"Hi ALl,so in the market, many printers are available and your goal is you want maximum B&W print then it is a good choice.if your students or businessman and you need avg 1800 to 2000 ping in the month then it is the right product.The price of cartage was expensive but you calculate then it is around 1.2 to 1.5 INR per page."
4,"ProsPrinting quality is good, Color as well as black and white. Plastic Material is good quality and shiny.Good printer in this range and for home use.Duplex printing is good feature provided.Printed 50 prints so far.App based printing is good.ConsPrinting is bit slow but manageable for home printing.Setup is bit difficult and steps are not proper.WiFi setup is unpredictable it was not connecting for 1 hour but once connected it’s working now, WiFi connection steps are bit tricky.Power supply printer socket could have been better."
1,"Horrible service from canon,  bought the machine on September , machine started giving trouble from3rd month, December; booked complaint on 2ndJanuary; two service agent came to inspect the machine, and assured replacement within a week, now on 16 th Jan after two calls service center is  saying we need to patiently wait for 15/20 days for the replacement. Never expected such horrible service from an multinational brand like canon."
1,"The machine failed to connect to wifi.  The tech support tried to guide me, but that did not yield any result.  The support engineer is supposed to have come within 8 working hours after the online tech support couldn’t solve the problem.  Even after 48 hours the engineer did not show up!My experience is very bad with this product.  I wouldn’t recommend this to anybody."
1,Very difficult to setup. I had bought a canon printer previously which was really good and easy to setup. I think Canon has changed their setting up process for new printer installation. This is a nightmare. Expected better from Canon
5,"Being a genuine HP printer user from school days till the day, I used this product of Canon. Just like the company base in Japan, the product is ultra – sleek in multi – features and quite user friendly. The driver caused some problems but was instantly solved by online up – gradation. In very precise, a product worth of purchase and checked all functions properly. The best part is the jamming portion easiness which is best but HP is quite tedious.Lastly, amazon rocked with the delivery and package with timed dispatching of product."
1,"I have installed the software for the machine and tried to take a test print out.  Unfortunately, the A4 size paper is not fed properly on the machine.  It gets stuck in a middle way.  Thinking it may be the fault of the paper I feed, I purchased and tried a new set of A4 papers.  That too got stuck in a middle way.  Please make it convenient to rectify the defects of the machine."
1,"One of the worst decisions I have taken in recent times. This printer just doesnt connect on wifi automatically. If its in mood, it may connect once and give u a print but then it will forget the settings next time and you will end up reconfiguring it again and again. In last 2-3 weeks, i have done it 7-8 times now but it just doesnt remember the settings. And every setup takes 30-40 minutes. So if you are using it at home where you will take 1-2 prints every now and then, you will end up wasting 45 min if you want to do it thru wifi. Now, i have simply resorted to connecting to laptop and finishing it in 2-3 min."
3,Look wise this is gud .... but that’s not why we buy it right ! Print quality is ok...nothing great ! Wifi doesn’t work with iOS nor with android phone ...tht part of this printer is useless !! Don’t buy it looking at the colour n look of the printer . Better options r available .
2,"Do not opt for this.. home use buy at INR 6000.. but all set of problems.. be it printer/ detecting paper/ paper tray/ errors.. unending list of problems.. don't expect it from a premium brand.. if you don't have a decent service network, at least have all the solutions available online for troubleshooting"
2,"Delivered seal opened product, these days I am seeing these type issues with amazon"
4,Overall it was an easy self installation and the print quality and print speed is as expected and solve the purpose for home use. The WiFi direct setup was done easily and prints well but the setup for WIFi with router is documented as simple 2 lines step but somehow is not working properly and need some better detailing.HP certainly wins my bet ahead of Epson and Canon after all my initial research.
5,Recently bought hp smart tank 516 printer. Built quality is quite good. You get very simple instruction manual very easy to follow. Filling the ink tanks to printing was very easy. After downloading the application n connecting with printer via wifi was quite good. Took some document prints as well as photo print on photo paper. Both were good. So far impressive. Need to see how much print can be taken with the given ink.
1,Multiple follow up for installation but there is no sucess.The technician assigned is super busy and never call you back. I  afraid how can they support when there is an issue in the printer.. Poor support
5,Awesome. Worth the money
5,nice quality
1,"Very difficult to install WiFiStruggling , there is hardly anything in the manual"

3,Printing problem..  see attached photograph of  print out.....I have checked with new cartridge it is working fine...
5,Hp 1005 printer quality really good and easy use and maintainI have purchased with discount 15499
5,ProsSuper print quality.Low mainatanance.Hp and canon both companies invented this technology. Having patent for this technoloty thats y other companies cont reach dis quality of printing.Can be insert canon or hp catridge 12a.ConsNo ADF (Automatic document feeder)No two side printing - but by reinserting papers in reverse order we can print 2side.Slow printing.Per minute 14 papers.

1,my hp printer is dead now which is deliver on 17-08-2018 . what do i do now. please call me
2,After 800 Page printed using last 3 months now showing big line on the pages of middle
1,Never buy a product from Amazon. First they sell defective product without any sort of quality test and to add salt to injury force you to go through customer support for the so called brand new product! Go the old school way of purchasing from local brick and mortar shops. Good for the economy too.
5,Good working very eye use
5,It’s a proven printer . It’s basically for commercial use so no body should have any doubt on performance . In Fortis Noida this model is used on every desk which speaks of its quality . Fantastic product for B&W quick printouts .
1,Amazon sale China product so many call to HP help line not responding so my advice to buying visit Near HP store and buy
2,"The printer prints well, and lives up to its reputation on that front. However, the scanner does not work with a Mac (at least for the new ones). I could not find drivers for the scanner online, so called the HP Support. After wasting a lot of time, taking my purchase details, serial number etc., they told me they did not have drivers for Mac. What do you do with a printer costing this much, and which is so popular (Amazon's Choice #1) if you have to scan using another printer, which is precisely what I have to do?"
4,"Product is good, print is good. Only drawback is Screen on printer is too small and don't have backlit so it is  not easy to read. Scanner don't have dedicated software. I have another HP deskjet printer which has a good software for scanning"
1,"Pure china product, no quality at all.not worth for moneyThe product is not working and also customer care is helpless. I think it is HP's replica product from china. FAKEEEEEE"
5,The printer is one of the most famous and affordable printer ever introduced by HP. It's a good investment considering the price and utility you are going to derive from it. Ink can be refilled easily. Toner is commonly available at all the regular stores. It's cost effective and print quality is also good. Speed is not great but not that slow to complain about! Scanning is very slow and didn't find it much effective. You also cannot scan legal size papers so please bear this in mind.
3,"Everything is great as mentioned by other reviewers. One BIG issue, it doesn't have driver support for Mac OSX so unable to use scanner feature. Printing works fine. I would not have bought it had I known this earlier. Not recommended for Mac users."
4,"The only thing I don't like about this HP MF Laser Printer is its high price.  Otherwise it is excellent for my requirements connected with print, scan and copy.  Easy to operate is another excellent thing about this machine.One drawback I recently faced is that sometimes scanning wont't work.  I have to switch off my system and printer from electric connection and start fresh again.  When I do like this it works."
5,"It is good quality printer, I am using this printer for last 3 years in my office also. In office we use it roughly. Now I purchase it for my home @ Rs.14499/-"
3,Price is high in jan 2015 the same product I purchased in 10840/- rs without any offer and now this product rate is 17400/- rs.Other then that every thing is good.
1,"Waste product, scanner is jammed. Bought just a week back in prime Day sale. Was not expecting this from Amazon. Now should go through all hassles like connecting with manufacturer and stuffs. Even return window is closed with in a week. I would not buy anything from Amazon again."
5,"Got delivered within 12 hours of placing the order,that too in lockdown situation.The product is as usual AUTHENTIC  and  the printer has print,scan & xerox in black inkThis product is cost effective and hardy for heavy office use and is indeed value for moneyThank you seller for Authentic product and thank you Amazon for quickest delivery"
4,"Cannot comment on durability as its still new. i bought the product based on the reviews, assume its good. with everything wifi these days not having wifi is a problem for me. I thought i could have paid more and got a wifi enabled one as well as the dual side printing, which is very tedious if you have to do it few times. Drive installation is a challenge with HP website popping up quite a few windows to get the installation right.. Scanning is a separate software which comes with the HP pack itself."
4,"I have purchased this as shown discount on HDFC credit card rs 1000, and 1750rs on credit Card EMI discount, but I found originally rs 1000 discount on Credit card, Bcoz, they charged 199rs processing fee, +18% GST and 1.25% interest + GST on that also, over all about rs 750.So got rs 1000 discount only.About the product is very good, but for delivery I have to call many time, and the courier person refuse to deliver the product, I have to complain and got the product next day, while I am a Prime member, but here also found no benefit of Prime membership. so I have given 4 star, not for product due to service.Product deserves 5 star."
2,Cartridge not working. It's look like a old catridge. Just I did the 50pages catridge drum was spoiled..totally disapoointed. This much cost not satisfied with this catridge .. look like old catridge
4,"This is an excellent printer worth the money, great build quality does the job absolutely well but I realized within a day it is almost impossible to get the scanner working as I am a MacBook user. There seems to be no driver available, HP easy scan, Apple Image Capture none of them recognizes the scanner. I am returning this product with great disappointment but the product is absolutely bang for the bucks."
1,After some days print quality is low and take print one side black
3,Good
1,Please don't waste money on buying this model..I am getting an error code while printing.To solve this I contacted HP help care but delay in services..
5,"Easy to install , robust build , you can repair it not need to change the printer if something goes wrong as previously I bought a Ricoh printer at 6k and after a year I had to bought this beast. Please go on buying without thinking if u need it."
5,"This is purchased for my brother. He is start  the new shop ,he need to Xerox , print and scan for customer requirement. It's installed easy and use easily. Print quality also amazing . This product also taken less area compare to Xerox machine. My brother also happy for this multiple function printer."
4,"I feel reget when i know that there is no warranty card inside box of this printer item. As a result of this ,i will be experience when the printer is facing problem.  I was placed the order along with waranty card cost and payment also made.So, if there is possible way ,pliz send me warranty card ."
5,"The product remains best for lady 3 years. I have two machines. Both work fine. Only drawback I observed was if you give more than 10 copies, it stops almost 10 between pages."
5,"Unless you know how to install and set it up, it can give you nightmares.Once installed, it works like a piece of cake.Use the universal printer driver from HP for best results.(windows only)"
3,Needed local guy to install. Company guy don't turn up. So better buy locally
5,Yes
5,"Easy to use..Easy to refilling cartridge..Print quality is best.With compact body and weight less, helpful for portability.Thank you amazon for fast delivery and safe delivery and for offers.. On sbi."
5,"Don’t buy xerox machine, buy this printer , This is an amazing printer with copyr , i am using in my school as i am a school owner n from last 6 month not a single issue with this printer. we use to print 1000 of qus paper every week ."
1,Duplicate don't work
5,Excellent
5,Good product
5,excellent product... thank you amazon..
5,verry good
5,Good product
5,Good product
5,Satisfied with the working of this model. It has a good battery life and recharges pretty quick. Nice and clear printing quality. I've been using it with USB cable but Bluetooth connectivity is also working. I'd surely recommend this purchase.
5,"Speed, Print quality, Efficiency which i was looking 4 nd fortunately I got this printer. Its value 4 money, cost effective, fast, easy to setup and can be used directly through smartphone without any hustle 👍And the paper tray is one of the best feature of this model which provides Efficiency and time saving where we can store 150 pages at a single go. After reviewing side by side to various other models of different brand, finally purchased it 🙌👍 Happy with the prod and most importantly its a new model launched in d 2nd half of the 20k so 👌  😀  this is d plus point too. Instead of purchasing any old model of 2019 or 18Just go 4 it.."
4,"Works well. May not be as bright as a hp ink jet. No issues. Takes a while to get used to. Online videos are helpful. Looks like online availability of genuine ink is a problem.  Brother does provide local city contacts to buy genuine ink. And it’s available at discount. Print speed is fast. It does not have duplex printing. USB and WiFi printing works well. Overall very satisfied. 1st ink tank purchase after reviewing hp, canon, Eason. This had the least concerns. My previous hp inkjet ink is no longer in stock. So hp was last choice for a new printer."
5,"Received the product on time. The printer seems to be decent for the price. The colour prints on this printer also seems to be good, but not excellent, overall the printer does it's job fairly without any problems. Go for this printer if you want a compact printer with all features and plus it's wireless as well, I would suggest everyone to go for this rather than going for hp,Canon or Epson. This brand seems to be new in India but is definitely worth every penny spent."
1,It barely prints from secondry trey. You will have to pull and push primary trey so many times. Very bad experience.
4,"1) Not compatible with Mac OS, you will have to use Brother iPrint&Scan app for wireless print.2) you can only print PDF format through IPrint&Scan app in MAC.Mac user should avoid and purchase DCP-T510W which has apple airprint.Windows users go for it, great product!"
5,"It took me 2 weeks to carefully analyze every printer. Then ended up with this one.It is a new model. I bought it for 12300. It it is 300rs less. Just grab it as soon as you can.It is worth it.Once you buy it, carefully read their guide manual of 6 steps. I missed 1 step in the beginning and struggled but now it is very easy to use. Even a kid can monitor it.Let me know if anyone has any doubt."
2,"Update After using 3 months:Prints fast (b/w) color printing is great. Can print using wi-fi. but the color prints on photo paper seems to be fading quite badly over time. Making this unusable. I have tried 3-4 different brands. I do not know where the issue is.Reduced rating to 2.. as I can get a much cheaper laser printer for b/w prints. Attached images are without any filters. The browns were blacks when printed.Below is my original review:This is the best printer I have bought in recent times. Prints quite fast and cheap (going by numbers, haven't used a complete ink set yet). Wireless from any device.Special mention: Borderless printing. Try printing on a photo paper (with borderless setting) and you will get amazing pictures printed at home. Attached image is on A4 sheet. Loved it."
5,"Ordered this printer after a lot of comparisons with other printers in similar range.My requirement was to have wireless printing for enabling through multiple devices. I was trying to order DCP-T520W which has few more features than this (extra RAM, LCD display, copy zoom in/out) but it was not available at that time so I went for this. You can compare both at Brothers website as well. If you donot need those extra features then no need to spend extra 1000 rs.Print quality is good. The quality depends a lot on paper quality too, so if you have to print a color intensive page then use high quality paper.Scan resolution is better than other machines in the same range.I had issue with WIFI setup. The device was going to sleep (disconnected) after 5 minutes and was hard for mobile/laptop to discover the device. But I upgraded the printer firmware and the router firmware and now working like a charm.The manual feed is also working as required. If there is paper in manual feed then it will be used first, then from tray. There is no need to remove the tray (as mentioned in some other review) for printing on manual feed."
5,"the printer released in nov 2020proshas the latest tech like speedpaper tray  can take even legal size papersmanual feed for 1 paper auto head cleaning when connected to a power source. i feel the auto head clean is a great feature for an intank printer to ensure the printer head remains clean. my last printer Epson L 210 did not have the feature resulting in few clogged nozzles of the printer head with no repairs but change of printer head for rs 4500/In this printer manual duplex is easy. You can set the paper tray to legal and easily reinsert  A4 sheets for duplex printing.you can  use the manual feed too.ConsBrother is not so popular brand as yet in India as compared to Epson , canon, HPVerdictGo for it if for all your needs. The best All in one printer available today"
1,"Inaccurate description of this product from the seller. A trusted seller should be more careful. I buy a lot of stuff from this seller. But the first time this has been a problem. Trusting their description that the device supports iOS and MacOS products, I got this printer. It did not work with Apple products. When I found out from the website of the manufacturing company that it doesn’t have any drivers for Apple products and that I have to use an app which will just print pdf and pictures that too only via AirPrint, I tried to return the product as it was useless for me since I use only Apple products. So this expensive printer is just a waste of money for me. Did not expect this from this premium seller."
4,"I purchased this printer recently after a lot of research. And I am satisfied with my purchase.Pros: quality of photos are excellent. Wi-Fi is working although not smoothly, and you can connect with multiple devices. But all of them should be using the same Wi-Fi. I was initially printing on 70 GSM A4 papers all my color photos, and they were looking good. But when I used glossy A4 they were mind-blowing. Customer support is also good. I struggled to make Wi-Fi work, but the support person helped, and now I can do it myself. You can use 270 GSM paper. According to this product specification it can take up to 300 GSM papers.Cons: 1. Connecting with Wi-Fi is sometime big issue. I have restart printer to connect.2. Extremely slow. Full size color photos with the highest quality setting are taking more than 10 minutes sometime. Even 5*7 photo paper is taking 5 minutes.3. During printing if there is an error it just stops working unless you restart.Overall for home use this is fine. But if you want to use it for many pages on a daily basis, I don't think this will be sufficient."
5,"Very nice product with fast delivery within 2 days, thank you Amazon.Affordable price Rs.11999 with great featuresI will not write any pros or consPrinting quality is awesome whether be or colour , normal or photo paper.I am suggesting to everyone specially to students,home user, small office userIt is good for themBecause don't waste your money for auto duplex printingYes I agree sometimes need of add but it is also helpfulI did 700pages prints in one day in both sideOn wifiDid Xerox,scan everythingGo for it and save money"
5,"Awesome product, fully satisfied good quality, received in 4 days only."
5,"I have received it yesterday in original packaging and no extra packaging from the seller but received the product in good condition.The printer looks good, easy to install and wifi connectivity is good.But the cost per page is yet to be seen and I think one should go for this printer.It is good deal if you have to do home job printing."
4,Looked at many brands and finally settled on Brother after doing a bit of web research. Print quality is fairly good. I had a HP cartridge based printer and colors are not as bright as a cartridge based printer. This has a manual software based duplex printing option which is fairly useful when you get used to it and you have large documents to print. The scanner is good. But what has been a bit of disappointment for me is the print/scanning desktop application. This is not well designed. The scanning software does not allow inline editing for scanned input ..this is particularly annoying when you cannot crop or adjust brightness of multi page PDF documents. Print speed is good for B/W pages.
2,Extremely difficult to setup. Seems like an obsolete model. I still haven't been able to set it up on my Mac on a preferred old 10.11 osx. Got it working through a third party morpia Android app but not on my Mac. Please share driver for mac 10.11. And on latest mac osx I still have not been able to print from ms word etc. I have to use the broter application. Frustrating.
5,"Pros:1. Compact and ergonomic.2. Paper tray box (protects dust and moisture) which no other brand offers.3. Remove jam paper very easily than other ink tank printers.4. Printing speed is fast and vibrant. 80 gsm paper recommended to avoid paper jam.5. Consumes only 11 Watt electricity in use so you can easily operate it on inverter in case of no electricity.6. Wireless setup and printing is very easy.7. Best built quality. Weights 6.4 Kg much heavier than HP, Canon and Epson Ink tank printers.Cons:1.  No spill-free refill system."
5,"I have been using this Printer for the last one month and would really recommend it to others. I have got it connected to my phone as well as my Macbook Air and to be very honest, not only the installation was easy but also it prints wirelessly without any hassle. Never have I faced any paper jam issues either ...In one word its just Amazing!!Just note for Mac users the right driver has to be downloaded & installed properly else the wireless printing might not function seamlessly."
5,Worth money spent
5,Good product go for it if auto duplex is not an issue.Printer will not get jam even if you don't print for a month.That too in cold in North India.So yes good.Clean and fast printing.Ibrother app is good.Can be paired with many devices.My printer remains switched on 24/7
2,"This is likely a good printer. But, if you use a Mac Book or any other Apple product the setup is cumbersome and inefficient. The Brother website does not offer proper drivers and the iprint and scan app is dysfunctional with limited options and at best is a crippled app. Do not buy if you are an Apple user!"
4,The product came well packed. The installation is very easy. Took black and white as well as colour printouts were good with proper clarity and no smudges
5,An excellent product for this price range.I tried printing in color with both photo sheet and  normal paper. Print quality is great. I'm very much satisfied for home use. It will be helpful for small office as well. No second thought go for it.Only instruction missing is after installing all necessary drivers press and hold green button for 3 secs to start print.
5,This printer is very very good as compare to other. So buy it now. I am happy for buy this 420w printer. I purchased this printer for my son.
5,"Nice Printer.Easy to use. Easily setup with home wifi router and working wirelessly from day one without any problem or lag.Speed of print out is not as written in the specifications, may I have missed any setting.Brother I-print application is good but only crop function is available for photos. No editing features is available i.e. to increase contrast, sharpness etc.Overall quality is good. Enjoying the print out. Easily controlled by mobile application."
5,It is easy to setup and live to its features flawlessly. The usage is very easy and the manual and cd is easy to follow and guide you well and you are ready to start in minutes.Have been using it from more than a week.May update here later to keep you posted.Thanks. I 💯 recommend you. Worth your bucks and Brother is a reputed brand since many many years.
5,"Good quality printer , print quality is very good, used for a fortnight still it's too early for a review. My initial experience is overall good only lagging is that it should have a lcd display for easy operation."
4,4star so far!! will check after 2 mnths again :) installation is bit time taking!
5,Amazon has done a great job in delivery and service.  Very good product in appearance.  One day has passed.  Can't give a review yet in Experience for Purchases.
4,"There is no compromise with print quality but function of this printer is very hard to handle because of no screen on the hardware,Rest things are ok."
3,Plz  installation purpose Plz do user friendly  registration  through ur customer care services for ur technicians booking to do demo & installation.It's very difficult to upload the all the data &  billcopy etc for registration.
1,Does not support MAC OS
4,Good one easy to install. Took a while though but was easy to follow instructions. No digital screen on printer which is a little inconvenient have to look at the light blinking pattern to understand the problems.
5,"Excellent print quality, scan and copy features with wifi enable printer"
5,It's Durability is too good.No need to daily maintenance.Automatic paper tre system is good enovation in it.
1,Received prominently used item with empty ink bottles.. Box and product damaged...
5,"Product quality, print quality and easy interface make this printer a totally complete printer and this model is perfect for home use.  I just love this product."
1,"The first printer delivered was defective so, a replacement was sent.The second printer was good, worked for 2  days and later it started printing blank pages. No, idea what happened. I called Amazon support, printer has been returned."
5,Whaooo printer value for the money ...go for it you never be disappointed
5,Nice product
5,"I love this printer. This is the 316 All in one. It doesnot have wifi,so it's not a wireless printer. But the best part is that you can buy a small connector OTG for connecting your android phone with this printer, download the HP Print Service Plugin app on your phone and get to printing directly from the phone. The print quality is good. The print outs don't come out at the same speed as they come out of a laserjet black and white printer ( i also have a Ricoh black and white printer/scanner/copier). One coloured print out takes almost 40-50 seconds. It's small in size and the coloured bottles come along with the printer. The 310,316,319 series is a series of non wireless printers with not much difference in their functions but instead difference in the amount of colour bottles given with them. The 410 series is truly wireless and you can buy those only if you have much use of a coloured printer daily and you want to invest over 10000 bucks. You need to take a printout once or twice every week for the printer ink to not dry. I have been using this for almost a month now and it has been working wonderfully. The only thing i have been not been able to resolve is that i can print not directly from my Gallery of phone but i have to use Google Photos app to get the print option. I got this for 8100 rs in prime day sale so it's totally worth it.. delivery was smooth and fast and the printer was received in very fine condition. Good job Amazon.Edit after 2 months of use: The printer started showing paparr jam error. We followed the instructions on the HP page to resolve the problem but there wasn't any paper jam anywhere. Called the customer care number after sign in with the email id and they promptly sent an engineer to resolve the issue.( In actual the cartridge was jammed.) He told us the paper roller is not working,placed an order immediately and within 2 days the new part was put in the printer, with the printer working properly again. So full marks to hp for their customer service, although I didn't expect the printer to develop a snag when we have been using it very carefully."
4,Installation is quite tough. The software and driver's not available online for this printer and when I connect through HP Easy Start it detects HP ink tank 310 instead of 316. No proper instructions given in user manual not clear pictures to remove dummy print head and how to insert color/black print head.. otherwise it's good products..print quality is not up to mark but that's ok for this price..
4,Verry verry good product.Cheap in the best.
1,"This is worst product i ever purchased from hp.First of all my old ink adavantage 3545 cartridge based inkjet printer prints much superior quality than this and with faster speed this printer prints 50 pages in 90 minutes.Ans also company claim of 4000 black, 6000 color pages goes wrong i have printed 1500 pages and black ink got depleted whereas color ink got half. (was printing a book only)Duplex printing is a joke. When u trying to do so, started with ok but later random pages printing."
4,"Good printer for document only , not for photo page, you can also take print from mobile through OTG cable , I already tested with android device using type C OTG cable"
3,"Previously used canon ink tank printer, which was far better than hp in colour production,not satisfied with scanning quality also, feeling bad for not opting canon again.Yhink twice if can't compromise the printing quality"
3,"Really difficult installation process and no one helps. Sent many messages for HP, emails and phone call. But no one helped and I actually had to do it myself."
4,"I really liked using the HP printer printer. I bought the printer for 8499 rupees.And this model of HP is the new model.And the black ink bottle that is given here has ink here 170ml which is what other HP printers have 135ml I am getting a big benefit here I am getting 170ml bottle here.And with that I got two little books. It was nice to use, but it would be better to use it for the house.E-print is a picture that takes a little longer to print very well but the picture is very good. I printed my family album in this HP printer and it is printing very well with  inkjet photo paper paper. But one complaint I will make here is that HP Ray is commenting that our color ink can be printed in 8000 and black and white can be printed in 7500. I think this is a complete lie. It is impossible.Another thing I don't like though is that or this problem is with every printer. If I don't print for several days then the print heads get jammed. That's a big problem. I think the company should fix something.............. have used this printer for 20 days and I have shared with you as much as I can find out about this printer using these twenty days. Thank you."
5,"I am writing the review after using it for a month.PROS:Reasonable CostEasy to use - I tried by connecting to the system via USB and connected to mobile via OTG cable. Both are working fine. I am using third-party software when connected via OTG and all is good.Black & White print is good. Clear, crisp print without any markings.The color print in A4 size paper is really good.Color Photos using 200 GSM 4*6 are good, but not as effective as photo studio print. The color is touching the hand when I selected the best quality, but the photos are looking good.Left unused for 15 days and the printer worked without any hassle.CONS:Unable to get a printer cover, but didn't find any so far.When connected via an OTG cable, HP software is not working.Need to place the printer in a proper place as the color tank is attached as an extension to the printer.If you can spend some more money then go for the WIFI model so that you can do print from anywhere.This printer is not having Auto Duplex printing so need to do it manually page by page."
1,"i bought the printer two months ago & it stopped working all of a sudden. I have raised case with HP, however there is zero response from the HP. every time i call support center they says i will get a call within 24-48 hrs, and guess what.. u never get the response from them. I 'm regretting, so dont want you guys to fall on the trap. HP has worst after sale support, pls go for canon or other vendor."
3,"After a month's use, I feel it was a wrong decision to buy this printer. Print quality is okay but it is really a bad choice for duplex printing. It is nearly impossible to reinsert pages back for reverse side printing as if paper tray is locked! Also, need different type of wifi router to possibly connect it over LAN so lack of wifi is a definite minus."
5,"Sorry to add this review after a week but this is a must buy product.I love the printing quality of this printer.I have received my printer in just 4 days. Packing of the product is same as you buy from a shop it includes everything, Wire, ink bottles , instruction manual. Although the colour ink bottles will fill your tank only once and If you fill full ink tank then bottle will get empty in one go but black ink bottle is bigger then coloured ones so you can fill your tank twice. Installation is also easy you can watch the installation on youtube videos.All an all i love the product."
1,Worst printing experience. 1 out of 15 papers get stuck inside the printer and we have to open the printer to find torn paper. Don't waste money buying this printer. HP support is complete waste of time and they don't give you any resolution. Stay away from this printer at all cost.
5,Pros:  Cheaper than other 310 series printer  Good print  Delivery was fast with in 3 daysCons :  Made in CHINA  No wifi
1,"Seriously, I don't know but it broke before completing it's first month. And Costumer service was very poor from the service center. I had to pay for the parts. When the product has broken down in first month of purchase."
5,I was looking for a good ink tank printer below 10k and found this for an offer for ₹9500. It is a very useful all in one pinter for home use. why not for office because the printing speed is low but in this price it is lit🔥
5,"used it for 1 month now. No compliant till today. Since it’s ink tank, you can use as much as you can at very economical price per print. Print quality is good for day to day color and black and white print. Photo print is okay."
1,No installation support by HP
4,Reason for only 4 stars is this printer isnt plug and play for windows 10...Need to install drivers which is slightly a hectic job when all rest of the companies provide plug and play drivers
5,Very good all in one. Got in the sale at 9499 less cashback. Colour and bw prints are very good. Scan takes sometime but result is very good. Can buy for home use.
1,Rcvd a broken printer. Its ink tank is attached awkwardly. It was broken during transportation.
4,Installation & Demo service is not available for HP 316 ink tank. Print quality is good but not excellent. But it is fine considering price of the model.
1,Scanner in product is worse
5,"Able to setup with in an hour, using the manual provided. Using it for a week now, and so far the experience is good and printing experience is smooth. Guess, ideal for home use. The delivery was very prompt."
4,Good budget printer for home purposes.
5,Best printer.you can see my review on YouTube
1,will never deal with Hp one of my worse experience after buying printer.please urge people not to go for HP
4,Excellent printing
1,Don't purchase this printer...1st of all very slow then sometimes it just forget about the pending prints. Then you have to restart & again commend the print for your requirements.
4,Printer is good. Mobile printing via USB is too slow like a snail. Colour print quality is average.
5,Good product.
5,Quality and cost is good.. only wifi printing is misses out..
5,Print Quality is very good.....
4,VALUE FOR MONEY.... I THINK IT IS BETTER THAT EPSON INKTANK PRINTERS  COZ IT  IS MOST CHEAPER ITS HEAD IS ALSO BETTER AND AVAILABLE AT LOWER PRICE THAN EPPSON
2,Printer is good but what lake is otg printing. Nowdays who owns pc but everyone has mobile and latest update. HP should work on it.
3,Paper stuck during printing. Speed is slow. Cost is ok
1,Not at all happy with quality of the printer Please refund the money
3,Proper manual not given
4,Good printing quality but slow but worth buying
4,"Print Quality is Good, we can Print Passport Photos,4×6 Photos, Documents etc... And finally Printer is Excellent👍"
3,I am writhing this review after using it a month. I purchased it for Rs. 8999.Pros:-1. Fast printing2. DuplexCons1. High printing cost2. 1 cartridge yield maximum 1500 pages only3. MonochroSince if you want very fast printing and duplex then go with it. But cost for this you have to pay approximately Rs 2.5 per page.And if time is not your concern then go with epson printer in the same price segment you will get all in one printer (print+copy+scan) and page yield is about 7000 page for colour and 6000 page of black. And even one refill cost around Rs.400.I am using both printer thats why I am able to compare both.
1,"I received this printer on 14 July 2019. After installing as guided i connected the printer it got switched on and immediately the fuse gone and trip off in main board. I called the amazon customer care. He advised to change the switch board. When changed it switched on again. Whenever the printer is plugged to switch, the main board gets trip off. Since the power connections are good and is three phase it is getting trip, otherwise there would have been electrical fire which is life threatening to family members. I called the amazon technical team again on 22 July 2019 and spoke to Mr.Vidhya (which is recorded by me). After putting me on hold for four times and extended the call for 30 minutes, he said he has applied for replacement and i will get the message shortly. Even after 24 hours I have not received any message. Today (23 July 2019) when I called for three times I am not at all connected to technical person. May be instead of applying replacement my number would be blacklisted. Once the product is received by us i don't think we will get a replacement. Is there anyone who got their electronic item replaced by Amazon. Please think twice before buying this product through online. Now the replacement date is also gone."
5,"I got this one at ₹ 6850 , which was great in worth for these type of printer ..."
5,"Since last several years I had been suffering a color printer. And since I don't use much, the color cartridges used to stale. All color printers have 4 cartridges and in old color printer, if one cartridge goes faulty, the printer stops. This is crazy. Besides, one color cartridge costs approx Rs. 1500. Multiply this by 4 and its Rs. 6000, just for the cartridges alone. And I never used color cartridge much. but I had to buy it because without it, the Black cartridge won't work. It was an expensive affair.Then I finally decided that enough is enough. I need a printer which is for home use, minimal use, and the cartridge should survive some long period of hibernation. And since I had burned my fingers with an expensive, famous, high end printer, I was looking for a printer with a reasonable budget, preferably below Rs. 10,000.The Brother printer is truly doing good. No hassles. And no paper jams as yet. It's very easy to install. There are youtube videos on how to assemble it. I could do it in less than 5 mins. And the best thing is, you power the printer, and insert usb in laptop/computer and goto printer settings, and when you add printer, the driver of the printer self-installs. I have also ordered ""Apple Leaders Printer Dust Cover for Brother HL-L2321D"". You see I have Brotherly feelings already towards this new possession."
5,"This is an efficient and reliable single function monochrome printer! I was looking for a good laser duplex printer. After a lot of search, I found this printer to be the most appropriate. In fact, I wanted to get a colour laser printer but found them to be very expensive and unnecessary as colour prints are rarely needed. The toner costs are astronomical! If a single original black toner cartridge costs half the cost of this printer, imagine the cost of coloured toners! Besides the initial cost of a laser colour printer is outrageously high. So unless you really need one, don’t waste your time looking for one. Inkjet colour printers are cheaper so you can opt for them. But be advised that they aren’t easy to maintain. Unlike inkjet printers, ink leaks won't occur even if the laser printer isn’t used for a long time.Setting up this printer was very easy and I had it running in minutes. Duplex printing is fantastic. It saves paper, time and energy. The paper tray stacks 250 papers neatly within the printer. Always use dual print compatible papers to avoid causing paper jams or poor quality prints. The toner (TN-2365) that comes with the printer has a stated capacity of 2,600 pages. But eventually the number will be close to 1,500 pages. If you use the toner saver mode then it may reach 2,000 pages. Additionally, the drum (DR-2365) which houses the toner will also have to be replaced after every 12,000 prints. The print speed is impressive. It can print 30 (A4) or 32 (Legal) pages in a minute. I have printed 750 pages at once all under 30 minutes. I haven’t had a single paper jam or any other issue while doing it and in all the 6 months use. This implies reliability.Compatible refills and cartridges are easily available for this model and costs a fraction of what an original toner cartridge (costs Rs. 3,000) would! Compatibles will affect the print quality to an extent and depending on their quality and how the cartridge is refilled, it may cause leaks within the printer. Therefore care should be taken regarding this. Do note that compatibles will void the printer’s warranty. So it would be better to go for compatibles after the warranty period. Being compact, it occupies less space. It comes in a two tone appearance (Black and Grey) and doesn't have wireless printing. The similar all black colour"
5,Print quality is supper.....Its easy to install......It's also a user friendly printer.....It will print only when the command is given from a computer...It will not support mobile printing....
5,"Purchased this superb printer in Diwali sale and got 10% off on price of 7499/- i.e at 674 effective price.. Today on Diwali, got it delivered..I must tell that I was and to some extent sceptical and scared that how will such a low cost printer handle duplex printing over the years.. Let's see..Initial thoughts :1. Installation was a breeze.. All the things were guided nicely by the guide papers, paper cut-out indicators etc.2. Print quality is awesome.. Printed around 500 pages as soon as I got hands over it..3. Single side print speed is around 30 ppm as advertised.. It litterally throws paper like bullets, such excellent sppeds..4. Double side print speed is on a little lower side at around 8 sec per print i.e around 7.5 ppm..5. All error handling lights and LEDs are very user friendly as well as status monitor (for Windows) is nice and concise way of seeing what printer is doing now..6. Build quality is as per the best printers in market.. no cheap material whatsoever at any part of the body.. (By looks, it looks like a 17k - 20k printer..More updates when I use it more.. ( I've at least 10k pages to print ASAP, that would test the printer and toner/drum extensively..😉"
1,1 Star for providing wrong info4 star for print qualityPrint quality is best but pls consider the following information1. U have mentioned that this printer contains 2600 pages inbox toner. But it failed to print even 1000 (includes back to back) pages. Til the replacement of new toner it wont works.2. Pls provide the correct information. If its potential is to print 1000 pages pls mention the same info. Providing of Wrong information may lead to loss reputation and sometimes would also leads to face the legal actions.Hence provide the guinuine info. As u advertise.Thank u
5,I have purchase this printer in May 2019 its more than 2 months and is working perfectly.No issue aroused so far.You can refill its cartridge by yourself or get it refilled in market which will cost around ₹300-400 which is 8 times cheaper than the new brother cartridge and print quality is almost same.It is a duplex printer i.e. prints simultaneously on both sides of paper. The print speed is highly satisfying.I have printed 550 pages at one go without any page stuck.The no. Of pages that can be printed in 1 cartridge depends on what you print i.e. printing text only will allow you to print around 1500-1600 pages (this is just an approx. idea as i have not counted the no. Of pages printed)if you print pages with images you will end up your cartridge with less no.  of printed pages.It also depends on whether you turned on toner saver mode or not.Also dont forget to turn on duplex mode before printing.I will update this review after some time when my cartridge will be finished and will let to know the no. Of pages it prints in 1 full cartridge.Hope it will help you.
1,"I am facing paper jam with this printer in the 2nd print itself from the date of purchase. Had registered the complain but no action is being taken. Wastege of time and money in total, would not recommend anyone to purchase it."
4,"Ordered Friday, received Monday, so amazing delivery right off the bat.Print quality is crisp and clear.I print a lot of documents and books hence the auto duplex. But when I gave an auto duplex print, it only printed half a page on one of the sides. Bummer!Called customer care. Very responsive. I was personally attended to the very next day and when I gave a print, the duplex worked just fine! Isn't that how it always goes?Pros:Cost, Print Quality, Customer CareCons:Expensive original cartridge, Single functionAll in all, when it comes to low end laser printers, this seems like a winner. I'll update my review after a couple of months or if I encounter any trouble."
3,I brought this in 8500 rs . At  this is  price this is the best .But I would suggest Invest some more . And you will get Inktank printer aroung 10k Which are much better than laser .printing cost is less in ink tank .Also you can get colour and other features like scan .The Toner refuling is headache for laser printer . and after 10000 print you have to replace the cartage . which costs around 2000 .But in inktank there is no headache . Easy to refiil .
5,At this price range Duplex printer means you put some 300 odd sheets and forget and give print command and it prints both front and back in a jiffy.I even printed my Study materials  PDF in a jiffy.Just combine all those study material pdf  and press print and rest it will do printing by itself no worry about paper reverse and all all done it itself .Just use it wisely easy to intall .At this prince range worth it .Don't worry about replacement cartridge even just as razor and blade marketing the toner is priced high .But still worth it.
1,"After warranty period ends, printer breaks down.Brother will charge 50% of printer cost to replace the circuit board.Avoid at all costs. Absolute junk"
5,Writing review after use of 1 year. Got best quality prints . Still not face  serious issue. Refilling is easy. Duplex printing is very fast.
1,"I have used printers from almost all brands be it HP, Samsung, Cannon etc. This is my second Brother printer. The first one worked for 7-8 months and then the printer died on us. This one has stopped working in a month. I strongly don't recommend Brother products just because of the built quality. They offer excellent value for money until they are working but unfortunately they dont work more than few months and in this case not even a month."
5,"I own several printers for my office and of each kind ink tank , laserjet , thermal etc and of every price point. but this baby  is awesome. it does the job perfectly and accurately. and those who think that its too expensive as its toner and drums cost more... you should never buy the original toner and drums. always go for a local printer shop and ask them for a refil.  200 rs is what i pay here for refill. Good day my nibbass"
5,Bought it after reading the reviews and considering my requirements which was small sce printing of study materials and stuff..So opted for this duplex model..very fast and prompt printing..once or twice faced paper jamming issue..Must use paper thickness above 70mm..otherwisethere are sligh chances of jammingduring duplex printing ..Anyway sorting out a paper jam was super easy as there are brother's own step by step YouTube tutorials..Avoid it all together by using good quality paper esp during duplex..I am quite satisfied with the product..
4,"I have used this product for a few days now, and admittedly, the printer does what it claims well. The printer produces relatively sharp pictures in black and white and is the ideal device for someone who needs a durable laser printer and does not want to spend to much on it. The printer supports double sided printing, which is common, but still a good feature to have nonetheless. The page tray claims to be able to hold above 200 pages, but it may vary based on the quality and thickness of the paper. The installation process was the easiest part and took nearly 10 minutes to get it up and running. The product is cost-efficient and can support office environment and house environment based on your requirements. One thing I do not particularly like about this product is the printing speed, however, given the price and the quality, its a forgivable factor.Overall recommend this product to any person who is looking for a basic printer that can help them with their black and white printing requirements."
5,Fully satisfied with the product.I think best duplex printer in this rate.Very good print.
1,"I received the printer day before yesterday. Yesterday I tried printing. But it always gives printer jam error. Followed all troubleshooting instructions. Checked paper tray, drum unit, back side. No paper found anywhere. Also tried different types of papers. No luck. Will try one more time today, then return it if it does not work still."
5,"Using it for last couple of months .. Great purchase .. Loving it.I have used multiple color printers before and most of them lasted for less than 2 years. The last one was HP Deskjet ink advantage 3525, which was working well for more than an year and then it stopped printing due to printer head malfunction as we couldn't use this printer for 2 to 3 months in between which may be the reason for this issue. I was kind of fed-up with these issues and thought of trying an economical laser printer as laser printer doesn't need the monthly duty cycle.Loving this Brother laser jet so far and as of know looks like a terrific purchase. Only one practical issue is that there is no WIFI and we need to use laptop or desktop with usb to print. But i am used to it now. Printed around 700 pages so far and still showing around 75% ink remaining.ProsEasy to installGreat quality printingFast printing compared to previously used color printersDuplex PrintingHaven't faced any paper jam issues so farEconomicalConsNo WiFiOverall great product!"
5,"Overall printer is a good choice for monochrome printing purposes.Pros:1) Functional-Printing Quality is very good with duplex printing. Duplex printing is fast, simple and well automated.2) Build Quality:- Printer is robust and have great build quality.3) Printing tray capacity: Qty I haven’t measured but it can take easily 100 sheets.4) Cartridge: Long Lasting Cartridge with very easy installation..Guided by there Manual.Cons:1) Space required: Lot of space is required around 500mm x 500mm.2) Connector cable: Since it is a wired printer Its cable is small in length."
5,Top class printer. I have total 3 Brother printers at my shop All are work horses. This is a sibling of 2541. But only print. No scan and xerox. 2541 I have still and it has printed more than 2 lakh pages. I know this printer also will go beyond 2 lakhs. Thank you brother.
5,Nice printer at a price of Rs.7379/- .Ordered on the 16th Oct just as soon as The Great Indian Shopping Festival started..They promised a same day delivery..But had delivered on the next day..Still thats awesome isnt it..Got an awesome Rs.1100/- discount due to the Festive Sale period..Non-offer price was 8499 then..Prints quite nice..just hope the machine lasts long enough..I chose Amazon because of the delivery speed promised and they have kept their promise quite well..Other apps were giving me a 12 day delivery period unlike Amazon..Amazon had given a same day delivery promise..The printer is also very easy to install..
5,"I have had 3 inkjet printers before this. 2 of HP and 1 of Lexmark. Initially all of them behaved well but as soon as the cartridge exhausted, with a refill, they started giving trouble. Finally with a couple of cartridge changes I had to throw them out as scrap.With a couple of thousands rupees more this is proving to be a delight. I am an author. I have already printed the manuscripts of 2 of my books with 272 and 230 pages respectively. Whereas printing a single book of 250 pages on inkjet used to prove to be a half day task, this did the job in 15 mins. flat.Pros- Installs like a breeze.- Easy to handle- High speed printing- Crisp and sharp prints- No need for frequent paper feeding(takes 250 sheets in the in-tray)- Automatic both side printing (Duplex printing. Especially beneficial for manuscript printing)Cons- No Wi-Fi connection- No scanner- Somewhat heavyBut then one cannot expect everything at this price point. I cost me a mere 8500/-."
3,called Brother to ask for return - no because I should have researched it myself - their site doesn't mention it DOES NOT support Chrome OS - work around? connect to a USB-router and hope for the best after configuring it with a win/mac laptopotherwise probably the best price/quality laser printer you can find - get the extra toner and refills...
5,"Good value product with duplex feature. With easy double side printing, it saves a lot on paper. So far no paper jams. Small minus is it’s a little noisy compared to my earlier HP."
5,"I'm using a laser printer for the first time. Installation was very easy - youtube videos by the manufacturer itself defines steps from unboxing to finish installing toner cartridge. Loading A4 paper is pretty simple.For Windows, driver and if needed additional printer management softwares can be downloaded from Brother website. I am able to print from Android phone via USB OTG using some software on play store, and it went well.I chose 600dpi medium quality setting before printing pages of text and mild graphics, and it all went well. Prefer draft mode or 300dpi for printing images, otherwise toner consumption rises and image may look too dark.This does automatic duplex printing and it works well. Very happy with the purchase. Printer is so simple, humble, capable and value for money. Also compatible toner cartridges are available but seeing so many complaints related to print quality and duplex printing; so better to stick with genuine toner cartridge (gives 2600 pages) from Brother and cost per page is very cheap as home use is concerned."
5,"Post lockdown, there were lot of printing to do for my kid.. I looked for ink jet and ink tank but every professional printer suggested to go for laser as if your weekly print count is 5-10 and u don't want to spent a lot on the long run then go for laser given its low maintenance. Brother was a good fit and they are durable."
4,"For those who want only black and white printouts, this is the best. Although the plastic made of the machine feels little delicate. Easy to install and use. There is no scanner and color print in this. Multifunctional printers only make the system more complicated when repairs come and expensive. Otherwise, you can buy them separately and use, all come to the same cost as a multifunctional printer."
5,7999/-24hr delivery and it's a first class product with good packaging.Worked on 1st attempt itself.Easy to install and use.Buy 1yr extended warranty at 349/- giving peace of mind.Register for warranty and support.Reliable brand like a Brother. I liked it
5,"I order Epson model first. It got stuck after printing 2 pages. Luckily, Amazon accepted the return.I had no idea about Brother brand. Boss, It's  a beast... ! My daughter put toothpick, plastic sheets etc into it.. still no damage.. no paper jamGreat product for familyPrinted 600 pages in one go.. not a single jam..Just go for it .."
4,"Very easy to use - very good black-and-white printer. But no wifi!!  So if you are looking for wifi laser printer, you have to spend more moneySometimes some black marks come - but you can clean it by removing and moving the green part shown on brother printer cartridge. Simple work to be done every 2-3 weeks or so."
5,"Excellent printer with auto duplex printing facility, highly reasonable price. Working very well. One of the oldest printer company. Very low priced cartridge. I would strongly recommend the printer. Just go ahead and buy it."
5,"This lazer printer is fantastic value for money. Printer is a USB only which is okay as I don't have more than one computer to connect to. However, recommend a wireless one if you have more than a single user at home.Otherwise, print quality is good - very quite and simply works the way it is designed. Not too many fancy buttons and easy to clean. Fits perfectly on the desk. Duplex printing is great too. No paper scrunching unlike other expensive printers still do it. Easy to install the cartridge by following instruction sheet. no loose parts.Highly recommend this product for a trouble free printing."
3,"I have brought this product after a lot of surfing and thinking.Brother is less in price compared to those pronounced brands. I m a student switched to laser printer because it's maintaince is very less compared to any other type of printer.I think this printer is ok with everything but it's price per page is high..Toner is not easily availableLet me use it for some time ..Next I will provide much better information with experience..1st Edit after 4 months of usage Well uptil now it has worked nice,"
1,The disappointment was that of the missing security label on the package. No where it was to be found after screening through the areas based on the instructions. Such experiences hinder online procurement and search for genuine products. I have requested for a replacement which I hope is up to the mark and policies of Brother.
4,"Hey, its better than i expected.  I used to have Canon LBP 2900 but after using this Brothers printer, i never touch that Canon.  It prints like a breeze, the print quality is superb.  Canon was very durable, i dont know if this Brothers printer is going to be durable or not.  So, in comparison, this printer is better in every way except for durability which is not yet known."
1,"I purchased this (as a stand-by) mainly because of many reviews saying they have experienced no paper jams. contrary to this claim, from the first day i am experiencing paper jams every time i use this machine. even now, after four months, after experimenting with various good quality printing papers, it jams at least once a day.. sometimes two sometimes four papers are dragged in. despite fanning all the sheets, etc this happens. useless brand. print quality, auto-duplex etc work well. i like the separate drum feature also. my first printer, ricoh 3510sf (also purchased on amazon in 2016) gave me hell with combined drum and cartridge."
5,"Its Uses,* For Engineers and Industrial Designers. Create your own signature molds.* For Educators. geometry to life with holagrams.* For Chefs and Chocolates. Making custom dessert mold* For crafters."
3,I need 300mm x 400mm mould size it's available
5,Good packing and genuine part
5,"It's original Print head kit by its HP HOLOGRAM , After installation printer is working well, also it's my first experience with amazon, In future I expect more extra ordinary experience with u ,  thank u amazon,"
1,The packing is worse and the product was not working and the product had no seal and was opened and the printthreads were used and destroyed . They were in bad used condition
4,"1st i installed print head I faced paper missing error and black print head missing error indication after i cleaned print head insert area of waste ink.then i installed, the print head error was cleared. But paper missing error continuing then i long pressed for 3 secs in paper missing button then that's also cleared. Now it's working good. So kindly clean old print head insert area in printer before installing of ur new head. Then press information button to check print quality."
1,I ordered this product on 05 Jul 20 and received the parcel on 07 Jul 20.It was a prompt delivery by amazon.Unfortunately when I opened the pack it was observed that I got an already used cartridge as the seal was opened and pasted with a sub standard transparent tape. Even then I thought if it works in my printer I will use it. But when I inserted the cartridge in the slot it is not working. I compared the model with my previous one.. product is matching..but I am sure that it is a used cartridge.The seller for this item is APPARLO RETAILPRIVATE LTD.Unfortunately there is no return policy only replacement is possible.i have initiated for replacement let's see if they give me a brand new cartridge which is properly sealed.Will write another review after that
1,"Worst product received. Product package damaged and repacked. Printhead was an used one. New printhead contains ink stains. Copper strip in printhead is ink stained. Seller, selling used one product is worst thing related to Seller nature."
2,It was a faulty one ... I had to return it..Worst experience always from HP products as well as customer service.. Never ever recommend HP products.. Waste of money truly..
5,"Purchased this for replacing printhead for my HP DeskJet GT5820 as the ink suction was having issue as I saw air inside the color pipes. After checking on HP support site, I found that in this case printhead replacement is necessary and the only solution. Initially I tried pumping out stuck air inside the pipes using syringe but nothing worked. Also doing all these are never recommended by HP. This is the original printhead from HP and worked like a charm. Also after replacing and completing the priming process I saw a message on my PC saying "" Thank you for installing Genuine HP ink cartridges! HP M0H50A TriColor HP M0H51A Black"". I guess  this message on PC can be expected if the printer is installed over network and that is what is in my case. As soon as I replaced and followed the replacement steps, the printer was back in action again. Printing quality is also awesome."
5,"Thank you itglobal for delivering genuine hp printhead. product is working well so far, no complaints as such. Please replace the printheads step by step as per HP video in HP website, otherwise it will lead to bad print quality and maybe damage to the printheads and it will not be replaced by the seller. replace both printheads at the same time. So, please be very careful replacing the printheads."
1,This does not support Ink Tank Printers wrongly mentioned that this supports InkTank printers.
4,Its a bit pricey than what other options were there plus also incurred delivery cost...however worked pretty good with my HP Ink Tank wireless 410 printer...
3,"Delivered on time.However, the product is not comparable to the original heads that were came with the printer.The printing quality is okay but not dark like before.Anyway, it works properly."
4,Print head is required to be cleaned using in built software if printer is not used daily.
5,This is a genuine product and the delivery was the best part.done in less than 4 hours which was least expected.
5,"On time delivery, original product, was delivered in a different part number but checked it on hp website, not are same"
1,Worst printing quality.... Worked good for a day and the problem started from the next day.... Some sort of white lines occurred and the colour print is worster....please do replace the product or refund the payment

3,"I had ordered tri colour printhead but got only black, I have used this black printhead in HP 5810 PrinterIts working properly"
5,Received original. Using for HP 410 series home printer.
5,Good product in this lockdown
1,BAD. The black print head was defective and even I faced problems with the return and ultimately I wasn’t able to return the product just because of amazon's poor service. Disappointed
5,The product is a genuine accessory for HP printers. It was easy to install and has fixed printing issues relating to damaged printheads in my printer.
5,Good
5,I replaced for my printer. It is working smoothly
5,Perfect and genuine  product :)

4,"Print Quality is Good , easy to install, cost too high"
1,open packet
5,Good product
5,"Very Nice Thermal Printer Easy to Use 😊, Costumers Are Very Happy 🙏"
4,Good but usb cable not working
5,"Nice product , good support . Surely you can buy without any problem . Very good"
5,Good
1,Does not support OTG
5,Print quality is good
5,BEST THERMAL PRINTER....
5,No problem in pintar
5,"Ordered in nov'20. There were few reviews about pics getting printed lil dull and darker. But if you process images brighter and lil more saturated you can manage more vibrant prints. From my image you can see all colours have been well developed. Got it for arnd rs.10,500 in  nov'20 and immediately price was reduced to arnd 9,200rs :(.  Anyways very very happy with the end result. Kit also had a 10 film pack, a photo bunting and 10 photo cards. Thank you amazon and the seller!!"
4,Polaroid cameras are better but this works too. It darkens the photos so if you’re gonna print out then I recommend using brighter photos.
5,I'm impressed 😁
4,"Please check the sample pic.Printer is good, light weight, easy to use. However, please use filter before printing anything. Example, The more saturated one is edited on snapseed using Accentuate filter. Other is the original one and turns out too whitish.So please watch some YT videos and you'll get better idea how to get best results :)"
4,"It is very easy to use this Polaroid printer. Minimum efforts, good quality pictures.The film costs too much. Like 1000 for 20 sheets. But, other than that it is A grade."
5,"The only drawback is that the reels are very expensive , hence the product is really nice and easy to use"
5,Easily the best in this category.
5,"It does what it is supposed to do! And best of all, unlike polaroid cameras, you can choose the photo that you like the best to print!"
5,Very good product and quality.
1,They should give one refill at least.They don’t give anything. You have to buy new for that
1,Not a value for money product charging cable was not there.. if you open cartage flap and close it it will waste one photo paper
4,"Prints are too bright hence color correction needs to be done everytime, needs to adjust brightness to lower level"
5,Good product from instax
5,Amazing
3,Expected bit more on the quality of pictures and whole product itself. But not fully satisfied. Better go for some other product
1,"PLS DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM CANON.  THIS PRINTER DOESN'T PRINT MORE THAN 100 PAGES.  ALSO,  THE CUSTOMER CARE IS USELESS,  THEY WON'T TELL YOU EVEN A SMALL SETTING OF PRINTER IF YOUR PRODUCT IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  3RD CLASS SERVICE BY CANON. REGRETTING MY DECISION TO BUY A PRODUCT FROM CANON"
1,Bad choice.  Stopped working after six months of fairly average use 2-3 prints a week. Didnt even last till first cartridge finished.
1,"The printer is defective, scan and xerox does not work after few days, its absolute waste of money. I felt never buy any more online."
1,"This product is worst, the first time the ink was completed too early called to customer care they said first it is a common behaviour (both Black and Color ink were completed for 60 prints). I have bought new Canon PG-47 Ink Cartridge it also completed within 100 papers printout. Not getting a profit from this printer because of Cartridge costs around Rs. 600 and each paper costs again .50 paisa. Finally, the user will end up with a loss.Worst experience with Canon printer."
1,Don't Buy . Don't Buy .Don't Buy . You will die purchasing cartridges which cost around rs.1400 . Print per page is 7 rupees per page black and higher for colour .
1,"The  product  did  not  respond  to  the  cartridges  installed ,  also  Wifi  Button  not  working  not  blinking  after  pressing,  Software  installed  on  PC  found  the  printer  unresponsive."
1,"Pathetic printer and pathetic service. Since past 6 months, the printer has broken down for more than 4 times. The service person takes about 2-4 days to return your request and last time around they did not even resolve the issue. Paper consumption is also very fast and cartridges very costly. Will not recommend at all."
5,"a very nice product.absolutely no issues.superb printing thru usb,wi fi ,mobile.very sharp printing photo or text.no idea about cartridge printing capacity ( pages ).but overall love it.scanning is not tested yet.thanks amazon."
1,First time printer delivered was damaged. After replacement the printer delivered seems refurbished. It's wifi is not working. Key press not responding. I lose trust on seller. Even though i can return it till 17 Aug. App not allow me to return.
2,"Printing is erratic.  Waiting time is too long.  Color printing takes much longer.Same case with printing specially pdf and excel files.Scanning takes long time.Color output is mediocre.Overall performance is poor, understable for the price. I wonder higher end other models may be better."
3,I am writing this review after using of two days. I am not satisfied with printer because there is no borderless option in this printer. Means it is leaving the white border of an incharound while printing . The photo size would be small. I asked the customer care officer about it. The second option is not available in this model. So I think it is better to ignore this model
4,Good for home for students assignments n projects.Legal size prints are not available.Mobile to printer printing possibleHave to use with app n net routerSaves me frm taking late night trips for children's printing work
4,Dont buy.  I am keeping it unused.  New oringnal ink I installed.  But printer does not recognise it.  Waste of money and ink (costing Rs. 700)
4,Print quality is ok. It is good value of money and very easy to install and operate by just going through mannul given along with this or on youtube
1,Printer started to have trouble from day one. Every time to get a single print you have to struggle with this junk for around one and half hours.. Their customer care is also like tinpots. Total waste of money...
5,Canon is at the Top when it comes to printers. Reliability and durability are the hallmarks of Canon products.
3,Printer's performance is good. But catridges are too expensive and error 1401 (fine catridges are not installed) accurs frequently even with new fine catridges.
1,"Worst experience, only 20 to 25 pages print in one cartridge. Cost per page around 20 rs per page for black and 30 rs per page for color print.Don't ever buy canon printer without ink tank."
1,"Return not available. quantity is poor / low catagory matarial use , drivers not esyly install , wifi not working properly, print costly."
2,प्रिंटर की छपाई तो अच्छी है लेकिन इसकी स्याही बहुत महंगी पड़ती है इसका कार्टेज 14 सो रुपए में आएगा जोकि दो ढाई सौ पेज में स्याही खत्म
1,Very disappointed to see such service from Cannon. It's been more than 10 days to report issue of printer wifi not working and it's still not resolved yet.
1,Rong printer
5,Great printer and not costly at all...using for daily printing
1,"This printer is not working ,I want to replace."
1,Please don't display this product on screen plzzzz
4,The Print Quality of the product is good. Just find the plastic might be fragile. Also the Print speed is slow.
5,V usefull
3,Good
3,"Overall product is ok, but I am not getting a good print copy, as when trying to copy I am getting a thick black line on one side of the paper."
1,Stay away window 7 usersIt won't work
3,Superb product in best rangeI bought this product 3999rs
4,Good printer with low budget
5,"Yet, not connected but it's good."
1,Worst product. Total waste of money. Don't buy lest you should be betrayed.
1,"We got a damaged one, returned the same immediately."
2,Not even installed and not started
5,Connecting to WiFi is tricky. Good printer
5,This is mainly for students who are under age and to do print many projects ..
4,Don't buy inkjet cartridge printer.Ink tank printer is good for low cost print and good quality
1,This vendor sells with wireless print not working
1,Waste product. Cheating  customers.If you buy XL cartridge  it comesnearly to the price of the printer. Itcopies  less nos. than mentioned.
4,"The product is very good considering price range the print quality is awsome but u need to download the drivers from the official website the C.D which is provided with the product is useless as soon as u tap to install driver it opens webpage and also u need to have an uninterrupted internet connection to download driver's, the only drawback is cartridges provided with the product is small cartridges they should provide Xl cartridges instead of small, thank u."
5,It is a good printer for homeuse. It's printing quality is so good.
3,"Negative concern:1. Actually slow printing.2. Huge printing cost(if you manage with ciss it can reduce).3. Black Ink are not waterproof.4. Print quality not too good, just ok quality.5. No duplex printing facility.6. High price @₹4388/-Positive concern:1.Good WiFi facility, also WPS support (direct connection), mobile friendly. Quick connection after plugin.2.Can print thick paper(photo glossy 2, vinyl).2.Easy and efficient paper size selection.3.Borderless printing.4.Best printing resolution in this segment.5.Good scanning resolution.6.Cancel button that immediately stop print/scan oparation.7. Easy to install.8.Easy to Oparate. After plugin, immediately connected devices with WiFi.9.Small LCD display and LED notification"
3,"This is a product made specifically be sold cheap so that Canon can sell ink at exorbitant prices. The plastic is the cheapest I have seen on a branded consumer product. Have lost respect for Canon seeing the flimsy, non-homogenous material all around.Some brilliant person decided to give a fine chequered texture to the top surface of a product which predominantly sits in the open. The texture accumulates dust like a magnet and holds on to it for the rest of its life. The same surface also holds on to the sticker adhesive & packing foam reside.  No, you can’t clean it, even with an ear bud soaked in isopropyl alcohol.The description stated duplex printing. But there is no paper tray. And no, there is no automatic double sided printing. You need to manual flip the pages over like prehistoric times.Once you install all the associated Canon software, be prepared to be bombarded with notifications / survey requests etc with every breath you take."
2,"Even thought the printer is not so expensive, the cartridge is very expensive and gives less number of prints. The colour quality is also not so great. Good thing is that you can print using WiFi. But is there is an error it’s difficult to identify the problem as there is no manual attached with it for troubleshooting."
5,"Initially received a faulty printer with hardware issues. But, after raising the issue,  was replaced with a new one. Thanks to Amazon and the seller. Initial setup is tedious, but overall satisfied."
1,"This printer is good. However the overall costing goes expensive in terms of print per page.1. Print quality is awesome.2. Cartridge goes out of ink too frequently.3. Cartridge refilling option is not available. You will have to buy new cartridge which are expensive.4. After investing 7000 if overall print per page goes more than 15 to 20 rupees, its not worth buying it.My recommendation is to go for tank refilling kind of printer e.g. Canon Pixma G2012.Reply to this post if you need more details.RegardsNaved"
1,I have used more than 5 printers till date and Canon Pixma TS 3370s is the most expensive printer to use. High maintenance cost. 745s and 746s catriges will lasted me for 13 black and 10 color prints.I regret to buy this printer after reading many feedbacks on Amazon and Flipkart. I got this printer for 4000/- after discount and now I am really scared to use this printer due to maintenance cost.
4,Nice product.. use the Canon pixma printing is good .. buy all Canon itam.
1,"First print itself came with white patches, display and Power button stopped working within a month, printer became unusable within a month. Not recommended at all"
4,Average.
3,The product is good but it consumes more ink also if not used frequently the inks dry. Eventually increasing your headache and price per print.
3,Plz help me your catrages are empty in only 2 prints they show empty tooner please help me
3,Paper jamming frequently
5,"Easy to install,  wireless option too! Faced no issue."
2,Not as promised. Ink finished after few printouts.
1,Don’t by this product
1,"Print 31 pages only then you have to refill, I want refund but didn't get it."
2,Very bad don t purchase very poor printer waste of money print is very poor and page only 20 printing of cartigaes very poor don't purchase
5,It's really very good printer and it's very fast print
1,"Cost of printer cartridge is more. For 500₹, we can print hardly 20-30 pages. Product should be removed from market than cheating public."
2,Cartridge of the printer finished early. I would not recommend this printer to anyone. I want to return the printer
1,Printer not working. Customer care contacted. Service engineer says should be replaced. Awful buy with no solution till now
1,Printing costly
1,Only 10 prints i took from brought date catridge

5,I am very upset with Amazon my printer not working

1,Waste waste waste!!!!!!
5,Print QualityGood for home use
1,I totally dislike this printer
1,Print Quality is very poor
5,Best products in prices
2,Cartage problem
3,"It needs the firmware and drivers to be installed from the CD that comes with the printer. Updated firmware and software is available online, but the printer refused to work with those until I installed the ones from the CD first. Since I had a laptop that didn’t have a CD/DVD Drive, I had to buy a separate portable Drive to install from the CD first.Once installed, it’s printing and copying works fine. Getting the scanner to work took more fiddling with software.Not really plug and play if you don’t have a CD drive"
4,"It is good priter , hp help center is also too good,"
5,"Used this for almost one year, the cartridge that comes with it last only for 500 papers , after that you have to buy an another cartridge ,otherwise the printer is great quality is fine"
1,Not able to install its driver neither provided  CD nor online software even by remote expert by hp expert. Very very poor and negative response both from Amazone and hp support team when asked to return/ replace. Lost Rs 13500 of its cost with too much frustrating reply from Amazone and hp. Never never by online products which require technical support. I am signing out from Amazone.
5,"Special thanks to APPARIO RETAIL LIMITED...for giving a fresh piece. Thank you AMAZONE for delivering the package 4 days before the expected date.About the printer.... printing speed is good. Printing quality is good.scanning speed is good.zoom and micro is good.software is good.. totally user friendly.What I am sad is about....is...when I purchase this item the price was 13950 next day it dropped to 12499...no time to return...second one is....size of cartridge,it's small in size...need to reefil frequently....overall the printer is good....8-04-2019 after taking 800 copy and 150 scanning..the printer is working properly...no complaint...now I have to shake the cartridge before taking first print....seems ,the toner level has gone low..only problem is the cartridge eald...15-4-2019No problem with the printer and print . One thing that should be noted is , you must use good quality ink...thank you."
4,"Good printer, but need earthing otherwise you will get shock from USB cable which connect to laptop, I don't understand why its design is like that, I call customer service technician he said this printer must need earthing. This is my only equipment in my home which require earthing. I argued to technician because I never see such kind of printer design which require earthing all the time, may be I got faulty printer. And I am using it with earthing. That means all the time when my printer works I am grounding some amount of power. Pls if someone has any idea regarding my printer problem, share with me."
5,"I am writing this review after using this product for 3 months.Print Quality:-Print quality is amazing as compared to others printer in this price range.Photocopy is not much good but the if you print any documents/photos by laptop then you get the nei quality.Overall print quality is best 👌Easy to Use:-Yes,it is very easy to use this product you don't need to read the booklets to use this product. And also it is easy to install the software in the PC. (This includes CD)And Controller are simple and fine.Ink:-As in the description box there was written that you get 1000copies with single toner .But i think its wrong. I have printed about 200pages on -3DPI the ink detector started showing me that your ink is low. And when printed some more documents (about 20),it was end.In Simple word, In the description box there was written that you can upto 1000copies with single toner. But i am able to print only 220 Pages on Single toner (-3DPI). Maybe first time printer consume more Ink.Other :-Other things like price, Printer made quality,Size,Wires, Internal Parts, Delivery,etc. all are excellent 👌.Thanks."
5,"1. HP Laserjet Pro M1136 Multifunction Printer is really amazing.2. It works very nicely and efficiently.3. Its duplex facility is excellent but it does not print two sides automatically. Lifting printed pages, you have to insert them again in their opposite position- which is also simple.4. It printing quality is incomparable.5. It prints pages in booklet formats also.6. It provides a best feature, i.e., you can cancel your printing anytime with is button on the printer.7. It prints pages in two qualities: 1200 p and 600p.8. A special thing about this printer is that it saves electricity and ink with its option ink-saver.9. It has no WiFi facility.10. Its Xerox quality is also excellent.11. It is better than brother printers.12. In all, this device is superb. Don't think too much. Go with it."
1,"This product is not for India as well H P is not providing any support. As a company you must be careful in supply of product of a who doesn't support product, because I tried my west having complain no BNZF4511-01."
5,Fully satisfied.before buying this printer i think how to refill the ink and what will happen if the ink is  fully consumed....but it is easy to REFILL the powder ink. Powder ink is refilled by myself it’s Very easy.I am giving this review after 3 months of usage.
5,It has proven to be a very good printer for me so far. I have ran 3 toner cartridges (over 4000 pages)  through it and have gotten very high quality repeatable results. No issues at all with printing whatsoever. I have only ever had two paper jams and that was due to my own stupidity where I put the paper with crumpled edges. Perfect printer for home and small office use. I do not require my printers to be WiFi enabled as they are shared over a network anyway so it is perfect for my requirements. Your mileage may vary.
3,"A robust printer. However, when u start it for the first time, the scan fails and you need to redo it. But thereafter it runs fines. The printer is great but the scan files come out too large for mid-size DPS scans of 600 / color."
1,The drivers delivered with the printer are more than 6 years old and they are not working. I have tried downloading them from the HP website but same issue. I have spent two days trying to install the drivers to no avail. I tried calling HP and after endless waiting they were not able to help. Finally I have to take the printer and my laptop to software service guy near to my home to get them installed. This is worst printer I have seen in device or support.
1,"The product was defective. The computer did not recognise/detect/install the printer. The  Drivers did not Install from CD or downloaded from the Internet. On top of it Amazon hassled me for two days before accepting a return and refund even though they did not say the product is ""non returnable"" on their website."
5,"Best product ,best quality , best amazon delivery ,I liked this"
5,i really happy with this printer its working really great and the printing quality superb.its very easy to install and operated manually and also photo copy quality wonderful thank to Amazon  for delivering me fast in a day and for affordable price i have more then 2000 rupees discount on MRP.
1,"We had purchased this printer before 6 month, but I recommend you this is the extreme level third class printer with poor quality service. Ink is not proper working, it shows again and again blinking light of Ink refill. Set up is too much tedious.  After 1 hour of waiting setup is not running properly. Totally dissatisfy with HP service all time. Instead of I recommend Canon Printer for easy setup and easy to use."
4,As yet 15 days using the product with no issues. Hopefully it will keep on going as is. Little extra space culd have been given for scanner n xerox wuld make large demand to product...
5,Great for home and buisness use..
4,"This product is good, but if you want 100-200 prints daily then this fine.. then you want to buy 1005, when you buy free you can print 400-600 prints only after you want change toner or refill it, after refill you can face many problems like hang, black print, stop while you can print 100 above prints. Slow if print 20-30 plus prints. But overall this good product product for home use and light uses. I Give him 5 stars, but now i feel i can buy 1005 or above. Thats why i will give 4 stars"
4,"Very wonderful product ,bought nearly 1 yr back .working goodWe are not very frequent . Only drawback is that after print is faded,you have to removeInk cartridge and shake it and insert again to get uniform print. Definitely that’s not a tedious job."
3,"Demo toner gives you just 100 to 300 pages print. After that you have to buy new toner which would cost you ₹4500....So don't just buy printer according to your budget, but ₹4000 less so that afterwards you can buy toner...My demo toner which use to come with the printer, finishes within an hour after installation."
5,Very Good products
1,Tried installing with Drivers CD as well as well downloaded drivers online from HP's support website but it didn't work on my i7 laptop with Windows 10 even after installing latest firmware.  Support contact number was always unreachable. Sent email to HP's given support dept with no response. Have no option than to return product.
5,"Excellent printer. Slim, light weight attractive design. Simple installation. I didn't have cd drive in laptop so downloaded it from hp site and installed without any issue. Unpacking is also simple. For both unpack and driver install, you can refer any video in YouTube.Printing is fast and quality is very good. Photocopy is also nice. Overall I am very happy to have this printer"
5,Print quality is superb. No issues. But dissapointed with the dry cartridge which was installed in it. It did not even print more than 25 pages and had to order another cartridge within a short period. So utterly dissapointed. So seller to please before shipping the item. Rest it's fine.
5,"This product is actually good for households office , enterprise who does use it for heavy duty . It is well packed and easy to install. It has a catridge which can print 700 pages. Later can be refilled . The photocopy , scan, print is high quality ,sharp and fast printing . It does it's process very quite and efficiently. The price is very good for this product ..... The print quality is satisfying, very easy to install"
1,Very Bad. we have kept this aside and no body is coming on call even in warranty period......
1,This product is useless..never buy this process... Product which i got is defective..it doesnt print ..neither amazon company replace this product ...
4,"This HP Printer is good with regards to the Print Quality, User-friendliness but the Yield of Printouts from its Cartridge is not so satisfactory as I would have liked."
5,It is very simple to use but installation for windows 10 is very difficult. I requested the Service Center to help me for installation after approx one week 'so called  Engineer' (Because he don't have enough knowledge) come and installed. The service of Hp Service Center is not satisfying.
2,Paper jam is a main problem. Suitable software is not available in the site. No directions were given by the distributor for how to download or the link of the site.The installation CD given is not completely downloaded. It shows errors.
1,Very very low quality printer.1. Electricity current in back of the printer and earthing problem.2. Very slow scanning process approximately 3 minutes per page.3. No help by amazon customer care.4. I am very sad after purchase this product.
5,Company people come and opened the box and installed the Xerox machine to my pc so no problem with that and I am using it for last 1 year. I am happy with my xerox machine. Operating the Xerox machine is also very simple and easy. Printing quality is excellent.
5,This printer is very brilliant under 15000.19 pages per minute.Printing quality is 100 /100.800 to 1000 pages print in one refil and refil price is 90 to 100 originalThis is very brilliant product but delievery time is too long 5 to 6 days.
1,The product was faulty and HP has declined to replace under warranty. Amazon has been showing technicalities before us and there is only an exchange of mails. The amount of over Rs  13000/- Is like swindled away and no resolution at site. Meanwhile the seller is nowhere in picture.
4,"I like this product for multi-function work for household and office, school projects especially during these days' difficult situation. I did not earlier realize before buying this product that it cannot print both sides simultaneously/ automatically and require physical change the paper to print both sides. However, product is nice and good to use till now.Thanks"
5,"For installation on Windows OS, it is easy with the CD.  But for MAC Catalina OS there are no drivers as of date.  also the CD concept is outdated as many Laptops do not have a CD.  It is the Pendrive age.  The drivers/installation app should be on a pendrive or alternatively aweb  link should be provided, both for MAC & Windows.The product as such is sleek and good."
5,"Product is rigid, well finished, and good quality plastic. Prints smoothly, scanning is difficult to manage and limited function keys are available."
4,Excellet laser jetPrinter for office or home use.it is very easy to use even a child can copy or print .super quality.i will surely recommend you to buy this
1,Inaccurate images of product. The first image is of hp smart 530 but why it Is placed in hp smart tank aio 500. As shown in first image it doesn't have touch screen
1,"This is not a wireless printer. However hp stores specification showing that this is a wireless printer and it has 7 button on control panel cancel,resume,colour print,black and white print,info,wifi and power button. Totally misguide customersI want to return this product. Hp support suggest me to return this product to amazon."
3,Printer work fine .colour combination very nice. Print quality also good. But build quality of the printer very bad .never expected this type of build quality from HP brand. Front door very loose. Better to buy in this price range canon or epson . Not recommended overall
2,"मैने hp स्मार्ट टैंक 500 लिया परन्तु उसमे wifi नही है,मुझे मोबाइल से प्रिंट निकालने मे दिक्कत आ रही है, मुझे 515 प्रिंटर चाहिए था ऊपर के पैसे मैं दे दूँगा।"
1,Didn't like the product.. amazon is not allowing me to return it also. Even if I have bought just 3days back the product.. Had called yup amaxon customer not even ready to share amazon customer care e-mail id ; this is real sad not allowing me to refund the product;
3,"Product's working is fine.But the build quality of the product is average, not so good as much expected.The company should improve the build quality of the HP 500 all in one smart tank printer.Working satisfactory, but the build quality is average...."
5,"I bought this for regular A4 size colour printing and occasional photo prints.Very satisfied with the print quality. I used professional quality photo paper. Borderless printing is a plus as it gives your photo a different feel.A bit on the expensive side, but additional scan and photocopy options are a plus. Print speed is good comparing other similar HP models specifications."
1,"Don't buy, Worked only for one month, now not even switching on. Booked a service call on 24th Nov still no response/update from service team till 9th Dec, 15 days later. Regretting the purchasee waste of time/energy"
5,"The printer is so good by body make, technology and the services it gives. Its faster than any other inktank printer I used previously. And the price is also reasonable. I found a printer that served my purpose."
4,It's in experience period so I can't say anything earlier but one thing is clear that this one isn't below average.

5,Awesome products  who thinks to buy a new printer I suggest them go for it and u would like this product
5,"Good Product, I am using it from 17-01-2021 and the experience of the first day was awesome. Now I am exploring the printer if anything happened I will mention.First Impression is very very awesome."
5,"Product as expected.Easy to setup.  ( fill the ink, goto setup.brother.com) it will download the required drivers. )Copier is working fine.Scan also fine.

4,"Print quality is decent as expected from inkjet, although ink bottle only contains half a tank worth of inks"
5,This printer is Amazing.You can even print with your mobile by connecting it to the USB through OTG cable.Make sure that you install the NOKOPRINT app from the playstore.Only then you will be print from your mobile.The print quality is Good.You have to install a software for your PC/LAPTOP to get compatible with this printer.Note:the nokoprint is available for android.I am not sure about IOS.
5,"Built quality was excellent, print quality was excellent. Wot was not good or time consuming was installing software from CD provided. It took 2 hours to install software. Rest all ok. Over all best buy."
5,I bought this printer after a lot of research and good reviews. I have been using this printer almost every day. This printer comes with all business essentials features that a business may need. You can trust this model blindfoldedly. I am really impressed with this model.
5,"This is the best Ink Tank Printer I got. Brother is my personal best than other printers in the market. Print quality is best, there is no ink problem in this printer. Black print is spectacular. And most importantly product registration for any Brother printer is quite good and fast. I prefer Brother Printer rather Epson, because of the page loader tray. Brother Printer has a specific page loading tray like xerox machine, but other printer doesn't have that facility, which is mainly problematic to me."
5,"Printer is easy to set-up. Print speed is good, quite fast. I am a bit concerned to see that original Brother ink is not available online. The only original option shown had adverse comments."
4,Its only a month ago I just printed not more than 200 copies print quality is good but not as cannon.I purchased this because of brother is japanese company.My experience is good print is very fast in term of documents print.software is very user friendly.easy to install
5,"Review after 1 month of use -Build quality -- Strong and compact built quality. Light weight, no items projected outside. Strong top cover which is flexible for book printing alsoPrint quality -- I have tried more than 1000+ prints (both color and black) in last 1 month. No problem in ink spillages, printing lines and color variation.- Color print is excellent but take more time- Print, Scan and Copy all are very simple to operate and within 1 day my daughter started using it smoothly.Price -- Budget printer in this category.Unique features -- Inbuilt paper tray for 100+ papers inside the printer- Special feature for ID card printing- Both side printing facility is also possibleSuggestion -- Kindly buy CP-440 printer intead of CP-220 since 220 variant is not having wifi printing/scanning option."
5,Print quality is Awesome. Best printer at this price.
1,1. This printer not supported for Mac - this was my priory use case2. Scan has shade of green color3.paper get named very frequently4. Print speed too slow.
5,This is the 1st time i ever used ink tank printer.  I must say ... i loved it. Only challenge is it get genuine ink. Hopefully i will get that. Else it will a waste
1,Within second week of use the printer is not working..

5,"HP 319 ink tank printer review -1. Purchased for 9700 Rs during Prime day sales2. Delivery was done next day of order.3. Installation process is quick and easy. Many YouTube videos available. Can ho through.4. Print Quality is Excellent and great.5. Scanner is very fast. Scans and prints within 20 sec for B&W and 40 sec for Colour6. Printing speed is ok. 7-8 Prints for B&w per min and 3-4 Prints for Colour.7. You will receive 2 Black ink bottles of 170 ml each which will print minimum 8000 pages of b&w practically which is very decent. Tricolor bottles of 80 ml each will print upto 3000 - 3500 colour pages of decent quality.Why i opted  HP 319 and not 310 or 315??Because it has 2 ink bottles of 170 ml plus blue design. 310 and 315 has only 1 bottle Rest everything is same in all 3.Why i opted  HP 319 and not 410,415 or 419???319 does not have Wifi whereas 410,415 and 419 has wifi and you can print from mobile and will cost you minimum 3000 compared with 319. I dont have any use of Mobile printing and hence opted for 319. If you want to buy Wifi Printer, go for HP 419 as it is top model and 2 ink bottles of black with it as in case of 319.Why not Epson, Canon or Brother ????I liked the design and sturdiness of HP Printer and there were negative reviews and feedbacks about these 3.So i hope my review will be one stop guide for all of you.Thank You 😊"
1,Service provided by HP is very poor .don't buy this product .I bought this printer 319 ink tank just 15 days back I have got a printer with damaged color print head .HP  company is neither replacing my print head nor providing service ...I feel am betrayed by Amazon and HP company am planning to sue them I won't leave them that easily
5,Great product I love it very much. Cost saving easy handling WIFI printings gives a hassle free operation from mobile devices or from your computer/laptop even you can create a unique email id with HP and send email like FAX on this printer from anywhere in the world and it gets printed.
5,First of all thanks to Amazon to gave me a quick delivery..This printer is1.Easy to handle2.Easy to install3.light weight and reasonable size4.Easy to print and scan5.Printing speed &Wireless connection Printing is low .Totally Am happy with this advance HP419 model printer.
3,"I am using it frim past 1 year.After 1 year Printer Head will stop working i.e. immediately when warrenty ends.U have to buy a new one of Rs.3500/-.Also you need to take printouts with a regular interval not more than 7 days, otherwise Printer's head will also stops working."
4,"I am using HP 5811 for more than 2.5 years. Now I am using this HP319 from August,2020. Print Quality is same. The problem comes after a few days with Black Prints as mostly we all take black prints more than color. Still, it is surely value for money!! You can use it 2 and half years / 23000 pages yield which comes first. More I can say, It is much better than Epson Tank Printers, which I used earlier."
5,"It’s a wifi printer, No duplex scan, you need to perform scan manually.Ink tank printer, clean print quality, value for the money.I was confused with Epson,but HP 419 has a small screen to give info regarding the print.Best for home or office usage."
5,Really useful Printer forlow cost printing.It does not take too much time while you are doing print text/documents whatever may in Color or Grayscale.For this thanks to Amazon and Seller and off course delivery agent for their wonderful job.
4,Light weight.. easy to use .. perfect for personal use.. print clarity is awesome.. only one issue it doesn't have a software installation cd. If you are unable to download the hp smart app in ur pc follow the instructions by support. Hp. Com
3,"It this range , printer should have at least 10 pages tray.. what is the point in putting each time putting single paper .. I take 8-10 prints every day but every time I need to stand near printer to put single sheet 😟"
2,"Initially Installation was a problem. The Guide given alongwith the Printer is wrong so wasted lot of time in installation.Whenever giving print command, after 7-8 pages of print, paper gets stuck. After pulling paper out, printer does not give remaining prints. So has to give print command again for remaining pages.Many times gives blank paper in between."
4,"Good things:- Looks great!- Build quality is great- Input and output tray folds inside the printer. So you can cover it up properly when not using. There is a cover to protect the input tray when the paper is not kept, this is very useful to prevent dust and particles going inside.- Spill free ink refilling- Good quality print. Photo prints are good too. But this is almost similar to cheaper inkjet printers.- Installation process is not that difficult- Makes less noise and vibration while printing- Scan and copy speed is very good.- Claimed page yield and per page cost is very less. Should be a very economical printer.Bad things:- Black print head started showing error the next day. I called HP support, they assigned the call to the local support partner who came and replaced the head in the next working day. (I called them Saturday and they came on Monday). I didn't wanted to raise replace or return to Amazon as the replacement printer could get some issue too. Overall I'm happy with the support. This is a good thing but the fault is under the bad things list.- Print quality is like any other inkjet printer, nothing special (at this price point). If you need the best quality black prints, go for laser printer. Not a bad thing but I just want to set your expectation.- The driver and main printing software called ""HP Smart"" is only available through Windows Store. In one of my laptop the Windows Store is not downloading the app (not sure what is the issue, I tried tons of troubleshooting steps but none of them worked). From HP support portal you can download basic driver and printer software but the experience will not be the same as the HP Smart.- Ink Tank printers are expensive. This is similar to any Officejet printer with an additional tank and ink flow mechanism till the print head. Wireless models are too expensive, Rs. 3k extra. I wanted to buy the wireless one but paying 3k is not worth it. If you are someone who use computer all the time there is no point of buying wireless one. You can easily connect the printer with USB cable and print. Wireless printers have mobile printing feature which can be useful for some people but not for me.Recommended things:- Use good quality paper. Cheap papers can result in ink bloating at the edges of the lines or texts.- Keep the printer covered properly, save it from dusts.- Use the printer regularly. These kind of printers are not recommended to be kept at home without using it for long time. The print head, ink pipes etc. will get dry and you need to spend on maintenance.- Use HP original inks, those are not too expensive."
4,The product is good. But at first driver was not installed from Windows store. In that case you have to download and install driver manually from the hp website. Next point is Pathetic quality in phtocopy resolution is too poor in this case. Default scan resolution is also 200 dpi. If you want to sacn in 300/600 dpi you have to change the settings every time. Print quality is superb. I am missing my canon mg 3670 for auto duplex printing.
4,"The printer seems to be good, easy to install and quality of print is also good. It has been a month of usage, and so far no issues.I had purchased it for 10.5K in May 2021 and installation was done based on video shared in WhatsApp by technical support team. I am able to take printout via OTG connected to Android phone as well. It also works with windows laptop connected via USB, I am yet to try with Mac laptop. I am regularly using it as ink tank printers have to be used regularly on daily/weekly basis.Pls go through your current & future needs and based on that purchase the correct type of printer - inkjet /advantage, ink tank or laser"
2,Poor print quality for photos. I purchased one week before and was very eager to print passport size photos and other photos at home. It disappointed me unconditionally. All my room decorating plans with photos collapsed. Please go for epson or canon than chossing hp
2,If someone buy this product. it prints is good. but its head ink supply pipe is many times gets air bubbles and facing irritated .be careful bought this product.🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
3,"Printer head problem , in two years I hv replace it two times."
2,Color print is not fulfill expectations { money loss} and less print size option. For color printing it is talking time for print and you can take cup of tea in that time.  Epson is better than hp.
3,Cons1) Prints 3-4 pages in a minute.2) Scanning a page at High resolution takes almost 3-5 minutes.3) Copier is also slow.Go for Epson wireless instead.
4,"After the usage of 3 months I nearly printed 700 pages, ink tank of the black colour reduced to half,I doubt that company can meet any near of their claim of 15000 B/W prints.It is quite possible that they are having the claim of 75 dpi print while 300 is very good.If you are printing in 600 dpi then it will use a lot.1200 dpi print takes very long to print I observed around 5 mins for 1 print."
2,Text smudges away when highlighted.. Photo paper print left ink marks on my hands even after 24 hours.
2,"think 100 time before you place the order online.  I brought this product, later I realized that this product has no wifi connectivity. I understand that it's not there in the product description.  I tried to get it replaced with the model with wifi but replacement is allowed only when product is damaged."
3,"Everything is Ok with the Printer, except for PDF documents. It does not open up directly. We need to go through Adobe. This printing service was available after HP rectified it online."
2,"print quality good and paper feeder take 5 to 10 sheets ata a time. also no wifi ,not value for  oney,its a shame to hp"
4,This is my 3rd printer from HP over last 20+ years. This one was easy to setup and use. The printing quality is good and works very well.
5,"Very good buy. Didn't get any discount,thats the sadest part.Print quality very good. Since July I have been taking at least 10 pages every week and could not detect depletion in ink level."
4,"Printer was goodCan you bill this at by business account, we will get GST input benefits."
5,Easy to setup.Scanning and copying is good ;printing is a little slow but good quality of printouts.Arrived earlier than expected so Yay for Amazon!
5,It is a good product. You have to follow instructions to install it yourself else call installation service. I was able to do it myself. Print quality is good and can give a lot of prints based on volume of ink provided.
3,"The supplier has not provided the installation CD apart the printer is good, but without cd installation sucks....print is good n print is performing upto the mark"
4,everything is very good. quality is superb and delivery experience was also great. giving 4 stars for this product only due to no serial number provided by Amazon in the box to get proper warranty experience. and I don't know how to get that.
1,I searched for Wifi printers. This printer came up as result. I ordered. On receipt I found that this printer is not wifi capable. So disappointing! 😢😢
3,Its good device for personal use but the device gives up if you print 60-70 pages at a time. It completes the task but it takes some time readjusts & then start again to contine the print. So its a bit sluggish i would say. Print quality is good for day today use.
1,This printer was mentioned as wireless. On installation it was found to be USB. Scanner is not user friendly. On the whole I am very unhappy .
4,I think it's price is little high as it has no auto duplex and it's printing speed is slow
5,"I ordered HP 319 and it was delivered the very next day. Print quality is very good, absolutely easy to install. Can't comment on value for money as this is my first printer for home use."
3,For priting both side .... one has to stand a side and keep on feeding paper....It doesnt auto rotate the paperNo wifi connection option to get it in home network...
4,"Good printer with a price worth its capability. Easy to install. Light weight and takes less space.  Print and scan speed is a bit slower, which may be problematic for those willing to perform the tasks in bulk."
1,Printing Head problem start just about 6 months to use.
5,"Very satisfied with it, I use it for my children school work"
4,Product is new to market..... only available in online platform.... product is goodWhen i talked to canon company engineer he suggest use 75-80 GSM A4 size paper for printing....Also not to buy ink from onlinePrint every 2 days means use printer continuously.....otherwise ink will be dry and printer will not last long.....
5,"The printout quality was amazing. The initial setup configuration was very simple. I recommended to go for it if you don't need wifi options in 2021 year model. Ink tank printers do a initial high purchase cost, however cost per print is very less.. Thanks Amazon for the perfect delivery on time and neatly packed."
5,Amazing product i like very much worth for money
1,The epson worst printer ever bad quality don't take high GSM photo paper new printer sold after three days of purchasing
5,Good
4,Filling the cartrizes initially is very difficult as all the tanks need to be filledup completely..
3,"I like the print quality, but the speed is very slow, its not as per your printer description. Sometimes it takes about 30 seconds for the 2nd print to follow. Average speed is not more than 4 prints per minute. I am disappointed with its speed, as it is time consuming."
5,Print quality is very good. It's easy to install. And tech support is not so great. He was not knowing why printer was not able to set as default printer in my laptop. Because of this problem printing was not happening. However I resolved the problem by myself very easily by watching a YouTube video. Windows permission  has to be adjusted from control panel. Now it's working perfectly.
5,Good print quality and easy to install.L3116 is USB connected not wifi.Support one side printing.
4,Over all good in this price range but colour photo print is average
5,"Amazon service is very poor ,we have received defective printer i have request for replace but still no any action from amazon in last 8 days ,very poor service of Amazon"

5,"REVIEW AFTER 6 MONTHS OF USE: Oh this printer is stupendous!!! It deserves an 8 star!!!I printed a photo last week (on Epson gloss paper) and it came 100% studio quality. Well, thats enough for me! I can now make posters at home, without spending extra bucks in a studio. Love it. buy it!!----------------------Let me first say, that the 5-star rating I have given is not because L130 is the best feature-packed printer in the market, but rather it was the “exact” printer I wanted per my technical requirement, specification, and budget---after a 2 month research.I am going to give a very detailed review, with some myth-busters. Yes, I see a lot of wrong Q&As and reviews that I would like to bust with my honest review on day-3 of my purchase.Home use, not for bulk or fast printing–This printer is a pure home or small business/shop use. Do not expect paper capacity beyond 40-50 (75 GSM) in the input tray. Print speed is fast enough for home and shop use. If you are looking for more paper capacity, super-fast printing, regular photo paper printing, well then invest in a more feature-packed costlier printer. For a home, student, shop purpose L130 is stupendous! I am yet to try on a photo paper, but that is “extra” start if I get a decent print. If not, I’m happy the way it is.Single-function is what you need today–Everyone has a decent smartphone that can scan and PDF documents using the camera. Free apps like Adobe Scan, Google Scan, CamScan, etc. can scan documents, align them, auto-correct colors, and will save you an extra 3-4K by buying a single-function (print only) printer. I see many reviews saying L130 is bad because it doesn’t scan! As it says, its a single function printer; it cannot scan.It’s an ink tank–If you do not want to fall prey for the ink cartridge scam, you need to go for an ink tan printer. Yes, ink tanks (like the L130) are a little expensive than inkjets cartridge printers, but in the long run, ink tank gets you the best return on investment (ROI). Inkjets are available for 2k and does max of 50-60 color prints. Making you buy another cartridge for 1.5k every 60 color prints. L130 can yield you 5000+ color (and 4000+ monochrome) prints in just one refill. The printer comes with 4 sets of colors, and technically you do not have to worry for a few months/years without an ink change.Compact for the desk–In its compact state (when trays are inside), the depth as less than 30 cms., making it ideal for any normal shelf/cabinet. Input trays also fits a 1 ft tall shelf. As needed, retract the trays to place the papers. See photos as it is easier to understand that way ;). By far, this is the most compact ink tank printer I’ve seen.Loves Apple as much as Windows–This printer works smoothly (including installation in under 3 minutes) in Windows 10 and macOS 10.14 (yes, Mojave too!). Many reviews and Q&As indicating L130 doesn’t support a Mac. Well, sorry wrong informers… it does support a Mac and all you need is to go to Epson’s website to get the right driver.Make it wireless if you have the right router–L130 is a non-Wi-Fi/non-wireless USB printer. A few years back, when I upgraded my W-Fi router to a dual band AC model, I went for a router with a USB port and with an inbuilt print server, though I never used that functionality till date. That decision came to use now! Yes, if you have a router with print server (and USB port), you can connect L130 to the router and use it wireless! One additional step beyond Epson’s driver setup is that you will need to install the router’s print utility/driver. Simple application you have to download from the router’s website and you have a USB printer that you can print directly from a PC/Mac connected to the WLAN.Take it to the cloud–Okay, now that you have realized that this is a print-only, home use, Mac friendly, and wireless “capable” printer, do you want to take it to the cloud? Meaning do you want to print from anywhere in the world? Well, folks, it is possible with some extra steps. As mentioned in my above bullet, if you have a router that has a print server and a USB port, make it connect to your WLAN. Once connected, register the printer to your Google Chrome account. Once registered, share the printer with any other Gmail accounts so that they too can print. For example, in my case, I registered my L130 in my Google account account using Chrome, and shared it with my family members’ Gmail ID. Now all of them can print from their Android, iOS, Amazon Fire, PC, Mac, from anywhere on the planet---as long as their devices and the printer at home is connected to the Internet.Well, that me after the third day of use, but 2 months or research. Good luck Amazonians!"
3,"The printing is good, but only those who use often only go for it. If there is time gap, most of the time we had to clean the head or nozzle lest the print was coming in pale yellow., Which uses some % of ink."
5,"Have been using this for almost 1 year now. Compared to my previous HP printer, this has been running well. Printing speed is normal. The print quality is good for home printing purposes. The ink has been lasting more time that it used to in the HP cartridge printer. Simple to setup and use. The only draw back I felt is, the only mechanism to check ink level is to raise the tank and see."
5,"My experience started on a Wednesday before Diwali on 23-Oct-2019 when my 2-year old Canon G1000 Ink tank printer just stopped printing and just spooled empty pages. Luckily I had purched OnsiteGo Extra Warranty. They responded asap and sent an engineer who couldnt fix it and decided to take it to their service center. Subsquent follow-ups confirmed that the printer couldnt be fixed and OnSiteGo refunded the entire invoice amount of Rs 7098 as Amazon gift vouchers by 30-Oct-2019. Not bad for a Rs 450 extended warranty.I wanted to go for a simple inktank printer and while i wanted to go wireless, there are no printers with just wireless. You have to buy it as a Multifunction which to me is fairly useless as I do a significant amount of scanning using Turboscan including legal documents, bills etc, and so waste of money. I did read a bit of literature on how to enable a non-wireless printer on a wifi network if the router had a usb port and voila my router (supplied by Airtel) which was a Huawei Hg4185 had one. So before i decided, i did a test with a neighbour's old epson Tx121 printer and it seemed to work. Secondly the cost of a good wireless inktank multi was almost twice the cost of a basic ink tank print only device. My choices narroed down to Canon G1010, Epson L130 and HP115,. all of which were single function, ink tank printers with no wireless and no duplex (which are the main add-on features as far as i was concerned).As i had previouly used Canon and HP in the past, looking at the reviews especially by one the gentlemen on Amazon who confirmed the wirless part, I decided to go ahead with the Epson L130. I ordered the same on Amazon on 30-Oct-2019 @ 17:00. The printer arrived prompty at 31-Oct-2019 @ 10:30. I called up Epson customer care @ 11:00 to log an installation request. I got a call from their installation at 12:00 and he landed at home by about 13:00 and by 14:00, we were all set. The printer defiitely looks sleek and doesnt need a lot of space. The only eye-sore is that the ink tanks are outside the core printer and is a little bit of nuisance but no ways a deal breaker.My wifi gig however did not work. After a lit bit of hair scratching, I disconnected the printer from the wifi router, shut down the router, connected back the printer and restarted the router. And bingo, the printer was available on the wifi network.  You just need to make sure that the Epson L130 driver (either through the CD or online from the epson site) is installed on your computer. I think did the same on my dad's laptop and worked like a charm.The next step was to set it up for printing from a mobile device. We are thankfully an android household and once i followed the instructions on the google support site on Google cloud print, I was able to print from my android phone. Further you can also grant permission to others through email and as long as your printer is on and your wifi network is connected to the internet, you can print from anywhere in the world through your mobile. Quite cool indeed.SO overall, this is like any other inktank printer1/ Uses inktank technology (naturally) and prints decent prints at a cheap rate2/ Is slow (especially on color prints)3/ Doesnt make too much noise4/ Has just 2 buttons one for power and the other for indicating if there is an isssue (nothing comp;licated)5/ You will have to print at least a couple of prints a week to make sure that the nozzles are fine and that the ink doesnt go dry6/ I am expecting to see with lines in a few months (courtesy my canon G1000 experience) which will require a bit of nozzle cleaning.7/ very compact for a home office (more compact and ligher than my earlier Canon G1000)8/ Overall a good buy for home usage and which will hopefully last for the next 4-5 years with decent mainteance.So for a first day experience, am very happy. And lasly i did get the OnsiteGo extended warranty for 2 years. Hopefully their customer service continues at the same level as today.I will post a detailed update in a few months after testing it extensively. For now, totally blown away with both Amazon and Epson customer service and of course the printer"
1,"I have used Epson Printer for last 8 year.The Only problem is after Warranty period only the printer get not working problem.I have used: L210 model, L110 Model, M205(2 Printer) and Finally L130 Model.Problem is:1.Connectivity Problem USB Won't detect.2.Head Problem Replacement cost is too High.3.Switch ON and OFF problem.4.Motor Problem in Scanner.5.After (15,000 Copy even b/w or color) or Warranty period Expired new few month the printer will make any issue.6.We Can Not use this printer more than 2 year. Completely Use and Throw Product."
5,"This review is after 3 months of usage.First of all for a printer to function well, you must print every 2-3 day. Even 1 page is enough.I've had no problem with this printer. I regularly print pages every couple days. Till now I've printer around 1000 pages (a bundle of a4 sheets printed both sides) and you can see the level of ink used. Its gives very cost efficient printing. Though the investment is a bit high for once. But if you have to print regularly it's the best deal. Its very light in weight too.Never go for the cartridge printer. Its the biggest scam in printer industry. Have already regretted.This ink tank is the best as these days there's no need for scanner. You can easily use apps like camscanner for the job. It will save your ₹3000 of the all in 1 model.I've attached pics of the printer, it's ink level after 3 months of use(1000 page approx) and a few print samples."
5,Awesome printer.I am not sure how many papers it will be print as I bought this printer one week ago.1.fast and good quality print2.sleek design3.easy installation on windows 10.(online installation done).also can be done by cd (attach with printer)
2,After 2 months of use problem started..while printing some lines at the mid lower part are being skipped and not getting printed...
1,"Usually our process with Amazon is smooth. However, on this occasion two problems: (1) Package wasn't handled properly which resulted in a hole on the side of the box and eventually we got to know from the service engineer that the mishandling resulted in the movement of a particular spring that was crucial to smooth operation of the printer, (2) We have already lost 4 months of warranty because as per Epson website the warranty commenced 4 months back. Overall, the entire experience feels like buying a used printer instead of a new printer."
4,"i was having previously inkjet color printer costed me around ~2500Rs with small cartridges, due to printing volume key contributors been Kids, i got fed up on on buying small expensive units! so decided to shift to Epson L130  Ink Tank Colour Printer, reason being its Ink TANK! supporting hing volume of printing and ""NO NEED OF PHOTOCOPYING AND SCANNER""  till now my experience is great, its just ""FIT AND FORGET!"" easy to install and printing quality is very good, it took 1hr in overall to unpack,install and start printing for my 11yr kid ..you can imagine its ease..  finally AMAZON's in-time delivery and packing is awesome !"
1,Worst service experience face ever in my life. This printer got dead in 1 week and service centre doesn't cover under warranty. They demand 6000 Rs for repair. Customer service in pathetic. Call centre disconnect the call without listen whole condition. Also I have check their official Facebook page.over there review section is hidden. No body can review about their services only because of worst service. After sell service is pathetic3rd class service.
4,"Build quality is goodFinish is goodEasy to installFast printingNot sure if it will print 4500 pages but shd be around 2500 as per quality of print selection.Color are goodNot many buttons, only 2 buttons easy.Less watt so save powerScan and copy not thereNo need of WiFi, just buy an OTG cable, download print share on mobile and connect to mobile directly for print.Prinshare premium will cost 199 per year which bus worth than spending 3k on WiFi printer.Price 6700/ my purchasing.Date 30may 2020.Go for it verdict!!!"
5,Awesome.Good qulality with less money.Enjoying it.I already have HP 2541 all in one printer.but I lost money eqaul to 1 printer in buying Cartize.Now I free from these all complication.Thanks Epson .Thanks Amazon.
3,Print speed is not up to the mark as they claimed.Standard print quality (normal): 7 pages per minute.Draft print quality (very low quality print): 18 pages per minute.BUT not 27 pages per minute.
1,"The worst service ever. I ordered it and when it came the paper couldn't feed as the roller was not working. When I contacted Epson, they said they will get back in 3 days, I waited for 5, nothing came back from them. I ordered a replacement but this time I recieved a product with no USB cable, switch cable or ink. Epson calls itself consumer friendly but is a absolutuly garbage company. I had a bad experience with this printer, it's better to give a little extra cash and take an HP inkjet printer instead of this ""Kooda""."
4,"I used pigment ink instead of dye ink in it, which doesn't print well on normal paper but great in glossy paper. Printing is slow and noisy, but I am patient. I brought it to print poster and stickers and photos. I am happy with it at beginners level since I couldn't afford more to invest."
4,"Build QualityThe entire body is made out of cheap plastic, which looks very cheap. In image, it looks good but in reality, the built quality is the weakest point of this printer. I was very disappointed with the built quality of this printer.Printing qualityThere are multiple modes given in this printer, for best result you have to set the print quality to high in printer properties. This printer is not a photo printer but this can print passport size photographs without any issue but in larger color prints it creates some lines, impression of printing head, which is only visible at a particular angel. The printed document looks nice.FunctionalityI have faced only one issue that this printer does not load the ink into the cartridges (tank placed on the printing head) from tank and there is an initialization step which is missing in the user manual. You have to press the page indicator button given besides the power button so that it loads the ink.But when printer and up using all the ink, it stops loading ink in the cartridges which was really annoying. I had to open it up and fixed it. For cleaning nozzle and printing head there is an option give in the printer icon displayed in the system tray, you just need to right click on it in case printing quality degrades.ConclusionINR 7,500 seems a lot, if you consider the build quality of this printer. But duty cycle of this printer is high, Epson claims this can print 4000 prints in a month, I never tested the claim but if requirement is to take roughly 50 to 70 pages on daily basis including color Prints then this could work and if you can fixed small issues by yourself like ink not coming into  cartridges then overall productivity will going to increase."
5,"Ordering :- As usual amazon easePrice:- Very competitiveReceiving:- Smooth, as promisedInstalling:- Simple and compatible to win10Ink topping:- very easy. It took nearly 15-20 mins to charge the ink.Quality/Service:- very good, even on photo paper. Speed suitable for home/small office. Ink is available in cheap rates. I even topped up further.I became frustrated and started to feel cheated by the ink cartridge prices of other make. For normal home use, this is being impossible to buy cartridges. Now the time came to throw them out of one's life and move to ink tank system.Conclusion:- VALUE FOR MONEY. GOOD QUALITY PRINTING. SIZE IS SUITABLE TO KEEP ON READING TABLE.IF THE PRINT HEAD SERVE WELL, I EXPECT ATLEAST 5 YEARS SERVICE."
1,Not worth buying for this price when there are various other options available.Their return policy is terrible which force you to carry this burden rest of your life.
1,"Prone to a lots of problems. Often gives bands or other kind of problems even if the settings are all right. A small error here and there can totally spoil the print - the printer has zero intelligence, it has to be told everything and even then sometimes it malfunctions.PS: as you can see in the photo I have been able to make notepads with papers this printer has wasted."
4,"one must install Epson software to utilize all the printing modesB/W Print- Good. Draft mode is very fast and decent quality. High quality prints takes bit of time and way better than Draft(draft use very less Ink and prints are actually bit gray in color instead of BlackColor:- Good Prints. Have done some prints on glossy paper and it is like 90% match to what we get in studios. Good for home and small office use.Printshare app can be used for direct mobile printing via USB. (select generic driver)or just connect it to Router (having print server)serious doubt on the claimed print output. for general usage i think it will last 1/3 or 1/4th of the claimed numbers.( Attached screenshot of ink level after printing 450 B/W pages and 40 colour prints (20 prints was on glossy A4 paper ..high quality for photos).Nozzle clean. I have been using the printer almost daily for few prints, still nozzle clean is required. With less usage surely nozzle will get jam"
4,"The printer has a small footprint. Easy to install though the initial ink charging takes time. Print quality is good. The printer resets itself should there be a power failure and the cycling of the ink charging whilst doing this can be irritating. The printer is very noisy, especially when pulling a sheet from the tray - certainly not for use in bedrooms or where children may be resting. Need to check whether the printer restarts without hiccups after a long (month/s) break with the power off, or will the ink in the system clog and prevent normal functioning. More on this after I return from a 3 month break."
5,"Amazing Product Using from the last 1 Year, Buy with hassle freeOne of the greatest product in my list.I found all Pros only, No Cons to say,but improvement purpose only - ink tank if visible @ front are, it will be more good.Thanks and RegardsAshok Devulapally"
5,Bst Product...Bst Printing Setup...Buy it
3,"This printer has performed well although had a couple of instances were I had to spend some time troubleshooting. First was when I noticed very small amount of ink streaking the bottom edge of some print outs. Since it was inside warranty period called support and someone came in to check. Suggested I use a better quality paper , like 80GSM or more . Although it did not completely get resolved it is noticed only rarely.Second instance was due to print head getting clogged probably due to not being in use for a long period . Had to carry out some service myself using the print application and it is working fine till date. The service engineer did recommend using the printer at least once a week though. So much for ink tank printer to reduce printing costs.All in all pretty satisfied and would recommend it to anyone looking for a home printer if you have school going kids, occasional high volume printouts and/or regular low volume printing."
1,Brand new Epson L130 printer but keeps showing paper not loading (orange light) error. Didnt even print a single paper. Completely dissatisfied.Cant lift the whole unit because all sides have moveable trays or ink attachement. Very shaky unit.Epson Service Center in Bangalore didnt co-operate to check and rectify the paper loading issue hence had to return the product.
4,Dont forget that its mainly a document printer not a photo printer. So paper GSM is limited .
2,"The product is of very poor quality as already brought to your notice through customer service.It was pointed out to you that as my interaction with Epson company,one should not buy their products through Amazon as the quality of such products is compromised by Amazon.For ggenuine and good quality one should buy only from Epson.This has been proved right as the printer supplied by you is of very poor quality.It keeps on going out of order and the wuayof prints is really very poor."
5,"Very good, print quality are good too, (though this my first day of usage) . Will be reviewing in future more about the printer after necessary user trial."
5,"During this lockdown, I wanted to engage my kids with their activities and wanted to have a mid-range printer function only device and after a lot of research and the amazon reviews I have made my mind to settle with this Epson printer and I would say this is a good decision.Pros:1. Compact Printer.2. Delivered fast from Amazon.3. Printing quality is good. Both image and texts are coming perfectly.Cons:1. Installation from the Epson takes their sweet time and needs a constant follow-up.2. The technician who came to install didn't have an idea about how to install the device. ( so I installed myself, by downloading the driver and watching YT videos. He simply was standing)So overall product is good and Epson may WANT to improve the customer service."
1,Not a good printer. I bought in 6999 R's.  After 15 to 20 colour prints the quality went down. Need to clean head again and again.  There are  ink lines  on the print. Print quality so poor. I returned it and very thankful to Amazon customer care for providing refund of the product.  Love the way Amazon takes care of the customers.
5,"I love this printer.  Print quality of Good.  Not as good as a laser printer but good enough for all practical purposes.  I have used normal A4 paper so prints on photo paper should be excellent.  It is easy to install.  Having used inkjet printers in the past, I am happy with this machine."
5,Very very good. Print quality are decent & speed is also adequate for home or small office. Economy of print is also great as every print take insignificant amount of ink ank ink bottle are cheap and also individual ink bottle are sold separately.No issue on paper I have never faced problem of jamed paper.I certainly recommend for my friends & colleague!
4,You need to put in the the whole ink of the bottle and have to wait for 20 minute or so before a print.Driver:  Setup with direct USB was pretty easy. I didn't have a CD drive in my laptop so dowloaded the driver from web.Making it wireless: Making it wireless was a bit of challenge. I use my wifi router USB port and made it a print server and added it on my laptop with http:192.168.1.1:631/printers/printername as identified in wifi router .Mobile phone print:I am using google print to print from my mobile phone but for that the laptop needs to remain connected to the printer and the google print needs to be kept open on the laptop. I have shared the printer to everyone Google account in family. So all of them can print.Print quality: not bad at allPrinting issue: if I have a lot of page and trying to print over wifi. I am facing problem. As the print is not reaching orinter. It could be because of laptop and the doc reader I have on it. As if I do print it over the google print from same laptop works fine.Maintenance: I keep my printer powered  all the time as lots of website says. It goes power off on it's on if not used for long time.Noise: little noisy but acceptable and as it's near router it does not disturb anyone.Wish I had: I wish I could directly print fro  my mobile over wifi without using google print as it requires laptop connectivity at the same time.I wish I could print from internet without any laptop.
5,"First of all purchased this at 7499. And today it's 6999. That's bad. This printer is compatible with macbook os siera, x. Its working like charm. Drivers are available on Epson web. After installing drivers just give any documents print order it works."
5,Plug and start using with minor software install. Super easy to use. Prints faster than conventional inkjets.The printer has different settings for different types of paper qualities. So if you're going to print a photo on a plain paper the quality is not at it's full potential.Overall happy with the product.
5,"Nice printer for students , installation was simple , i had taken 600 pages printout on first day ....it was smooth and easy. Go for it."
1,"Printer collapsed in ,even after the call logged nd repaired by the engineer,it still not working.What a useless products.What useless products Amazon is providing.Need to return it nd want refund."
4,"Good packaging and delivery. Fairly straight forward installation guide. Print quality in colour is good enough for school work but not great like photo printers. Black and white prints are very crisp and clear.Does make little noise while starting and printing, so if you have a light sleeper baby, keep printer in different room or print while baby is not sleeping😔We do print 5-10 pages a week. Have to see how long this goes without running out of ink or any technical issues."
4,Never open the box. Call the company customer care and tell them the printer model and serial numbers and tell them to come and install. On the same day they will come to your place and install the printer. You don't have to do anything then only the printer warranty will be applied.

1,"Horrible product from HP. I bought it despite the negetive reviews. For gods sake dont buy it. No option for automatic double sided print, need to feed it into a clumsy tray manually. Ink bottle refills are not yet available everywhere. It GT-53XL, search for it yourself (Black Cartridge)Ink smudges while highlighting, its a disaster. I couldn't use it enough in the first 10 days hence I am stuck with this product."
5,"Because there were no reviews, I was very confused to buy this printer. Packaging was good and thoughtful. Setup completed in 15 minutes from hp website video. Wireless setup is very easy from HP Smart app. Main benefit is Apple Air print, Google Cloud print. Tried black print which is sharp. Tried colour print on glossy paper which looks great. Perfect colour reproduction. Don't find need to connect to usb cable. Wireless connection is very seamless."
5,"I am reviewing this printer after 15 days usage at home. its a very good printer from HP. we can configure on wifi, and print from any where. print quality is very good. Ink usage is very less. I have printed many high quality photos but looks no effect on Ink level. setup is fast and very easy. just need to install HP app it will configure product automatically on wifi as well. Amazon delivery was also very good."
1,"The packaging is so scanty that when I opened the carton, product was broken. The scanner glass totally shattered and the side plastic case also slightly broken. Amazon did not have an extra packaging, it came in HP carton. There was no packing material to safe the top part, which holds the scanner. Also the printer itself is pretty big, but not sturdy and strong enough to withstand transportation shocks."
1,"Don't buy this model, wireless printing is way too slow & more importantly it has print head problem.As soon as I connected it to internet, it downloaded updated firmware & started showing print head issue.I did some googling to troubleshoot found YouTube videos posted by HP, troubleshooting steps didn't help but I found comments from people across the world mentioning print head problem & HP should consider recalling all the printers.Luckily it was last day for me to return the product on Amazon & got full refund from the seller.I purchased Canon g3000 series printer , I am not marketing Canon but it's wat too supervisor product than HP, Check it yourself."
1,"The main usp of this product was Bluetooth printing and fast processing speed VS Hp419/415 AIO product.  Bluetooth printing was not working and to return this product it took hell of lots of time, efforts, letter from HP etc...given to amazon after that they processed my return/refund. And worst part is neither Amazon is aware of this product features nor the HP technical ground staff could support.  ONLY HP authorized people were aware of that extra feature."
2,Printer very  loud noise...very slow print outs...disappointed with printer...Very poor quality material...very delicate....Not suggested...I think it is defect item sold by Amazon.
1,It's just a month old and I am facing print head issue. Didn't expect this kind of issue to surface within a month. I am talking to HP customer support. In a nutshell I am not happy with this product as I expected that I won't face any issue atleast during the first year. Now I am talking to HP customer support so it will be a test of HP customer service and their warranty obligations too. I will provide update later on HP addresses this issue.
1,"Product has been received with carrriage cover damaged, hence printer is not working. Hp engineer has visited and submitted his report for physical damage inside printer.Need to return the item but return / replacement window is closed.Pls suggest how to get this printer replaced / rectified"
2,"other hp printers have decent quality but this model is defective. takes almost a minute for 1 print. quality of the print is not good, some times its get struck and have to click print 3 to 4 times. quite annoying to use"
1,"New Printer was delivered on 28.12.2020. This stopped working in a couple of days. Got a replacement Printer on 19.01.2021 after daily calls to HP Support & Local Service Centre. The replacement machine also stopped working within 2-3 days. Technicians from local HP Service Centre have visited thrice, last being on 04.02.2021, but they are unable to resolve the problem . Either the machine is defective or the Service Centre people are not qualified enough. As on date i.e.16.02.2021, I am still without a working printer seven weeks of buying a new one. I have been told by the Service Centre that they have put in a request for a refund, which I have not received till date. Over the last few weeks, I have had to make numerous calls to HP Support, Local Service Centre & have written to HP via email at least 6 times, but to no avail. It has been an exasperating experience to say the least  & to mention again, I am still without a working Printer."
1,"It's a good printer if it works for more than 10 days.Though print quality,cost per print is excellent. I have been facing issues in printing where in black print is not appearing. Getting through support or help is a humongous task. Better not to buy if you are not printing like 20-30 pages a day. As usual response from HP is poor and no permanent fixes for the issues. The problems replicate,support fixes the same and again problem replicates. You need to be tech savy if you have to buy this product. In general its a NO NO to buy this...Note getting a fix is a tough one,but really cannot understand why HP does not allow us to create a case id.I have printed more print information sheets than the actual prints.On Dec 1 2020.After multiple follow ups HP support team provided in house support and changed the print head.Its working now. Need to check the longevity now."
1,Total money wasteAfter 10-12 pages black print not workingNot good product Total defectiveProcessing Time of copy very1 print take one minute for printingDon't buy this productTotal defective productPrinting Quality Not GoodIn the printing this show the lining in Black printHight Electricity consumable
2,"Not so great product for printing. HP support needs to improve their service,first call to technical support, took 50min, wasted my time. Second call got escalated to a senior guy, he couldn't resolve the driver installation on Windows 7, though on HP product page it says, printer supports for Win 7. Third call also not resolved & the guy asks me to replace Win7 with Win 10! Just for a mistake of buying a Printer, do I need to upgrade OS & Hardware?Now iam using only mobile print. Utter waste of product....."

5,Seller: Appario Retail. I am giving 5 stars overall. Received a new printer in working condition. It came in its original packing. The print quality is quite good with good colour reproduction. Also very low cost printing. Printing is possible directly via the USB cable that came along with it.Printing is also possible from PC/ mobile with Wifi. Only difficulty is in initial configuration of Wifi for a common man because there was no step by step instruction anywhere. An experienced user can easily set it up after doing some research.
4,This product is awesome. Installing the heads is a bit tricky.Purchasing on Amazon is always awesome.Amazon Transportation Services is worse than the worst. But it seems like they are reluctant to improve.
1,HP are interested in ONLY sales. No demonstration call was logged automatically. Eventually I had to install and configure the printer. Upon change of WiFi network printer does not get configured. Absolutely poor technology being sold by HP in India compared to western world. Not being able to use printer for last 1 month. Technicians can not fix the matching by taking remote control of my screen. Despite complaint no one visited me so far. I will refrain from buying HP products in India.
2,Received the printer and the packing damaged. There was no repackaging items in the box to return. No warranty or instruction booklet.
1,"Better not to buy,  2nd day of the use only started trouble error E2 ,and prints very slow. Don't waste money on this and there is no return also"
4,"Thanks to Amazon for the on-time delivery. Only thing for which I am not happy with the HP technical support, I tried to reach techinal support but I was unable to connect the line after 10 tries. At last I did installation on my own through YouTube and luckily it got setup all well. But if I talk about Printer, it  is good with optimum quality as expected, go for it."
1,The print quality is extremely poor. Colour prints are not at all good.
2,The printer head broke in six months. The repair work is outsourced to third parties. They have not yet visited my house for repair due to lockdown. But 6am to 10am is still open for  business.
1,HP customer care is the worst in world. Purchased this printer one week ago and have been calling HP Customer care to get it installed. Till now no one has even tried to reach out to me for installation. Amazon customer care doesn't care after product is delivered. So guys please be watchful of HP Products
1,the setup is complex and no proper documentation available online.the tech support was found short.The installation instructions were not very helpful. Overall a hyped product and is not easy to setup.

1,This product was rcvd a month back but due to my travels I ended up opening it today and I was so disappointed to see that it has no user manual.

3,"Everything is good except print quality . I have another thermal bluetooth printer ""maestro script 57"" which I bought nearly 5 years ago. I feel print output in hoin Bluetooth printer is weak and dull looking compared to my older thermal printer but on the other hand it can store paper roll upto 25 mtrs. And printing speed is also very fast."

4,"This is first printer I bought, and first impression is really good.Easy and quick to set up. Just watch any youtube video than going through entire manual.One point though: if you have cropped any photo (from a DSLR, i never print mobile photos), you will loose the quality in the print. Must be because we loose lot of pixels when cropping. Uncropped image just come out perfect out of this printer.Mainly bought this for my daughter for school assignments. But I also do lot of photography - so wanted to buy a better one. Invest little more if you want to print photos, color print etc and its worth it"
5,Very light weight and premium looking printer.Printing speed is very good.The printer has also Artificial intelligence.It has find automatically what is wrong while Printing.
3,"Good Purchase.. The printing quality is superb.. All that matters is speed. Works fine with monochrome option but prints too slow with colour.  Sometimes pauses during printing, if number of copies increases to 4 or 5"
3,B/W print quality is Good. I feel it could be more better.Installation is easy.Color print is average
5,A very good product
1,Box seal was broken
5,Very good Printer
1,Very bad product
1,"It shows that wireless/wifi connectivity is possible, but it is not actually. I got to know after purchasing it. Colour quality is not great, just fine."
5,I am using this printer around 3 years and faced no issues at all.It is very good for home purpose.Very comfortable to use it.No maintenance at all.Refilling of ink bit expensive but fineIf not in use better to put cover on it as it will preserve the ink and not dry it fastDouble side printing facility also available and is very easy as it gives instructions how to place the paper for double side printingScan and copy quality is very good
5,"I bought this printer 3 years back. I use it for printing legal document, my kids school work, scanning documents for legal and compliance related work. Lately I also discovered that you can use it to combine multiple PDF pages. No maintenance product. Highly recommended."
1,"The product discriptiinnwrongly states that this is a wifi enables printer. It how ever is not. The printer has good functionality but unfortunately I have to return it as I needed wifi enabled printer. The low rating is for wrong description, not for the printer quality or functionality."
1,I bought this printer for 4899 and i'm refilling it with cartridges for 2000. This printer wont print with Black Ink only it needs color ink as well to print. So there is no point in setting the printer to Black Only or grey scale mode. Please do not buy this product. GO for a higher end model which requires lesser maintenance. I'm totally digusted with this fact otherwise the printer is good.
4,"The printer works well and is value for money. Nevertheless there is a valid reason to be upset with the way Amazon has paid no heed to repeated requests to stop advertising this product as having WiFi connectivity. This is wrong in the eyes of the end-user and a bunch of lies even to the most aware consumer. Please be careful before you buy such a product. You may uphold its quality, still realizing that somewhere down the line you have been BLATANTLY CHEATED by these marketing zombies."
1,"The print qaulity is very bad , I ahve purchased this product seeing the seller discription that it has wifi , it's my mistake that I haven't checked in details , but the info providedby seller was wrong .Contacted Amazon , finally after a week of conversation they agreed to refund the amound .thanks Amazon for thatReagrding the product .Print qaulity for black and white is too bad , it's very much faided , photo quality on A4 photo paper is adj ustableCall connectivity is the main problem , to laptop also printing is a problem . Again u cannot use printshare or any app to connect to your phone with otg cable , this won't also work .Overall I won't suggest this to anyone who would wish to take print out from his phone and who looks for a good print qaulity ."
2,In today’s times without Bluetooth connectivity is a real pain.Plus it has started acting weird with the MacBook and doesn’t print anymore. Bought it by mistake as I thought it’s got Bluetooth connectivity.
5,Excellent performance.......easy to use........the quality of printing is awesome...👍👍👍
1,"It is very slow printer. For high quality black-white print it takes 03:49 seconds for a single page but in description it shows 8 pages per minute for black and 4 page per minute for color but it not reflect not at all. How long should I wait for it? And color print is also not a good quality it reflects like some small-small dots on color print out and I more thing that it shows many pages to print in single cartridge but only after 4 color pages it shows ink is in low condition, what the hell is this?Such a useless product it is. I m totally unsatisfied with its quality, speed but it looks nice .🙂"
1,"Amazon has mentioned 'wireless connectivity' as one of the product's features. But, it is not true. The product does not have a wireless connectivity which I realized after purchasing the product."
1,"If I had not see ""Wireless Ink Efficient Colour Printer"" in the title of product description I wouldn't have taken the printer as simple as that. After setting it up completely now am stuck with a wired printer which I never really wanted. I am shocked to be in this situation on a platform like Amazon."
1,"It cannot be used as a wireless printer. Too expensive for a normal printer at 6885, lots of other better options. Don't fall for it"
4,Have been using this product for more than a year. This printer is working perfectly for a quick copier and has a decent colour print quality for your kid's project. Have used this printer for printing on photo paper and so far the photos are showing decent clarity.
5,"Printer is great quality is also good but, not recommended for heavy usage. Cost to each print is high. It is recommended for normal individual usage."
4,The re-fills are a little expensive - all in all a great printer/scanner and copier suitable for project work and home use.
1,"Printer cost is High ... Ink jet Cartridges cost also High....So Choose another Item.... This is Waste product.. In Reliance Digital Price. 3689/- , Amazon price. 6111/-"
2,"Got problem after 1 month of use, it started eating paper and print quality is not very good!Paper getting stuck issue is very common!"
1,"in the product specification, it is written that it is wireless printer. But actually the wireless functionality is not available in this printer. I am cheated by the wrong information given in product specification."
1,This product does not have WiFi connection feature but the Amazon wrongly depicts so. Requesting amazon to refund the money and get the product returned.
1,"Product say every where in website as support with wifi, actually it doesn't have one, pathetic product doesn't have an option to increase or decrease the colour on the printer"
3,"This printer is Just Okay. Photo quality is very bad. Showing so many grains even the original one is not grainy. Borderless Printing is very good. Scan / Copy are very fast. If you are looking for a photo printer, go for any other."
5,all is one good printer.. no any drawbacks.. excellent printer ever with this purchase ..  but cost of catridge is too expensive
3,In description it’s mentioned that this printers is wifi enables . I bought this printer only because of its wife . When its delivered then I realise its not wifi enables. So please don’t write wrong products information. I am not happy at all.
5,Serving me well. Colour quality is decent. Photo prints are slow and a bit washed out but thats acceptable since inkjets are not meant for photos.Perfect for those who have to print around 50-100 pages per month.Scan quality is average. For photo or hand written scans you better get it done from a scanner with higher dpi.
5,"great home use printer-scanner-copier. got best price on amazon. had some trouble setting it up so called canon helpline, they sent an engineer who set it up free of cost. great experience so far!"
5,Very nice product
1,Not good. Since installation getting P02 error. Checked cannon website but solution there doesnt help. Couple of times tried calling Cannon help desk. Always waiting. Not happy with canon India service. Finally planning to return back.
1,Printer not working properly.. Paper getting stuck some time and need to change cartridge for shorter period.. Taking long time getting start
1,I thought Amazon is delivered good product.ut completly broken.even not able open the box.it shows broken the printer.
4,Really Good Product.....The only thing missing is WiFi Option but I can manage without it though.....From print quality perspective the quality is top notch I had used other printers too before this I had HP but compared to HP this printer gave real good quality...The only thing I didn't like is the wait time.....
1,low grade printer for very small office use.
1,No WiFi and no double side printing
5,Printing quality is ok but scanner is absolutely good
3,u will get great prints from canon..dont go fr it if u  r nt a daily user.... good product but maintnence is high... and its nt gud for ocasional users.. need to buy cartridges frequently... thanks to amazon for deliry nd safe package
1,This is not wifi supported..wrong description..no contact number available to co tact them.very bad on their part
5,Easy to use and very efficient
4,"Print quality is good, but if you are not using for a long time, the ink dries. poor om durability, as cartridge case is not of good quality."
4,"Product is very good, quality of printing is better than my previous HP printer, I would like to recommend who really want to buy a home printer"
3,The product was delivered on time. but when i opened the package only the printer was there but the power cord is missing
1,Very worst Amazon product.. I open the delivery pack printer not working...This printer has not even started!Amazon is unable to make it available to its customers by testing the products it offers to its customers.And finally.....This is how Amazon waste the time of its customers.
1,Very worst Amazon product.. I open the delivery pack printer not working... I send return request past 8 days... Problem not solved...
5,"Very good product, using from last 2 years no issue to worried"
1,There is no power cord and connecting  cord to computer
3,Good.but expected more
3,Normal working
3,"It is not 136 column, it is 80 column only. Wrong information in specification. correct specification should be mentioned. Thanks."
1,My printer not workingVery disappointed it was ordered in a much needed situations. But no response from your support
2,2 time stop working within first 5 month
5,"Print on 250+ GSM photo paper then look the quality of print, always use origional ink and good paper for quality print. This printer is best in class, wifi Direct function is also good, this is very user friendly printer u can repalce its cartage, ink, ink head by yr own hand no need to call service agent, u can give instructions by yr mobile over wifi, auto power off function available, u can clear its jammed ink by its own software no need to call service agent, u can clear its head by its own software no need to call service agent and many more function is available. Very user friendly!!!!!!!!"
5,Agar ek word me iski tarif karu to.Jummeshwari......❤️✔️☑️☑️Super se bhi uprrrrrrr
4,"Hi All, after lot of research on web, i had finalized this printer however it is not worth. it has stopped working post 20 pages of document and there is not proper support available for this in india. Careful .Update: was able to reach out and it required me to replace the toner and after which things are very much working. Therefore have revised my rating."
1,"I brought this printer and used only two day and print around 7-8 pages only after printer stopped working. technical team checked and observed its showing error due to any defect of internal board. Its really very bad experience with a largest known brand of the world,.... i feel very disappointed....."
5,"Working all fine. Compact, doesn’t need much space to keep. Easy operability. Just on/off button & Wifi button. Very easy to set up. But need a laptop or computer to set up even though it’s WiFi printer. Works well with ipad. Print quality is good & speed of printing is fast. Less noisy as compared to Canon Inktank printers. Using it for last 1 month, no issues so far. Don’t know how long the cartridge lasts."
3,"I have purchased this printer just because of printer  brand and more about use of Wifi functionality. But There are some critical things which make this printer too COSTLY!Pros:-Easy Setup on Windows10 with Driver installation.-Easy setup of WiFi from driver and print for PC.-Good print Quality-Good print speed-portableCons:-Default Printer cartridge is duplicate and has capacity of 700printing pages, mine got finished at 518prints.-""Original Printer cartridge"" has min capacity of 1500 printing pages.-Default Printer cartridge has no genuine serial no not showing in PC information page.-Printer registration is not done on official website, this make doubt of duplication of product.-No mobile WiFi printing, even after installing mobile App.-No Refill powder and chip available anywhere easily. So every time need to buy new CLONE cartridge which is too costly(1.2K).-Original Xerox cartridge is very Costly(4k-5K).-Service issuesSo in conclusion if print coast is not affordable then Wifi functionality is useless and it is better to purchase standard laser printer with toner refill capability, which makes it affordable even without WiFi."
1,"Printer is very good in all respect, print quality is mind blowing & well speed. BUT THERE IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR REFILLING OF CATRIDGE. AFTER 200 PRINTOUT CATRIDGE TONER IS FINISHED. WHEARAS HP PRINTER PRINTOUT CAPACITY IS 800 to 1000 & SUBSTITUTE CARTRIDGE EASILY AVAILABLE IN MARKET IN A ECONOMICAL PRICE UNDER RS.600 BUT XEROX SUBSTITUTE CATRIDGES RATES ARE VERY HIGH & THERE IS ALSO CHIP SYSTEM.  IN THIS GROUND PURCHASE OF THIS PRINTER IS NOT A WISE DECESION.If the manufacturing company solve toner related problems then it will be a great printer for ever."

1,I Change Almost Every Thing In 2 Months  Now Mother Problem In Motherboard
5,has been using from last one month ... very comfortable .we can also print A5 pages ..almost i have taken around 250 A5 pages .. not seen a jam till now .. i brought print share licence from android play store and using usb direct printing..for some reason the default hp plugin didnt print usb  print to printer ...
5,~Low Maintanance Cost~Repair everywhere available at lower rate.~Printing Cost is about 2.6 ru per page~as the refilling iz common so 88A Cartridge is available easily in market. and refilling cost is also low.~Cartridge options are also available.
4,no dual side printing automatically although there's an option to print both sides and there's an option given while giving print command but by changing the side of the papers manually after it prints one side of paper. Otherwise it seems to be good with decent quality prints.
3,"HP Laser jet P1108 was delivered on date as stated at the time of placing order. It was packed in the original HP cardboard box and looks same as in pictures on website. The contents inside included power cord, USB cable to connect printer to laptop/desktop, Installation CD and toner cartridge. My laptop doesn't have CD drive so I downloaded the driver software from HP website and installed the printer. The printer is working fine, print quality is OK. But today is first day so cannot say much. The printer prints one side of paper only if you need to print on both sides than you need to feed the paper manually. I am disappointed because I purchased it thinking duplex printer but actually it is not. Therefore, this review is for those people specially who are looking for auto duplex printer, please don't be misguided. Otherwise the printer is nice. I will post another review after using the printer for atleast six months."
5,"Good value for money, easy to use. Toner capacity is little less but otherwise good. Print speed is good. Overall very good for home + small offices. Workmenship is good."
5,Very fast printing and easy to use. Print quality is also very good. Now I am waiting to see how many pages get printed from the first toner.It's just that I could not find any app for printing through phone. Can't trust thr third party apps.
3,"The Start Button has issues.Also, the Power Plusgthat connects from power source to printer has some kind of issues. Otherwise Printer is good, Great Speed and Quality. I think i got the product from wrong Seller? :("
4,Pros: Good for home use as well as comercial purpose. I bought it for e-commerce business. Print quality is superb. Low in maintenance. Low cost in printing.Item delivered within the promised date so cheers for seller as well as Amazon logistic team.Cons: I faced problem during installation of printer driver which have to be done automatically later I done it by extracting driver files. For warranty updation I had submitted my POP to HP portal which still not updated by HP Team.Conclusion: Recommend Product.
4,"I have been using this product for last two months..... One thing is to be remembered that when it activates, it requires 360 watt power...... so don't use it in low voltage.....otherwise printer will stop and red light will go on...... Except it, no problem is yet noticed.......................I recommend it for home & small office use."
5,I am very happy with this HP LaserJet P1108 printer. It works amazing and printing is very smooth with low cost. I highly recommended for small Office and Home use for those who are looking for a Black and White Printer.It does not have a scanner but who used scanners these days while everyone got a smart phone.  It is super easy to install and connect with pc.
5,"Great product by HP.  Old is gold: old model but highly reliable. Low maintenance. Single function makes it super special: just print and no other useless features. #One most important thing i discovered: HP doesn't allow mobile printing feature for this model, But here is a good news, an android app available in good play store ""NokoPrint"" works very well with this printer. Easy to to connect. Just don't forget to switch on OTG port settings.  So, if you were to ignore this printer for non-mobile printing feature, you have a solution now!!"
5,"Hey friends, I had purchased this printer in 2014, for just Rs. 5298. As you can see, the price was really low at that time. I have been using this printer for more than 5 years continuously, without any problem. You can trust HP printers without any doubt. Giving it 5 stars."
5,"Some black dots appeared on printout.Otherwise a great product.Very easy to install, easily add on the Google cloud print."
5,very easy to use there is no button printer you just have to give command through pc and it will print and print quality is awesome one thing is that it supports A6 size which is used for printing amazon shipping labels if you are seller on ecommerce all good
5,The print quality is amazing but the installation was a challange as the cd that came along was a legend and the drivers for windows 10 (forget instaling for a Mac) were also not so easy to find had to call my IT guy to fix the issue
1,The printer will defintely print good as it is a laser printer..but worst service given from retailer and hp both....Retailer did not keep any return policy..once you are stuck with this printer you are stuck forever.... has way too hectic installation...hp is the worst brand to order any product from....their service guy could not himself install this printer on my computers ...their CD also doesnt function well...hardly manage to install the printer with the faulty CD...but the irony is my printer csn never be installed if i lose this CD...NEVER BUY THIS PRINTER OR ANY HP PRINTER !! Never
3,Printer is good. It is very base model. Issue is it does not have auto print on both side. We have to collect the first page and feed the paper or back side printing.
1,Damaged printer was delivered hence order cancelled and requested product return. The product is expected to be lifted today
5,"Print quality is exceptional! My cd didn't work but the drivers are available in the official website, so I downloaded them from there instead. Instructions were also available so it pretty easy to install."
5,Excellent Quality Low cost Laser Black and White Printer.  Though it seems to be priced higher initially  but the running cost for printing is very low. Ideal for small offices and home use.
5,ProsLaser printingcost effecitvefastwe can print on both sides(manually)ConsStill not observed anyOverall--Decent product hoping good life.i research for many days and gone for it.Happy for this purchase.
4,Costly printer. Not sure why it is very costly.Other than than product is good and features also.
5,nice product. using since 1 year
5,PRINTING COST IS VERY ECONOMICAL.BRAND NEW PRODUCT WAS RECEIVED.5-YEARS COMPLETE NOW IS IN RUNNING CONDITIONS.
4,"I received my printer today....being from non technical background , it was a bit tough for me to install the printer but with all odds I was able to do that and now the prints are really good....I must say that it is best laserjet printer at this cost ...Must buy this"
5,I would like 2 thank Amazon for its quick delivery (before as scheduled) product is awesome and installation procedure is user friendly and printing quality is very crisp though i took 500 pages printout and found same quality printing from the very beginning any it's speed is very much satisfactory.
1,Weighting the review after 1 month of use..very upset about the performance of the product..not expecting this kind of performance from a brand like hp. Printer getting very very very slow if continue print just 10page at a time....not recommended to buy..
5,"Liked this product,one can go for purchase if  he is in continuous use...."
1,"Dont buy it, printer not working in 15 days, it wont power on & frequently getting auto power off....Costumer support is an auto bot nobody listen to you they just show trouble shoot vedio....Not expected from Famous brand HP...."
5,must go product. still i havent taken too many printouts. only home use. but dinding it good. later if any issue comes i will update you.
5,Great printer. Hopefully the print cost will be significantly lower than the inkjet printer I bought earlier
5,product is good.. but packing is verry poor.. nice printer for home and office used.. print cost verry low..
5,"Excellent delivery time, good printer for home/office, extremely error free & easy DIY installation guid & process......5 minutes total time from unboxing to 1st print. Highly recommended."
5,"Using this for almost 5-6 months now, working perfectly for me.I take around 150-200 pages monthly.Till now no ink refill done.Worth my money."
5,packing was not as expected otherwise everything ok
2,SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE PRINTER FROM THE FIRST USE ITSELF. JUST BEEN 5 DAYS NOW.REVIEW AFTER 4 MONTHS- SMOKE STILL COMING OUT OF THE PRINTER BUT ITS STILL WORKING. GETS HEATED UP AFTER 10-15 PRINTS.
2,It does not work with the new MacOs Big Sur update. It worked fine with Catalina but it doesn't anymore. I don't know what to do. I guess I am gonna have to wait for a new update from HP. DlApple users don't buy.
4,As HP brand printers are always best ..Iam using this printer from last 7 years..No issues
5,"Good laser printer at low price. installation also very easy  ,super fast delivery by amazon, I got it in kerala, malappuram within two days from Maharashtra based  seller , go for this if you are looking for a cheap and best basic laser printer."
5,Printer Quality 4/5Amazon delivery 5/5Print Quality 5/5Printer speed 4/5
5,"I was searching for a suitable inktank multi-function printer with auto duplex function for home use. Unfortunately, most of the low cost printers available in the market are single side printers, ie, no Autoduplex function was available even in the range of 20,000/-. Finally, I shortlisted Canon, g6070, Epson 6190 & brother MFP-910dw. All the 3 printer's price was around 25K. It delayed my purchase further. Meanwhile Brother introduced their new range of printers including this model on Nov-20, it took one more month to get available for online purchase.This is a feature rich printer which has more features than other cosltly 25k printers.Main features are,1) Autoduplex. It makes possible Hassle free printing of books2) Auto Document Feeder for Scanning multiple pages without any intervention.3) Wifi Connectivity.4) 2 Paper trays. One is multi purpose tray.5) Filling of ink tanks is easy.6) Easy setup pf printer.7) can print more thick paper than other printersI recommend to use 80 GSM paper for normal printing purpose. To reduce paper jamming complaints,Printed multiple A4 size full page color photos and a text book in color for my daughter. Ink level is still maintaining at 75%.Go for it."
5,"First day review - Printer is super easy to setup. BUT - if you are buying online, chances are high that you will get UNABLE TO PRINT E3 error. Call BROTHER support and some one will come very soon. This is a common issue where the wireless network card gets loose inside the printer. Customer cannot fix this and this has to be fixed by brother support. It's a 2 minute job. Prints are very nice."
4,"The printer's core printing hardware is good. The print quality is very good so far. I have tried duplex printing feature, copied a few pages and printed a few A4 size photographs. The print quality is good everywhere. Photographs turned out to be really nice. Haven't tried ADF for copying or scanning so can't comment. But for me, the software is let down .. specifically the smartphone app. The look and feel of their main android  app feels like the work of a school project! That would have been acceptable if there was a lot of functionality in the app but there isn't. Also the display on the printer seems to be a couple of generations old along with the navigation software onboard the printer. All in all, while the printer's hardware beats the competition by offering ADF, duplex printing and good quality prints etc at this price point, the software is generations behind HP in my experience. MY 7 year old HP printer (HP 3515) which was less than one third the cost of this printer had a better onboard software than this printer. And we can't even begin to compare the app."
5,"If this printer costs one and a half times that of other similar ink tank printers, there is a reason. And it is worth it.The speed, print quality and convenience it offers over other models in the category is unmistakable.The automatic feeder and auto duplex saves a lot of time and paper."
5,"Initial impressions :- Delivery took almost a week, however, the package was received untampered (considering the total weight of ~10kgs, a job well done)- First time setupThe setup was fairly standard. Follow the guide displayed on small LCD screen. Hardly takes 5 mins.Only the wifi password entry interface is bit annoying.- PrintTried wireless print function only. Standard A4 size printing is pretty smooth and fast.Photo printing on A4 glossy paper (180gsm) with fine settings took a little extra time. But, print quality is pretty good.- ScanScan using ADF is new for me. Printer does it's job nicely. However, one thing which we don't get is the scan for a 2 side printed page ( technical word could be duplex scan)- CopyLike scan, Copy function is also butter smooth.2 sided page copy I am yet to figure out.Overall, a decent printer with a decade old UI :P"
5,"Very feature rich printer. Print quality is good. In this budget other brands do not offer the features of this printer. Setup was a breeze through mobile app. The website needs more work. It was a bit daunting task to register the printer, and there was no confirmation Email from Brother. Although I got a request number.I have set it up via ethernet for stable performance. Can also connect through WiFi / USB. Overall a good all purpose Printer.Update: Got confirmation Email the next day. The product is registered, warranty activated. Couldn't be any easier..."
5,"Best printer out there under this price range. Only feature which is not there is fax. I am sure most people would not need it anyways. Apart from that duplex printing , adf, multiple trays, borderless printing .... everything is there. Colour Prints on glossy paper hardly costs 4-5 rs if you buy ink from Amazon"
5,Print quality is good Scanning is fast.It was very easy to install including Networking (no professional help required).At this price the function/features provided are truly worth it.
3,"Low Print quality compared to InkJet - Prints are not sharp, Black ink is not black enough, No shine to the ink, so not good for photos. Good enough for school work and kids , but not suitable for professional submissions.The ADF is not two sided, even though it can print on both sides."
3,"Not the best I would say. First, it came with that dreaded E3 error. Then post it got fixed, still not convinced if the print is that good - I always feel its a bit washed out colors. Next, the wifi is pretty bad, to an effect that if the printer goes to sleep mode, it does not connect back when a print command is given, you have to WAKE it via restart. A lot of issues, but then you don’t get that much in a single package - ADF and Duplex Printing."
4,"Value for money. Though scanning speed and colour prints are slow, but they are of very good quality. Even pictures on a photo paper (4X6 in) are near perfect.Installation was super easy and print/scans are easy over WiFi. The s/w can be improved.Most difficult is configuring the printer due to one Line LCD screen and using buttons to go third the menus.All in all a great product for home and small office use."
5,One of the Best all in one Printer at Reasonable Price. This Printer providing  good Pictures quality.If you taking Photo copy then It will provide little bit Fade Colours. I mean Colour will be Light. Maybe it’s Effect because of Wrong setting. I am not sure about that’s.  But as per features it’s good Printer.
5,"Though printer has arrived later, but it came with safely. Too many option available same like higher printer. Print quality superb what I expected."
4,Easy To Use 👍Print Cost & Refilling Cost Pocket Friendly 👍Black Print Is Just OKColour Print Is Not Upto The Mark
5,"i will tell the features that is not mentioned  anywhere1. it has automatic function to cover the nozzles to protect them from drying and clotting, it's just awesome feature2. you can print 2 pages in a single page one side using only printer no need of mobile or computer, it's also a useful feature.at last, this product satisfied me bacuse at this price i bought it is earned in just 6 months without even changing ink."
1,"Update : 24 May 2021Returned second time as same error in the system. Packaging is worst from seller. DO NOT BUY FROM Appario retail.First review:From first startup showing an error "" cannot print E3"". Junk device sent to me. Returning the product. Would prefer a better seller."
5,"Like the mobile app the best. It detects printer and prints.Also, ""sendto"" on mobile pops up this print app as one destination which makes using the printer very easy.Love it so far."
5,"Decent print quality, easy to set up wifi. I am happy with the purchase and the printer functions."
5,100% recommended for both home and official use. I’ve been using this for 2 months and I’ve not refilled it (taking around 10 prints everyday). The print quality is also very good. Very easy to use.
5,My first printer and truly outstanding features rich .
5,"In this price range this is  very good printer...Scan, Printing,Xerox all are working well"
5,It is the best printer of 2021 with all the features.
3,Printer is super easy to setup. BUT - I will not get print due TO PRINT E3 error.  Amazon refund me my money easily.
5,"Duplex Printing, Speed of Printing, ADF, Wifi"
2,"Product seems good but not sure about service. Product is delivered on time, but not received any call for instruction and demo. I am looking for the same."
4,The product is handy.Printing and Quality is good.User interface is simple.
5,Photo printing is simply superb. Worth my spend.
4,The product is very good at its price print quality is good and it is user friendly mainly the mobile application very good we do almost all work from mobile
5,Excellent product!!!
5,Print quality is good.
5,Good Wifi Printer cum scanner it also has automatic document feeder.Delivered early. Thanks.
3,Unable to set up wifi printing
5,"Awesome, easy to use. Love it."
5,Option and model super but compared to Epson l565 printing quality waste
4,"Print speed is fast, quality is good. But noise is too much during printing"

4,Restaurant billing
5,This product is awesome. Printing quality is quite nice. The price  is also attractive. I am using it for last few months and till now i didn't face any issue.Built in quality of this printer is very nice.
5,"Very good product, have both USB and Bluetooth connectivity.One each of USB and Bluetooth connected device work together, good quality printing 58mm,  product meet the requirement of POS printer."
1,Defective
4,I use other billing app.Is this printer will work with that?? warranty ??
1,Just had the printer installed last night as it was delivered yesterday in the noon. The ink had leaked half and this is a new product.Kindly have it replaced I had ordered this printer for my work and Now I have to run pillar to post just to have a print.
1,The printer in itself is good however HP is not repairing the printer under warranty because the serial number on the bill is different. Amazon has taken the money and left me with a 20 day old printer withought warranty. And amazon is not helping with this problem of wrong bill.
5,"I was looking for a moderately priced ink-tank printer which could  offer multiple functions of  print-scan-copy in a wireless mode and support web based and smart phone printing options. I found all these in HP Ink Tank Wireless 410 printer.Got it today.  My observations:Pros:a. Excellent packingb. Crisp instructions to installc. Smooth installation process (including wireless set up)d. Smooth printing (direct, web, via email, smartphone)e. smudge and spill free ink fillingf. User removable print headg. Duplex printing (manual change over)h. Booklet printing that is easy to manageCons:a. Paper tray has limited capacityb. You have to be savvy to learn the functioning of Control Panel of the printer (you will need to download manuals from the web)c. Though the printer comes with installation CD, they encourage you to download the software from the web.d. Paper out area has a big opening and is likely to have dust accumulatione. No easy way to do a quick scan (wish they had a shortcut for it)f. allows paper thickness of upto 90 gsm only (desirable was at least 100)g. it makes you dump lot of polythene and plastic as a part of installation. Even the print head area has a full packing which one feels bad discarding.In short, be ready to spend some time to familiarise yourself with the printer.Despite the cons, it is good value for money. Best in its class, I would feel."
1,"I bought this one for my home office. The first impression was good and printing was fine. After the first use, I didn't used the printer for a week. When I tried to print again, the printer didn't print at all, I got a blank sheet. When I searched a lot on the internet; I found that, this is a common issue. If you won't use the printer on a regular basis, the ink forms clotting on the print heads and you can't use it anymore without servicing the heads. I did a servicing and after that, each alternative day I printed something to keep the printer alive. After 5 months of use the printer stopped working, it is not detecting the print head anymore. When I tried to find a service centre there is literally 'none' nearby my place (There is only 1 service centre in the whole area which is 50KM away from my place).The issues I've faced so far:1) Ink clots on printhead if you won't use it on a regular basis2) There is no service centres nearby3) Ink to print head everything is very costly4) The ink level indicator never worked in my case5) The software/printing apps are really badI won't recommend this product to anybody, it's a money pit. You will lose a lot of money to just maintain this printer. I regret buying this one. Good bye to HP & it's products."
3,"In the product description, it can take upto 6000 pages black and white. But, actually on the box it can take upto 4000 pages only... please try to give genuine information as you can"
5,"It's the best wireless tank printers and low priced too.. I got it in just over 10k after sbi card discount and amazon pay balance. the print quality is far more superior crisp and clear than Epson and other printers  which give light and dark bands in draft printing ..I installed and wireless configured the printer myself but others may require some technical assistance for  installation and first run, it has built-in wifi direct sofor your android phone  just download hp smart remote for printer and hp print driver app and you can scan print configure and operate your printer wirelessly from your phone even without a wifi router .. the only thing is I didn't get the dustproof printer cover offered by some sites with this printer"
1,"After first installation, getting error as print head.. Though followed all instructions. Please help to fix or return the item"
4,"I have used to hp printers in UK the all in one wireless is much better quality and prints both side of paper.Features that lack in this printer1. No card reader, no pen drive reader2. For the price it could have had a good display screen for printing status.3. Ink is expensive4. Back side printing is manual.5. For 6000k we get very good printers out of country here even after paying 14k lacks many good features."
5,"I took a risk and bought this printer, as I'm using Linux mint on my computer...nothing was mentioned about it working on Linux. Before I got it, I had a tough time as to what should I do if it doesn't work on Linux, finally I bought it as it also has wireless connectivity...I'm happy to report this:The pros:Wireless, so u can print straight from the smartphone,Also can print thru a router, easy to set up.Usb printing for windows and Mac.I had trouble with Linux usb, but after going to the hplip download website, managed to get everything working.. very good printing, cheap and effective for home printing..Value for money, as cartridges last long.Scanner works well, so xeroxing is easy, even coloured .Setting up is easy once u read everything correctly..Paper is top loading, so even thick paper will work for cards n stuff.No adaptor, straight power cord connection, India plug.Ink levels can easily be seen.Ink refills come with the printer. 1 black and 3 coloured (CMYK).All settings can beThe cons:No support drivers for Linux on the cd., Only windows and Mac.Power button difficult to make out, as it isn't printed with white ink. Can only make out after led lights up."
1,"hopeless printer, worked fine for 2 days after installation, then printer paper feeding mechanism is faulty, takes a bunch of papers altogether , and they get stuck inside, to retrieve a single printout you have to struggle for such a long time , that one feels, absolutely cheated by HP. for logging into customer care you have to spare atleast half an hour to satisyy their introductory querries. wifi printing worked fine for initial 2 days, now showing error in printing. trying to resolve the matter with HP cust. care, logged my complaint No. :  5035382582, dated 09/08/19. Personally speaking, it seems to be a total loss of money."
3,"I have bought this product recently. Everything was ok, until I tumble with the problem of configuring the printer with D link DIR -816 wifi router.  Had to raise a HP service request to make a visit technical engineer to investigate the issue and fix it.  After hearing the issue the HP technical engineer informed us that HP printer don't support D link DIR-816 router. And also, informed there are many router which HP Printer don't support. There is workaround but that's not a full proof & fully functions.After googling found that same issue is faced by many customers. HP Printer don't support all router.I would request Amazon & the OEM that please ensure you publish all the list of Router to all customer which are NOT supported by HP ink tank wireless printer. This will help to avoid harassment & bed review for HP product.Customer who are reading this review, please ensure that your home wifi router supports HP Printer."
1,This HPS printer is USELESS. The display shows that it is connected to Wifi but the printer does not print. You need to switch it on and off 4-5 times before the printer is recognized. It's probably the worst HP printer I have used in the last 20 years.
4,"This printer is ok for the price. Easy to set up. Appears durable (just got it today) and has a nice form factor. Yet to try the wireless printing capabilities.The print time (color) for basic documents without too many graphics is ok and not too slow. The scanner however is a major let down. Disappointing color rendering and scanned image quality (sub par resolution). Scanning is sloooow!Buy this printer only if you don't have to do much document / image scanning and if you are only looking for printing documents.I haven't yet printed any photographs. Will add to this review once I try thst out.Update: It is now a year (October 2019) since I bought this printer. Just printed some 300 pages over the year! The tri-color printhead stopped working. HP support replaced the printhead (onsite service) within 24 hours! Very impressive service. WiFi connected, works like a charm and the best is no cords! Not happy with the photo printing though."
4,Good quality colour print...Low cost copy...Totally too good
4,"So i got this printer for a good bargain about a month back. Here is what I like about it -1. Very easy to setup; Just follow the guides step by step and you cannot go wrong. Connected to wifi very easily as well. The overall setup took about 45 minutes but, then i was slow and reading each step carefully.2. Offers a web based console that keeps a complete check on the printer's activities, how many pages it has printed and so on; Very useful.3. Print quality - Good as it can be. Haven't printed any photos. Documents have been crisp.4. Supports Apple's wifi protocol; Can allow you to print from any devices without any hassles.5. Supports wifi scanFew things that I feel, i didn't like.1. Printed paper collection tray; Its very delicate. I feel if any pressure is put, it will break down.2. Supports only manual back to back printing (its in the specs); Now if you try to turn the sheet and try to feed it, few times it slips thru a minor gap between printer and feeder.Overall impressions - after using it for nearly a month, i am happy and can't really complain. I hope now the ink tank does stand it promise and give me an ability to print about 3000 odd papers. that will be 1 ink tank fill for a year."
1,"Warranty is as per hp website started in Nov-18 where as I purchased in 07-may-19, HP eprint not working, print quality is dull colors, not displaying ink levels in webpage. Very pathetic service by hp customer care,They chat with for 4hrs and could not able to solve the issues and they don't want send  their engineer for solve the issues....As per hp customer care supplier already switched on this device hence warranty will start from that date... Hence the supplier cheated and he is not provided details of extended warranty claim.."
4,"Cons--Slightly large, space consuming-Printing is a little slow-Makes some noise-cannot take a print on both sides of the paper automatically. One has to manually reverse each sheet to get print on the other sidePros--10paise per print-wireless, print directly from phone-free installation by professionals-cheaper than market price at amazon-very high quality scan and print-photocopy function is also resonably good-very easy to useVerdict- go for it!"
2,"I faced a host of issues with setup:It arrived fast, but there are problems with technical support and the seller.1. Seller has started the warranty before sale. My printer had the warranty period started 1 month before I even purchased the product when I checked online. Please type HP warranty check and make sure you don't have this issue! If you do, call HP support, show them the invoice and payslip with serial number and urgently update the mismatch. It will take 24-48 hours.2. When I tried to set up the printer, I ran into some issues with the wifi setup, and trust me it takes a tech savvy person at least 45 minutes to figure out how to proceed. So then I wanted to request a HP installation engineer (which every customer with a new product is entitled to).3. The seller has *already* used my printer's unique serial number to register an engineer installation for someone else some time before selling me the product. I cannot have a free HP engineer come to my house now as they only do it once and HP asked me to contact the amazon seller directly. So if you need an engineer's help, then good luck. You will have to call HP technical support and do everything yourself like I did.4. A 'Start Here' blue booklet/guide is missing in the box and a setup CD. This made figuring out how to setup 2x harder and I had to look up the HP manuals online.5. Wifi setup isn't smooth, even when I installed everything correctly and followed instructions. I had to open my TP link router management webpage and set up the WPS link through that - or else the wifi will keep disconnecting from the printer.6. I set up the Google Assistant Voice activation. Just download the google assistant app and say 'speak to HP printer' and it will add a new printer.  Color print is ok. 1200 dpi scan will be a bit slow, lower resolutions much faster. The same with printing.7. The seller responded to my question about the warranty and engineer request by saying 'if product is under warranty please contact HP' after selling it to me less than 3 days ago! I may return it and buy directly from HP.8. The printer itself is good, for initial setup check youtube or type hp 410 manuals on google and set up with that. Not too complex - fill the ink, insert the printerheads and run an alignment. Download the HP smart app.Bottom line, buy directly from HP for peace of mind regarding warranty and ease of installation, or try another seller. I may return it as an exchange period of 7 days is available, but I don't want to end up with the same seller again."
2,"It's been more than a year since I purchased this one. Printed quality was great initially during first few pages/photos, for a month.Then lines started appearing, requiring very frequent troubleshooting through hp smart app. After 4-5 months usage, black printhead stopped printing. Online and on telephone support didn't help, so finally customer care guy came and after checking, replaced the black print head, under warranty.Then after a year and 1 month exactly, after a total print count of less than 150 pages, the color cartridge stopped being detected. And then, it doesn't print anything, simply freezes at power on asking to check cartridge (print head), though black printhead is detected perfectly.Now no warranty, so customer care asked me to purchase the printhead. When I asked that it's printed less than150 pages so far, how can print-heads are getting spoilt so soon. The epic explanation: ""printhead delivered as part of new printer aren't of that good quality, you need to buy new one""..Another problem, even if one printhead is faulty, and replaceable as a single piece, you need to buy both (black & color) as a set because HP doesn't sell them individually. And you've got no option, it's monopoly as usual, once you've purchased the printer.This printer looks good and wifi works perfectly, but that's not what I paid money for. Print quality is good only when it's new, and then it turns frustrating. Paper fetching also doesn't work smoothly, I many times need to keep shaking the paper in tray before it finally detects.I've got a far cheaper black ink laser printer from another company working perfectly for last 11 years. This one has given me enough headaches in one year itself.And as the ink-tanks are not getting empty faster, looks like hp has decided to compensate by selling more printheads. I don't know how often I'll need to order them.I wouldn't buy any printer from hp in future for sure."
1,The Blackberry offer displayed on the product page is not a available for printer model 410. Amazon and HP are misguiding with this offer. BEWARE of fraud !
1,"This has reference to the HP 410 series wireless printer that I bought from Amazon on 27th Oct . We had requested for an installation and the HP engineer arrived on 5th Nov. Upon arriving the engineer Vishesh arrived and  was under severe cold however we did keep safe distance.He checked the printer and was able to take the first printout. However, post which he stated that there is an alignment issue to the printer and it needed to be reset and he was not able do it and had to be taken to a service centerHow does HP check field engineer assigned how is suffering from Cold and thus a potential case of COIVDA printer that has been purchased 10 days back and one is unable to do an installation is deplorablePlease have this addressed ASAP and revert back.The support is par below expectation from HP. but this at your risk"
5,An awame product...print quality great...easy to install...photo print quality also great...material is strong...nd easy wifi print...whenever you will go for wireless print please turn off your mobile data otherwise you will not get print...
5,"Amazing response from Amazon, delivered within a day.Product arrived intact. No issuesMy self installed, needed youtube guide video and manual support. With few errors i completed installation. Took 30 minutes to take first printout wirelessly from desk top. And installed this printer in all the gadgests. Now i can print from anywhere outside home  or from office through internet. All set up took 30-45  minutes.* Print quality looks watery when coverage is more, need more time to check. B/W text prints ok.Cons.. printer is slightly wider, expected from the photo an eveb better compact size.More on print quality asand when i face challenge."
1,This printer is good as long as it works. It is prone to frequent problems and HP support for its printers is very poor. I bought two printers because of quality print and ease of use but both developed defects even after minimal use. Both were installed in different cities. To add to the misery HP support is extremely difficult to find and connect.
5,"Hello Friends, Printer is awesome right now, don't know it's future. Printer packaging is awesome got every item in good condition. I have printed on 150gsm glossy paper at best settings and it's quality is awesome. I have purchased onsitego 2 year extended warranty and registered the product on both websites HP and Onsitego, Now my printer is protected from 29/Sep/2019 to 28/Sep/2022. MRP is 15769 Rupees but I got it on deal of the day for 9999 Rupees. You can go for it. Amazon is Amazing."
1,"It take almost half hour to print 2,3 pagesWorst printing speed"
1,"We purchased the product on 16th October whereas the database of HP shows item purchased on 21st September 2019 hence warranty expired on 20th September 2020. This is not fair. Also, i have not used the item much and now the black ink does not come out. I thought this would be user friendly. Not really. Seller, please help out to get the warranty done right."
1,"Don’t buy; especially if there are any tagline as ""Amazon's Choice"" do double check the reviews, else you shall end up with the trouble as I am; the product has no support from HP. I have issues with the print quality and now I am struggling to get help. So no point of having any warranty as HP themselves do not offer any help."
1,"Disappointed for the first time with Amazon customer care. The product description says that it is replaceable within 7 days but even though I was having a defect in my printer, even then there is no return possible. It’s better that Amazon doesn’t display false information on the product page. In my printer the black ink tank is not filling completely but Amazon refused to replace the printer as promised and now I’m left to using a defective printer. Really disappointed with Amazon this time. The Amazon tech support didn’t know anything about the problem and simply asked me to contact HP support to get it repaired or whatever but no replacement as promised on the display page."
2,"this printer is waste of money, there s nothing more thsn a inkjet printer. buy inkjet instead of inktank , specially of hp.inktank printer is a inkjet printer with just ink in side tanks.  dont go for inktank printerseven epson inktank is better than of hp.some of epson printers have print on cd/id card facilities. epson have better design too."
5,"Wi fi set up though took a little bit time but once done , you can print just easily from your mobile, print quality is good too and plus it's got ink tanks attached so there's no hassle of filling ink cartridges etc...go for it ..yes recommended ."
1,HP is a established brand. Bur seller sold a printer which was already registered for warranty which had expired wirhing a month of purchase. After some time i noticed all ink from one inktank has leaked out spoiling the printer. Then only I noticed that Appario has sold out of warranty printer which was supposed to be for one year. While quality of print is okayish. Nothing great to write about. WiFi worked. Normal document printing is ok. Sometimes paper gets stuck.Terribly disappointed in the product and behaviour of seller. Amazon should take note of the malpractices indulged in by Appario for selling out of warranty printer.
2,"The printer turns out to be one of the worst purhase decisions we made.It worked fine for 2 months in the beginning but the condition is really bad after that.1.It gives error 2/3/4 which are only described in online video platforms as non debuggable errors.Once you get that error you as a user cannot solve the issue yourself.Saw various videos which said a paper should be stuck but there was none. Checked using torches and various methods mentioned on online video platforms. It kills your time and gives you no output.The only option you have is to wait for 3-4 days after which the printer decides that it can now print again.2. Color Printout on glossy sheets is smudgy.When you buy a Rs12,000 color printer you would want to take out some photos on a glossy sheet.The printer let's you do that but you cannot touch the printed part of the paper for ever. IF you do it leaves a black residue and smudges the whole photograph. The printout is simply untouchable for ever.3. Printer stops during Printing.Sometimes the printer stops midway during printing. You just wait and cajole the printer to throw out the sheet but it won't. It holds on to the sheet even though it has printed it and you cannot use your print.4. Device does not allow Wifi printingWe have an airtel wifi in the house for 5 years now. Quite consistent in speed and performance.The HP printer allows wifi printing on certain days from the mobile and on other days you need to switch on the laptop to print using wifi.The mobile wi-fi printing the main reason we purchased the printer simply does not work.5. HP Smart App.The HP smart app does not show any error or problem even when the printer shows Error3/4. It keeps showing the printer is Ready.We keep sending the prints but nothing get's printed.6. Poor Customer Service.a. The customer service number is not reachable from Airtel phones. It gets disconnected within 1 second of dialing the call.b. From prepaid vodafone numbers it says the call is chargeable and disconnects the call.7. The printer has already broken down twice in the 3 months that we have owned it. Ticket logging with HP is a headache. You are asked to explain and try everything on your own from fiddling with the printer when it is on to taking out the printer heads and replacing them back when the printer is still on. At the end of a 30-40 minute conversation they log your ticket and assign an engineer a day later. the engineer further takes between 3-4 days to come and set the printer right.Both the times parts had to be changed and that is what we were trying to explain to the Customer Rep but they make it sound as your mistake.(Paper would be stuck, not enough ink, paper gsm quality, paper company, type etc)Alas the poor quaity problem remains the same. If you buy a home printer you are likely to suffer for having paid these companies."
1,It's been 1 month running behind HP for service as printer is not working but no resolution. Seems if you buy from Amazon you will not get service. Worst product. Don't buy.
3,"The black cartridge goes bad very soon. HP support is good that they replace it till the printer is in warranty but after that, you are on your own. Buy this printer if you print at least 1 page daily or max weekly. If you leave this printer without use for a longer time, chances are that cartridges head may go bad. It has gone bad for me 2nd time in 8 months as I print only for my kid's school project only when it is needed. The WiFi connection also does not work most of the time. I connect with USB cable and print."
2,"I had a epson ink tank printer for the past 8 years.It gave away due to detoriation of the ink pad.Bought this with great expectations but so far the experinece has been average to poor.Prints are average,one cannot compare it with the catridge printers.But what irritates the most is the HP smart app for android (not sure why they named is as smart).It doesn't print exce/wordl files.You need to convert it to pdf for it to show up in app.With other printers,one can open the files,enable the share option and the printer shows up.In this case the printer doesn't appear.Worst possible setup .Regreting my buy. My advice go with epson.Fantastic windows and androif interface."
1,"Seems like a very bad printer. Single page prints fine. It gets stuck on the first page if you give print command for a file with multiple pages. Sometimes, sends out blank papers. Same issue in the replacement printer too. Finally, getting a refund. Amazon support has been helpful though. Looks like HP needs to work on the hardware quality."
4,"Product is good. But the technical support from local HP partner is pathetic. The technician that has come to install the product did not know how to set up the printer on the router.(this is the main feature of the said printer).Left my premise putting the blame on the wifi router.Technician more of a 'duniya kar lo mutthi mein "" salesman. Same complaint raised on Twitter. But HP twitter handle response ..more than pathetic.Not that easy to install. Difficult for a mom technical person to install by himself/herselves.Print quality not as shown in the video. Tech support ....MORE THAN PATHETIC."
4,"After using last 2 months, i am writing this review.1. We are not using much frequently, but whenever we are using it, getting excellent print out. Nevertheless, we have taken around more than 80 pages.2. Very easy to install and use3. Very useful when taking printout from mobile. just need to connect the printer using inbuild wifi and give print. Or install the mobile app.4. A text beside button would really very helpful to know the button function for any user"
5,"Super printer and easy with HP smart app. Copy, print, scan efficiently. HP eprint is awesome allows to print from anywhere over Internet. HP afer sale service is excellent. I had problem with printer head and was replaced by HP in 1st call. Ink tanks are easy to refill and spillproof. Excellent printer overall."
4,"Product is nice but in my printer error show when I start printer, error message show cartridge end life time.What is its mean ?help"
1,"Hi, all in the specification of the product it was mentioned that it supports back-to-back printing, however after purchasing the product I found out that it does not support back-to-back printing. and you have to do it manually."
4,"Writing this review after 3 months of use. I had used HP printers for almost 10 years and I was looking for a change. After some research, I decided to buy this one. It has many pros but a few cons as well.Pros:1: Good pricing for a printer with ADF and duplex print.2: Cost per page printing is economical3: Easy to install and use4: Print, Copy and Scan functions work great.5: Print and Scan Quality is as good as any printer.Cons:1: It's a heavy printer.2: It's not easy to move around3: Makes a lot of noise if Quite mode is not being used.4: Minimum printing DPI is 600..so it can't print in Economical Mode.5: Printer preference are not easy to set.Still, I would say - It's a great value for money Printer."
4,This is good and value for money
1,all are fals information
1,Print quality is very poor
5,nice Product
5,Working very wellThanks AmazonVery fast deliveryThanks all
2,It's 2 sideo Or not
4,Happy with it
5,Good
5,Love it. Will give it a 4 star. The only problem is finding the app.
5,The machine has more RAM than comparable models. Hence it is able to print faster.The scan functionality is supported by a good software.It has a cover for the feed paper so that as to protect the paper in the tray against dust.The machine also turns on fast. I have used models from another popular brand and find hat this one performs much better.
4,the printer is a bit heavyDoesn’t need much space to place the printerPrint quality relatively very goodFast printingEasy installationNeed to down the user software from canon websiteEasy onlyGot it a bang on deal for almost 10.7K
5,I got this before 9 months i am using it form my small office business. Trust me this printer is perfect in every way. We take every day 3 to 4 copies. 8 to 10 prints and 3 to 4 scanning in a moths. very clears prints. i refilled 1 time
1,I received it this way
1,"It was a very bad experience faced with the Canon MF 3010 Printer. I could not able to print after my 64th Paper.Following are the issues I faced after that.1  Faded prints came for near 10 pages after that nothing is printed.2  After the advice, I tried to change the Toner Powder, No luck nothing is printing3  I have been asked to change the drum as well. But the service team is not confirming that even if I change the Drum.4  I have been asked to change the Catridge itself for the new printer.Asked Amazon Agent about the product and they are not ready to solve it."
3,the profile on this page says that this printer is duplex (both side printing) but in reality I am unable to print both sided so could you either explain me right way or change the information already provided immediately
5,I have the same model and using it for thirteen years without replacing any spares. Excellent printer from Canon. No paper pickup problems or paper jams. Please keep the printer protected from dust and other foreign small particles like used staple pins which if accidently get inside may cause paper jams. If paper gets stuck please follow instructions by the manufacturer to get it out the right way. Pulling the paper the wrong way may aggravate the problem. The paper pick up roller should be cleaned when necessary. Printers are electromechanical devices with sensors attached to perform the necessary functions. Dust and moisture are both enemies which may cause problems in the long run. So avoid them as much as possible. Careful occasional vacuuming and blowing will keep the printer in good condition. While changing the cartridge be careful. Do not do anything by force. The cartridge should gently glide in the rail without any obstruction. Recommend the seller as it was delivered on time and in perfectly packed and new condition. The price could be a little discounted.
3,Design better than HP. easy to use. print copy scan speed better than HP. copy and print quality is ok not better or similar to HP. I observed HP printers sound is less than canon and sharp and clear print. canon giving light print. better to go for HP Laserjet Pro M126nw.
1,Damaged product
3,Very difficult to install by searching different videos on YouTube. Still i couldn't do it. Not started using after trying a lot.
4,"Best for small home setup and light office work. For two side print, you need to manually flip the paper. You can print multiple size papers but scan a maximum A4 size. Print quality scan quality is good. You need to install drivers for scanner to work. Drivers available with pre packed CD or on the website."
5,I have been using this printer for several years now and this is my second purchase. That should explain what I think about it.
4,Printer is good.. but is makes lot sound while printing.. .. 10 k is ok for this product.. for 12k it is waste
5,"So far my experience product is good. Price is really low.It is useful for home & small office use. print quality excellent. Packaging is excellent , I expect more good products from Amazon.  transparent & hassle free service  .Also I will recommend for friends & relatives to buy product from Amazon"
5,"- Printer doesn't occupy much of space .- Prints Efficiently & prints are crisp & bold even in Toner Save Mode .- Start-up or warm-up time is less than 5 seconds .- Easy to setup like '' Plug & Play ''All features - Print , Copy & Scan work efficiently .However if Wireless Printing could be provided , it would be cherry on top .If you want to buy a affordable multi-function printer , this is a safe bet ."
3,Printing problem occurred after 6 month of very normal use... Print speed is fast but does not print properly.
5,Excellent for rapid mass monochrome printing.  Can stand considerable abuse and keeps working.
1,"No colour options, not suitable for my requirement, if I want to replace with other models which has colour options, Amazon says not possible. Waste of money."
2,I purchased this printer and I recieved a defective product. The printer prints at a very light copies. Also I am not recieving the service for the same. #Pathetic Canon..
5,Hood
1,Installing problem
4,The printer is very good but if you are planning to make it wireless with your raspberry pi then you will run into issues. Canon ones aren't usually supported by CUPS printing service and its a night mare to try to setup.So take this if you are plannign to use a separate print server or as a standalone printer. Doesn't work with raspberry pi.
4,Nice
1,It seems that it doesn't support legal size
4,Very good and useful.
5,As expected the printer met with my requirement. Found user friendly and value for money.
5,Everything of the product is perfect but the courier takes too much time to deliver the product and the service support of canon at Bhopal is fabulous.
5,Good product
5,Perfect home office printer; great deal from Amazon. Super performance; printed about 700 pages in one go and worked like a high end heavy duty document printers.
5,Good product
4,Only 100 pages print with and again refilled
1,Your deliveried printer is not working. Loss for money. This is very bad
5,Best in market in this price range
4,Print quality is very good but print quantity is not so much refill  it every 6 to 700 pages.
4,First class but wireless connection is not there
3,The printer we received within a span of one week itself we have to refill the cartridge and then its showing a drum problem that also we already replaced... The item is not meet our expectations....
1,It didnt work since the input of first pageThe very next page got jammedReally had a bad experience with it
5,"Printing , scanning quality all are top notch.The setup is easy build quality also is premium. Highly recommend."
5,Prints as per the product description.
5,heavy duty printer scanner is also good
4,"This is an amazing all in one printing-scanning-copying machine. Offers more than other models like HP.  Opted for this as it has an auto feeder, which makes copying/scanning of multiple pages much easy. In the HP machine, you had to insert and scan one page at a time. In this, you just load the pages on the feeder and it does it all automatically.The only downside was the default setup this machine comes with.  I would say its very user unfriendly. After spending few hours and browsing through all the forums and international Amazon site, I learnt how to set up this machine for best use. My printer was setup correctly, however on the wireless printing mode, it used to go to sleep mode after a few minutes, and none of my devices were able to detect the printer there after. This was a pain, as I had to eventually go to the machine and restart it to get it out of the sleep mode. Brother needs to fix this as not everyone is good with machines.Anyways, here is what you should do right after installing the software on your PC.EDIT: Before reading through the steps below. Make sure you update the firmware on the printer, as it might automatically solve the iissue. If it doesn't, then go through the steps. Firmware can be updated by downloading the Firmware update tool available here: http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadtop.aspx?prod=dcpl2541dw_as&c=as_ot&lang=en Go to the printer , Click on the Menu Button, and pull up ""Network"" settings using the buttons on the printer. Under that, go to WLAN and click on set up wizard. Use this to connect your printer to the router/wifi. Once you are connected, do the following steps.On your printer, press Menu button and :1. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP->Boot Method - Change it to Static2. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> APIPA - Change it to turn it OFF/Unchecked.3. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> IPv6 - Turn it ON.After following these steps, your printer will always stay connected to the network. If you don't follow these steps, then your printer will not show up while you try to wirelessly print/scan from your device(after few minutes of turning on the printer). I hope Brother sets up the machine to run these settings by default."
1,I strongly recommended you all dont buy very poor service from brother i purchase it before a month & i only 33 page print problem comes and 1 time motherboard changed but again problem come and no one listen even i call customer care but only delay delay delay from there sides
4,"First about price - >During Great Indian Festival Sale, I was able to get it at an unbelievable price of just Rs. 11600/- and considering its MRP is beyond 18000, its was just amazing. (10% bank discount+2k discount during lighting sale+1k cash back) Now About Delivery Experience -> Horrible. Order got lost during transit and after much request and followup Amazon ordered a new product for me at no additional cost. When the product did come after about 12 days, the delivery people were dropping the product box (which was again entirely sub-standard packing without any amazon boxing) as if it was a bag of cement.About the product ->Pros:1. A True All-in-One Laser Printer. If you do research before buying, its really hard to get every feature in a same printer. This is one such rare printer where you will get almost every feature which any average user can think of.2. The most useful feature among all is ofcourse the - Wifi & the ADF. Wifi allows you to print it from your laptop or mobile (or PC with wifi adapter). ADF allows you to copy documents by feeding them automatically. It saves a LOT of time than the conventional flatbed scanning and copying.3. It has Duplex Printing thus allowing to save time and paper both easily4. Setting up is easy just install using Drivers from CD provided or from the Website of Brother Printer and following the steps. Remember to update firmware as well.5. The Input tray is closed-type and can hold 250 pages6. At the risk of getting Warranty Void, Cartridge can be refilled as told by many. Haven't done it yet as I have just bought but YouTube is full of videos showing how to do it using any 3rd party toner powder.7. Fast and Decent Printing and Copying. Good Scanning as well.Cons:1. Costly. If compared to other brands it is costly. Toner and Drum are costly as well. But it has all features so I think its value for money.2. Cartridge cannot be refilled without getting Warranty Void. Brother Printers should provide Official Toner Powder for Refilling if not 3rd party ones.3. Delicate and a little flimsy. Quality of plastic is ok but parts are so delicate inside and out that you doubt about its durability.4. Drawing high electricity and hence cannot be used on UPS or even on most house-Inverters5. Wifi Setting up is glitchy and re-setting it up is a headache6. Noisy7.  No duplex Scanning. Only Duplex Printing. Thus while copying no use of auto-duplex feature. Auto-Duplex work only when printing.Verdict ->  If you get it within 15-16k ...go for it...Value for Money, fast and Heavy Duty Laser Printer"
5,It's Awesome.This Multifunction Printer is superb for Professionals. Printing speed and quality is really awesome and all other features add cherry on the cake.Packing of the product was fantabulous. Really well pracked with all sort of precautions taken.
1,I am an advocate by profession - this printer is not meant for advocates who requires to print pages on both the sides only on legal size papers. This is useless for me now. I am ready to sell it for half rate and the product is in warranty.
5,"I've ordered this multi function device for my home need and it does a fantastic job. Mostly I am using it for my kid's school assignments. The print quality, duplex printing option, Copy & scan function, Admin tool, etc is simply superb. It's easy to unpack, easy to install. The quality of the print is so neat. Device does not heat up too much and it's noise free operation. Wireless printing option is the added advantage because of which I can place the printer wherever I want and not necessarily in my working table.Initially I had some trouble in setting up the scanner function (it's my bad that I have used WiFi router's different frequency band in my laptop and in the printer so the scan was not working). I did not have time to explore by reading the [online] manuals so I casually emailed the customer care team just in case if they can send me a reply. Surprisingly, within 2 hours I got a call from them and they have assisted me in screen-sharing mode of all complete set of options available in all functions, the features, setting up various printing options, etc. It was like a one simple online demo. I am super happy and satisfied with this purchase. I will definitely recommend."
1,"U can't use without problem, regular problemsDefectives: adf reader stucks, line come on print out page, images come black, repair man from company can't solve problemAdvantages: super connecting WiFi, scan is good , customer care giving good service"
5,"Everything good except wifi direct printing from mobile.All type of printing and coping features works wellTakes 10-15 seconds while startup and then prints very fast.Bought only 10 days before so cant say about durability.Brother iprint &scan app on android is very very slow to work with while printing.I used many hp deskjets and inktank printers, all gave me mental tortures time to time  but this printer looks like my real friend i was looking for."
4,"First of all my reasons of buying this printer: (a) I don't print a lot; the inkjet and ink tank printer head clogs up if not used regularly (b) I hardly print colour but when I do, I wish quality (c) I wanted full networking - Ethernet/Wireless (d) I wanted ADF for scanning/copying and auto duplex printing. This printer ticked all requirements.The printer arrived today (20-Sep-2020). This is my very first observations review. I will update after 4-6 months.  The print quality is superb as with most laser printers.[A] Packaging & Unpacking: Printer comes with toner in sealed bag, USB cable, the main guide + CD ROM in a pouch, and very neatly packed in the huge box. It had sticker tapes to prevent movement of parts. The quick instruction sheet (A1 size) had neat explanation. There were no issues while unpacking. I installed the toner cartridge in a zilch. The printer is nearly 10 kg and must be ""installed"" at a fixed place - fairly heavy. It is bulky too like most laser printers.Rating: 5/5.[B] Setup and installation: The printer comes with a CD ROM. Most laptops today don't have a CD-ROM drive. Not a big issue. I downloaded the s/w from Brother website. I wanted to connect the printer over ethernet. I am fairly competent at networking having setup my complete home network with cable model, wifi router, wifi repeater, a NAS, assigning static IP addresses to important devices, etc. Printer must have a static IP address. I connected the printer via ethernet cable expecting automatic recognition and DHCP address assignment. But I had trouble figuring this out. I could finally enable the Wired Networking on. I enabled Wireless as well and manually set that up. All this one has to on the printer, using menu and +/- and OK keys. It is tedious.[C] Usage. I was able to print from laptop with no issues once the printer was setup. I have heard about the ""wake up from sleep"" issue. I did not face this issue either. After a good 45 minutes, I printed another page, the printer did take time to wake up but it was not showing offline. Maybe because I have to networked via ethernet. I could scan a legal size page using the ADF - no issues. I was facing this issue with my older Epson L210 printer.[D] Print from mobile. I was able to print from Samsung M30 and M31 with absolutely no issue. No ""wake up"" problem. The small irritating issue is that paper size defaults to ""Letter"" in mobile print option. But it is a mobile phone issue.[E] Amazon delivery: Great as always. Delivered in one day in spite of COVID issues.So far, I am fairly pleased. I am docking 1-star off for installation difficulty."
5,"Awesome quality printer under 16 to 17 k.. Best product from brother. I use various printer from various company,but this one is the best.. Thanks amazon and brother"
1,Performance very bad! Lines appearing while scanning & paper getting stuck after just two to three Printouts! Waste of time & money!Pls send your experienced engineer to set it up properly this Sun 10th June!
5,We are using this totally good. Compare with other brands it's 90 present dust free.
1,I strongly recommended you all dont buy very poor product. i purchase it before a month and motherboard changed(Installed  DCP-L2540DW instead of DCP-L2541DW)..Its Very big lie..
1,"*WARNING*: Amazon does not accept returns on this product. If you see the return button option, it will not accept it, rather the call will go to Amazon customer service which will say that returns are not possible. So the return button is highly misleading. Once you buy, you are going to be stuck with this product.As for the printer: It's problematic when a bygone era product is disguised as ""WiFi"" printer. Setup of WiFi is torturous. Connecting is painstakingly difficult. Keep the connection on is chore. The printer randomly goes to sleep mode.  WIFI once connected, forgets the connection, you have to go through the whole process again. Who have designed this monstrosity?If you are thinking that this is a WiFi printer: It's not easy to use the WiFi!Pros: Seems well made from outside. Test print had good quality. That is the only pro.Cons are many:WiFi printing is a hilarious joke. Not possible for average user, i would say difficult for even a little tech savy user.WiFi printing by Android is very difficult and does not work fast. If you want 5 copies, printer will keep displaying recieving data for eons, and then print one. The next one will then start ' recieving data' for a while and print. I was wrinting this review, and for being silent for a 5 mins the printer printed the 5th copy.Brother customer service in Pune: 3 phone numbers, none of them working.Brother customer service number : call any time you are 10th in the line.I tried to solve the problem by diving deep in my router settings, YouTube videos, internet forums etc. However can a average person have time to do this? Also why should I do this in the first place. I paid more that 17k to do hours of search?I have never reviewed a product this badly.And I can't even return this."
5,This is an absolutely great network printer for a small or medium sized office. It does duplex printing and will print on A4 or Legal Sized paper amongst other options. It has a nice large toner store so it will go for a long while before needing a refill and it does auto scanning as well as photocopying. I haven't had to get the ink refilled yet so I don't know how easy or cumbersome that is or how well that works.It's definitely better than anything I've used from HP or Canon.Note: Do check online about disabling sleep mode because some people have complained about that. When it goes to deep sleep if you give a print command it won't print unless you go to the printer and wake it up. I disabled it and I haven't had any issues.
4,"Firstly, since I was confused, this printer can handle legal size paper- print, copy and scan.Easy to set up the printer. Wireless is a bit tough to set, but once you're done, it works perfectly. Prints are great including the ones on Legal Size Paper. Scanning could have been faster, but can't complain much at this price. Photocopy is absolutely hassle free. ADF works great. I'll update the review after exhausting the first cartridge."

5,"Best printer. Much better than hp or samsung. There is no other feature left  other than color printing which a printer can have. It has adf, wireless printing and scanning that works flawlessly, copying and print speed is the best at 30ppm. Very easy to use nad setup. It has a very good range of wifi connectivity.  Got it for just rs.12000 in amazon great india festival."
3,"The print quality is about average, when compred to a simple HP 1020 printer.The speed of copying is very fast - photocopy is great. The speed when printing over wifi from iphone is slow, however from macbook or pc is as fast as usb (almost).Looks like its heavy duty stuff. The auto document feeder works flawlessly so far.The screen is dot matrix. I was expecting a more user friendly coloured lcd screen , like you get on inket brother printers. The options are hard to get and toggle with as its like a calculator screen which is outdated.So i like it , it does the job, and is sturdy. It also has a good deal of storage for sheets , so u dont have to refill paper too often."
4,Print quality is great. It is quite easy to install but if you are a non techie person it might me a bit tough. There no wireless printing issue. If you want to get the best wireless connection you need to set it up with a computer. It’s a great printer for its price. It is go to printer is you are a home user who prints 5to 10 pages per month as the the is no issue of ink drying like inkjet printer.
1,"Worse after sale service by Amazon,seller ,brand.Installation specifically written free of cost still brand ( brother) charging 500+ gst for installation n demo.Inspite complaints to Amazon n seller Neither of two concern about it. Amazon wants we to make complaints , writing mails instead self action.if owner of Amazon is viewing this my review please get into it on property to avoid negative publicity of Amazon.This is my last purchase from Amazon.Thanks..."
5,At this price point this is simply a wonderful printer with Wireless as well as Duplex feature. The only challenge is the LCD screen which is too small so installing the printer on the WLAN is bit of challenge especially when it comes to typing in the WLAN password. One needs to use the arrow keys provided on the right of the screen to navigate through the keyboard one charachter at a time.Barring this installing this printer on the wireless network was a breeze and hassle free.
1,"The photocopy machine (Brother DCP-L2541DW) which we have purchased from Amazon India, that said machine is damaged and poor quality."
2,"I bought this printer thinking its good tech and is wifi printing enabled, but the printers wifi settings constantly gives trouble. Everytime, we have to call customer service which charges money for every visit despite being in the first year of warranty. Better to go with companies like HP that are mass printers and don't give these problems"
5,"Earlier I gave a good review of the product but I was proven completely wrong. Printer needed service 3 times in 6 months for the same problem. Service engineer attended every time promptly, opened up the printer, scraped a few electronic points using a screwdriver and got it working. After the last service, there was no go. it still does not work and is in warranty. More so, Brother India senior management does not respond to emails nor do they take action. Avoidable, that all I would say."
5,"Amazing Japanese build quality. Easy to set up and use with minimalistic buttons. Its a black and white printer and does its job well. As long as you do not have children with heavy art project requirements, then then this is the perfect home home office printer for a working professional."
3,"It s a reasonably decent multifunctional printer and operates alright. However, do not buy if you want to connect wirelessly. The wireless network configuration and the connectivity are very unreliable and do not work for more than a few hours. You will have to repeatedly reconfigure the network configuration by selecting your Wifi Network SSID and entering the password/key using a hard to use interface."
5,"Great quality prints and very efficient system overall. If I get this on a discount, iTunes completely worth the purchase. I've been a HP user for many years, and I was fed up or changing printers and paying for expensive cartridges. Brother does a great job overall. I may update my review after one year of use. So far it has heen working really smooth."
3,"Print quality is nice but have to face lot of jerks for the installation. Setting up of port via switching on both Wifi button on the printer and WPS button on the router doesn't work and had to install through brother support. Moreover, if would need a copy of one side and two sides, the process is herculine and not automatic where I felt a lot of pain."
1,"don't buy this printer there have some technical issue like1, when we use refile cartage printer showing replace toner anytime on display and PC too where printer setup software installed.2, printer going on sleep mode after 1 hour,  and if printer in sleep mode printer not taking command for printing and scanning too after rebooting you can use again3, Cheques printing mode not in this printer, you can't print cheques4, technical service support also not good.5, You can't use Refiled cartage with in Warranty period. if you used refilled cartage Brother not give you service free service relented printing quality issue."
2,Well they advertise it as with wi fi printer but it's wi fi capabily hardly work. It rarely can work flawlessly on wi fi. Installing driver using wi fi is a hit or miss. Mobile app is DAMN slow and impossible to our practically.Please note that I am absolutely comfortable with setting up technical stuffs and I do understand how such devices work.
1,"After installing this printer, my Modem now only allows one device at a time to connect to wifi broadband.Earlier it used to allow multiple devices to connect.Otherwise there is no issue with this printer. It can be a bit slow in copying data over wireless from mobile but that is not an issue for me"
4,"I have been using this printer for 3 months, The print quality is awesome sometimes papers stuck for 1 sided prints but except that issue I didn't feel any bad thing about this product,I thought it would acan legal size papers but it doesn't, overall good product ."
5,"I bought the Brother DCP L2541DW laser printer a few days back. I am really impressed by its performance. This is my first Brother product, and I was really apprehensive to switch brands because I have been a fan of another brand for many years. However, my experience with Brother multifunction printer amazed me. The quality, ease of use and intuitive features are some of the advantages that I have noticed. It has wi-fi, auto duplex printing and many other features. If you own a small business or if you are a home user who has lot of print, scan, photocopy requirements, I would definitely recommend this Brother printer. It is affordable and easy to use. If you are a bit tech savvy, you can set it up yourself."
3,"The print quality does not Look like a Laser print quality , it is more likely a inkjet printer quality .Dissatisfied with the feedback. Just make sure if you want to invest such a huge amount for a inkjet type of printing ."
4,A bulky printer. The toner last for about 1600 prints only. And a replacement cost RS 3500/- Quite expensive. After sales service is poor. They are not prompt and take their own time to resolve the issues.
1,"While printing on a letterhead there are weird artifacts all over the paper. The service technician told us that this is ""normal"" as the printer is a ""hot roller"" one, whatever that means. His solution was not to print on letterheads but only on plain paper.We are going to take further action against this."
4,I have two printers variant one of is HP brand M126NW and another one is this DCP-L2541DW these both are like similar but BROTHER one is best with good connectivity and quality even speed is super as compare with hp one go with it blindly if u really need good printer .Order with Amazon always best Thanks to amazon service for bring this on time
5,"Perfect. ADB and dual side printing is awesome.Just one problem , it cant hold more than 14 to 15 pages print in continuous printing it starts falling off so you have to manually remove many time printing large documemt."
5,The best multifunction BW laser printer in the class when compared to HP MFP126nw and the canon pixma. It has auto duplex printing and the ADF is a great option to have. Can scan upto 35 sheets very fast.
1,"This product does not even have a LAN port. It is completely misleading product description. I just wasted my 12,000 bugs in this useless machine. Unfortunately Amazon didnt honour return and I ended up keeping this useless product in my office."
5,"When I was needing for a printer which suits me , then I went on searching for many blogs, articles and videos that which printer should I buy then I ordered this one .My requirements was - ( for a research student )1) Fast Printing ( Duplex- both sides)2) For longer use ( I don't use printer daily , that's why I neglected ink-based printers)3)Servicing and Brand ( Servicing means , cartridge is easily available and affordable and the printer have brand )So , I came with this one having all functions that I needed.Now , Pros -1) All above three2) Better printing quality3) Very easy to use , plug and play , can print 200 pages in one goCons -1) Not have led lights .2) I bought @13k , which I think is bit more ... It should be somewhere between @11.5kI have used HP m1136, and other HP products , but 'brother' can beat them in Quality , Fast printing , Auto duplex and Servicing .Go for it ."
5,"I have been racking my brains for the last few days since I received the printer to find a fault with the machine; disappointed that I cannot find any. This machine has more sophisticated functionality than I require for my limited home office needs; the two- sided scanning and printing, the two-sided scanning of Id cards and printing of both sides on a single page are some of features that I can think of. Kudos to Amazon to make it affordable to me via its red hot summer sale."
1,"The toner cant be refilled only replacement, its cost is Rs. 3500/- every time. Pathetic after sales support.Strictly dont buy this scrap."
1,"The description doesn't say this cannot be connected to LAN which is a basic feature for a printer. This neither has WiFi nor the LAN port. It's just useless and Amazon cannot accept the return. Its waste of money, NEVER buy this useless printer."
4,"Lot of people are complaining that it doesn’t have wifi or LAN. For their information, the connectivity type is already mentioned, that is USB only. It’s a nice product in 11k price range."
5,Writing this after 8month usage product is good but tonor filling is not easy if you do your self u need assistance for tonor filling so in this range there is no wifi but i print with otg cable print quality is good i daily print a book product is fine but i will be disappointed by that there is no backlight on lcd which is bad
3,"Product is good but its not yielding  as many prints as they mentioned, not even near by the number 2600. in my first full toner it yielded 1600 pages only.kindly provide me invoice bill once again."
5,Very good product.Auto-rotate feature.Easy Installation.Plug and print.
3,"Tldr: Printer is good, the software isn't great.Bought the printer for home use. It was very easy to install. The instruction manual was detailed and the instructions to download and install the drivers on Windows 10 were simple. Installs easily on MacOS also.Prints well, and is quite fast.The Interface to scan is not too great. It's easy if you want to scan a document into a pdf, but images are a bit complicated. It was easier on my old Canon Deskjet.Copy function doesn't work great with IDs. The photos usually end up with high contrast and black out at times. One workaround is to scan and then print.Overall, the printer is good if using primarily to print/scan documents."
5,"This is my first Brother made printer, found complete satisfaction, print quality is clean, sharp. Design is so nice. So many features available. I like duplex printing feature. software is also easy and user friendly. Scanning is just perfect. Speed of scanner and printer is fast as they mentioned. overall good deal."
1,worthless printer and seller distributed wrong information on amazon portal about wireless connection and product other features related.Please amazon check all details regarding products .i am not happy purchase this printer its just like a black marketing
5,I had this printer when I was in Canada. Hence I bought it here too. Amazing print quality as expected. Scanning and software installation is much easier. I have hp mx1130 laser jet. Compared to hp this is way better.
5,Very good product and fast delivery by Amazon and very good paking . product is too good than comparison. And lot's of options available in brother printer...thank you Amazon and thank you brother
4,"Excellent printer. Does the job. Consistent print quality and fairly easy to use. The parts feel made with fragile plastic but for the price I dont think I should complain.The only problem is the LCD display. It’s very hard to read the display and this is a real shame as this is the only “user interface” and I believe Brother should introduce a backlit display or something similar.The other disadvantage is that the software that comes with this printer (also available for download from the internet), is heavy and tends to make your computer very slow."
5,"If you require an easy to use, office like print operation and quality at affordable price, look no further, this is the printer for you. The installation was hasslefree, you can download drivers from the link provided in the manual and within 30 minutes the printer is installed. The cartridge drum has a orange locator and the manual has markings and depictions to help you place the toner cartridge in the cartridge drum. The entire process of setting up the printer was a smooth experience. Press the start button, press the print on the PC and the printer starts in a jiffy, the speed of printing is lightning fast and the two sided print happens automatically and seamlessly. Overall, the print quality and the print operation and installation is superb and plug and play. Have to test the scanner though. This is a very capable printer for a home office and can print in bulk and fast. Go for it."
5,"Setup is a breeze thanks to the included CD. If a CD/DVD drive is not available, then the drivers have to be downloaded from the Brother Support Website. The size is around 200MB.TIP: When choosing the printer model to download the drivers from their website, choose Asian Region and then select Indian Specific Models and you will find the drivers there."
5,"Overall a good printer.  I had some initial set up issues.  Could not control the contrast and the darkness of the prints.  Learning the ID printing and dual page printing techniques were a bit involved.  It took a few attempts to get them right.These features were very useful and most used.  I am quite satisfied with this printer now.  I do not know the support available for this printer in India, but let us hope that I do not need one. :-)"
5,Excellent printer for both home and office use. Crystal clear prints till now.very good printing speed.Overall highly recommended.
4,"So advantages are already mentioned so I am talking about it. What I observe is it requires a amt of space and also draws a large amt of current.. Another thing is that if using an extension box, even if the switch is off,due to large drawing of current you can get small shock if the laptop material is  metal... These are not the disadvantages but something you need to care about.The print quality is awesome and don't forget to register the product in brother site to check it's authenticity."
3,"Pros:Easy very good Black Prints and fast prints , dual side always a plus. ( Brother quality print are always good)Easy installation!Cons are no WIFI (Big-ve for today) , no EthernetStill you can make wifi prints via shared router, youtube if you want."
5,"I am fan of brother products since last 12 year first i bought only laser jet with tonner it printed 2600 copy in single tonner , in monsoon this printer dont spread ink like other printers do , never heat and auto updated driver"
5,"It's the most amazing printer at this price, I've been using laser printers since 94, the beg. Era of printers, but brother has simply outclassed HP etc, just don't, think twice , if u wanna have monochrome printing needs."
4,Price print quality it's ok but display have not visible no back light .direct print fast .but using from computer  its take first scanning then Printing take too much time.for 10 print its take 8 minutes . I am not satisfied with this  I am RETURN  I am buy little more price  around 20000 .
5,"It's a mind blowing fantastic printer for office and business use,  print quality is excellent,  and duplex printing add extra advantage to this printer,  double side printing is awesome,  everything is goodCon--- it needs good maintaince,  so use properly,  don't play game with it, I mean don't take it lightly,It's not working in inverter,  if you still use using high power inverter then may be internal parts damages"
5,"Brother printer is good,"
2,"1. ABNORMAL MACHINE RUNNING NOISE WHILE COPYING / PRINTING DOCUMENT2. CD RECEIVED WITH PRODUCT IS NOT WORKING, DRIVERS DOWNLOADED FROM NET.3. LCD - DIM SO NOT READABLE EASILY4. INVOICE RECEIVED, IS NOT LEGIBLE AND NOT COMPLETE."
5,"This is my first Brother made printer, found complete satisfaction, print quality is clean, sharp. Design is so nice. So many features available. I like duplex printing feature. software is also easy and user friendly. Scanning is just perfect. Speed of scanner and printer is fast as they mentioned. overall good deal."
5,Got this for home use. It does exactly as it says and the printer is rather fast than the printers I have used before. The duplex printing facility is also very helpful.
5,"If I have to rate this product across all catagories on a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate it 9 out of 10. Delivery was well in time as it appeared at the time of ordering it. Quality of the printer and print is great in its class. It is indeed a product with good value for money. I am completely satisfied with this laser printer so far."
2,Better write the try HP laser printer with auto duplex or cannon. I have proof don't neglect this review.  It won't print 2000 copies
2,It's display is so poor... We can't see things in its display properly. They also didn't provide return or replacement. software installation is also a difficult task as the cd along with it won't run.We have to go to the website and download it.Overall Printing quality is good.
1,"It has been mentioned on the printer itself that 2600 pages minimum it would print, however, it was able to print only 2000 pages. i am suprised on seeing the differences."
4,Since last 5 years am using Brother Printers .i am telling simply its Pretty hardworker.... But its very impossible to get  Customer care support  .. I tried and installed myself ....
5,"Very Good ,Value for Money Product."
5,Value for money. Easy to use. Good quality printing. Had my doubts before purchase. But it is all clear now.
4,"Nice and convenient printer, user friendly and economical"
5,Excellent printoutsOnly Black and white printouts
4,"The product was packed very well... The setup was very easy. The print quality was great. I bought it for School use, overall a good product"
1,Sacner is not that good at the time of photo coping.  Scan to pc is ok
4,"- Recieved printer in a good condition from Amazon.- It was very easy to install, cartridge placement, ink filling, driver installation from net.- Print quality was good, meets the purpose.- Printout speed is also good.- Replaceable cartridge is good thing in Canon, which is inbuilt in other brands and expensive if it goes down.- Hope it doesn't give problem in longer run.Thank you Canon and Amazon.- Intentionally decided single function printer as copy, scan function was really not needed, if yes, we can always take printout.Happy with the product."
5,using in my shop and its working perfectly for now....
5,Very good product
5,Best of multi thermal printer 80mm

4,Good Product paper pakup laser printer
1,Bad
5,"We use this thermal printer in our new office, I can easily create receipts using phone and system. The printer quality is simply amazing. We are so happy using it"
1,"The printer was purchased on 21 July, 2020 but became defective just after 5 days of installation. We could just print about 20 pages on 2 ocassions within a span of 5 days on receipt and installation. On 3rd time on 04 Aug, 2020, it failed to switch ON and gave error message of system initialize problem. HP service engineer visited to repair it and suspects major problem in internal components but the company has refused to replace the printer, as whole.Item not worth purchasing and I feel let down by the brand name of HP.Example of poor customer care/regard by HP."
5,"First reviewed a lot on HP laser printer for home use, purchased this and, fully read the manual, enabling wifi or wireless use for printing and scanning is very simple.  Unless and only if manual is followed in order to configure then only everything becomes easy to use.will update later"
5,Great product
5,"Best part : manageable size, acceptable print,scan and Xerox. No Hassel of ink drying if not in use like inkjet. Excellent WiFi connectivity using HP smart App. Recommended when you suddenly need prints /scan and Xerox sometime and no use some time.Not an color printer. Laser color printers are not proven at these price."
1,"It's just a wired printer, not working for e print , google clouds print , apple print . Cheating customers by giving wrong description.Don't buy there are so many other options available with low price"
1,"The product is ok. But Amazon has provided partial information about the product. Its a manual duplex printer and not an automatic one. And this information is nowhere mentioned in product description, while all the gazillion other details are there. I found out about it only when my 10 day return/replacement policy on the product expired and AMAZON clearly refused to help me with matter. Neither did they owe it up to their mistake of providing partial information. Will NEVER again order anything expensive from Amazon. Customer care is pretty useless."
5,Very easy to install. Has great print quality.Scan quality is also not bad. You just need HP account and an app then you're good to go from any device. Just keep in mind you remove all the packaging even inside the printer next to cartridge. It is plastic n can melt if not removed.
1,waste of money always showing low tonner even after filled also
5,The product meets the quality and specification of a branded item. Very happy

1,Product not work .very bad product
5,Best for small business dont think twice go for it
2,Overall quality is not so good. Not able to print complete bill. It's print 2/3rd of the page. Not getting any support.
5,Very good item. I am fully Satisfied with this item.
5,I'm using it from last month.It's working efficiency is pretty nice for me.Built quality of the accesories of this printer is greatPrinting quality of this printer is good at this price point.And bulit quality of this product is premium.
5,Satisfied. It has been 2 months. My usage is super low.. about 10 prints/week. Now you may ask why did I go for laser then? Believe me.. inkjet printers are real pain in the ass. And they come for cheaper price but makes big hole in your pocket from the day one of its usage. This one is super comfortable. Fires up in seconds.. print quality is average but manageable
1,It’s not a wifi printer
5,"This is the second time I bought the same printer .though the previous one is working fine,  but I trust cannon for the performence so I went for it"
4,"Print quality is good. Canon giving quality product as expected.Value for money: Definitely not for this price of 10k range. Duplex not available. Colour print not available. WiFi print not possible.Installation: My computer having issues, otherwise printer setup and installation was easy.Size & Looks: It is not too heavy. Size of 12' portable TV. Looks elegant and classy.Overall I'm satisfied.Will update the review after few months of usage.Thanks for reading!Review on 27-Oct-2020:----------------------------Tried printing images and it came out really well. This is just b/w printer. I can see every detail of the image.Attached image."
4,"Printer is good. Seller sold open box product. Slight marks on body. Review is specifically for the seller who sold open box product. Wanted to return it, but I was in badly need of printer. Cartridge looks duplicate."
3,"The printer is easy to set up and use, but it has to be used carefully or you get a mild shock. The quality of the print is disappointing as it is rather pale. If fed correctly, the paper comes through smoothly without getting stuck."
1,It was mentioned in the specifications that we can print at both sides of the paper once.. But it is not like that... I wnt to replace it with another one which is auto duplex....
1,Don't buy not having mobile connectivity as per web page specifications
3,Earlier I have used a LBP2609 for almost 9 years.I am using this printer for last 2 months.This is not a value for money product.Printing quality is not so good. Specially for small fonts printing is very poor. Image printing quality is also average.
5,"Best purchase. Go for it if you print frequently. Use 80gsm paper if you want to print on both sides (since no auto duplex you have to do it manually, like even odd printing). If you use low quality paper then there are chances of getting it stuck in drum roll. Otherwise best. Don't buy ink jet printers."
5,Best printer at this price range.The quality of printing is better than HP. Also the printing cost is very low( similar to hp product at this range). And this product is less costlier than other laser printer .so go for it.
5,I m satisfied with the product.. In the beginning I was a little bit confused with the installation process but with the help of You tube videos sorted it out..Printing Quality is Great..Seller did a good job delivering the product in time..
4,"Good printer for home use especially for printing notes and photocopies. The problem is that the system doesn't recognize the printer when plugged in. For that uninstall the usb printing supporter and then reinstall, remove the cable and plug in again. The driver will be installed without delay."
1,"Within a month from purchase the print quality has become of very poor quality. After contacting amazon, the complaint is nowhere registered. Amazon is requested to replace the Cartridge immediately."
5,"Product as stated on the portal,best in its class,working flawlessly as the brand known for,arrival before time and packing was good,I used it since last one month and till date I satisfied"
5,Extremely price efficient as the toner works for life. My 2nd purchase. Works slow thats the only problem.
3,"Its not a WiFi printer, so if you do not need wifi printer then you should go with brother printer instead"
1,Worst product in this range.....Go to Flipkart and purchase HP printer in same range.This is neither Wifi based nor compatible with android phone.Waste of Money for me.Once you purchased it is not returnable.
1,Canon का प्रिंटर सबसे बकवास है और कंपनी का रेस्पॉन्स बहुत खराब है ये ना तो कुछ बताते है और ना ही कोई सर्विस के बारे में बताते है धोखेबाज है ये कंपनी वाले।।। जब भी लेना कंपनी से पहले बात करके कन्फर्म करके तभी लेना।।
5,Very good laser printer by canon. Much better than previous inkjet printer I had.
1,"Bad quality, can't print on other side of paper bcz of roll over of page, continue stuck of pages, print is not much dark, I recommend ""NOT TO BUY"" Damn serious..."
1,Sent multiple times returned product with multiple labels on it.. packing poor and printer doesn't work properly with missing
3,I need bill of this product against my company gstin number. Contact me 7678214169 as soon as possible.
5,Good and efficient printer.print pages with speed.

5,"Writing this review 4 years after buying this printer. I must say this one of the very good printers which pays you for the money you invested. One ink bottle they gave along with the printer, lasted almost for 3.5 yrs (my printing quantity less though). Unlike InkJet printers, its ink doesn't dry if you don't use the printer for long (say for 2-3 months). You may have to do head cleaning once in a while.Overall, really a very good printer."
5,I ordered this printer for Xray printing and I am extremely satisfied with printer quality!
5,"Epson technology in printing is well known, but the economy if offers in running this printer is amazing, It is for sure the future of printing, and these printers will eradicate the Laser Printer in the near future. The most amazing thing is you are getting this printer at a discounted price at Amazon, that makes it even more economical for us to own one."
5,"Fast printer and good quality printing, glad to have bought this on independence sale!!!INSTRUCTIONS: To fill ink you need to push the ink tank towards the back as there is an indication on it to do so, then open a silicone cap inside to fill ink. First fill the initial ink then once you are done using that in months you can fill the bonus ink bottle if provided with package."
5,"We have so far bought 10 Epson 100 printers. On an averge, we take 100 prints of each printer per day. Never was there any problem in the last 3 yearsGood bye to the catridge printers !"
5,"Really a workhorse, I have two of them and both of them working butter smooth for last 5 months.Was bit skeptical about Epson but now happy on my decision."
5,Sturdy and reliable the way all Epson products are
4,printer is good. but its speed is very low after 50th number. so the printer want a rest after all 50 page printing. but i dont see any other printer like this speed. so it is better from others.

5,Good value for money
3,Ink consumption is high. Or else its good
5,Very good printer... Cheap to run. I would recommend it for office use instead of a laser printer.
1,For installation i had face lot of inconvenience. No engineer came to installation.
5,Good product
5,"Best monochrome, most economical, fastest in the segment, easy-care, Trouble-free office printer ever."
5,bill printing made easy
5,"Great Product,Value For Money,Run on Invert Also,Packing is Good,On Time Delivery"
1,This is not good printer. Very poor quality. Missing parts.
5,Good product
1,"I had previously given a 5 star rating, but changing it now only after 2 days of use.The entire print has a grey undertone to it, and there are black bands on both edges of the paper.Have made repeated calls to Amazon to have the unit replaced, and they tell me that they have processed it, but no reply over email, no ticket number of the request or any communication regarding the replacement process. It feels like they are trying to stall so that the window to request replacement is over and I am stuck with a defective machine.Very disapoointed."
1,printer have manufactured defects. brother engineers say it physically damage. and it is now out of warranty. I am speechless. what a bad experience.
5,"This is a revolutionary product offering from Brother where in they have reduced the cost of printing in laser products similar to ink tank . The toner costs only 900 rs which is way cheaper than HP and canon toners which cost 4000 rs and the price of the prduct is also cheaper than HP and canon lasers. All in all a great product with god functionality and additional features like duplex printing. if you compare this to the top selling model in the market - hp 1005 , which is priced at 17k , this is a clear winner as it is multi function , plus duples , 3k cheaper plus cost of consumables is only 900 rs !!"
5,Awesome product got in just 11000 bucks a great deal and a great product.
1,Brother DCP-B7500D Multi-Function Centre with Automatic 2-Sided PrintingVERY BAD PRINTER & BAD SERVICE FOR SERVICE CENTER...DONT PURCHASE BRODHER PRODUCT......
4,"The print quality is great and it's quite fast too. Automatically prints both sides of the paper. Scanner and copier functions work fine. I had no trouble with installation. I'm quite surprised at the connectivity options though (the lack of them to be precise). It only has a USB port. And that's it. Not even an Ethernet port. If it had Wireless connectivity, it would have been ideal for me. But it doesn't. It's pretty expensive for what it has to offer, but it does print very well. I've had big problems with inkjet printers, and I've learnt that ink tank printers have problems with printer heads becoming bad in a year or so. So, laser was the only option for me. I don't print very often and I don't want to keep changing the cartridge  every time I want to use it. I hope it lasts a while - it looks quite sturdy."
1,"NEVER EVER PURCHASE THIS PRINTER, WORST EVER PRINTER I USED. PURCHASED 2 MONTHS BEFORE, CARTRIDGE AND DRUM DAMN LOW QUALITY"
5,Writing this review after two months of usage. Print quality is good. Its easy to install and I did not need an engineer from Brother to assemble it. Its very easy.  Printing speed is also good. Its easy to install and use. Scanner could be a bit faster. All in all its a good printer and great value for money. Very good for home or office use. Though I wish they had given some color options.
1,"this printer is after 5 months was given this xerox and print, every time change toner and their price is 1000 rs. I especially tell you didn't buy this printer"
5,Toner finished in only 12 days....i dont know how they said it print 2600 pages....i only printed arround 600 pages...It is completed one month again toner has finished by just taking fifteen pages daily...coste is 900...again we have to go on printing shop for cheapest print
5,Value for money...Very nice printer34 page per minute
5,"Having spent my life trying to get good prints from ink-jet printers, worrying of ink levels, getting my hands/clothes stained with ink and cost of cartridges, this Brother printer is now complete peace of mind, I have finally find found Nirvana. The duplex printing feature, the well designed backlit LCD with user-friendly menus, the auto wake-up and sleep, the fully covered bottom tray design, the 2 sided ID card copier on same page, clean backside, all are well designed features of this printer, go for it."
1,After using of 2 months the printer is asking for replacement of toner cartridge.Shall I have to refill or have to purchase a new one.Kindly suggest....
5,Best printer.Printing Speed is osmloaded with lots of features.User friendly software.Far better than HP Printers.
5,Very very best macheen i am very happy
5,"Super product without any problem, blindly trust in this printer if you are going to buy a new one. My first printer is from Hp but...after corona pandemic, i hate china and chinese products....so blindly trust in this japanese product."
3,Easy to install in computer. Print quality best. Price of toner is a little bit expensive as compared to the other models of brother.
1,"Brother after sale service is worst, after one month it's not working. To decline warranty brother company have many reasons."
1,"Second side printing is not working, paper always jams when both side print command is given. I brought it 5 days before only due to both side printing but not a good product for both side printing."
1,I only print 965 copies my printer toner is exhausted. It claims to print 2600pages but cant event print half the number of pages. Dont buy if considering cost effective printer else everything is fine.
1,Miss some line or words during printing
5,"After 5 days of use - Very much satisfied , thanks brother & Amazon for such beautiful product, I have a small business & it serves the needs perfectly, printing & copying is fast & perfect . Without any doubt go for it & brother is almost 110 years old company , Trust Brother . It will definitely make you Happy . 👍"
5,Best deal.  Waited for 10 days for price drop.  it fluctuated between 13000/- to 14500/- and finally purchased for 12500/-.  Best features among other similar printers.Delivered within less than 24 hrs.
5,"The printer has a good speed, The print quality is also very good ,the first toner given with the printer doesn't print up to the claimed 2600 pages."
2,"Ther is not wiFi.no EDF,Function is to difficult ."
5,"Yes, its on my side, my brother. Nice printer for professional work. As we need lot more prints due to Book Publishing work. Thanks amazon.in for prompt and secure delivery."
5,"1- QualityPrinter is very goodPrint quality is very fine2- User friendly3- Manual guide has perfectly explained each and every steps for installation. So, I have not faced any difficulty for installation."
3,Not at all value for money 1st cartridge over on only 1200 pages and it is mentioned 2800 pages  it cost appx 1.5rs per page not at all recommended.
4,"Does what it is supposed to do, really well.  But fit and finish not so great.  There are visible gaps and very tacky.  Also noisy during print.  But its a printer/scanner and it does its job really well."
3,Good Quality and easy to use
1,"Don't buy for business purpose,because 1 copy nearly 1.20 rupees,there is no possible change toner,cartridge change  every time (940/-)"
5,This machine is good quality but i fine out more cheaper price thats why i have return the printer
3,The product delivered is opened not seal  with brother tape  the seal is broken this is very disappointed for customer to received .
4,"Everything is good.but there is no official support for printing through mobile.However,u can use third party apps like NokoPrint for printing through mobile devices..."
4,Refilling ink cartridge is said to be not possible?
5,value for money
3,For printing it's a good product. Problem comes at the time of scanning multiple pages as the only drawback is it doesn't has the duplex scanning option.Overall it's a fine product.
5,"I purchased this printer in January 2020 , a month ago. It’s worth money spent. Only problem is of scanning of A5 or legal papers as the length of scanner glass do not support it. Installation is very easy."
3,"Three in one...Scan,print, Xerox for home use it's much useful for covid 19 epidemic situation.Print quality is excellent."
5,Very easy and yes value for money
5,"Does what it says, cost effective"
1,worst product hp brake my trust in three month printer is not working properly and the are not giving us service they told me to courier the cartage to bhopal i talked to bhopal service center they told me it may take atleast 15 day i m getting suffered a lot
5,"The build quality was fair, but value for money. Print quality is good. Wifi connectivity is good."
1,Only positive is easy to fill.But print quality is horrible. Tried all diagnostics mentioned in document. HP support is also very bad.. at the end they will say you are not using authorized ink fill. Very expensive print..Don't prefer at all..

2,"Our purchase date is 22-06-2020, so the waranty period ends on 22-06-2020. This printer is not functioning properly currently and we had contacted HP customer care for the repair and came to know that the warranty period for this product has expired and we were informed that any service from their end will be chargeable. This is very surprising to us as we had purchased it on the above date. We were informed by HP that this product was not updated by the seller ( Amazon ) and because of this we are facing such problems. You are asked to update HP about this product immediately, so that we can receive their free service within the waranty period. Please send us your confirmation after this is shorted out and also take necessary action so that in future your customers does not face such problem"
1,"Printing issue every month. Bad printer. Every month we need to call customer support and get imaging drum replaced. The servicing is also pathetic. It takes 7-20 days for the issue to be resolved and that too during warranty. God knows how bad it will be after warranty. That's not all, you have to follow up on the complain multiple times to get a reply and then again follow up to get a resolution. If you are really interested in this, please hire someone (to manage and follow up with HP support for all the problems you will face every month) while ordering this"

4,"The printer is really good and easy to install the instructions given are really easy to follow and it can be connected to different devices too. The printing quality is also good.

5,The best feature of this printer is ease of use and easy to fill ink . Print quality is good and speed is fast
4,"Although I just bought this printer a few days ago, the warranty shows only nine months are left. I have no clue on why it is so. Amazon should keep a tab on resellers and ensure customers get the full one-year warranty. Otherwise the printer is quite good."
5,"It's such a relief to have a reliable printer....After past experience with a cheaper, well known brand of printer that constantly let us down, this printer absolutely brilliant. It was easy to install too!"
5,"No need for  transfer documents received in mobile  to laptop or pc,can easily print them over wifi or via google cloud print"

Installation is bit tough to ready.but print quality is best of all,but when you start it,it shows'Maintaince catraige cannot been found' so buy if you're supported to canon costumer care..Overall best quality printer"
1,"Print quality is not good, we get blank output and the it pushes multiple pages at once instead of"
4,"Printing speed is higer than the previous canon g series model.Easy to install.Print quality is just great.After a lots of research I was still confused between apson 3110 and canon 2020. But finally I go with canon 2020 and quite happy with my decision.Take some time for the first print that about 25 sec and after that print flawlessly.No such issues found till date as I m using it from 10 days with 4 to 5 prints daily.No need to worry, go for it..👍"
1,"I received a used product, I didn't expect this from Amazon, I'm not using this printer from ten days, now this printer was not working"
5,Printer is not working. Invoice serial number and printer serial not matching.

5,"Upgraded from my old HP deskjet with HP 415 All-in-One Tank Wireless Color Printer.The experience so far has been good. Received the printer in good condition with proper packing.The setup process is easy using the manual. As move forward in the setup process, the test pages give you further steps on how to proceed. I liked this approach.I was able to get my laptop, 2 mobiles setup for printing wirelessly in 15-20 min (including downloading of the app and software)The spill proof tech for ink filling is impressive.Print quality is good. The printing over wireless appears to take small delay if you are not using Wi-Fi direct and instead going through the router.I did not check photo printing as yet but should be good for home printing."
5,"The printer came in a nice packaging the delivery was fast and the printer box was all new not opened. The setup was pretty easy if you just follow the instructions given in manual which is provided in the box. The best thing i like about this printer is the print quality, easy to refill ink and the wireless connectivity feature by which you can use your phone to print the photos or files. The printer has both Wi-Fi Direct and simple Wi-Fi network by which you can connect to the printer and you have to download 2 apps which is already there in the play store or the app store."
2,Always hangs and scanner never worked since installed. when i call the customer service no one responds. and always like  old statments will get back to you sir.  but heck none of them will contact you after that.Not happy with the product.
3,"Support service not good,like other service care hp care call service not open 24/7 it open only 5Pm,secondly its website so complicated,found service center in india but show other country there are more nagetive points,Quality good and for support it is bad so I will give it 3 star only for product"
2,"HP Ink Tank Wireless 415 series.Initially 1 month was good, after two months, no daily usage, printing quality is Pathetic, worst.Money waste was okay but time also wasted my time reslove many printing issues. Such a bad experience.Never recommend you to buy DeskJet, Inkjet, InkTanks printers.Urge you to Buy only LaserJet though those are expensive🤬I will through this into trash soon after buying a Good laser jet Printer."
4,"Printing quality is acceptable but a little bit slow.Look wise good. Connectivity options are also ok.Serves my purpose at home. Need to check in the long run.You need to use this printer regularly (at least once in a month). If you miss, there is 99% chance your header dries out and you end up changing it again and again - this is a big big drawback."
3,"I have used the products for 8 months now, and my short review would be-Although the printer is good for large volume printing at cheap cost, quality wise not very good.Color photo printing is just ok, colors are slightly shifted.Paper jams happen often.Does not handle large documents/many pages well, hangs in between. I replaced the first printer I got after this problem. The replacement model also has same thing,the service guy told me this is the expected quality.HP service is prompt and assuring, but 14k for this? You arr just being fleeced. I got it in sale at around 10k in January, even then I think this is expensive.But cheap printing is definitely my most desirable quality and it does that well."
2,"I ordered HP415 aio, but the detected software and printer detected by Hp website is as hp410 model.Now i dont understand why packaging box and sticker on printer says 415.Lots of confusion.Its not easy to setup, untill you have deskject or old printer experince.Print quality is ok ok. Dont go by reviews. Better then epson.Better buy simple printer aio. Nothing comes cheap. Its too mess to get things running"
5,Not easy to install. Nice print quality. I just viewed a video of its unboxing while installing. Value for money. Best part is the low cost printing. It costs 10 paise for black nd white 18 paise for colourr. Its an one time investment just pay around 12k and relax for months without thinking about refilling. It is far cheaper than those inkjet printers. I previously bought hp 3635 and it costed around ₹10 for black nd white that is 100 times of 10paise.
5,"I received the product from Amazon on the proper date and the product is working properly. Print quality is good. Easy to install and print cost is low.But the device which I received, that is 13 months old and that product is having only 7 months warranty remaining. After multiple contact with HP customer care through emails and phone calls - nothing changed. So when you are receiving the product, please validate the manufacturing or import date."
4,"I got this printer on Sept 2020. I was delivered within 2 days of ordering.Pros1) Pretty compact and good packaging as it was delivered.2) The instructions of setting up the printer was super clear and I was able to set it up in 15 mins.3) Wireless function is seamless, especially the WiFi direct feature. I have printed 50 pages till now without even using the usb cable once.4) Connectivity with Macbook was super convenient.Cons1) Print speed is average and takes more time as compared to a laserjet2) Print quality is above average. But could be better for this price point."
1,"Be Ready To face worst Hp Customer Services. No cal for the installation despite for requesting.and every time u will hear someone will call you back . an that day will never come .and when u have call the customer service they will disconnect the call on ur face ..took a very bad decision going with Ho. there was many other Brands,so please be careful and chose wisely.Thank you"
1,I bought it 4 months back and now it is sitting idle. It won't print more than 10 pages once as paper jams and won't work again. Hp customer service is a joke. It is much better to choose other company than hp and suffer. Totally disappointed
2,"Bit disappointed with print quality. The default printing mode NORMAL giving actually bad quality printouts. The previous printer F4288 was a beautiful one, I now think. Need to contact HP support and see what solution they propose."
5,"Print quality is good, however the colour of the print is slightly dull compared to the original. Installation is easy. We have number of videos available in youtube demonstrating the installation."
2,Performance is very very poor comparing it's look. Everytime start the printer and facing glitches. So complicated software that needs software engineer at home. No one can get a print out in first attempt. Too much user unfriendly.
1,"Horrible product. After printing barely 100 pages, printhead light started blinking indicating some error. Cannot even print black and white when the color printhead light is blinking. Do not waste money on this product."
3,I ordered hp 415 all-in-one tank printer even i got. And on front hp 415 printer tag also there but when i check detail in printer its show its hp 410 .its ok its working fine .thanks for this but do not cheat other people by send different projects
4,"Product become very good and install become simple in windows (Hp Smart App).1. print become good quality2. product looking simple3. refill quickly dry ...................... need low costFinally i don't know the quality of photo print, because i never try it ..........."
1,"Being HP, it's made in China , The quality of the product seems to be duplicate and very poor , would suggest not to buy"
4,"Good printer. Once initial setup is completed, easy to use later. Foto print quality is not up to the mark."
5,"Easy to use,easy handle,easy to install and durable ink and print quality...best for home use"
5,Its very easy to setup and use daily. Wifi feature is saves time.
4,Too early to comment.Used only once after installing it.Scanning and printing seems ok.
3,"Paper tray is very bad, it takes quite an effort to get printout. Paper sheet needs to be adjusted multiple times. Paper tray can hold 7 or 8 sheets at a time"
5,Easy to install. Wifi connectivity helps. Good colour printing. External refilling useful.
5,Nice print quality at right price
1,"Printer performance is too slow, more than 5mins per single page black and white print. I will suggest not to buy this product"
1,HP has made printer setup difficultJunk product stopped working after single print and customer are left scratching head to get it fixed
4,wifi router connecting processes is difficulty please make it easy.
5,Excellent quality... Have been using since few weeks and I am satisfied with its performance...
1,Atrocious product with zero service backup
1,HP contact number given is wrong. 1800-2000-047. When call on that number it says invalid number!How I  will get the free installation????????
3,No proper packaging. Manual was missing in the box. Still the product was safe and good. Printer is working well. Should also focus on packaging.
5,Very good original product and worthy with cost savings of Rs1000 in MRP rate
5,"Good product, excellent  print quality"
3,"I cant register this product online,it was saying serial key entered was wrong,please help me about this...."
5,•The Print quality is excellent.• WiFi printing works really well. And the app is really easy to use.•Value for money.• 💯 Would recommend.
5,"It's two weeks now, working good. Great experience using mobile printing. WiFi has no connectivity issues."
4,Service is very good.
1,The cartridge of this printer ( hp laser MFP136nw) is not refillable.So after finishing the ink I had to buy a  new  cartridge of cost INR 3700.As as result the cost of printing a page is nearly 7 rupees which is extremely costly.Now I have stopped using this printer.Buying this printer is nothing but waste of money.Don't do the mistake of buying this horrible printer.Recommend to go for other brand.
4,"Its nyc printer, very light weighted, nice output, but Menu options are not soo easy, not sure how to setup wifi password. Need to press ""Ok"" button every time, if we gave multiple prints. Processing is not so fast.Overall, I gave 4 star, because all limitations are manageable, but output and weight and size is good."
5,"its really good product, only the auto duplex printing is not available"
5,I was confused about buying this as this has just come into the market. But this is an excellent product. I highly recommend it.
5,"Excellent printer, toner cartridge is costlier"
4,Nice printer with a lot of options to connect and print documents. If printer size is a concern - then this is not the printer.
4,Warranty paper not given and working properly
1,not working.. giving cartridges issue on first day.. very poor hp support
5,Good

5,Best products value for money
5,Good product
5,Nice
1,Good One But heating a lot and taking a lot of time to print multiple papers...Wifi signaling is weak and Catridge Cost is too high according to market
5,It's a very useful product. Backup is good. High portability adds to the utility. Print quality is good. Satisfied. But the flip side is that its ink cartridge is generally not available in market. Print cost is quite high.
1,PLEASE DONOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. HP HAS STOPPED MANUFACTURING IT'S CARTRIDGE. POOR AFTER SALE SERVICE. THEY ARE JUST SELLING THIS PRODUCT TO CLEAR THEIR STOCKS.
5,Great product.  Very compact and mobile.
1,Total wastage of money features can be achieved with any low cost printer
5,Very useable mobile printer.
1,"HP cannot supply cartridges for this and it’s unavailable in hp store for last 6 months plus . For a customer who has spent a lot to get this mobile printer , it’s like HP has cheated . I am stuck with this printer for last 6 months for no cartridge and now thinking to buy another printer"
5,It is a unique printer which is chargeable and portable. It provides a very good connectivity to all the mobile devices through WiFi.
5,"Print quality is very good as compared to price. And the most attractive part is, it supports different paper size from a standard bar codes paper size to a shipping label paper size."
1,windows 10 does not detect this printer  on my both laptops.i have tried it installing drivers both from the CD provided in the box and by downloading the drivers from the website.i need a replacement
5,Value for money. For bulk printing from excel database is bit difficult. Need to have a good source of direct thermal paper. So far no issues with product. Using from 3 months
1,Always seeing error after printing normal paper. Then have to switch off and on for resetting. Trying maximally but not resolved. No response from seller. It is for sticker paper only. Dont buy for normal paper
1,"The machine is not even printing a single digit. Its just a dabba, rather calling it printer."
5,Nice product worth for money
1,Damaged after 9 Days
4,Its a bar code thermal printer and you also use for billing  .
5,Good printer im happy with this
5,Good
5,Very nice 👍
5,Super printer
5,Built quality is very good and feel premium.Printing quality of this printer at this price point is very nice.Printing efficiency is also better than my older one.
2,Not good product at all times
5,"Good product, excellent packing. Software CD is also provided.Print quality is good and fast as well."
5,I can easily print from my phone. Awesome experience with using this thermal printer in my home. quality is very good. Happy now
3,"After using the printer for a few days, here is what I experienced:Pros:1. Unboxing and Setup was easy and quick2. Printing was fairly simple3. Black print is fast and crispCons:1. Downloading the driver was a terrible experience. The HP Website was so slow, I could finished my lunch, evening snacks and it was still downloading!2. Colour print is absolutely worst. Highly pixlated and no sharpness even after selecting best quality in the settings.3. Printed a picture of my nephew on a photo paper and after 24 hours, it hadn't dried and got smudged when touched and spoilt the whole print.Conclusion: if you are looking for home printing and if 90% of it is B&W, its an excellent printer. Its good if you wish to print color text too. However, one of the worst printer for color photo printing. I wish I had purchased Epson Ink Tank printer!"
4,I am giving 4 star due to HP support staff. I bought one printer with Amazon. Item deliver on time but product is defected. I replace the item receivd another printer. Now working properly. But HP support staff said that it was PC software problem for colour defect. Not proper support from them. But Amazon deliver on time. Thank you so much
2,Doesn't support wifi connectivity wrong details in comparison section. Only usb connectivity.
1,I am an expert in ITand this product is just garbage. When I calibrate the print heads it does not take place and prints are all distorted and of poor quality. Tried to get a replacement the same day but amazon is not letting me do so. Everytime it takes me to consult an expert and the support person repeatedly asks the same questions again and again and finally they ask to contact HP. Total waste of my money. Just a landfill now.
1,Print head error after 30 prints and 2 weeks. 3 visits to HP service center and now they want me to buy print heads as the print head which came with printer is out of warranty. Printer is under warranty.
4,Print quality is not the best but good for home use. Printing speed is little slow. Installation is easy.
1,"Print Quality is pathetic, used superior quality paper. 40% of print outs either getting stuck inside printer or torned."
5,"No doubt, printer is good and prints good. The packaging was also great and satisfied with it, but there was no Amazon sticker in/on the product.And the most important thing there was no Invoice/Bill, which is always present for any small-to-small product.Satisfied by printer and highly recommends it."
5,Since I started working from home and my child also online school printer became essential for us. This printer is very easy to install and use. Also this gives good quality of print. It also used for scan and copy. So overall nice performance and worth putting money on it.
5,"This was a good investment. It prints well. After 3 months of heavy usage, I can say it is worth the money I paid."
4,Best printer and print quality is best comparison with epson hp printer quality alwas best but only problem with page pulling but it's ok
5,"Print quality is good, easy to use.Printer didn't come with Amazon package though. It was delivered only with hp package box."
5,Nice printer. Easy to install and take printouts.

1,Only b&w print is good but color print is so bad I hate this machine for photo print.and printing so late.
5,It is such an amazing printer ...... Very happy to buy this ..... Worth buying
5,GOOD
1,"HP is cheating the customers. It's cartridge is use and throw and the new cartridge is sold for Rs.4800. You can't use the refilled cartridge. We have been cheated and suggesting everyone, not buy this. If you change a new cartridge every time it will cost you Rs.3.14 for a page printing.  HP has become MAD. A Big NO to the printers having this type of cartridge 110A."
1,"i will not recommend this printer because after finish tonner, while you will refile this very costly,Rs 200 only ink refillingRs 300 only for the chip because of this chip-based cartage.Rs 200 for drum etc.if you go for new cartage than original cost will be around Rs 5000/1500 pages, if you go local than Rs 1400/500 pages.not easily available in local market."
2,I got this printer and wanted to connect my phone to it. I am told that it won't work on an IOS and neither a MAC because it aint compatible. Tech support people should know that wifi printing doesn't really use drivers and its just configuration. At the time of calling I was already able to print through my MAC. While connecting through my phone it was asking for the printers network key. I was told to call HP for the same. The truth is that to get the network key just print the network config from the printers menu - simple. Also while listing out product information do mention the GHz band in which the printer will work - its 2.6Ghz only and not 5Gz as modern day broadband networks are. Or if you have a dual band router. A customer who is not technically sound will either return your product or will give a bad customer satisfaction score as I am doing.
3,"I purchased it for 16500, choose ed over cannon product.This is difficult to install...my computer didn't recognize printer.no hp package helpful.hp wireless app is also useless app.i used mopria print,scan apps and finally got print through android phone.My computer still not recognise the priner through USB . don't buy"
4,"I have been a Canon follower for a long time as it had delivered fairly good results, but lately have been miffed by its compatibility to Mac operating system.(I  use a Mac computer). So i hesitatingly purchased this HP printer.The HP smart software is really better than the Canon software in usability and the smart tasks feature is quite friendly. It can color scan documents and photos which is really good whereas its competitor Canon model will not do this even though it is priced higher. This model can scan in color but cannot print in color.Connecting to the HP smart sometimes takes a little long especially uploading to Evernote, ( i don't know why ? )but manageable.I have not really calculated the cost per page as i am not a heavy user to factor this aspect in buying this machine. Overall happy with the machine."
5,"Printer is sturdy and work well except that it doesn’t work generate code to log in the account to use HP smart application,"
5,This hp products is very good and printing quality very good and useful items.
1,The scanner is not working with windows 8. After many try by support team they ask me change the O.S. but why should I change my O.S because of printer..So guys who have windows 8 or 8.1 don't purchase this printer.
5,"Thanks for amazon for giving me great deal to buy this printer at very attractive cost, printer is very good for home or office use also delivery service or packaging of big size products is very nice."

3,red light error problam bahut jayda hai
4,"Although not for long I used this product.  Writing this after two days use. But, the feel of the printer is good. It's of a solid build up. The print quality and response on command is also good.The ink tank filling with ink in an automated and hassle free way with the provided ink bottles of the company. No worry about cartridges.  The ink level is apparent in the ink tank. After all its an excellent product."
4,I bought this printer recently and I found this printer is quite good. Print quality is good but not excellent. If you are using normal low cost printers like HP and other then replace it.  This printer is easy to use and quite fast in printing.I definitely recommend this printer. I am happy as of now.
2,"Good for black and white, but colour print is not qualiti."

You can also search google review before buying this.The dual toner cost is 1400 and you can print 1200 copies.If i can get 4000 copies, that is adjustable.  I am thinking to go to consumer court regarding this."

4,The print quality is good. But the printing speed is little bit slow that is number of papers per minute printed is less. But ink consumption of this printer is really great. Till now I printed about 600 pages and very less ink is used from tank

I have used it to print pics on glossy photo paper and am extremely satisfied with the result. Overall, an excellent buy. I bought offline, from Nehru place Delhi for 12500, so much cheaper then is listed here."
5,"I am using this latest printer from Epson for last 3 months and I am fully satisfied with its performance. Besides having very good looks this printer is very economical and use to use. Without any doubt, just go ahead and buy it. You will be happy for your decision later on"

5,"It’s a great product. Purchased this for my shop and there is no problem till now. Been using this for almost a month now and no regrets so far. I would recommend this to anyone who wants this kind of product at this price. A must buy, just go for it blindly."
1,Print quality is pathetic colours are scattering when touched. Engineer visited but he was not able to fix it. He was also not skilled well every single thing he was asking over the call. I want a refund.
1,"Previously I was using HP Deskjet ink Printer 3545e, replacing cartridges costed me around 1500 and then if i don't use it for a while ink was getting dried up fast. So i taught of upgrading to a Ink Tank printer then I decided to purchase HP Smart Tank 530. When my product finally arrived, after using it for a while then I realised it was really a bad decision to go for HP Smart Ink Printer. I dint face issues with the print quality, print quality is great but the main two issues i faced with the printer was touchscreen was not so responsive and in between the display freezes. Second issue was with the built quality Hp has used low cost plastic to built this printer im not sure how long i can use this printer.  My personal suggestion is that please don’t  buy HP Smart Tank 530 Printer rather consider buying Epson Printers or other good hp printer models which will last for long and wont regret later."
1,"The printer is easy to install and doing average printing, there is no installation from hp or Amazon provided. And print quality is ok or same like 410 in price of 11000 and I feel I made wrong selection in high cost.Moreover whenever I print on gloss sheets the colors are comes out on my hands.and printout fades.very very bad product in high price.not to recommend anyone"
1,Was delivered a defective product. Moreover while checking online support on HP's website we found out that the warranty period start date was August 27 when we had purchased the product on December 25. I guess the reseller is trying to scam innocent buyers. Be aware.
5,"This printer from HP is an awesome one. It has Wireless , Wifi Direct, USB connectivity.A real time Ink Level indicator is what i like. You dont have to either print printer status report or check it using front panel or using printer software.2 Black ink bottles are provided in the box.Setup was smooth. HP Smart App supported.Overall a good product from HP."
5,Pros :-*Wifi printing is effective*HP Warranty is covered (provided you have registered the product )*HP installation is applicable*Anywhere printing through HP smart app or email*Printer quality is good*Works with Alexa seamlessly* Touch screen pad is smooth* extended warranty is recommendedCons :-*Automatic duplex printing  is not available this is the biggest drawback with such an expensive printer .*Little Noisy* printing tray doesn’t hold printouts effectively . Papers fell down after 2 to 3 printouts* printer may have 10 to 15 days old warranty as the product is sold by reseller on amazon . Do check this immediately on HP website before you install
5,"I received brand new seal packed product. Initially while setup, I added ink and then when I have to install cartridges and print the alignment page,  then i saw the holder where we have to fit the cartridges it was hitting the printer left and right very hard and not stopping in the middle. I called HP support and they tried to solve the issue over phone with sew trouble shooting steps. However result was same. HP arranged the service call for me and I also talked to amazon support for the issue. I explained them that I got faulty product which I can to know after inserted the ink so  I was hesitated to return the product as this might be given to someone else. But Amazon says, this is not my (ME) issue and will be taken care by Amazon even product is opened and they arranged the return and refund as same product was not available anymore with them.5 star for AMAZON.Both HP and Amazon was scheduled for next day. Luckily HP guy came firs and fixed the issue in 2 minute by unscrewing 4 screw and placed the transparent encoded strip in position (sensor behind cartage holder). He said this might happened in transport. Once it worked, i canceled the return request.5 star for HP support.Printer:Black ink is pigment and hence once printed on paper it is waterproof even if you put the printed paper in the bucket full of water.Color is not waterproof, however they don't fade easily.ADF: This is the plus advantage in this printer over HP 515. Just keep the bundle of paper in ADF and get the scanned or copy without any mess.INK: I got 3 color (GT 52 70 ml), Magenta, Cyan, Yellow each and 3 black (GT 52 XL 135 ml) you will get only 1 black in HP 515 which is 2000 cheaperOverall printer is good.5 star for Printer."
3,"Print quality is excellent but when you print via Wifi, printing speed is slow (can be ignored).It has been just a week now, very often noticing cartridge issue. After couple of prints have to open the door and set the cartridge.Other than this haven't noticed any issue."
1,1 page printing it's take 1 min (60 sec. )Very slow printing.High quality printing.After 2 .months ink pipes is blocked automatically. . RS 17000 loss
1,"Product is good only,Service was so bad"
4,"Pros := Compact- Easy to install- Ink filling is pretty easy as well- Has good advanced features (Wifi direct printing, Airprint, Print anywhere..)Cons :- Is a bit expensive for the features provided- No auto duplex..pretty strange. This feature is found on Inkjet printers which cost 7k"
5,"When I say smart, it not only connects with a smart app, it also has a smart display that can not only guide you with the initial installation process, it has a functional aspect to it that allows user to control scan, print and settings functions through the menu available in the screen. Installation was fairly easy. Took me maximum 15 minutes including test print and scan. You can easily connect to your WiFi using the menu on the touch screen and input your password. You can also connect to the printer via Bluetooth using mobile app on phone or on laptop. Printing speed is decent, pretty average for inkjet printers. Nothing too fast."
5,"I am using EPSON ink tank L455 since 3 years. I bought HP Smart Tank as additional requirement.I took some photo print on normal A4 size and outcome was outstanding, no ink smudging and spreading noticed.Printer design is very nice, its looking beautiful."
3,"Overall speed of Printer with prints and scan is slow. Also, for both side printing feature, you need to feed the paper manually. Where my other 4 year old cheap HP printer can feed paper automatically for both side printing."
5,"Awesome Printer from HP. Thank you Amazon for delivering this. Wifi setup is so easy and Bluetooth connection is an added feature. Touch screen works flawlessly. No extended inktank, ita a compact printer. I like it."
5,"Excellent printer. Easy to install. The automatic document feeder works like a charm and saved time. The quality of scanning and printing are superb. I always preferred inkjets over laser printers for quality of printing, and the large ink tanks have taken away the pain of frequent (and expensive) cartridge changes. The printer is a little delicate though. Meant for personal use."
1,"I bought this printer last month. I relied on HP brand name. Set up and install was easy. But the problem is that it just does not print. HP SMART app is installed and it says printer is online and all is good. But just that when I give a print command, it does not print. I am frustrated with the unreliability of this printer. Don't buy this ever."
4,"Installing : Little tricky.Print quality : Good in BWColour match : Not perfect match, poor Color Rendering.Scanner : GoodDirect printing : Not easy as HP claimsSpeed : Tad slow, takes time to wake up after a print command.Over all : Good printer with above few drawbacks."
5,performance is outstanding. Easy to operate. Inks bundled with the package are not going to empty soon. Document feeder scanning is very fast and clear as normal scan. Printing speed is good.
2,"Not sure if this is a buy since I’m already facing minor issues where I end up doing basic troubleshooting.Doesn’t have duplex scan or print unlike the queries section suggests.And yet, I’m not sure if there is any other better printer than this with ADF!!"
5,"Printing is of good quality and fast it has 2 scanners glass scanner and documents feeder scanner you can scan ,print and copy from your phone with hp smart app installation was provided free within 24 hours after raising service request on hp website"
1,BAD PRODUCTTIME WASTECUSTOMER CARE IS BAD
4,Printing quality is amazing.Connecting to mobile is simple..The worst thing i noticed is print speed is slow.Remaining all features are worth for money.
1,"Pathetic support system.... Don't go by the name HP.They will keep you on whatsapp for more than 2 hours and still won't be able to fix the issue.Wireless connectivity is the worst part.Don't don't go for this overly-priced, dumb (not smart) printer"
1,Colour spilled inside the box. I did not even open it fully.
5,Excellent printer by HP.  Quality of print is good and cost effective.  Better than laser printer. This is very useful particularly in lockdown period.  This is very helpful for educational method.
4,Given option to print from anywhere in world. Printing yield is of 6000 & 8000 pages per bottle (will check when use that much). Satisfied with the performance so far.
5,"Awesome Print quality, Easy to install, Fast service from HP and the most important part trust the Brand HP and Amazon e-shopping portal for the genuine product. You will never regret. Without a doubt, Go for it."
5,Print quality is superb.....and printing speed is too good as compier other peinter or xerox machine...
5,"Very good printer for home/office use.But not recommended for photocopy shop. Enriched with features and lags in only one thing, auto duplex printing."
4,The installation is little hard the printer is complicated the problem is it takes 3 to 4 min to print one a4 color page the touch response is okNow it has been 1 month to the printer and now it prints in 60 to 70 secs
3,"Awesome printer 👍,but printing slow . And system quality good,This printer is not suitable for taking out passport size photos or photos of any size. Epson is always good for taking photos. Personally, I don't like the price of this printer"
2,Wifi is nightmare . It don't work all the time . Its okayish printer  and work only with USB connection .Print quality is fine
5,Very happy with the print quality (was the only reason for this purchase).Easy to install only if you read manual.
1,Printer not installed yet.  Intimated to HP installation but not received any positive feedback. Poor installation services
1,"Photocopier not working.Annoyed,  having received a defective piece.  Wastage of precious time.  No Replacement option is there.  Very Deceptive.  Not Expected from AMAZON."
3,poor built in quality.but print quality is good.in the image displayed in amazon its looks like full black but more grey color on the top.looks different than image on the  display on amazon
3,Build quality is not great...at the time of unboxing you will definitely find that it's not a printer worth 17k.... colour print quality is very averageNot satisfied with the purchase
3,"Print Quality good but slow,installation typical but use very essay, amazon alexa and google voice assistant mention its features but not supported"
5,Little hard to setup wireless printing. But overall a good product. This isn't an issue to rate by less than 5 stars.
5,A good printer...one who wants only printing with wifi facility..go for it...i bought at 8819rs..any personal query can be entertained..thanks
3,"I initially purchased this printer for basic home use as well as to print PCB designs, However this printer jams on transparencies and 200GSM paper 90% of the time even after selecting 200GSM in printer settings, didn't expect this from HP as it says in the manual this printer can print on OHP transparencies the print quality isn't great on transparencies when it happens to not jam. also the vertical scaling on this printer is unreliable and it causes an issue for large PCB designs as sometimes it prints the PCB 1-3mm longer vertically (the same pdf prints different sizes vertically so it is 100% a printer issue), however horizontal size is spot onpros: the black is really jet black and it prints very fast, i can print a 10 page 2 sided document in less than 40 secondscons: the printer mostly jams easily on some types of paper, it cannot print properly on transparencies and the HP mobile app doesn't allow you to change the size of of the print when printing from a phone so a small picture takes the full a4 paperi also own a canon E500 inkjet printer and i cannot remember the last time any type of paper jammed in the canon, however this HP printer jams on thick or glossy papers extremely easily."
5,"I bought two of these. Wanted a simple laser printer that had wifi connectivity. Setup was easy, print quality is good. It takes very less space on desk due to its compact design. Make sure that the first setup is done by connecting it to the computer else it ends up configuring it's wireless profile and it takes a setting reset to reconfigure and add it to the network. If you are confused between inkjets and laser, think about how many color prints you need and take a call. If you are going to just print blacks usually. This one is the best option."
5,Buy it only if you do not want support from HP. As it says this product is no longer serviced by HP on the official support website.
1,Not able to find cartridge. HP original one is very costly.
5,"The Product is superb. Print quality is awesome since it is a laserdesk.Only issue is that the WPS pin number is not provided anywhere for printing it through wireless connection in a laptop. You need to first install the drivers whic is a one time process after which the prints are flawless through laptops. For mobile, you need to download the HP Smart app and have to be connected through PRINTER'S WIFI for giving the printout."
3,Nice printed does the job efficiently for printing normal copies. But if your a amazon seller and thinking about printing labels then I wouldn't recommend it as it doesnt print the label correctly. It always misses the alignment
5,"Printer was easy to install. I am using this printer at my home for the past 6 months in a wireless manner. So far, the print quality is good and I haven't faced any difficulty during my printing."
5,What a printer for home use like for kids project and assist to avoid to give mobile to kids which notes comes from whatsapp. Excellent wifi can print from any room.
5,"Very good printer for home and small office purpose.  Easy to configure to wifi network from windows computer but  not from MacBook. Once you configure it for Wifi. then you forget all cable, you can print anything from any gadget or computer through the same wifi network. Very good print quality and can be configure for economic prints."
2,It’s only good if you are planning to print 10-20 pages a day. My workload is around 100+ pages a day. I just used once a it was getting heated and also after 30 odd pages it produces smoke !! If you are looking for high volume then buy those heavy printers. Also Carterage is pricy.
3,"Writing it after wasting my 6 hours.Good build quality, easy to print with phone but you can do very little customisation with your documents while print,by using Phone. Easily get connected with phone. But to do more customisation with your documents you need a PC or a laptop. And getting connected with laptop, that's too wireless is a hell of work. You have to download file from HP website which is very pathetic. You might easily get connected using USB cable, but remember you are paying 2000 extra for the wireless facility. So If you are not easily get connected,then what is the point of paying extra. It would be better if you go for 108a , less price, same quality just the wireless facility will be absent there."
4,Value for money.... only issue is it takes time to wake up from sleep mode....
5,Fantastic network printer solving the printing needs during WFH for school and office.If I have to nitpick somehow the network printing is a bit slower to start.Very very easy to install and so long it is in wifi range can be installed anywhere
5,The printer does the job. However it looks very fragile (when compared to my earlier Xerox laser printer)
2,The ink powder is released out like a smokey mist every time for the first page. No ink mist for consecutive second third ..... Only for every first page.....This is a health hazard!!!!!!
5,"Very easy to install and it's really compact. As it is wireless, don't worry about so many cables on your table. Installing an app helps to to print from your smart phone."
1,"Quality is poor.Only connecting on Bluetooth.Whenever connect the cable it shows printer offline.Printing speed is very slow ie preparation for printing is slow ,once ready for printing then speed is fine.Both side printing is practically of no use."
4,Very good printer and easy to install.HP smart app make it very easy to print from mobile.dual side printing is not available is the only drawback.
3,Average printer. Toner cartridge is rarely available.
5,I liked the product so much...it was just like as advised
1,Can't install on Ubuntu distributionAlso wifi direct is not stable
1,"Extremely bad quality printing, got some issue within 10 days ,I returned it.😥😡"
5,"Good print quality, after installation very easy to use, printing from mobile via wifi is very easy and time efficient"
1,"Havent been able to connect the printer to wifi and no help from HP either. have tried using macbook, windows laptop and iphone mutiple times. waste of money paying for wifi."
5,Good product
5,It was easy to setup with Wi-Fi router having WPS option and the print quality is good and fast as well.
5,"Hassle free printing system. At this cost, I found it to be the best thing. Very compact in size. Initially you might face difficulty in installation. It's better to call hp and get installation support. They do it with remote connection."
5,Amazing product. THANKS to quick and safe delivery from amazon. If you really want to buy this printer go for it. DON'T THINK twice. Packing was perfectly intact and item was well secured...
5,Easy to use also print quality is good 👍
5,"Easy to install, good quality prints and prints directly from phone when used with the hp app."
5,HP is brand in market for years so it does have value for money.
4,Overall Product is good.
5,Perfect for home use and if you don't need color print. Using print from phone option is great.
5,Awseum printerJust go for it 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻

1,Wrost product and wrost service waste of money anc time.please dnt buy tvs printer and ant tvs products.bad quality .
4,"the very good printer  I like very much and very satisfied to boughtFollowing Items are plus in  this printer1.Speed high2.Colour-optional,3.total print  out Eco mode 8500 pages,4. Double tray  (more paper load  )5.If any problem in printer head change Easily6.this printer is the higher volume  per month  5000 pages ready to print7.Duplex Print  I bought this printer 1 month ago no problem I am happy."
5,"If you are looking for a good monochrome single function printer then this can be a good option.Things I like about this printer1- It's an inktank printer so the printing is very cheap. So you can print bulk amount of materials without any worry.2- It has also the option of colour printing. Incase your need is for rare colour prints you can buy the cartridge CL 741 , and you can function it like a colour printer as well.(however colour printing is expensive as it used cartridge not the ink)3- It has got 2 trays to store paper hence you don't need to worry about loading papers again and again.4- AUTO DUPLEX PRINTING (printing both the sides automatically) is the biggest advantage of this printer. It will save both your time and paper.5- WiFi connection helps you print from anywhere in your home.Now things that I don't like is1- Auto duplex printing is little slow.SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SINGLE FUNCTION PRINTER . THIS CAN BE A GOOD OPTION FOR YOU ."
4,Everything is best. The best only thing is that it should have scanner. Rest is best in class.
4,"The printer was good. I can say it comes under a best small office and home printer.Pros:- best printing experience.- ink efficient- color cartige can be added saperately (no ink tank for it)- duplex printing- two ways of page loading.Cons:- less info on product page regarding if it can be used as color printer or not.- a bit hard to setup over network.- it was not supported for mac os.- I was unfortunate that it went off within afew days of using, having error code 6800.Seller Apprio Retail Private Ltd. is very supportive as soon as I had raise issue they provided me refund for it as I was expecting (wanted) replacement."
5,"• Auto duplex feature• Wifi Direct connectivity via canon printer app is very smooth•Ink tank printers are economical•build quality is good•print quality is goodI'll further upload the revised review of after 1 month usage, if anyone has any doubt or confusion regarding this printerI'll be happy to assist, you can write me at 143tripathiashish@gmail.com"
1,Printer received on the 8th August.  Registered with h Canon service centre for installing.....so far none turned up though they always assure us that it will be done the next day...
5,The technician from Cannon arrived in less than 24 hrs after registering request ( in East Delhi) . My kids are taking lot of B&W printouts from  laptop/tablet/phone on our home wireless network. It has been only 1 week but we are very happy.  We would install color cartridge if we need that in future.
5,"Easy to install, duplex printing, easy WiFi connectivity with laptop, mobile.... fast and good print quality....scope for inserting colour cartridge also.... brought for 9k, let's see long term performance.."
3,I received parcel packed well. However instead of ink bottle in pack the ink was filled in tank and some ink was spilled. Dont know if the tank was full but now ink level shows half.  all the orange tapes were removed . I installed the software and used the printer. Printing qualit is good. First few prints were soiled by ink. But requesting amazon to lool in the matter how the ink was filled in the tank and was it half filled.
5,Good Printer💯 percent Satisfied with the ProductPicture quality is excellentSuperb I love this product
4,Print quality is excellent. But I haven't still figured out how to wirelessly print from a mobile. Could have been easier if the number of steps are less.
5,Good product. I have tried epson also. Epson has connectivity issues with wifi. This one is smooth.
1,I m nervous because printing speed is Very slow on 2 prints per minute..
1,Sick n tired to connect with WiFi..Returning back
3,Doesn't work thru apple MacOS
4,When in duplex printing mode it takes some time for printing.... otherwise it's worth for money....
3,Printing speed not matches as promised....6 page per minuteHighlighter react with ink easily as compare to laser printer
5,"Affordable , Excellent product for Duplex printing . Option to print colour ."
3,Excellent but connecting to wifi is difficult for the first time.
4,Overall good. Only issue is duplex printing takes more time.
4,Useful items for home users. Low cost printers.
5,Thank you
5,Good
4,Only bad thing about this printer is printing speed is very loww...  It will take hours if you want to print 100pages nearly 2pages per minute... But all other are fine till noww
5,Very good product
5,Excellent product for home use
5,Good product to use
5,Good printer
5,"CANON imageclass MF244dw can print both side of a single paper . It can scan automatically single side of 35 sheets of paper. You can copy both side of paper. So, MF244dw is saving much of time, work, paper and cost. You can easily use it for home purpose. The LCD of this MFD is very details. The LCD is giving information on how to clear paper jam in details whenever a paper jam occurred. 1700 pages toner is included with the box. This MFD is ahead of competition.Thank you."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE CANON Laser Printers because the Canon Company is NOT AT ALL PROVIDING WARRANTY.Amazon is NOT Taking any Responsibility for WARRANTY Ignorance from Canon Company. Total Loss of 20K within 40 days.
4,"for home office use, this is the best printer. printing done by 1200dpi, best colour scanner (600dpi). so easy process to scan a document to computer, its just one button process."
3,"The print quality from this printer is spotty. Characters in printed text don't have sharp edges. It feels like someone's chiseled off the ink. The printer arbitrarily applies its own margins especially on non standard paper sizes. This has often driven me crazy. When two copies of the same document are printed, the two have different margins.The Windows driver doesn't work. The only way I can operate the scanner is my Android phone. The scanner feed mutilates the originals at the edges, and the scanned documents are usually a little tilted, even though the guides are made to snugly sit along the paper edges.Overall, a mediocre product."
5,"This is an excellent printer that prints on both sides of the page which was my main requirement. The front led panel is also excellent and I could assign the wireless ssid, password and ip address to it easily using the buttons on the printer. Printing and scanning to this wirelessly is a breeze. The only negative I see is that when I am using A4 size paper and the person sending me the document has incorrectly selected page size letter, then this printer gives an error printing on the back of the page. So before printing on two sides I need to manually go and check the paper size and change it to A4. I have not had paper jams but I have seen youtube videos which say that you have to remove screws behind the printer to remove the jammed paper. In my older hp I just had to pull out the cartridge and remove the jammed paper. Overall I am very happy with this printer, I would highly recommend it. It is a bit on the heavy side though as compared to my older HP multifunction printer."
1,"The received printer is damaged ,infirior qualify hing, As hing support of the scanner is damaged,may be manufacturing defect, how can be such big company have this tolerance for their customers???????????After watching many printers I ordered it for giving the printer to gift to my father. Totally dissapointed with canon and team .poor quality plastic material. Don't buy it. Feeling sad as I am regular customer of amazon. And old user of conon printers."
2,Adf feature is not up to the mark....print quality is ok with letter and when you try to print an black and whit image quality is very bad...as compare to my perious printer...one of the big problem is after scanning of 30 to 40 pages paper starts getting jammed(used on only unstapled pages it cant hadle the unstapled pages than you can imagine)....and irritate you when you were doing work....one more big issue using it over wifi through pc...its too much slow as compare to using it from app....which is also quite irritating when you want to use it from pc....data cable quality is also quite low....overall not for office use....also printing speed over pc is low and it only print 20 to 22 pages ppm....not to buy product...its better you go for other hp products...
5,"In a day and age where colour printers are very cheap, I went for a laser printer for my WFH purposes. The printer came as promised, in a double packaging. I opened it and set it up. It worked using the USB without any problems but I did find the wifi option not easy to set up. Followed the instructions in the manual, still no luck. Finally, I called Canon and the person came the same day. He took 5 minutes to set it up and it is working fine. It is a joy to be able to print without attaching cables. Four of us work from home therefore this is a great option and additionally, I can print from my mobile also. However, it takes two apps to do it. That is a total pain. Plus if Canon can make the wifi setup manageable by non IT persons, then it would be amazing."
2,My Printer is under warrenty and i have used it only for printing around 1000 pages and now its not able to print  clear enough to read out the printed content. i hope my  problem would be resolved soon . and my cartridge would be replaced very soon . so that we can continue to have faith in amazon and its product quality. Else we will loose faith in your platform and I Need to to Think many times before buying something from amazon now.kindly resolve the issue by replacing cartridge.Thankyou.
4,The printer was really easy to install. Print quality is also really sharp and clean. Only negative thing I notice was that either it is not possible or I was unable to Scan documents from my system. I have to place the document on machine and select the scan to computer option from there only and I can not customize the same from my system like controlling the size and contrast and quality (DPI).
1,"I purchased Canon Multifunction Printer MF244DW. Since last 3 days i am struggling to install its Software. As these days Laptops don't come with CD/DVD readers, the DVD ROM provided is useless. I tried to download the software from Canon website, but, the installation was showing error always. Twice i lodged complaint Online at Canon Customer Care. But, nobody has visited my place. Its now just a box for me. I don't recommend anybody to buy Canon products. There service is poor."
5,"Print quality is good, easy to use and value to money."
5,"Purchased from Appario Business.History - On the onset let me tell you all, this is my second Canon Printer. Previously used Canon LBP2900B and Canon Lide 100 scanner. This combination used for around 10 years and the scanner conked. The printer still works.Requirements - Wanted a multi functional setup with Dual side printing, auto document feed, photo copy  and LAN & / WiFi. Looking into many other companies like HP, Epson, Brother finally decided to go with Canon. Previous experience got the brand loyalty of me.Overall - The printer has USB, LAN and WiFi connections for printing and scanning. There is a graphic LCD display on the front side panel which can be tilted upwards for better visibility. It has fair number of key(s) with specific and general functionality. It can do photo copying also. This feature is really quick and good. Top side is the flat bed scanner and document feeder. Two trays for paper at the bottom. It can also directly print from mobile phones. A lot of network related features.Printer - Good print quality with dual side print and various other paper saving print programs. Booklet, envelope printing and other document functionality also present, not tested them yet. The print software in Windows has all the control features.Scanner - The flat bed scanner has good resolution and also there is some software enhancement for the scanner.It gives good results. ADF system feeds the documents one by one, it is good to scan multiple pages in a stack.It can scan ID card both faces on to the same page.Connectivity - USB, LAN, WiFi. Connect your laptop through USB, LAN or WiFi. Print/Scan directly from mobile phones without laptop.Windows - All features of the printer can be used in Windows 10 with the provided software.Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) - Printing and Scanning possible with a little effort. Not all features tried.Android - Printing and Scanning possible with a little effort. Not all features tried. Canon Print Service app, Mopria Print, Mopria Scan required.Mac - not testediPhone - not testedThe device comes with a power cable, USB cable, software CD, toner cartridge and user manuals.Note: The software in the CD is a bit old, it does not work on Win 10, need to download the latest from website.The best features -Dual side printing, it saves time and paper.ID card both faces scanned on the same page. ADF for scanning.Photocopy without PC/laptopMobile phone direct print and scan feature, save a lot of time, no PC/laptop required.The hurdles -Software for Windows on the CD is old, need to download from website.Configuring the LAN and WiFi is a bit tricky.All features are not available / tricky for Linux.Scope for improvement -Better feature support and Control Applications for Linux."
5,I was already using the same model at my previous work place. Now i transferred to a new office where no scanner and printer is available. Hence i purchased this for my conveniounce of work from home due to covid 19. Its a overall champion in all areas referred to a printer cum scanner.
5,1.User friendly printer2.Printing quality is good not excellent3. No big space required4. You can make printout from mobile through business cannon print application.Overall satisfied with the product.I would recommend this highly for the students.Good luck with the purchase.Enjoy printing.
1,After Using one week the Paper Jam is normal in this printer within 10 days the printer was not working. I did complain about the problem. After 21 days there is no response from customer care except an email i.e they will solve within 24 hours. Overall the service is worsted . It will be better to buy another company product Like HP etc. If  you are buying this product It's your own risk. Still I am facing this problem and not happy with is product of Cannon. Thanks
1,On first day printer n scanner didnt work..after several folow up with call centre canon guy came and did something and without asking us reported as work done. printer is somehow working but scanner is still not workingWorst experience.
5,"Build quality is good, compact enough to place in space size of 1.5 square feet comfortably and got almost all necessary  features for small enterprises or to be used as home printer. Easy to operate and lots of documentation and YouTube videos available to help with."
3,"Printer is ok, but the cartridge with printer given is empty and there were no powder in it, earlier prints are coming dull we have asked this demo installation person but he told us that laser printer is giving such prints only, but after installing new cartridge the prints are excellent. It means the installed cartridge is empty and fooled us by installation guy"
5,"If you’re looking for a laser monochrome printer, this is one of the better ones, I like canon’s printers and it’s relatively easier to find a service center compared to brother’s, wireless connectivity has some delay time though but the rest is good"
4,"Pros:*Wireless Printer, Scanner* ADF Scanning & Copier* Duplex printer* Network Printer & ScannerCons:*ADF Scanning is limited to 30 Sheets at a time & scan only single side*Bit Noisy while scanning & printingBest use for Office & Home"
5,The canon customer care is horrific misbehave person do not want to help.  if you need any help to install the printer from the canon service then do not buy. Canon customer care people are worst people misbehaving the coutomer asking for help.
1,"I got it delivered on sep20, 2020. Printer box was damaged on both side. Very disappointed on quality. So far I just opened the printer and installed. But not sure on the printer quality and need to check all functionality."
1,it's a big no for this machine as it does not print duplex i.e on both sides of the paper. information given is misleading the consumers. Scanning bed is only A4 size.  it does not work for legal or other only A4 size.A BIG NO NO
1,"The waste printer and cartridge is drying very fast,cartridge cost is more"
4,"I have using past months, i have faced issues :1) the tonner cartridge cost was original Rs. 900/- to 1500/-2) Refilling cost around 500 to 700 for 1 cartridge3) pc scan setting was changed to letterotherwise it was awesome at this price."
1,When it was mentioned supports A3 I expected A3 and legal size copying too. But it's too small and I am not having the return option too.Amazon writes 7 days returnable but then why the option was disabled.  I only kept getting a message someone from canon or the seller will call to set it right.
4,The product seems to be very good features wise and value for money but it was very disappointing that the booklet ' quick start guide' was missing in the box. Amazon support asked me to contact canon support and canon support asked me to contact Amazon. But no one assured to send this minor thing by post. It's strange to find such things missing in a new product and raises doubts.
5,Masha Allah it is excellent buy for small business office I am.using from 1 year. Using compatible catriages its an excellent printer fast and features full.
5,"i have been using Canon from quite some time.in fact earlier also i had the same model but due to my fault i had to buy the same product.the size is perfect, the sound is good, the print speed is good, wifi connectivity is user friendly"
1,The print quality is very low. Even after all possible settings changed - print quality is very low. A new laser printer with such low print quality was not expected.
2,"Good features. But After sale services are extremely Bad. No way to contact the support staff is active, neither call nor mail. Very painful for Businesses, who need day to day servicing of the products. Cannon must be losing its customers as it is not at all vigilant in after sale services."
5,best product and super fast deliverybest print quality and low price and value for moneyand fast copy  superb
5,Very easy to connect manage & operate and on too of that canon’s maruti like reach in india .And best of all got it for 2000 less from amazon than available canon dealer in faridabad.

3,The product is good but there was not the driver disc
2,Break top glass
5,Very good product.Must buy....
2,Only 500 prints and ink level has reached half.Fake promising of 5k prints
1,Fast time hp said that no of print 5000But actually it's print 1000 so costing is high.
2,You are really chiting campany in hp printers 5k no printer500 page in one toner very badAnd very cast one page
5,"Looks like a cute mini photo state machine.Need Windows 10 minimum for Desktop Computer. You must have a router and a Wi-Fi dongle in USB of Desktop. If you have Router then It is good else Windows 10 can start Hot spot with wifi dongle. You can buy dongle from near mobile store or from Amazon. An active internet Connection is compulsary to install setup files. Little bit network technical knowledge is needed.Just type web url for desktop and scan QR code from mobile camera. Link and QR code are printed with books received with the box.This printer can work as photocopier, scanner and printer. Only black and white.Extra cartridge not found but one cartridge within printer with full ink found.Value for money."
1,"False claim of 5k prints,but in reality only 300-500 prints.Toner is also very expensive."
1,"Printer is not giving 5k print. Don't buy this. Nearly 500 pages comes out which add cost of ink too much in later stage. I believed in Hp promise but its fake. Within 1 month , i have filled 4 times. 500 pages per 1 fill.. Don't buy this."
5,"I have been using the product since month.It is genuine, brand new and good quality printing.Very simple to start with wireless access in this price range which is very accomodaing."
2,false promises of 5000 pages only 2500 pages print.this printer is good in quality and system but company claims first purchase 5000 page print. But printer print 2500 pages.
1,"It worked fine for around 2 months. After it has printed around 500 pages, the toner level showed half and the prints started coming out very faded. I thought perhaps we should refill the toner. So I bought the genuine toner refill from HP website  and refilled the toner. Instantly the ink level showed 100%. But the print quality remained the same.I called HP support and after 45 minutes of call, the engineer said that the print head seems to be a problem and an engineer will visit me.I waited for 8 days, no one showed up. I called HP support again, they said contact TVS Electronics in Jayanagar, Bangalore. I tried calling them at least 200 times.. on various of their phone numbers listed on HP website and google. No use.I called HP support again and was told they cannot do anything if the service centre is not responding.The hilarious part is that HP sent me survey link for the service request which was never solved. I wrote back asking them to look into the callousness of their service centre. But no action from HP again!I wasted 20K on this printer, just because I trusted the HP brand. Another printer service centre ( who doesnt service HP Neverstop ) told me that this is a bad printer .. most people have print quality issues with this printer."
5,Nice product 👌👍
1,I purchased HP Neverstop laser jet MFP Printer - which NEVER WORKSand there is the POOREST SERVICEIf HP wants - I can donate it to them free - Its unused - they can fool someone else tooShekhar Patil -70 year old - have lots of experience with printers in my life9820212303
1,Horrible...... only one page is print and need to restart for printing every page...
2,this printer is good in quality and system but some ink problem one tonner can't print 800pages
1,Ink refil pump missing and CD driver
4,"Taking print-out from android phone was flawless and very convinient. Establishment of wifi connection between phone and printer is very smooth. No specific app is required for printing from android phone. I have used Samsung J7 & Samsung A7 for this.But it was very difficult for me to install HP software in my Lenovo laptop having OS Windows 7 ultimate-64 bit via USB cable. Not a single software downloaded from official HP site viz Install Easy, Full Web Version, Version for- IT person only was successful. Later it was automatically installed by Windows update. No customer care mentioned in the documents are correct. I have received no call from HP regarding the setup/ installation of the item."
5,Best multi purpose scanner printer.I am using hp printers for 20 years now.Now hp is in less plastic movement so this printer do not need to change whole cartridge. I can just refill it. Original refill pack is so much affordable now.I bought this printer for my office last year. And now bought it again for my second branch office.
1,"This is very worst product from the manufacturer of H.P.  I never seen this type of bad functionality.  From day 1 it created problem.  Print quality and functionality is worst.  I request every customer not to chose this product.  All expectations were collapsed.  Seller not accepted to return back even requested immediately after purchase.  HP Company never provided any technical service.  I lost Rs.18,000/- for purchase of this printer.  Print quality is too much bad.  Seller advised to contact HP customer care, but Company of H.P. never responded to provide customer service.  This is very very very very bad and worst product of HP.  My rating is 0 star to this product"
1,"I DONT LIKE THIS PRINTER SCANNER, THE PRINTER IS GOOD BUT SCAN QUALITY IS VERY POOR. AND IMAGES ARE CROPPING IN ONE SIDE. MEAN FULL IMAGE IS NOT SCANNING. I AM GOING TO BACK THIS PRODUCT."
3,"This printer arrived with a leaky drum. What's more, the page count seems to be 24 more than actual (either zero not set correctly or used before shipping). The drum eventually got replaced through HP customer service, but getting through to HP and getting decent help online was a frustrating experience. So well over a month after purchase (of which the delay from my end was about 10 days) the printer is now set up and functional. And satisfactory so far. The ID printing option is convenient.Two disadvantages:1 The paper tray cover is very difficult to put in place and is really really irritating2 it does not print legal size (contrary to what the HP customer service told me on the phone). There is a range given for paper size but essentially you will be using only A4."
3,"Pros:PrintingSeamless setupCheaper refill costCons :It’s missing Ethernet ,Lacks auto duplex printing (not claimed, but still saying to clear if someone have doubt),comparatively weak WiFiPoor picture printing (might be due to wrong type...but not that great )Google cloud printing support is going away in Dec 2020"
1,"Dint took even a single print outProduct is worst ,no service"
1,The printer shows error and unable to print out. Only scanner is in working.It's a faulty piece given to me which waaranty period only 16 days left.
4,Very comfortable product for operating
4,"Good product, but in this price automatic duplex printing should be provided."
3,The print cost per page was not correct given in description...iam using this from last 6 months the average cost per print is 2rs actually for me...you can watch lot of videos in YouTube about this printer cost..
1,"I have buy this Printer but it is not working, I also request Amazon to refund my money but till now there is no action from Amazon.Very bad experience from Amazon."
5,Awesome product!!!
1,"I am sorry to say that I am unable to use to this product due to there is no driver in the packet. As per written life-let I have to download it from Hp support, the website provided by HP for solution and supporting. I have tried so many time but even fruitless I am at the present. I need help to set up this printer in my desktop to use it.Thanking you."
4,Very safely amazon delivered the product to my home... relieved my apprehension.
5,"If you are buying this with cloud print in mind google is removing its support for google cloud print for windows after December 31, 2020. Check google cloud print for an alternate solution. If u have apple products you can use air print with this.Other than this if you want to print directly with wifi direct it works flawlessly."
1,"Product ink toners are not available at any of HP stores, neither online and more over as promised, it only prints less than 1500pages where are 5000 are promised.They are scamming us."
4,"It was said that back to back printing possible,but only manual possible.Anyway it is possible to print back to back.Black cartridge is not available in the HP store"
1,"The product has decent print quality, but as with every HP product in the market, refills of toner and cartridge are not available. Please buy printers where you can get a refill easily."
4,"Works well even after 3 month, there is no problem apart from few pages stuck in it because of negligence. It's recommended."
2,"I don't have issue with the product only that I think I received a used product, as I'm trying to register for warranty but it's says already registered 4months  back ago. And the toner indicator shows already half have been used."
1,Difficult to get cheque printing and such small paper printing which is easily possible even in basic printers. Even legal paper cannot be scanned.
5,Its one the best product from HP.
5,Nice product
5,"I HAVE SMALL BUSINESS, AND I FACED DIFFICULTIES TO CHOOSE A PRINTER BUT FINALLY I GOT GOOD ONE.. THANKS OTHER REVIEWER AND SELLER DESCRIPTION ..."
4,print very fast...
1,"Service quality is very poor, because once the product is not working, the manufacturer stops replying to our emails and phone calls, because they are avoiding providing repair or replacement."
4,Nice printer. And direct thermal printer. Printing color depends on paper quality if you print on sample paper it's color black and other glossy paper it's color is blue.
5,"The installation process was a little tricky, but after that it's super awesome product. The bill is made and KOT is generated very quickly. Thumbs up from my side. B)"
5,Have been using since 5 months with great results. Seller from Tamilnadu greatly supported while setting up the printer software.
2,Its not Bluetooth or LAN conctivity.. Only USB..  Pls be sure before order
1,I could have given zero rating if it was given here.Waste of money product not as per the description and also waiting for refund from 15 days still not processed.
5,"Printer is very good and value of mony, paisa vasool product."
1,"Hi POS PrinterI bought your printer but its not imprint on bill, just plain paper come out side when I make billing.Please sujjest me how to setup it"
3,"Please guide how to know IP address of printer to connect with network, as upon pressing feed button, it prints information except IP address."
1,The worst printer don't buy any one

5,"I just received the product in 2days after ordering.My laptop is not compatible to read CD so I directly downloaded the driver software of this series Pantum Printer from Pantum website and installed and connected with my ph,laptop wifi with my modem..even u can connect it with your phone hotspot.Downloaded pantum wifi printer app from google play and everything is finely printed.Easy installation.Good quality and fast print.It works good.Nice Printer and printing.I used HP inkjet,Epson all in one inkjet printer..among all these printers Pantum's print quality is good.. although I miss scan and xerox feature in this but with wifi n connecting mobile for scanned copies  it doesn't matter now a days.."
5,"1. Very good build quality 2. Print quality is very good 3. Direct WiFi connection is available 4. Need to enable the connection to other WiFi network. Please see the help page for this. 5. For the first time, the mobile device will not get connected by QR scan. You need to enter the password manually. After that, it will get connected automatically. 6. Only A4 size is able to print 7. USB and Power cord cable length is sufficient."
5,"I purchased this product thru AMAZON today 02/10/2019 and they delivered the product well before time as mentioned.  Packaging was excellent and all the accessories mentioned was available.Regarding installation it is very straight forward and easy to do as well.WIFI works very well.  No duplex printing.  Only printer no photocopier and scanner.  But as on today worth for money for which i have given.  I did some test prints around 20 pages it has come out very good and faster as well.  Need to wait and watch how the performance will be on further usage.Only one clarification required is ""I feel it produces lot of heat"".  Can anyone confirm if this is usual.  I used it  for more than 1 hour and i feel the heat is very high.  Can someone clarify the heating element alone.M. SethumadhavanBangalore"
5,"Excellent print quality, option of printing in 600 or 1200 DPI. use 600 DPI to save toner and also get very sharp fonts. I also use this for envelope printing and it does the job very well. I ordered the 1600 page 211KEV cartridge along with the printer. I have not used the starter cartridge at all. This device is highly recommended for print only jobs."
3,"I was very excited to order a laser printer however the price is the same during the great festive season.We are having very moderate use of printer, after using for few months started giving issues with WiFi connectivity so we have to switch to a USB wire mode. Secondly paper is often gets  jammed.Overall, it is a good laser printer however don't expect the wifi to be available all the time. We have not refilled the toner cartridge so can't say anything much.I hope the manufacturer would help in resolving the wifi connectivity issue as it was one of the influence factor to purchase the product.Thanks."
4,It's a nice product...initially I was very hostile to its quality because many instructions were in Chinese and I could not understand the initial setup...however the customer support helped me very well and it's a nice product as far as its cost is concerned
5,"1)Well packaged, delivered 1 day before schedule (2)Easy to intall. (3)Print quality good say 4.5/5 (4)App can be downloaded on phone to use from mobile. Press WiFi button to print and scan the qr code on your mobile (5)Power button on rear(6) Setting of 600/1200 dpi to save cartridge (7) Manual duplex printing possible(8) Body plastic is of good quality (9)Value for money."
5,Installed in few minutes through Pantum mobile app. Printed few pages via mobile and it is decent. Very convenient to print via mobile. Great printer.
5,"It is my first printer. One click installation, wifi works fine, cloud printing works fine. If I a have to describe in one word, then it is WOW."

3,WiFi printing not working and print quality very less
5,Tried direct thermal printing.Excellent print quality.Fast enough for our requirement.Easy to install the driver on Windows 10.
3,"Got the printer yesterday in good condition. We printed 5 photos - Outdoor photos came up really well. Indoor photos where light is low, the colors do not show up as on mobile screen. Overall good buy.Two issues-1) Product description while buying mentioned Japan as Country of origin, but the description on product says made in China2) Instax share app is not good and has lot of bugs. One star less because of crappy app."
4,Amazing thing if you like to put snaps around house or present to friends! Output is lovely (you shouldn't expect a crisp lab like photo as it's not meant for that!!) Overall a very likeable print with fun element. Only thing is it's App which is stupidly made and it is good only as an interface to print between mobile phone and printer.  Go for it due to it's ah-ha value! And see a smile on your face or on the one who gets the photo!!
5,great device
1,"For such an expensive printer and such a famous brand, this turned out to be such a disappointment. It’s app has a 2.8 rating for a reason! Please don’t waste your money on this. I have tried connecting it from android and Apple phone plus I’ve tried and followed all videos i could find on YouTube for help, I have this printer since 3 months it was a gift so I could not return it!! I feel so bad for wanting this wasteful product!"
1,Very bad quality in both scan and print. Also lines appear on prints after taking prints for 5-10 mins also ink is getting light after 50-60 prints.....
5,"Received the printer in perfect condition. It works as expected, no complaints. However, I came across an Advisory that was issued by Ricoh India that advises users not to buy any Ricoh products from e-Commerce websites.

4,The printer has been setup by myself and mated with the Desktop with Windows Home basic OS but when starting the printer to do a test page the page printed was completely dark with Black cartridge ink filled.I do not know why this is happening when I do the testing page 3 times.Will the supplier help me out in sorting out this issue.Further the scanner's software also installed along with the printer's software but scanner is also not identifiable in the system.Help is needed in this respect from the supplier.
1,"Worst ever services ""Ricoh""1st purchased ""Product not working"" called Customer care and they provided service request no.I Did regular follow ups with then and they regularly keep on changing there service request no.sAt last a technician visited after 6 days, Here he was lack of knowledge and lack of testing equipmentHe said me to return the product as its defective and it will not be cover under warranty.I request him that I cant wait long as I am in big loss due to printer ""as my old printer stopped working all of sudden"" and also he already wasted my 6 days"" , so if he say I can also pay for any parts and additional his service charges but i need it urgently"" whether covered under warranty or not - I don't care""He replied no I cant as even if I wish to then also i can't make it right as i don't have even a single part of the printer to check were the problem isthen how will i correct it, it will take minimum 15 days to repair it because company dont provide us pats to check and we have to ship it to there location, its better to get it replacedOkI open a return request on amazon and thanks to amazon they replaced the product next day itselfBut again Its really worst ""Ricoh"" Printer start misbehaving after 132 Print outs and again its 7 days over with 3 to 4 service request no. on my messages but no one ever came to repair it latest service request no. they gave me yesterday on 6/02/2018 is LSP348723And last i want to tell you mine is not a ruler area , I belong to Jaipur , rajasthan - which is a metro city.I hope amazon will help in any manner"
1,"Two major problems with this printer:1) You can put straight and stiff pages in the paper tray, but when they come out after printing they are curved as if they had been rolled up for some time.2) The manufacturing quality sucks!! Within the first two weeks the printer would not turn on. It was a pain to contact warranty and get it repaired as apparently they did not have the parts available. Even after fixing, there is an earthing problem with the printer. If you turn on the printer and touch the end of the USB cable, you'll be able to feel some current. BEWARE, this might damage your expensive laptop/desktop!"
1,"The printer worked well for few months and then acute paper jamming started. Also the prints on the pages are getting removed while rubbing. Since the printer is under warranty, we got a Ricoh technician onsite and he mentioned that this is a generic problem. He resolved it and the problem resurfaced again within 3 days.I had to log a call ticket again. Very pathetic service from Ricoh and worthless product from cloudtail amazon. Please replace the faulty product. It is really frustrating to call the customer care every 3- 4 days"
3,"product is good, but i want to give ZERO for RICOH SERVICE, every time you need to re-fill / replace cartridge, you need to do at least 1 month follow-up to ricoh service centre."
4,"This is very good laser printer in this price range. Its strength is low cost print and copy but its scanner is not so good scanner is an average, printing is very fast and very less chance to jam the paper, noise level is really very less. It is very power efficient, there are problem in driver software, only printing option is available in ricoh display organizer software and for scanner U have to download Microsoft Scanner software after that only you will be able to scan in PDF. Overall this is very good printer for home and small office use...."
4,"Awesome printer.Scanner works fine.No paper jam issueQuick first printMultiple paper sizes are allowedLast but not the least door to door repair service (Yeah, their engineer visits our home/office and provides repairs and services, all we have to do is contact them via their customer service helpline)Best in its price segment"
4,A real good printer. If you just have a need of scanner and printer go for this product. The only let down is that it’s usb connected. In other words you need to connect it to a personal pc/laptop and can’t  share over home network . (You can add it in network using a usb router which has this functionality)Apparently I did not had this router hence a star less.
3,"I grabbed the Amazon deal for this product and bought it at very affordable price. However, there were some problems in the software installation of the product but got resolved easily. Must have for teaching professionals who need frequent printing and copying."
1,"Don’t buy Ricoh laser printers, there’s no after sales support to refill the cartdige. I saw the you tube videos, not that easy to remove and refill, you might mess it up :-( I regret the purchase"
3,"The printer is small in height, but occupies same space as other printers do. If the paper loading flap and paper out flaps are opened, it would require some more space as well. Printing, copying quality is good. Scanner quality is OK. should have been better. But again, considering all at this price tag , it is value for money."
3,Received product with apoiled scanner glass which had scratches and hs turned opeque and not transperant as it should be. Requested for replacement of Same product hope to get it soon
4,"I have been using this printer for 2 years now , my printing frequency is not very high but i have printed quite a good amount of documents. faced no problem until now print quality is good , scaning also work well , but i cant find any documentation like how to clean the printer etc on the site ."
5,"Value for money product..i got this product for rs 6300 /- its value for money..with great print quality..Its a great laser printer at best price..its value for money..Its a multi function later printer, scan,copy,xerox,..best in class.."
1,"I bought this Printer, reading in the reveiws that is compatible with Mac OS, but it is NOT.So do not buy this if you are going to buy for any Mac OS. I am stuck with this printer now and of no use for me."
5,"A good product in this price range, printing quality is good....Initially faced some problem in installation but its resolved....I have not used its scanning, so cant say about that but in terms of printing and photo copy of A4 size documents its good.....Have been using it for last 6 months, can say its good easy to use(initial installation is hectic)....no issues so far...."
4,"Very cheap and fast to print, time auto sleep, super colour, photo copy awesome, I take till date approx 1500 copy and print , good product, scan is awesome and true colour."
1,"Not good ....Ricoh SP 111SU Monochrome,Ricoh SP...this 2 products by me ....but not proper work...also jam the paper..."
5,It is a good multi function printer.Used for 5 months no problem.Value for money product.Got it for rs 4500.Only problem is it does not have paper storage tray.After using for more than 1 year its toner got completely empty after printing 1500 pages
1,"The printer was delivered in tact on 5th Oct.But still as on today 11th Oct,not working. Mail to you and calls to Ricoh are in vain.Please your action in this regard is needed immediately."
1,"Really one of the bad product ever seen after installation it's won't support for printing , when I tried to contact customer care they never come to contact worst customer care service , friends pls don't buy this product"
1,Yes..don't purchase this guys. They're giving old (2015) printer for cheap price. Buy some other good brands HP or Samsung. You will surely regret after buying this old product. Buy only 2017 or 2018 made
4,Great printer with energy conservation mode! Generally all printers stay on all the time this one goes into sleep mode. Print clarity is also great. At par with other manufacturers. Plus point its way cheaper than its rivals!!
1,"Do not buy this product if you are looking for multi purpose, as the scanner doesn’t work, you need 3rd party software and those software’s are not easy to use n install and also their output is not as expected. Currently am using only for printing n photocopy only."
3,Xerox plus print at this price range. I think it is best option for average users. It is best option for domestic purpose.  It is Monochrome laser printer. It is little bit noisy and slow but overall best package at this price range. I am satisfied with this product. 👍👍👍
1,"Horrible product, fully damage and used and full of junk will nver ever buy this. Full of dusty"
5,Excellent....same as shown Superb support from Ricoh for demo and setup. Very fast and cooperative customer care.Happy with product. Good with Windows 10. Easy installation.
5,One of the best printer to buy.  Learned a lot about printer after buying this.  Initially I opted for inkjet but good decision that I brought laser one.
1,"I regret that amazon is cheating with warranty. I cant register my purchased printer for warranty,i you want to buy fix in your mind that that there is no warranty"
1,I bought this printer on oct2017 . In intitial time printer shows nice results. But after two months continuosly paper have been jaming. I have complained 6times till now. Engineers are doing their job. But the problem is not solved yet
3,working fine! my printing frequency is occasional. can't tell about tonner.
5,Lucky to purchase in my budget...great work of printer
1,This product is not useful. It doesn’t support (latest versions)Mac nor your windows. If someone wants to use this for copying (xerox) then would definately suggest to buy this. Dont know wether they have a refilling for the toner because it seems to be outdated product.
3,Don't purchase this company. No service Available at major cities(chennai no service) With in 3 years its gone. Now i thrown this Wrst printer.
4,I'm satisfied with the performance so far. I bought it just one month back.
1,Product received covered with dust..after removing the plastic cover the printed was also covered with dust with black spots.wire was so dirty that we were puzzled it’s a new product or used one..the scanner glass is also filled with dust..
5,"Ricoh this printer is very good and Print time is very fast with jam free,Xerox and Scanning quality is very good no Heating Problem, Value for money"
5,Nice product. Useful for personal use and a small office.
3,"Prints & copies well but very very slow specially if its duplex printing. When I compare to my old HP 6510 all in one printer, this printer is very slow. Since it's not touchscreen based setup, initiall setting up could be bit challenging be it wifi or wifi direct setup...This being a new Canon printer introduced in India, the setup person was not very knowledgeable or well trained.Preferred this against more established Epson L6170 or L6190 thinking of better photo printing, that too I would say tad disappointing, don't get me wrong, its not bad, but not great either"
5,Good quality prints and being wireless can print directly from my phone which is quiet convinvenent
5,Excellent product high quality printing very happy with this canon printer
5,"You can take this printer with new technology, its ink does not dry even after not being used for a long time. It has an automatic arrangement for nozzle cleaning.  It is doing its job smoothly."
3,"Prints awfully slow. When you send a photo from your phone to your pc and print it, it prints only in black and white. I’ve scoured the internet for a solution in vain."
4,Simple & smart
5,Good
5,Print quality: Works flawlessly and has very good print quality.Print speed: Duplex print speed is a bit slow - but acceptable.Size: The printer is quite compact for a duplex printer.Installation: Printer installation was smooth on linux (though so far we have not managed to get the scanner to work on linux - its been working fine on Windows).Scanner: So far - we have encountered slight smudges when scanning at high resolution. Not sure if its due to the surface needing cleaning or driver issue or a fundamental issue with scan quality in this model.Price: The auto-duplex feature at this price range in color ink-tank printer is so far (beginning of 2021) only available in Canon. Hence its a good value for money (but still significantly more expensive than non-duplex ink-tank printers)Other Notes: We bought this from a local vendor (as we read many negative reports of damaged printer/scanners purchased online on this website).
3,"It’s better if you actually call up or write to canon directly. When I checked with them, MRP mentioned was 22k, they were also willing to provide a discount. Price mentioned here seems too high, in fact this is similar to the costing I received from canon the the product with more features."
5,Pros:1. Excellent packing2. Easy installation instructions3. Good WiFi connectivity range4. User removable print head5.  Separate print head for color and black and white6. Auto Duplex printing7. Easy Ink filling8. Many print functions9. Paper easy to loadCons:1. WiFi connection delay2. Printer waight is heavy and bulky3. Sometimes paper stuck inside printer4. No lcd backlight
3,"One of the best printer as per all research on printers like ink is from Japan to maintain highest quality of prints ,Dulpex prints save cost of paper  , robust body no brand give type ,Black ink size is bigger , print quality is excellent next to photo printer,ADF missing , Display should be 4 inches touch screen  .It's best ink tank printer in market as far now ,Black & color head is separate which  save cost if need to require to change heads ,only it's painful  more priced I bought at RS 19500.00 in Mumbai"
4,"Bought this printer from a dealer @18600So far its been working well, canon service executive installed it in time..Its on the expensive side, but should last a long time..Print speed/quality is good.. Refills estimate @500 per bottle..I'll post another update after a few months of usage.."

1,VERY EXPENSIVE TAPES. I REGRET BUYING THIS LABEL PRINTER JUST FOR THIS REASON. THE TAPES ARE VERY HARD TO FIND AND ARE PRICED EXORBITANTLY !!
5,Is this printer wireless ?
4,"A distribution sales office where I previously worked was my first hands on experience with Dot Matrix printers.Having used only inkjet & Lazerjet printers all my school and college life which gave fast & clear prints, a slow dot matrix printer was like a vintage car to me.But after having printed my first sales bill which required 3 copies per bill (Original, Duplicate for transporter & triplicate for accounts) it struck me that commercial printing on a daily basis is a massive cost and only dot matrix printers can minimize the hole in your pocket.So when i started my trading business the first thing i bought was the Epson LX-310.Epson is a reliable brand in the printing industry so i gave this no second thought.The printer works like a charm and can also print on 4 sided paper if required.Print speed is decent.. I use a three sided paper which has carbons in the middle and it takes about 20 seconds for a full GST Invoice print from Tally.Setup.. Heres where this is tricky as I am using 3 sided paper the initial lining up of the paper has to be precise to avoid wastage and ensue accurate prints. Invest the little extra time to understand the setup process to ensure peaceof mind and low costs in the future.Maintenence.. I have been using the printer for over two years now and it has never electrically faulted. The only thing you have to do is keep changing the ribbon in the printer when your prints appear less dark. I simply have a tie up with my local stationary man who replaces it for me when ever needed on a cost effective contract basis.In conclusion it is a great product which should be purchased by individuals or firms who need over 30-40 prints on a daily basis. The. Long term cost efficiency of this slightly expensive machine is what dot matrix is all about.IF YOU FOUND THIS REVIEW USEFUL, PLEASE HIT THE HELPFUL BUTTON UNDER THIS REVIEW.Happy Printing..- Gills Guide."
1,"I have reasons to give this a one star. The product seems fine, print quality is decent. I would have given the product a 4 easily. Its the service from Epson why I am giving this a one. We are having issues with installation, setting up the printer to print correctly etc. but Epson India is not available to provide proper service or make a office visit. Feels helpless when companies behave like this. Also another issue, Epson Toll Free number says this machine cannot get an extended warranty or AMC like its other products."
5,Epson dot matrix are the best. I had been using Epson for almost a decade. Great product and good price too from Amazon
1,There are wrong reviews about this product. It does not suport network based printing. I opened the box 2 months after delivery. Any chance of return? It's totally unused.
5,One of the most successful printer. I have 8 units working for me 10 hours a day. They let your maintenance cost cut down.
1,Very poor Performance
4,Ribbon problem faced. But Epson representative fixed it but little disappointed .
5,Perfect
5,Good printer.. working smooth.. economical and efficient
5,Super printer was a plug and play from Epson 300+. Efficiently does what it promises to do. Been an Epson user for almost a decade with an avg of 30-40bills everyday.

1,"Please don't buy this model.I already use epson M200 and was very happy with the performance of that product.The official website claims performance of 4500 pages for B/W and 7500 coloured pages per refill. But the performance of 25 normal official letters has lead to consumption of 1/3rd of black ink. The epson engineer said that the performance usually is 1000 pages max. This is furiating. The company should be penalised for making such false claims.I am still using Epson M200 and am satisfied with it, but this model should have never existed."
5,Just used for 1 day and really up to the mark.  Will be posting more feedback after using it for a month.
5,Multi function available on this printer setting are not to easy for photo printing.xerox quality is very good..printing quality is very good.
2,"The product is a waste of money rather my suggestion to go for Epson lesser price ink tank product. My product was faulty with no proper quality testing. The resolution was poor. Might be the head was malfunctioning. Blame has to be taken by EpsonCouple of noticeable issues1. The Control panel dash board is useless, not at all user friendly2. When my paper got jammed the panel was obstructing to take out the paper3. The width of paper feeder support is less hence the A4 size paper tends get backward swing."
4,"Go for the next model in L series of printer if you've made your mind to buying this only. Automatic Document Feeder isn't of worth use in this model. Also, you'll miss automatic double side printing technology if you buy this product."
5,"I think, all the printer companies from Hp to Epson, using 6000-7500 pages advertising as a publicity stunt.If you really want to purchase any printer, 600-750 pages are usable. Maybe less!"
4,"A good compact all in one printer. Connecting to a computer or a smart phone is extremely easy.Advantages: Can scan/print large sized papers like legal, etc.  ADF makes life easy while scanning but two sided scans make arranging the pdf files a tedious activity.  Print quality is excellent and ink refills are very convenient and cost effective.Against: Build quality leaves a lot to be desired. Plastic quality could have been a lot better. No input paper tray makes life difficult as everytime you have to put paper manually and store it separately.Overall a very good all in one for home use or for a small office."
5,"Just go for it. This one falls in the sweet spot where it not vry expensive and provides everything that you need and nay be more. Print quality is superb. Wifi enabled and air printing (using apple products) really rock. Has a compact design and easily movable. Adf for scan/copy is another cool feature. Inks too last long and easily fillable. Can connect fast to multiple devices using Epson iprint app and also use it via email from any where in the world. Overall, this one is the most complete printer for home/office 100 pgs a day or may be more."
2,"I have an issue with ink cartridge...only for one black and white and colour prints,the ink level is like this......Totally dispointed with this printer....."
5,"The product is excellent to use. The print quality is also good though I have not yet printed photos but text printing is good. The WiFi connectivity makes it breeze to operate. It even works on AirPrint for iOS devices. The Papers were getting stuck up initially in ADF, but after putting the paper properly it is now working fine. Overall value for money."
5,Really great product for 18k price it contains inktank color printer and flatbed + ADF scanner.Go for it if price is around 18K
5,"The ink never dried. But make sure to use it once a month atleast to print out one demo color audit . This will keep your ink heated.I am using it for personal usage, the print quality is good enough."
5,"In the beginning, the paper is going to have some ink."
5,Easy to use and colour quality fine.
5,Easy to use.Value for money.Good ADF and Manual Duplex.

1,"Poor quality printing (colour and b/w) I expected best quality from EPSON, but it is worst one. Iam feeling Very bad on buying this item."
4,"Well overall nice product, the installation was easy, but the black ink drains fast, I don't think it will deliver as many pages as is claimed by the seller. Review after using for a week."
3,The quality of printing is quite sad. Haven't yet figured how to scan - hopefully will be able to figure that out soon
4,Print quality good but small line print out coming on paper. Easy connectivity Good.

4,A versatile and multi functional printer which represents the quality of CANON !! It was well packed and timely delivered by AmazonBest part of this printer is simplicity of operations and ease of Installation. The user manual is good enough to guide . Only suggestion is that it should come in different colour variants
5,"Im occasionally using this printer.still working fine.not problem at all.color print quality is amazing.but only 25 pics i printed,and it lasts tottally color ink.think once if u buy."
4,"Just got it. It was easy to install and connect to the phone. Installation is pretty easy and all the instructions in user manual are very through and easy to understand. Will add to the review when i start using it properly. Till now good buy, satisfied."
3,"What do you expect at this price. I bought it at rs 4500. Doesn’t connect with PC. Though it connects easily with smartphone. That makes smartphone better than a PC, at least in this printer area.Print quality could be better. Though it works only with WiFi which is a huge drawback. Otherwise it’s ok."
5,Got this 3 in 1 printer at ₹ 3999 under a deal. It is easy to use. I am able to print and scan directly from my mobile with the help of canon print android app. Everything is just great.
3,Having issues with printing connecting to the computer. Limited documentation on way to setup. Printer scares you when u switches on printer with loud noisesI didn’t get a chance to test it when I bought it else would have returned it.
1,"Worst product....very difficult to install....always gives some error like p2, p3 .And after 6 months , completely stopped working. Pathetic Canon service centre denied guarantee and returned it. Wastage of hard earned money.Never buy Canon product."
3,Paper pickup is poor. Multiple papers get picked up very commonlyColor printing is terribly slowMultiple page printing after the first few pages is very slow as well
5,"Very useful for home printing. For photo prints, use kodak 200 gsm 6x4 hi gloss sheets. On normal gloss sheets, the photo peint fades off within a few days."
4,Working well! No compliant so far! Automatic paper feeder not available
5,Its quality is good but the noise while printing and pulling the paper is a bit annoying . Its also slow before it begins to print.
5,I needed one for my household and the this served my purpose
1,Not contact to mobile
5,good
4,Please don't buy. The worst purchase I made.
5,Very good product
1,"Please dont buy this product,it drinks toner,average per paper printing is Rs.5 and that only black"
2,The product is very good but the Amazon delivery is very poor. They mishandled the product resulting in lot of trouble to handle it.
5,Okay
2,Ink service is bogus... just printed 7 or 8 colour pages and the ink level came down to half... total waste of money for printing... Printer is good...
1,STILL WARRANTY CLAIM IS NOT DONE. DRAGGING THE PROCESS. WORST ON CANON SIDE AS WELL AS AMAZON HELP.

1,"Epson Seiko is a Japanese company known for their excellent quality. I used to have HP printers earlier but found these are not good. I switched over to Epson printers recently. I have two Epson printers. One is L-4150 Ink Tank Colour Printer and another is M-1100 printer which is a black and white printer. The print quality of both of them is superb and cost of one print is very low. I have been using both the printers for some time and have not found any problem. The After Sales Service of Epson is good. I strongly recommend if one wants to buy ink tank printers, then go for Epson. I have iMac which has no CD drive. I just downloaded drivers for M-1100 from the Epson web site and immediately started using the printer. It is noise less and has no frills. Cost is very affordable. But it can handle only A-4 size paper. Epson sends their service engineer if you want his service for installation. It is a free service."
5,Excellent delivery. Working is awesome.
3,Ink filling it's very slowly this model. Ink level not clear to viewable. But print out quality super.
5,Don't think too much just buy it you will not regret it

4,"I bought this Canon printer few months back . After few months of its usage , I have following feedback to provide1. Print quality is very good . Very legible and dark printing2. Print speed : I will not say it is fast , but it is neither slow too . If you are a medium user , it can work fine for you3. Now the best part : Wifi connectivity : At this price range , you will rarely find any branded Wi fi enabled printer . Wifi is really good and works efficiently . Only downside is you need to change the setting every time , if you want to change the wifi source . Mobile Wifi is also noteworthy4. Support : Right now I have not experienced any problem with this printer and so can't tell about after sales support , but they charged me for installing the printer , which should be free for better experienceOverall , a good buy and worth of money . Will update later in case of any new observations"
5,"Having used the earlier non WiFi version of this printer it was a no-brainer to opt for this upgrade. The earlier one was very much functional when I gave it away.As for the printer, the wifi setup was a breeze after downloading the app. And barring occasional glitches when the printer decides to keep the paper in its womb, the printer has been giving good prints no matter what the quality or colour of the paper.Totally satisfied with the product."
5,"All in all a decent affordable printer that does what is expected of a home printer. Setting up Wireless printing on laptop (win 10) as well as android phones is pretty simple. Plenty of  YouTube videos explain these. Not a direct WiFi printer, you require to connect via a wireless router. Once set, the unit retains WiFi settings even after restarting the printer.Print quality is good, supplied toner is genuine 925 toner cartridge. There are compatible cartridges online below 600 rupees which is a big plus (yet to try).With a reputed brand Canon can't go wrong.Product received made in Vietnam.Few cons noted:1) Unlike brother model this printer doesn't have a dedicated paper tray. Dust collects on paper if kept uncovered.2) No duplex printing. You have to manually turn and place paper in tray. For regular use it's a great feature.3) WiFi direct printing would be beneficial."
4,"Followed the instructions to install but got stuck as the app was trying to connect to a download site not approved by microsoft. Had to call tech support to complete installation. It seemed to be a trial and error operation , spent 49 minutes on call . some parts of the installation process seemed to go on in an endless loop. The support person was very patient and polite during the process. Understand there may be limitations due to work from home , hence this is not a complaint , just an observation. Perhaps the manufacturer should consider upgrading the tools provided to their support staff in view of the lock down scenario."
1,Absolutely worst printerCannot print duplex printTrust me do not buy this printer will only increase your work moreImpossible to print 2 sided from this printer even by printing odd pages first and then even pages after thatCannot print manual duplexPay more money and buy a decent good quality printerTotal waste of money and waste of pages as it is not possible to print two sided correctly from this printer
1,"1) White colour product is supplied to me instead of black printer.2) When contacted Canon services department for wifi installation , they demanded installation charges. ( But Amazon customer care said ""installation is free*)3) Wifi is there but they said ""modem is required""."
4,"As canon is canon but still I think this model should be little modified by manufacture for two things . 1) This printer should have dust cover on paper loading tray at bottom like (Hp1020) as paper bunch remains open in this model & dust appears on top of paper.2) Top paper holding tray should modified like Hp1020. As my desktop table has already undertable provision for printer space but due to this printer top paper holder tray which consumes more height , it stucked while entering to its place , so I dismental that tray from printer & inserted but now my printer is without paper holder tray.( If kept this printer on open table top then it's ok.) Otherwise verry nice quality printer in everything (hardware , print quality & its budget price)"
3,"This printer has 2 main advantages - number of prints per minute(18-checked works well) & number of prints per catridge(1500-1600 promised- yet to verify that number).Print quality is excellent. One may have to get in touch with Canon support in case installation by USB is needed. Other wise it connects seamlessly with Wifi router used for internet in the house using WPS option and it makes life a lot easier.It lacks both side printing but one can use adobe pdf reader and print odd even pages and it does the trick. The stated pages ler catridge was 1600, however my personal experience says it only orints about 50% of that number i.e. 800 pages. after that the print quality fades. spare catridge costs 2.5k (original).No colour printing so one must be aware of this while buying this printer.Would not recommend this."
5,"This is the first printer which i bought by doing lot of online research and it turned to be best because it had, the features which i wanted the most i.e. Wi-Fi connectivity at economical cost. I bought this for INR 8,950 which gives 1100-1200 pages (company claim) and the quality of the print is excellent. The only thing which i request the canon company to incorporate is duplex printing in this model and improved version of manual. I am advising an improved version of manual because it took 5hrs to connect to laptop and Wi-Fi connectivity after going through lot of online videos because existing manual was very little help that's the reason i gave 4 stars too easy to use.One more important thing they distributor even provided GST bill which i could reimburse."
5,"I had kept an eye on this product since 2017, at that time I had no money to invest in the laser printer so I waited but the cost of the product rose so high that I regretted to my earlier decision of not buying this product at that time, apart from the cost of the product the printer is good looking and Wi-Fi printing works perfectly, I have not printed more than 20 pages at a time. It declutters the space by implementing Wi-Fi connectivity."
1,"Doesn't look original, looks like from gray market.The instruction manual looks printed locally.There was no packing , printer was simply put in the box , scratch and finger prints.It was looking like some has returned it . Don't buy from this seller."
4,This is my 10 month usage review and after 7000+ printoutsPros- Clean and crisp printouts.- Wireless printouts are as fast as wired ones.- easy to install wirelessly as well wired- Easy to delete pending printouts- Detects changes in types of pages (if it's a stamp paper of A4 or ledger paper) and prompts before printing.Cons- Drivers sometimes fail to load but this is rare. I have to reboot the computer for it to work properly.- sometimes on cold mornings it draws in multiple pages into the printer. However no pages get stuck and printout is not affected.I have not faced any serious issues and I am using this printer in very dusty environment.
3,"Print quality goodGood connectivityBut in mobile printing app only 3 options to print a paper 1.LTR, 2.LGL, 3.A4.Need to find out A-5 size printing solutions from Canon mobile printing app. My old hp Lesar Jet MFP M 126 NW printer having all size of printing .Expecting earlier action in developing & update the app"
5,I purchased from Amazon a few months back. The CD supplied for Installation didn't work. Somehow managed to start it from downloaded software from canon site. Otherwise the printer is working good.  Print Quality also satisfactory. So far so good !
1,It printed very light ... i thought it will be ok as it may be due to some setting issue. Never expected a used/bad cartidge in new printer. I had taken less than 50 pages ( letters etc) till now. I had used canon earlier with many years use without any issue.I could not write anything earlier being busy.I am extremely frustrated to loose  rs. 12000 and shaken my belief in such transactions online. This is my first review on Amazon.
5,"Every thing is good iam happy with this device ....But small thing is not possible to connect directly with phone wifi u need dlink router ,that is the problem...Those who has computer knowledge they can connect easily ....Other wise go for  youtube vedios for wireless connection"
3,"It is easy to install and use. But if you are planning to take prints of colour images,don't buy this printer as it will not print the coloured areas of the images. To make it more clear, if you are taking printing of our marksheets and certificates, you would see the signatures not clear and also small prints seems blurred. The same with any colour characters. We wouldn't suggest this for a great use, especially if you want to use it for kids project or printing any certificate etc."
3,"A decent printer. Print density is a bit on the lighter side but will do the job for day to day use. No WiFi direct, router is needed to print wirelessly. Very good build quality.A little overpriced for a standalone printer. Would be a great deal of it was around 7k. If money is no constraint, is better to go for the canon mf232w which is an all in one printer with WiFi direct."
3,"Simple printer by canon. price is only for brand. After use I can say good printer, print is ok but first toner cartiridge  come with printer, give only 300-350 pages. After it print become light. I could not understand why print become light."
4,"Got this model below 10K in Jul 20. Print quality isn't dark enough, but meets the requirements. Could install it by watching YouTube videos, but took some time to activate WiFi with Modem via phone/ laptop.Seems bit over priced now, but a good choice for home usage due to its compact size (Please check similar options in Amazon with MFD). It's a reliable printer especially for irregular users."
5,"Canon LBP6030w 2 month user feedback - The product in this price range is amazing. The printing quality is superb & range of the Wifi is great. Easy to configure & also Canon provides application support for Android smartphones thorough which I also able to print it from my mobile phone also. It was a had decision to make for me to switch from HP Laserjet to Canon Laserjet, gave a lot of thoughts & I chose Canon of which I don't regret at all. Thanks Canon & Amazon!!!!"
5,"Much better compared to an inkjet printer for documents, even though not a colour printer.Had some trouble installing Wifi setup, though.Overall 5 star"
5,"Excellent product. Changing over from deskjet to laser because of economy and the headache of ink running dry (very infrequent use). Set up was a problem as the printer was not getting detected, finally un-installed the USB connection from device manager then restarted, everything works fine. WPS setup is also a breeze. Excellent value for money. Also delivery was very fast."
5,"This is a great little laser printer. You have to go online to find the setup though your router but once I found a video explaining, it was easy. It has three buttons only which operation very easy."
4,"The printer arrived on time and the packaging was good. As regards the printer it is quite good. Initially had some trouble configuring the wireless connectivity, after a few trial and error it could be done. I can now print both from my desktop and mobile phone. For printing from mobile phone you need to download Cannon print app from Google play Store. Printing quality is acceptable. At this price a wireless monochrome laser printer is a real bargain."
4,"Got a good discount on purchase. Excellent for home use. Good print qualty. I basically bought it for my daughter's school related work but ended up using it myself also because of the lockdown from March onwards. On hindsight, it was a good buy as going to shops for printouts will be pretty risky in the days to come."
5,"good quality of prints. very easy to install.For Wifi, it is not straightforward as it supports only WPS network for Wifi. received the package in very good condition like a showroom one. Its very fast in printing aswell. I do recommend this product over hp"
5,Good for regualr home usage too..Print quality is good..may not be good for photo print..it is B/W laser printer so cant expect more. Tweak some settings to get optimum quality.. Speed of printing is alsogood enough..i am happy with the product.. think thats the best in the market for price offered..
5,"Printer is really good, efficient, fast, user friendly. But it was surprise that router is needed to connect to printer unlike hp printers which don't need router as mediator to connect mobile or laptop.Sometimes print get blurred if wifi is not stable."
3,The company fools you by saying its a wireless wifi printer & you can print with smartphone . But they didn't tell you cannot print without a wifi router .
5,The printer is very good. Printing quality is good and also the processing is fast. Printing through phone is very convenient. Installation was quick and also the wifi reception is very good. Just ensure to download cannon print service app on your phone to process printing through phone
4,"Nice printer, compact, and works on wifi so can be placed at a distance fm your computer.. review based on another piece i own, as i have still to try this one"
5,Was able to connect with my smartphone galaxy and remind a wfi modem is needed compatible with windows and Ubuntu  great 👍 👌 😀
5,Easy to setup and works like a charm. I can now print right from my mobile using canon printer app and google cloud print
3,Printer was looking old from packaging but internal seal was ok so I installed it. Ot printed only few pages fine and within 15 days I have to buy new toner.
4,"Easy connectivitySturdyStylishWont increase your power billPrints are goodBut i face an issue print gets lighter after refills, need to change internal parts of Toner frequently"
2,There  is no duplex printing function  in this printer.Promotion video is misleading...
4,"Excellent compact printer. Good Speed of printing, no noise, seamless working of wireless feature from computer as well as mobile (through modem i have used).Sometimes I feel quality of printing could have been better but I am comparing with RICO's office printer."
5,**~ looks very stylish and works great too.Suitable for both office and house purpose. Has wireless connection which is the best feature.
5,Goo product for this price range.
1,Didnt receive driver CD and manual.
5,Affordable printer and its look is very good and best thing in this printer it is affordable and durable woth for every single penny.
4,"My horrible luck. I was busy ever since I purchased this printer and now today ( 2 weeks after delivery) when I turned on the printer for the first time, it exploded! YES it exploded!!!!  My room smella of burned capacitors.But when I switched it over to 230 v on the PSU ( it was stuck on 115v) the printer worked like a charm. I would like to explain how good the customer service was. I spoke to Sagar from the Banglore office and Suprim from the technical team. I was amazed by how helpful they were. Luckily all seems good and the prints are fine for now. But I'm happy with knowing these guys have such a great service team behind them.Loose one star for not including clear instructions on which setting to use SPECIALLY WHEN THE THING WILL EXPLODE IF ITS ON WRONG SWITCH.LOOK AT MY PUPPY!!"
5,The benchy printed is out of the box with 0.2 mm layer height. This printer is just awesome! Took me around an hour to assemble using a YouTube tutorial as the provided leaflet was slightly confusing. Had one spring missing though. But got it delivered within a day of reporting to Wol 3d. Awesome support. Keep it up guys!
3,The print quality and performance are quite are satisfactory given the quality of components encountered while unpacking.4 stars for the performance and reliability of the printer for a week so far.2 stars for quality of the components - the 2040 rails and the aluminium printer bed were dinged with scratches and lacerations. Either poor quality control - or we are getting the returned/repackaged products from other markets.The printing surface is hard to level as it is not possible to rigidly secure it to the heated bed. Also there is a slight depression at the center so leveling the four corners doesn't imply good adhesion on at the center. I believe this is going to trouble me on larger prints - where only part of the first few layers will stick to the bed. I hope to come up with some solution for this.The usual Ender 3 related design issues do exist but we were already aware of them before the purchase.
5,This product is underrated by many. With proper knowledge of product assembly and slicing it works like a pro.I work primarily on PLA and ABS - results are 10 stars. My clients are happy.Prints wood to perfection...More than value for money.Product support from WOL is awesome - make sure you buy ONLY from them.
4,"Excellent packaging, loads of foam and bubble wrap. Assembly instructions were a bit confusing at first, but a after a few YouTube videos it made sense. my unit came with a black silicone sock for the hot end and a removable build plate (non magnetic). the bowden tube couplers were also good quality and be sure to put the blue clips on the coupler Also i found out that the bowden tube on the side of the hot end was not cut properly, good thing i noticed that before turning the printer on. i would strongly suggest taking the tube out and check if both ends are cut properly otherwise you'd have your hot end leak filament in the wrong direction.now to the printer itself, its just and ordinary ender 3 which means there is a lot tuning and careful assembly required but once you are done with all that expect the print quality to be flawless, at this price point this is by far the best printer you could buy with your money as of this date.Also i got a card from the seller trying to woo me into giving the printer a 5 star review by offering 100 rs on paytm.and i would have given this printer a 5 star rating regardless, but its gonna get a 4 star one cause of the seller trying to do this.To the seller- IF i can afford a 17000 machine then i would seriously not care bout 100rs. use your common sense, plus reviews are not meant for sale. if you're trying to do this that makes you a bad seller."
5,This is a good printer. Assembly took 1-2 hours. To get it working you would need to adjust the bed level and extruder filament. There are plenty of tutorial videos available on Youtube to get it started. You would need to make sure the bed level is fine each time you start printing with this. Print quality is good. Recommended for people who are looking for the first 3d Printer.
5,"The printer is good. It took sometime to set it up. I printed the pig.gcode that was provided in the sd card.Regd installation we need to go by the manual as well as online videos.We need to be careful with the pin switch that is attached with the motor when assembling (not to break it).The printer function is accurate, It took approx 8hrs (patience required) to complete the pig 3d printing.Test filament (white) is provided, we need to insert the filament via the clip on the motor and through the white tube (while starting for the first time) else it might get stuck. Extra filament you need to order. Test filament was not enough for this task.All round i like the 3d printer, now need to see what are the different models we can create, just started:)"
4,"My frist printer.Assembly was easy but the screws are not properly labelled and it took some time to figure out.It says the upgraed one has some yellow strips but mine doesn't have any. Not sure if it is the regular one or the ""yellow strip"" identification is true."
5,"The seller is the authorised distributor for Creality 3D printers in India. They were prompt and cordial in responding to my queries.A no-frills experience that took less than an hour to set it up. Started printing right away. Good is you're just starting into 3D printing and dependable if you make money out of it.The bottom part of the machine comes assembled in the box. Easy to assemble the remaining parts with the help of provided manual, tools and Youtube Videos.The provided magnetic build-plate is textured, so parts stick very well without any tapes or adhesives.  But it's a tad bigger than the build platform, so care must be taken to place it properly on the platform so as to not rub against the vertical extrusions or the power supply.The extruder and hot-end cables must be properly tied with the provided zip ties as they can go behind the build plate and prevent it from travelling fully to the back of the printer.There is a channel on the underside of the machine from which the cables are given out from the control board. As it's sharp, a cable protector part must be downloaded and printed from Thingiverse.The firmware must be upgraded to the latest Marlin for better safety and print quality. First, the Arduino bootloader needs to be flashed to the Creality 1.1.4 controller board which is based on Melzi controller. It is compatible with the Sanguino board having Atmel ATmega1284P. A USBasp programmer with 10 pin FRC to 6 Pin ICSP connector is needed. Then compile and flash latest Marlin firmware (currently v2.0.4.4 when reviewing). Refer online guides for flashing the bootloader and firmware.Other upgrades that can be done are:1. Bullseye fan duct - better bridging.2. Extruder knob - easy filament loading and unloading.3. Glass build plate - smooth PLA first layer.4. OctoPrint on a Raspberry Pi with printed cover.5. Logitech C170 webcam for time-lapse with printed mount - webcam view in photos.Recommended filaments are WOL3D, e-Sun and Rever Fibreel. The provided filament in the box is very less. So buy a spool when you buy the printer to get started right away."
5,"If you are looking for budget 3d printer with decent prints, look no further, this one is best as entry level printer as well as intermediate work.I bought it from wol3d and it was brand new and well packed. If you have no knowledge of assembling 3d printer (just like me), they provide you with SD card with reader, open it in PC and watch unboxing video, it will rapidly orient you. Or you can follow pictorial manual provided to assemble the printer.Once it's done you need to level the base as this is not self balancing one.  Simple method of passing paper below nozzle where it passes with mild resistance works fine. I used chep's gcode (from his YouTube video) to balance the base and test it. I got decent print but base is little wobbly so I need to find workaround for that.I use ultimaker cura as slicing software as its free, easy and has lot of useful features.Now a few upgrade you might like to consider...1) Power supply is upgradable and you will need it if you want to upgrade your machine later. (I haven't upgraded anything  yet)2) Main board does not support many features such as auto leveling upgrade.  So go for skr mini e3 main board which has many support features (including support for duel extruders).  But beware it will need flashing of recent firmware and it's not as simple as it sounds.3) obviously auto leveler4) print smoothers5) glass base or carbon fiber sheet base.The list can go on and on but just have fun with 3d printing and experimenting with this affordable 3d printer.I have included a photo of skull insignia which was my first print, my son got excited and colored it. Later I stuck magnet behind it and now it's in use.Thank you for reading my review, I hope you find it useful."
5,"Well i wasted my first 1kg of filament printing stupid things, but if you find a good use it can be amazing.Got bad tolerances first few time while printing (needed some calibration) but works as good as it can get for the price limit."
5,"I received a well packaged shipment from Wol3D and was fairly easy to assemble once you lay out the components as mentioned in the instructions. It took more time to tune the fittings rather than just assembling it eg. the X/Y axis rollers were quite tight. I ended up loosening them a bit to reduce strain on the wheels.Pros:* Good quality prints once bed leveling is done* The provided build plate(had a Wol3D logo printed) has good adhesion, atleast for PLA filaments I had tested* Ships with Creality 1.1.4 board with Marlin 1.1.6.2 firmware. I downloaded source code from Creality's website and it seems thermal runwaway protection is enabled but did not test it out to verify.* The prints were fairly silent and I could only hear only the fans and buzzer being more louder. Not sure if it has TMC2208 drivers but probably my prints also didn't have high acceleration movements. Sounds levels of the steppers are absolutely okay for me* The package included yellow rubbery strips that go into the V slots as shown in the picture. More than just improving the look, I placed them strategically to prevent dust buildup on the horizontal bars, wherever possible. I guess it may help to dampen vibrations as well* Unlike reports, the Z axis rod seems to be aligned correctly for me. Seems Creality has fixed this issue* Includes a fair amount of filament for test prints* Has rubber feet to dampen vibrations* Absolute VFM compared to other printers in the rangeCons:* Creality board is 8bit, hence reducing your capabilities in terms of enabling more features or adding attachments* Ships with an outdated firmware and no bootloader installed. Latest Marlin is 2.0.x as of the day of writingSo far buying experience from Wol3D has been good. I hope they step up their game in providing quality and affordable parts and aftermarket accessories/kits.UPDATE: Updated it to Marlin 2.0.X bugfix branch just for thermal runaway"
5,"Brillant printer for its price.  But don't expect to start printing prints out of the box.  One needs to learn and explore.  It has its limitations which is understandable for the price.  But once it's strengths and weaknesses are kept in mind, it is a very capable printer.  Definitely recommended.  Don't expect too much support from the seller though.  I ran into trouble with the supplied bed sticker and ordered another one which failed in 2 prints.  That was because i was printing on ABS at 240 c for the extruder and 110 c bed temperature.  Once I switched to glass the prints are perfect.  Use normal float glass 4 mm with scotch purple glue and you are fine."
1,"The printer has been a pain from day one. With no support whatsoever from the seller, the 3D printer has been a pain. Frequent parts failure, cheap quality of parts and need to buy spares are constant heartburn. Never was at peace after having bought it. The entry-level (relatively cheap) may be the cause of this being up on sale graph but its not at all recommended for people to want to pursue 3D printing as a serious hobby/career."
3,"Reviewing after around a month of use and printing around 10 models.pros:The printer is good. The surface finish, print quality is good enough without any major upgrades/mods.Packaging was good, all the spares were in extra qty (seller probably repackaged and added that).all the tools required to assemble are provided in the package including allen-keys, spanner/wrenches, cutter, etcBed heating and magnetic bed really is a plus. Never had an issue for adhesion or removing the print from the bed till now.cons and tips:Received faulty limit switch attached to Z-axis. My printer wasn't ""auto-homing"" on z-axis, tried re-assembling, reconnecting wires, opening circuit board and testing connections but none of it solved the problem till I replaced the limit switch with the one spare provided in the package. (minus one star)(hope you send me a working limit switch module)They have specified black and white filament spools in the listing. But I received grey and fluorescent yellow spool of PLA.Allen-head bolts are of shitty quality. DO NOT put too much pressure on bolts with allen-heads to unscrew. The allen head will wear out very easily even if you are using the right allen keys and the you won't be able to screw-unscrew that part. (I had to break a metal piece of the enclosure of the ""mother-board"" and now, z-stepper allen-bolt is also weared out.) (minus one star)Z-axis assembly is toughest. Also the z-axis bar/linear rail rod comes closer and tighter as you go down. You would need to print this part first - z-axis spacer and assemble it on the printer to avoid rapid wear-out (stl available on thingiverse)Assembly is going to be tough. Do it carefully or else it won't print good. Watch good youtube tutorials before starting out. Know what you are doingBed leveling is important.Loosen out all the rollers and belt drives before assembling or it will damage the wheels. (they are too much tightened out of the box)Use ultimaker cura slicer instead of creality slicer, slicer software and settings largely affect the print quality.to conclude -This is my first 3D printer and despite of all the cons, when you see your model getting printed and see the output in your hands and fitting perfectly in your design assembly... it is the most satisfying feeling. So don't wait to buy one. I primarily use this printer to prototype my engineering designs for robotics and electronics assembly at my startup bitleaf.tech based in Dombivli, Maharashtra, India."
4,"This is the best printer for the money we pay. But it lacks support in India.Installation and packing: The packing was nice, and I could install this within an hour. At some point, you may need to refer youtube for assembly.Build: The build quality is decent not that robust, but it will do the work. Make sure to check Bed alignment as it's always not the right alignment.Printing: Quality of prints comes very well. Mind that an average time to print for a 2""x2"" would be around 2 hours.Board: It has The Creality 4.2.2 board with a boot loader.Support: Unfortunately, after 2 print, my printer went dead. I tried calling Amazon; they said it could only be refunded, and they had no support details from India.I sent a mail to Creality support but didn't get any reply from them. Their support phone number is from China.I fixed the issue by flashing the official firmware. You can download it from the Creality site and just past the .bin file on the SD card and plug it into the printer.I highly recommended flashing to new official firmware as the firmware which comes with the Printer is really old. I could see the difference in print quality and the more important printing speed; it improved slightly."
3,"Printing and assembly is very easy and good quality. But the Laser head doesn't work as per the instructions (the software is also not complete installation version and it's in Chinese no other languages supported, just hit and trial). Company/seller provides no technical support for the Laser engraving attachment (that's just wastage of time and money).The sample filament provide with it also very poor quality, it break automatically after 2-3 days after unpacking."
5,"I took a leap of faith with this Creality Ender 3 printer after reading reviews of WOL3D. Just followed the instructions provided in the sheet and watched few videos also on how to configure the printer. It isn't as difficult as it seems. Before I knew it, I did my first print.To my surprise, I did not encounter any problems like clogging, bed adhesion or missing parts in package. I even received a sample filament of few meters and an sd card with some gcode and design files in the package to print the first sample."
3,"Have been using this printer for more than 4 months now. Multiple You Tube videos help setting up and fine tuning the slicer parameters. Have used PLA and ABS for the printing - the results are good.The moment you need any support from the seller (WOL 3D) you can forget it - calls lead you to autoresponders with a promise to get back to you which does not happen AT ALL, raising a ticket on their website goes into a black hole.Thinking of now getting support from third parties for repairs even though the machine is under warranty as it has developed a  snag which I believe has to do with the Electronics. At a critical juncture in the product design phase and can't afford downtime.Good product to buy but avoid WOL 3D as they just forget you once the product is dispatched from their facility."
5,"Amazing product after 15 days of usage. I've heard lot of myth about 3d printers in general that has to be followed to get a good 3d print. However, this printer is dead simple and you cannot go wrong. The included filament and creality slicer is good enough to do all you want. All tools are included hence no need to have anything to set this up and running. Lot of information available in internet to upgrade this printer and I did most of them though they are just addons and not a must have and the default printer itself is enough. You really wont regret buying this model."
5,Packaged perfectly. Instructions were clear. Followed also some YouTube videos and assembled it in 2 hrs. The first print was perfect. I couldn't believe my eyes. Amazing printer. WOL3d doesn't actually do anything apart from branding the print surface and credit goes to Creality.Btw I got one with the new 32bit board(not silent). So firmware upgrade to Marlin was a breeze by just placing it in the SD card and booting.The frame must be checked for 90° angle at all places when assembling. Keep this in mind.Spend time to learn about bed levelling/tramming and also build surfaces. Also people should stop posting bad reviews without understanding the complexity of operating a 3d printer. Most negative reviews here are from people who haven't understood how to setup their printer.I did not need WOL3d for help so I don't know their support system. Anyways it's a Creality product and support is overflowingly available on the internet.
1,The ender 3 printer that I bought came with a bent aluminium bed. It is giving me a headache as I am not able to level.The display unit knob is broken. It skips input ( i.e sometimes turning the knob does not do anything). :(
4,"I'm an Engineering student and i love making projects, prototyping etc. Ender 3 by Wol3D was my first 3D printer bought three months back. The printer arrived on time with every component inside enclosed with proper packaging. Only the spool holder nut was missing which i manage to print with this printer. The Assembly process was quite easy. I have been using it for various project and it has done well till date. No problem i faced, still this version has no auto bed levelling which could make beginner little annoying but hey practices makes perfect. Ender 3 is open source 3D printer with quite good resource for custom upgradation which you should do at your own risk, i am not willing to do it now cause at this factory setup its working great. If you wanna have a taste of 3D printing and doesn't have enough budget you can bet on it. Wol3D Seller is also very nice quite helpful, I'm from india their service is very good here. Ender 3 has great community in facebook. Their official group is quite helpful. So consider buying this one you can upgrade it in so many ways but again at your own risk, there are many youtube videos on this printer."
5,"Working as expected.Dont know what are the things upgraded by WOL3D. Same as stock ender3 except orange rubber strips which are cumbersome to fit.Pl, check x axis horizontal, adjust eccentric roller, vertical aluminium sections are truly vertical after assembly for successfully first print ."
5,Truly speaking it’s an amazing printer with all features. The item arrived on time. Simply the best printer with at an affordable price. Guys do go for it if you want to enter into 3D printing for the first time
5,"The print quality of Ender 3d is amazing for its priceing,,,, prompt delivery and excellent customer support by WOL 3D. Even you can disturb them on Sundays,,, very quick response from them....."
5,"Order came in super quick time, exactly as promised by Amazon.2 days flat within Mumbai - 5 Stars!Product quality is sturdy and as described - 5 StarsPrint quality is excellent for the price - 5 starsInstructions - THIS could have been better, there is a sequence to follow but i think if they WRITE down what needs to get done, a novice like me would find it much easier. I had a technical person (a friend of mine) to support me, which made it much easier.  This is just something they can do better.I'm not taking away points for this because they provided excellent customer support (Ms Vinibha) in terms of answering my questions before I purchased off Amazon.So Overall 5 Stars. I will try out the product extensively and will add more info on it a month down the time.For now, Overall, i believe they (WOL3D) deserve 5 stars!"
5,"Bought this 3D printer to print model prototypes. Was wary initially about ease of assembling and operation. However, it worked like a charm. Followed Youtube instructions for ENDER 3D PRO assembly. Please make sure to level the bed and also the cut the filament end before feeding into the printer. The initial issues I had was due to these 2 issues."
5,It was partially assembled.took me 3 hours to make it work by following the instructions given with it.Print quality are amazing. after getting this printed so many things and so many printer parts itself.Easy to use and buy it if you are techie and love to do this kind of work.Can say this is the best printer available in market at this price. Just go for it.
1,"The seller has very bad after sales service. Just after 20 days of using the bed is wobbly and not able to fix the alignment whatsoever. I have been requesting them for personal visit even paid is fine, but the technician and support team just do not care. I would suggest buy from some other vendor with better after sales service. Also the feeder plastic part is broken just in 20 days."
5,"This is my first 3d printer and I ordered it just to experient with it. I saw a lot of YouTube videos and various forums and finally decided to order this product. Apart from the Ender 3 that is already known, there is nothing else. The package was delivered carefully and on time. Instead of using the assembly guide that came with the printer, I watched a YouTube video to assemble this and it took about an hour and half. And after some bed leveling, the printer was ready to print. The print quality is excellent and the box contains everything you need to get started with 3d printing. Just remember to order a spool of filament along with the printer as the sample provided with the printer is very small. Also, one thing with my print bed, it has a little bump about 0.1mm at the centre and the first layer won't print there and also sometimes it's really hard to remove the prints and therefore I am planning to order a glass bed. Apart from that, the printer is perfect to get started with 3d printing. If you are starting out with 3d printing, just go for it."
1,For integrating laser engraver wol3d won't give support..... Please don't but the combo...
2,"Better use octoprint with pi because this is like a dumbed-down version of a router with very very limited and controlled features.Only can work from phones ( not pcs), cloud slicing kinda whack, and there is much difficulties operating the thing.Not recommended."
5,"It is my first printer got in 17 thousand . Assembling was very difficult for me but YouTube helped. I have printed many things , n it's great fun also useful for engineering student n even normal person can print n enjoy to learn or make toys . I am now printing covid mask ."
5,"I bought it before Covid-19 lockdown @ Rs 15,500.... it is working good...... all the accessory for printing is in there [like:- sd card,sdcard reader,nipper,etc].... ii am very much happy with it...."
2,No instructions provided on how to connect the laser engraver. No response from WOL 3D regarding the same query posted on there web site. Can anybody please provide me with the details of how the laser engraver is to be connected
1,"Getting a print from this machine - you have to be LUCKY.my 3 year old CR-10 prints like a boss yet.Ender-3. A BIG DISAAPPOINTMENT.Extruder clicking - no extrusion, thin extrusion lines. the bed doesnt move fully on the Y axis without a cable crunching sound."
3,Appears that I received a refurbished model as the build plate had been scratched and did not stay level . Also just after I buy the price dropped and different ones came. So I returned mine and buying a different model
5,"10 stars for the product items..As they provided each and every tool.Even an amount of filament for print purpose, all hardware tools, card reader memory card, even 2set of nozzles,Its a great and.. very easy to assemble.Have very nice accuracy..A huge shoutout to the company for great buying experience.."
4,"Product was good at this price range,leveling bed is a bit tricky part , I assembled it with instructions paper provided it's that simple to assemble, purchase an adaptor for the power cable which costs around hundred rupees,tried with white PLA,have to do some test on flexible material,works fine for me"
4,"Pros- Print quality is amazing...particularly photo prints.- support for higher GSM and wide variety of papers, even PVC cards- Much better than previous generations..  - LCD display  - ink bottle system  - self serviceable parts  - Airprint supportCons- Setup is not user friendly- About Canon print/scan software, less said the better.- Little noisy"
5,"WiFi printing is awesome. The print quality is very good. Installation is simple. Ink management using external tanks is a very good feature, you won't have to buy the entire printing head cartridges. My opinion, buy it if it fits your budget."
5,GoodWifi n setup using appprinter noise is lessprint quality good awaiting for photo paperBadNo duplex print supportSize is big can be reducedprice little higher in competitionDisplay without LED cant read without 90 degree angle
5,"Must to have if you have kids at home.Wifi printing is good.Installation is very easy.After buying you will not use Black and white, You will use only color printing a lot.Color printing O/P is very good.Use good A4 paper with 85 to 90 GSM paper for good color printing.In-short good investment"
5,Very happy with the printer. Works well. But I have a little problem with the AirPrint. I am seeking an expert advice at the local level. Due to the lock down I have to wait till some slow opening of the curfew.
5,Nice product overall - very easy to install - using manual plus youtube video - works well with wifi as well - print quality is nice as well especially for photos on glossy paper etc. normal black prints also good.
5,Good
4,Original product but delivery  becomes delay. Very good product.
5,Mast go for it
5,Best in class Dot Matrix PrinterCheaper compare to other printer. And less Maintenance cost.
1,This printer cannot be used on i5 laptop if driver is available if not then return the item. Not printed single line since purchased. I trusted on the company but there in not service centres in Pune.
1,When its come some plastcis are damaged
1,Not good don't buy this product no return label
5,Very good printer
1,Very very worst service.service Technicians said the recent MSP250star printers are in worst quality when compare to older versions.Very bad...
1,Useless product.  I am using it. Print  quality is not good.
5,best dot matrix printer
1,"$ince I got the printer like 15 days ago but 4 days it took t out to.print to test it , I haven't printed a single page as the paper gets stuck and crunles up inside. Looks like something is blocking the paperOn one  side. My replacement window has alseo xpired. 4 days ago Now trying to get it fixed by calling. But no reply yet. This just pisses me of , you pay for a new printer and get a faulty one. I am disgusted and very disappointed with canon and Amazon"
5,"This is a great color printer for home or personal (infrequent) use. The following review is accordingly with that in mind. If you are a heavy user, then you should ideally be looking to buy a good quality laser printer instead of an inkjet printer.I have been using this printer for a few months now and am very happy with my purchase. Thecolor prints are fantastic - much better than the neighborhood photo studio (make sure you use good quality print paper - I use Kodak glossy print sheets). Also the canon print utility allows you to easily print borderless photos. Black and white prints are satisfactory as well. One thing to note is that by default the print settings are at Standard quality. Unless you are printing drafts, I would advise setting it to High.The scanner could have been better. It isn't great but its passable. Make sure you update the scan dpi settings to highest available (600 dpi) else you will get pixellated scans. Ideally I would have liked the option of 1200 dpi scans.The other good to have would have been automatic duplex - it only has manual duplex mode.The printer comes with 1 black and 3 color ink cartridges - and the inktank windows allow you to see exactly how much ink is remaining. I don't know how many prints the inks would give in total since I use the printer occassionally so still to run out of the first ink fill - but as I've said earlier, if you're a heavy user then a laser printer is the way to go. If you are an occassional user and need good quality color prints, then this printer is highly recommended. Even though its a bit expensive, the color photographs are superb."
5,"Excellent.Good MakePrints Faster than Other printers on plane paper, photo takes some timeOverall it's a very good printerTutorial available at ij.start.canon"
1,I have delivered a fake product
5,i bought this because i invest approx 500 rs per month for prints and xerox at out side...some late nights also i have to go for other places for xerox and prints  that's why i purchased last month...with 2 year extended warranty...i tried almost all types of prints...performance is good....for bright photo select paper as inkjet(A) other wise inkjet or maxe or high resolution paper for normal photos...normal print quality is good both in B&W and Colour...xerox also wellscan also well..Con: taking approx 5 to 30 sec time for first print...after normal..i think processing time..For ink bottles better to get authorized store...
4,"A compact, feature rich, robust and reliable printer with 'okay' printing speed. It's easy to set it up by yourself. I'm impressed with the print quality and color, on both plain white sheet and on glossy photo paper. The only negative I found on this device is the noise, but there is a 'quiet mode' on the PC app which almost solves the issue. Highly recommended if you are looking for a budget printer for low-volume home use."
2,"do not buy . trust me ..i bought a hp 5720 and this together. the hp installs superb , the wi fi was a breeze truly .the epson has not been able to configure its wi fi yet .. really it is sad these chaps could not have a flawless wi fi connect when toys can do that . the ink pumps to fro also , tyakes time to get rteady. the  installation is a headache ... hp may be troublesome but after 7 printers  i have bought it is far far ahead..save money do not buy epson"
4,Installation is easy if u follow youtube. But connecting through wifi is tough for the first time but if u download printer selector app and print the settings page then its okPrint quality is good even for the photos on glossy paper. But the display is not touch enabled. Print the settings first then go for offline connection first. Note the password which is specific for the model.
4,Good qualty product with best image quality on photopaper. The printing speed even in normal draft quality is really slow. Built quality is average not like HP. This printer exceeds EPSON quality ant sets a new benchmark for quality.
4,"Very good printer with high quality printing.Good speed also.Portable and easy to peint.Scanning is not upto the mark.Wifi direct ia easy to set up, but online printing is impossible.Paper margins are never correct.Main con is paper margins, canon has to do something about this margin issue."
5,The best model for domestic use where moderate to heavy printing is required.Print quality is good and good value for money.Set up is real easy.It comes with all the ink bottles and will last very long.Wifi printing is very fast and there is no delay.Direct printing from the phone app is also cool.The software for laptop/desktop is very user friendly.Good quality paper should be used to get a good printing quality .People looking for printing directly from iOS device should look for printers with AirPrint feature.
2,"I have been using this for few months. I don't know if it's just me but I have had a lot of issues with this printer. The problems that I usually face are incorrect color while printing. This is a problem I have encountered numerous times. While I print a photo sometimes the entire photo gets a shade of Green and Yellow. Before this happened it was working fine and I had printed around 10 photos. I uninstalled and reinstalled my drivers did a deep cleaning and then it started working fine however I faced the same issue again today.The let down is if you have to contact support,there's no toll free number and charges are applicable."
1,"Its 2019 and how is this printer not compatible with Mac OS? I can print from my Android phone or iPhone on this brand new printer from Canon, but not with any of my Macs! The older version Pixma G3000 is compatible with Macs. My much older Pixma Pro9000 is Mac compatible.1 star because of this."
5,"got the printer, setup done, printed some photos. the quality is great, photos look good (do not have photo paper yet). I use it for printing painting references. i was able to print first print from iPhone. setup from PC to print was a breeze, never had to connect printer to PC. Hopefully print cost is low so that i can print 'at will' , my main reason to buy."
3,"This is a value for money printer. But documentation and configuration is horrible. I have used HP for a long time and the set up was always a breeze. Canon lacks in such ease of set up. I, being a technical person, still had a nightmare configuring wifi and all."
4,"I have been using this product for 1.5 months now:Pros:Good print qualityVariety of connectivity optionsCons:Not so easy to install - especially the wifi setup via direct connect and network is not clearThe application to monitor the printer needs to be much better - the screens are not so easy to understand, and basic printer management functions seem lacking"
3,"Product is good ,it works well as compared to epson but it does not have option to print passport & stamp size photo from android phone"
1,CANON IS PROVIDING  INFO THAT Mac OS IS NOT SUPPORTED HOWEVER AMAZON IS NOT PROVIDING THIS INFO.NOW AFTER DELIVERY AMAZON IS NOT READY TO RETURN THE PRINTER.
5,"Painless installation. Using it with the cellphone app as well as Windows laptop. Photos printed on plain paper look nice, but I have not tried with photo quality printer yet. Text printing not as fast as laser, but that is expected for any ink printer."
4,"The best model for domestic use with moderate to heavy printing is required.Easy, flawless installation.High-quality printing but ink requirement is high.Good speed also.Scanning is also quite good.Wifi direct is easy to set up.Good value for money."
5,"I am a student and I make all my notes either on my phone or my laptop, and so I print around 10 copies a day. I have been using it for about a month and this little beast works like a charm for me. I am totally satisfied with this product."
3,It may be a good product but only black ant white is comming. Colour printings very very bad and unnecessarily spent money thinking of getting good colour picture.  It is a great failure. It is useful for black colour printouts only.
4,Very Good product I am very happy
3,I am using it from last 1 month  and  I found that the printing speed is slow. Coloured printing takes 20 25 sec for 1 page and black and white takes 10 to 15 sec per page..As per the prize the speed is slow ...
4,"Been using it for less than a week, good printer for home needs. Easy to install, good compatibility with desktop and Android phone. Have only printed b/w docs so far. Scanning quality not that great. Made in Vietnam."
5,"Satisfied after a month of usage (home usage). Setup and installation is very easy on Windows. Print quality in colour and rich black is good, but on only b&w, quality is underwhelming.Note: during first time setup, the colour ink bottles may not empty completely. Double check when filling."
4,Print quality is good on normal paper. But when we take the photo print the horizontal lines are seen on the photo print . But those not visible from front side . Only one can see those from vertically opposite to eye level.
4,6000 pages printing is totally a myth.It hardly prints 2 to 2.5 thousand pages. It consumes a lot of ink after installation for refilling the cartridge.
5,"Good sturdy product you won’t feel low quality plastic anytime , printing speed also good. so for printed around 50 page’s within 5 days , the quality of print is satisfactory, you won’t complain for sure. I bought it for ₹14000 which I felt little pricier. I will post the long term review later. Overall Ok 👍"
4,The printer is very nice and good working. But seller is keep going on changing price. When I was buying the price is 14348. But now it is 14040
4,"Biggest problem found being it does not support Mac, have to use a third party software to use it."
5,Print quality is so good around four color printing.Ink tank inbuilt the body.It's little bit more noisy.Borderles printingEasy to use through smartphones.Wireless connectivity  is so fastCanon provide us it's good printing and editing apps.
1,I installed the printer by watching your video attached to this product on Amazon site but in this video printer head installation description is wrong.due to this my print head is not working.hard brown tape supposed to be not removed but in this video all brown tape has been removed.
5,"Go for this printer , best in class product. If you are a windows user then just go for it.Be it print quality, economical , everything is best."
5,"very very nice printer. Print Quality is very near equivalent to Photo Lab.  I can print mobile picture direct, through mobile. very nice printer. printer cast is low. there are so many settings for print your job for many types of paper.we can print easily. very easy printing options.nice printer."
5,"Economical, excellent print quality...only regret not compatible with ios airprint"
5,A really good productI just loved it very good print quality just loved itIt's just a bit expensive but really worth
1,"Amazon sell the printer in invoice , but invoice not mention in serial number so trouble for warranty claim and repair...so don't buy online this....I face the issue"
5,Very good printer . It prints with ease on WiFi . Installation is very easy . As of now I have printed colour and black no degradation found .
4,Good side. Easy to print with mobile too. Awesome print quality. Easy installation processBad side. Response time slow. Noisy
1,"This printer is a complete waste of time, money and labels. The same command to print works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't. I have wasted more labels than what I have printed using this god awful printer. Buy a piece of rock instead of this and that will be more profitable for your business. And this product has a Return Policy duration of ""2 and a half seconds"". So if you think you will try it out and then Return it if you don't like it, forget about that. This is a Rs 12,000 bell stuck around your neck and you will never be able to take it off. The hole in your pocket will just keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger because you will be wasting more than 50% of your labels. I have realized that within a week of buying this junk."
1,Product is not satisfactory as its “MADE IN CHINA” there is no warranty and not a good brand for work. Also there is no ribbon with the product you need to buy ribbon and price is higher then expected with quality and service and no ribbon.Not satisfied with product and seller.
5,Been using this for more than a year and i'm completely satisfied with its quality/speed of printing labels.Initially i had a problem with loading ribbons and labels.Watched few videos on youtube and that's it.I don't know why so many negative feedbacks. this is by far my best investment .
1,Don't buy this product. Their service is very poor. I can't able to install the product by myself. I called their helpline number and got the reply that they are not doing any service to customers purchase from Amazon. So I arranged another person for installation and have to pay him. Please don't buy this product.
1,Printer not working. Don't ignore negative reviews. I just wasted the money. Never buy it online.
5,"First of all thanks to Amazon seller. for this productfast label print. best quality this printer. easy to use. packing is also v goodThe TTP-244 Pro is ideal for customers looking for a high-quality barcode printer.Value for money. fast print speed, along with the largest memory capacity in its classIt's v good productBest quality this printerIt's a good value for money as well.Best quality."
2,I did not liked it because...The driver CD was broken. There was so much of dust inside the box of this printer and also on the printer. The printer did not worked as I expected it to be. I had to reconfigure the printer after every single label print.
1,"The printer is faulty and doesn't work. Not even the test page prints without an error.  Tried contacting Amazon only to hear that I should contact the manufacturer because Amazon doesn't provide warranty for this. The manufacturer doesn't help customers who bought it from Amazon. So, in turn the entire 11.5K that I paid in down the sewer.The service levels couldn't have went down any further."
5,1St printerAfter Calibration printer will print one sticker after that print is going out of stickerAll the time2nd PrinterSuper FastVery nice1good qualityIt is calibrating very fastTHANK YOU AMAZON FOR BEET SERVICE
1,"We have ordered that printer for our e-commerce orders and use it once in a while.We wanted to use it last week and electric sparks came out from the printer plug (the one that connects the printer to the computer). I unplugged it and replugged several times and the each time we got the same issue.See the video enclosed.I was really concerned about the risk this represents in term of security for my office and employees. I therefore contacted straight away the seller and shared all the information asking for them to pick up and refund that terrible product. Since then, they have just be answering vaguely that they are looking into it and doing nothing.Seems scandalous that such an expensive product can be so risky.We will clearly never be using that product again - and not buy anything from that seller again."
1,I bought this product in feb 2019 . Right from day one the bar code is not printing well . Scanner not able to read . Dont buy this product online . The seller is not giving any warranty card or any information about the service centre and not able able to contact the seller also . SPJ gadgets private ltd New Delhi  .  When i checked  online the TSC  service  centre number is wrong .
4,"All you need to know is how to operate the software called BarTender. The printer has got nothing much to do its all about the alignment you do it in the processing software. But within the budget its an awesome product. Try to keep this printer in a clean and hygienic place, this will increase the life of the machine."
1,Print quality very poor.. Dots comes in between black region.. N fonts becomes too lighy
1,Pathetic product and pathetic after sales service from the seller.
5,Its an excellent printer. I am highly satisfied with the product as well as the customer service for this barcode printer. Seller of this product is really very nice and helpful in providing services to their customers.
5,I purchased a printer of TSC-TTP-244-PRO from amazon. It's Good Quality Product. Here I am attaching a video.
1,this is a big headache of a printer. a brand new printer keeps showing error after error. after taking to a local service center now has to go through warranty which is another big headache.

1,"Don't buy brother printer products, iam return my printer"
5,Bought the printer. Easy set up on all laptops and can identify multiple Wi-fi's at home. Powerful wireless and prints instantaneously even when it is sleep mode. It is also fast and does duplexing well.Have not tried the ADF. No complaints and runs smoothly.
5,It's good one.Duplex printing is good.High speed.Size of printer can be reduced is the only drawback.
1,Brother customer care is not support properly and amazon is not supported properly
5,"The quality of the printer is very good. I have installed the printer myself as lockdown is going on. The brother serveice engineer will face difficulty to come home for demo. So better you try installing.The model is very good and I got it for a very good deal for 21,500. Unmatched performance and features for this price.Overall I am very satisfied with this product."
5,No fuss like other printers. Easy set up and worth the cost.
1,Product received was opened from before...probably perused
1,Bad product. E3 problem.  I returned this product.
5,Brother printer MFC T920DWPrint quality is excellentCompare to offline online price is little highIt's a all-rounder 👍
4,Good for small office and personal ...
5,Great Printer! Works perfectly.
5,"Value for money,print quality is excellent,ease of use"
5,Worth it
1,E3 error in this printer and printing quality is very good and fast
5,"1. Print quality - 10/102. Print speed - 10/10 (Better than Epson and HP)3. Auto duplex printing - Yes (Faster than Epson)4. ADF, FAX, Wifi printing - YesOverall - 10/10Couldn't have found these features in any other brand, atleast for this price."
2,"Not lab quality print. Battery is not available in Amazon. Epson e372cartridges costs 1799/- in Amazon, which is too much."
5,"Good studio like print quality, took first 50 standard quality printouts in 4x6 size photo paper with the supplied cartridge, still shows around 50% ink available in the cartridge. New cartridge is available for Rs. 1,099/- (Epson Shop). Happy with my purchase. :-)"
1,Worst product in whole amazon
4,The printer is good to print pictures. The print outs are of high quality and perfectly exposes the colour of the picture. Just that the colour cartridge ends pretty quickly I won't suggest this product. I bought this printer to print passport size photograph and 4*6 photos but I could print only around 200 pages before refilling it.The original cartridge cost is around 1200. So if I can print around 200 4*6 size photos by investing 1200+200(paper cost).Cost per page: rs. 7Selling price at our hometown: rs. 6I'm getting a loss.Recommended only for home use or for printing passport size photographs.
5,Very Good work
4,Its too costly and print quality not upto the mark. But it is the only option available so just go for it.
5,"After running for so many color printers in affordable price, i find this one best according to my needs. Really best photo quality on glossy paper with good shining. Most impressive thing is that it reproduces same color in photos as displayed in your monitor."
3,Ink cartridge price to much high and original not available . Amazon is my best friend .
3,Volume for money.

4,"I have been using this printer for almost an year and it's giving me good printing results without a single headclean till date with more than 4000 prints. It's very easy to use and we get up to 5*7 size print, cloud printing, memory card slots and usb slot. The only concern will be the printing cost, it's bit on the higher side comparing with the inktank printers."
2,"The sharpness and quality of the prints are poor, it’s older model PM245 is much better"
5,"This is a great product from Epson ,perfect for personal photography . The photos come out very clear and crisp similiar to the studios . and its very portable , so you can easily take it out wherever you are going for parties and all"
1,It worked fine during installation. But right from the 2nd day it stopped working. The wifi connecting of printer is poor and not at all user friendly printer. With every minor issue one has to call Canon to resolve. Even Canon won't help you after warranty period.
5,I LIKE IT SUPER  PRODUCT
5,"Money worth. Easy to install , best print quality.Only drawback is sometimes while scanning, the documents get stuck in the middle.Definitely fo with this if you are looking for wifi printer with black and white print. Printing speed is also very nice."
1,Just had the printer installed last night as it was delivered yesterday in the noon. The ink had leaked half and this is a new product.Kindly have it replaced I had ordered this printer for my work and Now I have to run pillar to post just to have a print.
1,The printer in itself is good however HP is not repairing the printer under warranty because the serial number on the bill is different. Amazon has taken the money and left me with a 20 day old printer withought warranty. And amazon is not helping with this problem of wrong bill.
5,"I was looking for a moderately priced ink-tank printer which could  offer multiple functions of  print-scan-copy in a wireless mode and support web based and smart phone printing options. I found all these in HP Ink Tank Wireless 410 printer.Got it today.  My observations:Pros:a. Excellent packingb. Crisp instructions to installc. Smooth installation process (including wireless set up)d. Smooth printing (direct, web, via email, smartphone)e. smudge and spill free ink fillingf. User removable print headg. Duplex printing (manual change over)h. Booklet printing that is easy to manageCons:a. Paper tray has limited capacityb. You have to be savvy to learn the functioning of Control Panel of the printer (you will need to download manuals from the web)c. Though the printer comes with installation CD, they encourage you to download the software from the web.d. Paper out area has a big opening and is likely to have dust accumulatione. No easy way to do a quick scan (wish they had a shortcut for it)f. allows paper thickness of upto 90 gsm only (desirable was at least 100)g. it makes you dump lot of polythene and plastic as a part of installation. Even the print head area has a full packing which one feels bad discarding.In short, be ready to spend some time to familiarise yourself with the printer.Despite the cons, it is good value for money. Best in its class, I would feel."
1,"I bought this one for my home office. The first impression was good and printing was fine. After the first use, I didn't used the printer for a week. When I tried to print again, the printer didn't print at all, I got a blank sheet. When I searched a lot on the internet; I found that, this is a common issue. If you won't use the printer on a regular basis, the ink forms clotting on the print heads and you can't use it anymore without servicing the heads. I did a servicing and after that, each alternative day I printed something to keep the printer alive. After 5 months of use the printer stopped working, it is not detecting the print head anymore. When I tried to find a service centre there is literally 'none' nearby my place (There is only 1 service centre in the whole area which is 50KM away from my place).The issues I've faced so far:1) Ink clots on printhead if you won't use it on a regular basis2) There is no service centres nearby3) Ink to print head everything is very costly4) The ink level indicator never worked in my case5) The software/printing apps are really badI won't recommend this product to anybody, it's a money pit. You will lose a lot of money to just maintain this printer. I regret buying this one. Good bye to HP & it's products."
3,"In the product description, it can take upto 6000 pages black and white. But, actually on the box it can take upto 4000 pages only... please try to give genuine information as you can"
5,"It's the best wireless tank printers and low priced too.. I got it in just over 10k after sbi card discount and amazon pay balance. the print quality is far more superior crisp and clear than Epson and other printers  which give light and dark bands in draft printing ..I installed and wireless configured the printer myself but others may require some technical assistance for  installation and first run, it has built-in wifi direct sofor your android phone  just download hp smart remote for printer and hp print driver app and you can scan print configure and operate your printer wirelessly from your phone even without a wifi router .. the only thing is I didn't get the dustproof printer cover offered by some sites with this printer"
1,"After first installation, getting error as print head.. Though followed all instructions. Please help to fix or return the item"
4,"I have used to hp printers in UK the all in one wireless is much better quality and prints both side of paper.Features that lack in this printer1. No card reader, no pen drive reader2. For the price it could have had a good display screen for printing status.3. Ink is expensive4. Back side printing is manual.5. For 6000k we get very good printers out of country here even after paying 14k lacks many good features."
5,"I took a risk and bought this printer, as I'm using Linux mint on my computer...nothing was mentioned about it working on Linux. Before I got it, I had a tough time as to what should I do if it doesn't work on Linux, finally I bought it as it also has wireless connectivity...I'm happy to report this:The pros:Wireless, so u can print straight from the smartphone,Also can print thru a router, easy to set up.Usb printing for windows and Mac.I had trouble with Linux usb, but after going to the hplip download website, managed to get everything working.. very good printing, cheap and effective for home printing..Value for money, as cartridges last long.Scanner works well, so xeroxing is easy, even coloured .Setting up is easy once u read everything correctly..Paper is top loading, so even thick paper will work for cards n stuff.No adaptor, straight power cord connection, India plug.Ink levels can easily be seen.Ink refills come with the printer. 1 black and 3 coloured (CMYK).All settings can beThe cons:No support drivers for Linux on the cd., Only windows and Mac.Power button difficult to make out, as it isn't printed with white ink. Can only make out after led lights up."
1,"hopeless printer, worked fine for 2 days after installation, then printer paper feeding mechanism is faulty, takes a bunch of papers altogether , and they get stuck inside, to retrieve a single printout you have to struggle for such a long time , that one feels, absolutely cheated by HP. for logging into customer care you have to spare atleast half an hour to satisyy their introductory querries. wifi printing worked fine for initial 2 days, now showing error in printing. trying to resolve the matter with HP cust. care, logged my complaint No. :  5035382582, dated 09/08/19. Personally speaking, it seems to be a total loss of money."
3,"I have bought this product recently. Everything was ok, until I tumble with the problem of configuring the printer with D link DIR -816 wifi router.  Had to raise a HP service request to make a visit technical engineer to investigate the issue and fix it.  After hearing the issue the HP technical engineer informed us that HP printer don't support D link DIR-816 router. And also, informed there are many router which HP Printer don't support. There is workaround but that's not a full proof & fully functions.After googling found that same issue is faced by many customers. HP Printer don't support all router.I would request Amazon & the OEM that please ensure you publish all the list of Router to all customer which are NOT supported by HP ink tank wireless printer. This will help to avoid harassment & bed review for HP product.Customer who are reading this review, please ensure that your home wifi router supports HP Printer."
1,This HPS printer is USELESS. The display shows that it is connected to Wifi but the printer does not print. You need to switch it on and off 4-5 times before the printer is recognized. It's probably the worst HP printer I have used in the last 20 years.
4,"This printer is ok for the price. Easy to set up. Appears durable (just got it today) and has a nice form factor. Yet to try the wireless printing capabilities.The print time (color) for basic documents without too many graphics is ok and not too slow. The scanner however is a major let down. Disappointing color rendering and scanned image quality (sub par resolution). Scanning is sloooow!Buy this printer only if you don't have to do much document / image scanning and if you are only looking for printing documents.I haven't yet printed any photographs. Will add to this review once I try thst out.Update: It is now a year (October 2019) since I bought this printer. Just printed some 300 pages over the year! The tri-color printhead stopped working. HP support replaced the printhead (onsite service) within 24 hours! Very impressive service. WiFi connected, works like a charm and the best is no cords! Not happy with the photo printing though."
4,Good quality colour print...Low cost copy...Totally too good
4,"So i got this printer for a good bargain about a month back. Here is what I like about it -1. Very easy to setup; Just follow the guides step by step and you cannot go wrong. Connected to wifi very easily as well. The overall setup took about 45 minutes but, then i was slow and reading each step carefully.2. Offers a web based console that keeps a complete check on the printer's activities, how many pages it has printed and so on; Very useful.3. Print quality - Good as it can be. Haven't printed any photos. Documents have been crisp.4. Supports Apple's wifi protocol; Can allow you to print from any devices without any hassles.5. Supports wifi scanFew things that I feel, i didn't like.1. Printed paper collection tray; Its very delicate. I feel if any pressure is put, it will break down.2. Supports only manual back to back printing (its in the specs); Now if you try to turn the sheet and try to feed it, few times it slips thru a minor gap between printer and feeder.Overall impressions - after using it for nearly a month, i am happy and can't really complain. I hope now the ink tank does stand it promise and give me an ability to print about 3000 odd papers. that will be 1 ink tank fill for a year."
1,"Warranty is as per hp website started in Nov-18 where as I purchased in 07-may-19, HP eprint not working, print quality is dull colors, not displaying ink levels in webpage. Very pathetic service by hp customer care,They chat with for 4hrs and could not able to solve the issues and they don't want send  their engineer for solve the issues....As per hp customer care supplier already switched on this device hence warranty will start from that date... Hence the supplier cheated and he is not provided details of extended warranty claim.."
4,"Cons--Slightly large, space consuming-Printing is a little slow-Makes some noise-cannot take a print on both sides of the paper automatically. One has to manually reverse each sheet to get print on the other sidePros--10paise per print-wireless, print directly from phone-free installation by professionals-cheaper than market price at amazon-very high quality scan and print-photocopy function is also resonably good-very easy to useVerdict- go for it!"
2,"I faced a host of issues with setup:It arrived fast, but there are problems with technical support and the seller.1. Seller has started the warranty before sale. My printer had the warranty period started 1 month before I even purchased the product when I checked online. Please type HP warranty check and make sure you don't have this issue! If you do, call HP support, show them the invoice and payslip with serial number and urgently update the mismatch. It will take 24-48 hours.2. When I tried to set up the printer, I ran into some issues with the wifi setup, and trust me it takes a tech savvy person at least 45 minutes to figure out how to proceed. So then I wanted to request a HP installation engineer (which every customer with a new product is entitled to).3. The seller has *already* used my printer's unique serial number to register an engineer installation for someone else some time before selling me the product. I cannot have a free HP engineer come to my house now as they only do it once and HP asked me to contact the amazon seller directly. So if you need an engineer's help, then good luck. You will have to call HP technical support and do everything yourself like I did.4. A 'Start Here' blue booklet/guide is missing in the box and a setup CD. This made figuring out how to setup 2x harder and I had to look up the HP manuals online.5. Wifi setup isn't smooth, even when I installed everything correctly and followed instructions. I had to open my TP link router management webpage and set up the WPS link through that - or else the wifi will keep disconnecting from the printer.6. I set up the Google Assistant Voice activation. Just download the google assistant app and say 'speak to HP printer' and it will add a new printer.  Color print is ok. 1200 dpi scan will be a bit slow, lower resolutions much faster. The same with printing.7. The seller responded to my question about the warranty and engineer request by saying 'if product is under warranty please contact HP' after selling it to me less than 3 days ago! I may return it and buy directly from HP.8. The printer itself is good, for initial setup check youtube or type hp 410 manuals on google and set up with that. Not too complex - fill the ink, insert the printerheads and run an alignment. Download the HP smart app.Bottom line, buy directly from HP for peace of mind regarding warranty and ease of installation, or try another seller. I may return it as an exchange period of 7 days is available, but I don't want to end up with the same seller again."
2,"It's been more than a year since I purchased this one. Printed quality was great initially during first few pages/photos, for a month.Then lines started appearing, requiring very frequent troubleshooting through hp smart app. After 4-5 months usage, black printhead stopped printing. Online and on telephone support didn't help, so finally customer care guy came and after checking, replaced the black print head, under warranty.Then after a year and 1 month exactly, after a total print count of less than 150 pages, the color cartridge stopped being detected. And then, it doesn't print anything, simply freezes at power on asking to check cartridge (print head), though black printhead is detected perfectly.Now no warranty, so customer care asked me to purchase the printhead. When I asked that it's printed less than150 pages so far, how can print-heads are getting spoilt so soon. The epic explanation: ""printhead delivered as part of new printer aren't of that good quality, you need to buy new one""..Another problem, even if one printhead is faulty, and replaceable as a single piece, you need to buy both (black & color) as a set because HP doesn't sell them individually. And you've got no option, it's monopoly as usual, once you've purchased the printer.This printer looks good and wifi works perfectly, but that's not what I paid money for. Print quality is good only when it's new, and then it turns frustrating. Paper fetching also doesn't work smoothly, I many times need to keep shaking the paper in tray before it finally detects.I've got a far cheaper black ink laser printer from another company working perfectly for last 11 years. This one has given me enough headaches in one year itself.And as the ink-tanks are not getting empty faster, looks like hp has decided to compensate by selling more printheads. I don't know how often I'll need to order them.I wouldn't buy any printer from hp in future for sure."
1,The Blackberry offer displayed on the product page is not a available for printer model 410. Amazon and HP are misguiding with this offer. BEWARE of fraud !
1,"This has reference to the HP 410 series wireless printer that I bought from Amazon on 27th Oct . We had requested for an installation and the HP engineer arrived on 5th Nov. Upon arriving the engineer Vishesh arrived and  was under severe cold however we did keep safe distance.He checked the printer and was able to take the first printout. However, post which he stated that there is an alignment issue to the printer and it needed to be reset and he was not able do it and had to be taken to a service centerHow does HP check field engineer assigned how is suffering from Cold and thus a potential case of COIVDA printer that has been purchased 10 days back and one is unable to do an installation is deplorablePlease have this addressed ASAP and revert back.The support is par below expectation from HP. but this at your risk"
5,An awame product...print quality great...easy to install...photo print quality also great...material is strong...nd easy wifi print...whenever you will go for wireless print please turn off your mobile data otherwise you will not get print...
5,"Amazing response from Amazon, delivered within a day.Product arrived intact. No issuesMy self installed, needed youtube guide video and manual support. With few errors i completed installation. Took 30 minutes to take first printout wirelessly from desk top. And installed this printer in all the gadgests. Now i can print from anywhere outside home  or from office through internet. All set up took 30-45  minutes.* Print quality looks watery when coverage is more, need more time to check. B/W text prints ok.Cons.. printer is slightly wider, expected from the photo an eveb better compact size.More on print quality asand when i face challenge."
1,This printer is good as long as it works. It is prone to frequent problems and HP support for its printers is very poor. I bought two printers because of quality print and ease of use but both developed defects even after minimal use. Both were installed in different cities. To add to the misery HP support is extremely difficult to find and connect.
5,"Hello Friends, Printer is awesome right now, don't know it's future. Printer packaging is awesome got every item in good condition. I have printed on 150gsm glossy paper at best settings and it's quality is awesome. I have purchased onsitego 2 year extended warranty and registered the product on both websites HP and Onsitego, Now my printer is protected from 29/Sep/2019 to 28/Sep/2022. MRP is 15769 Rupees but I got it on deal of the day for 9999 Rupees. You can go for it. Amazon is Amazing."
1,"It take almost half hour to print 2,3 pagesWorst printing speed"
1,"We purchased the product on 16th October whereas the database of HP shows item purchased on 21st September 2019 hence warranty expired on 20th September 2020. This is not fair. Also, i have not used the item much and now the black ink does not come out. I thought this would be user friendly. Not really. Seller, please help out to get the warranty done right."
1,"Don’t buy; especially if there are any tagline as ""Amazon's Choice"" do double check the reviews, else you shall end up with the trouble as I am; the product has no support from HP. I have issues with the print quality and now I am struggling to get help. So no point of having any warranty as HP themselves do not offer any help."
1,"Disappointed for the first time with Amazon customer care. The product description says that it is replaceable within 7 days but even though I was having a defect in my printer, even then there is no return possible. It’s better that Amazon doesn’t display false information on the product page. In my printer the black ink tank is not filling completely but Amazon refused to replace the printer as promised and now I’m left to using a defective printer. Really disappointed with Amazon this time. The Amazon tech support didn’t know anything about the problem and simply asked me to contact HP support to get it repaired or whatever but no replacement as promised on the display page."
2,"this printer is waste of money, there s nothing more thsn a inkjet printer. buy inkjet instead of inktank , specially of hp.inktank printer is a inkjet printer with just ink in side tanks.  dont go for inktank printerseven epson inktank is better than of hp.some of epson printers have print on cd/id card facilities. epson have better design too."
5,"Wi fi set up though took a little bit time but once done , you can print just easily from your mobile, print quality is good too and plus it's got ink tanks attached so there's no hassle of filling ink cartridges etc...go for it ..yes recommended ."
1,HP is a established brand. Bur seller sold a printer which was already registered for warranty which had expired wirhing a month of purchase. After some time i noticed all ink from one inktank has leaked out spoiling the printer. Then only I noticed that Appario has sold out of warranty printer which was supposed to be for one year. While quality of print is okayish. Nothing great to write about. WiFi worked. Normal document printing is ok. Sometimes paper gets stuck.Terribly disappointed in the product and behaviour of seller. Amazon should take note of the malpractices indulged in by Appario for selling out of warranty printer.
2,"The printer turns out to be one of the worst purhase decisions we made.It worked fine for 2 months in the beginning but the condition is really bad after that.1.It gives error 2/3/4 which are only described in online video platforms as non debuggable errors.Once you get that error you as a user cannot solve the issue yourself.Saw various videos which said a paper should be stuck but there was none. Checked using torches and various methods mentioned on online video platforms. It kills your time and gives you no output.The only option you have is to wait for 3-4 days after which the printer decides that it can now print again.2. Color Printout on glossy sheets is smudgy.When you buy a Rs12,000 color printer you would want to take out some photos on a glossy sheet.The printer let's you do that but you cannot touch the printed part of the paper for ever. IF you do it leaves a black residue and smudges the whole photograph. The printout is simply untouchable for ever.3. Printer stops during Printing.Sometimes the printer stops midway during printing. You just wait and cajole the printer to throw out the sheet but it won't. It holds on to the sheet even though it has printed it and you cannot use your print.4. Device does not allow Wifi printingWe have an airtel wifi in the house for 5 years now. Quite consistent in speed and performance.The HP printer allows wifi printing on certain days from the mobile and on other days you need to switch on the laptop to print using wifi.The mobile wi-fi printing the main reason we purchased the printer simply does not work.5. HP Smart App.The HP smart app does not show any error or problem even when the printer shows Error3/4. It keeps showing the printer is Ready.We keep sending the prints but nothing get's printed.6. Poor Customer Service.a. The customer service number is not reachable from Airtel phones. It gets disconnected within 1 second of dialing the call.b. From prepaid vodafone numbers it says the call is chargeable and disconnects the call.7. The printer has already broken down twice in the 3 months that we have owned it. Ticket logging with HP is a headache. You are asked to explain and try everything on your own from fiddling with the printer when it is on to taking out the printer heads and replacing them back when the printer is still on. At the end of a 30-40 minute conversation they log your ticket and assign an engineer a day later. the engineer further takes between 3-4 days to come and set the printer right.Both the times parts had to be changed and that is what we were trying to explain to the Customer Rep but they make it sound as your mistake.(Paper would be stuck, not enough ink, paper gsm quality, paper company, type etc)Alas the poor quaity problem remains the same. If you buy a home printer you are likely to suffer for having paid these companies."
1,It's been 1 month running behind HP for service as printer is not working but no resolution. Seems if you buy from Amazon you will not get service. Worst product. Don't buy.
3,"The black cartridge goes bad very soon. HP support is good that they replace it till the printer is in warranty but after that, you are on your own. Buy this printer if you print at least 1 page daily or max weekly. If you leave this printer without use for a longer time, chances are that cartridges head may go bad. It has gone bad for me 2nd time in 8 months as I print only for my kid's school project only when it is needed. The WiFi connection also does not work most of the time. I connect with USB cable and print."
2,"I had a epson ink tank printer for the past 8 years.It gave away due to detoriation of the ink pad.Bought this with great expectations but so far the experinece has been average to poor.Prints are average,one cannot compare it with the catridge printers.But what irritates the most is the HP smart app for android (not sure why they named is as smart).It doesn't print exce/wordl files.You need to convert it to pdf for it to show up in app.With other printers,one can open the files,enable the share option and the printer shows up.In this case the printer doesn't appear.Worst possible setup .Regreting my buy. My advice go with epson.Fantastic windows and androif interface."
1,"Seems like a very bad printer. Single page prints fine. It gets stuck on the first page if you give print command for a file with multiple pages. Sometimes, sends out blank papers. Same issue in the replacement printer too. Finally, getting a refund. Amazon support has been helpful though. Looks like HP needs to work on the hardware quality."
4,"Product is good. But the technical support from local HP partner is pathetic. The technician that has come to install the product did not know how to set up the printer on the router.(this is the main feature of the said printer).Left my premise putting the blame on the wifi router.Technician more of a 'duniya kar lo mutthi mein "" salesman. Same complaint raised on Twitter. But HP twitter handle response ..more than pathetic.Not that easy to install. Difficult for a mom technical person to install by himself/herselves.Print quality not as shown in the video. Tech support ....MORE THAN PATHETIC."
4,"After using last 2 months, i am writing this review.1. We are not using much frequently, but whenever we are using it, getting excellent print out. Nevertheless, we have taken around more than 80 pages.2. Very easy to install and use3. Very useful when taking printout from mobile. just need to connect the printer using inbuild wifi and give print. Or install the mobile app.4. A text beside button would really very helpful to know the button function for any user"
5,"Super printer and easy with HP smart app. Copy, print, scan efficiently. HP eprint is awesome allows to print from anywhere over Internet. HP afer sale service is excellent. I had problem with printer head and was replaced by HP in 1st call. Ink tanks are easy to refill and spillproof. Excellent printer overall."
1,"After installation of CD that came along with Scanner, I'm getting a pop up saying 'Can't communicate with scanner-scanner is is turned off/ USB cable is disconnected' code: 2,156,33 . I can't scan even a single page!"
5,"it is nice. 100% perfect.Easy ty use,Picture is awesome,Software is easy to install. Better than other companies.I scanned 200+ pages in 45 mins. Do not look at negative reviews. Just go for it.[Update after 4 months].. I have scanned more than 10k or 20k pages or more, of different books. It neither hangs nor stops. This is just perfect. This scanner is really made for ""heavy duty"""
1,The unit was lying idle. I just started to scan a Photograph and a document. In both cases the scanned images are having a vertical blackout hiding the documents portion on the right side. Repeated scanning are showing the same results. It appears to be defective unit.
4,"Procedure :1) Download the full software package + driver from their website.2) Start installation WITHOUT CONNECTING THE SCANNER.3) While installing, the wizard will ask you to connect the scanner, THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE TO CONNECT.4) After the installation finishes, lift the scanner up and unlock the scanner by moving the black switch underneath.Thats it. Now you can use IJ Scan Utility to scan from the pc or directly from the buttons on the scanner."
1,"received just two days before, and then tried to install it on PC (windows 7, USB 2.0)  (1st pic) as well as on laptop.( Windows 10, USB 3.0) (2nd pic) but , the scanner can not be communicated in both cases as shown in picture. I have tried several times, but the same case appears. The scanner is defective and I have requested for refund, but there is no refund option, only replacement option available. But, I don't need replacement. Ridiculous!!!"
1,I can't install driver on my Windows 7 HB for first time! Customer care instructed me to carry the scanner along with laptop to service centre; where as other companies help customers through telephonic conversation. Price is also higher than other scanners.
5,My cousin is really happy with it. I have used this series for almost a decade so had recommended. The best part is that it doesn’t require a power cable and is charged up by the USB. I don’t like some of the features of its software though. Not much control unlike the hP scanning software. Only the stitching thing is okayish.
4,"After my humble HP Scanjet 2400 stopped working after 10 years, I bought Canon LIDE300 from Amazon after a little bit of research. I needed a budget scanner with the best possible performance. And I am not disappointed. I do mostly color scanning and it has been two months since I have been using it. Here is a detailed review about things I wish I had known before:PROS:1. Good scanning speed. I do most of my color scanning at 600 dpi and it is pretty fast.2. I am an artist and color reproduction is very important, and this scanner does a very good job.3. The USB cord is sufficiently long.4. The scan quality is very good. The images are crisp and highly detailed.5. Compared to many other scanners it is definitely value for money.6. Works very well with third-party softwares.CONS:1. It is very noisy!2. Even though I use a third-party software, when I tried to install this scanner's own software and driver, it didn't work and gave me lot of trouble and I gave up after a few attempts. This is a major con if you do not want to use a third-party software.3. If the photo is even 1mm above the glass, it will be blurred. The photo or the document needs to be completely flat and touching the glass. This was never a problem in my old scanner.4. The build material seems slightly cheap, but it makes up for it with the scan quality. So it is a good tradeoff.5. The lid does not completely come off, though it elevates sufficiently to scan books and magazines.6. This is a very specific con, and might not be a concern for many, but if you are scanning a picture, magazine, or newspaper which was folded at some point or has a crease, then that crease area is very prominently visible in the scans. This was never a problem with my old scanner as it lit the scanning area in such a way that the folds were never visible. I am still trying to find a solution for this and if I find it I will update the review."
3,Hi everyone whoever is facing problems connecting with usb 2.0 try installing the drivers from the CD only and not from internet .turn off internet while installing drivers then the scanner will be functional completely i faced this issue and tried this method now my scanner works perfectly.thank you amazon for replacing the initial defective scanner with a correct one
1,The scan has now power cord and it runs only by USB 3.0 but I have a USB 2.0 Laptop. Couldn't use it since it was delivered. Now ordered an USB 3.0 converter and I am not sure if it would run on that as well. Recommend all not to buy this model...
4,"To all the folks who are complaining about Communication error with scanner, Pls release the lock switch located at the bottom of the scanner and then give it a try. It works well but isn't ""too"" fast at scanning the docs. Overall I feel it is a bit overpriced."
5,A quality product from Canon. Very fast scanning. Easy to install and use. Scan quality is great.
5,CanoScan brand I preferred as my last scanner was also from CanoScan LIDE25 and used for 12 years. This scanner is also performing well on my PC. Only one problem for me was this scanner is not for VISTA that's I am using. Otherwise the scanner is very nice and fast.
5,"Using this scanner for past couple of days and its totally worth it. Scanned my documents, old photos and its quality is excellent. There is no issue with driver. Whoever is complaining about driver not red the description above nor the user manual. Follow it correctly and there will be no issues."
1,"After installation of software from CD there is an error 'Can't communicate with scanner-scanner is is turned off/ USB cable is disconnected' code: 2,156,33 . Tried software installation from website also, same error..Any solutions?"
4,"The scanner easily installed without any hurdle. It functions well. Quality of scan is good enough. It is a product with value for money. I was searching a scanner within 4k price to do legal job, as it is A4 size enabled, so I can't do scan the whole legal page but by folding out excess portion I can scan A4 size from legal size papers. However wish to buy a scanner within 4I which can scan legal size paper also."
5,User friendly
5,Best for the given price. Quality scanned copies were nice. Happy.
1,The scanner is taking lot of time to scan each page and very frequently getting internal server error. We tried in multiple laptops and facing the same problem. The performance is really bad and it is a total waste of money.
1,Scanner is not functioning. Not a single photo scanned. The msg on screen is1. the scanner is not connected.2. USB Cable disconnected.The port3.0 is only used. The signal that the scanner is connected is there. The CD is used and downloaded the softwarein computer.Please help to resolve the issue or collect back the canon scanner.
3,This product is not compatible with Windows 7 and I am unable to instal it. Would be grateful if you would replace this product with Epsom or any other Canon scanner which is compatible with Windows 7. You could send Epson Perfection V39 Scanner which is compatible with Windows 7 and I am willing to pay the difference.
5,"Great buy, easy to set up,quality results, value for money."
5,"Really like it easy to  use  & u don't have to  download software online ,it comes with CD just install it."
5,Easily installed the latest driver from internet in my laptop without using the installation CD and the scanner is working very nicely.
5,Till now it works fine. But after one year I will review its performance.
5,Scanner does not work with Windows XP. You need latest OS.
1,"A defective scanner was sent across, we tried installing it several times but alas it did not work. By the time this exercise was completed it was too late to return the scanner.I am quite surprised that how can amazon not make it compulsory for vendors to undertake quality check before dispatching the equipment."
4,It's a nice Scanner from Amazon.
4,Installation is little difficulty
5,VALUE FOR MONEY
5,"Easy to use, great output. Have used LIDE series before so the results were as expected."
4,Good resolution 2400×2400
4,Good product
5,Good buy and easy to use
4,"Printing is really good. Dont worry about the driver, it will workYour scanner will work perfectly"
5,Excellent
1,Yes easy to use but the product delivered first time eas faulty.The change one fulfills the promises it does.
1,The scanner show's error message that the scanner is turned off. Even though it is connected and we called toll free number they said for this model there is no demo service. We are extremely upset this kind of poor service and response from Canon.
5,Excellent product.
5,"Easy to use After scan ,Cutting edge etc Not provided."
4,I was looking for scanner and printer for home usage (for occasional printing). I decided the hp 2131 which was coasting around 3100 but shortly it became out of stock. So I went for this one and it costed me 3300 on freedom sale.Prints are clear and also the scanning quality is good I scanned my brother's college id card it was clear . Speed is also good and it is quite lightI will post full review after more testing.
4,"Good printing.good working.But,ink problem.....So,sad...This is good product."
3,"HP Printer is very good, no doubt and a buy at the price. The only problem is the ""loss-leader pricing"" of the replacement cartridges which become uneconomical in the long run..."
1,"I won't recommend this. Hardly it worked, it's not at all taking papers for print. Waste of money."
5,"Nice product. As usual printing cost will be high, though i bought it for scanning purpose. Okay for a4 size paper scanning but can't handle a3 or larger. At 300 dpi b/w scanning takes approx 10 second."
1,"Printer catridge 805 not available anywhere including hp store, without catridge the printer is idle no use.please don't cheat people like this.If the product has no support from its manufacturer please don't list it."
1,"Waste of money. Because I had printed around 75 pages with black and white,by that time ink is totally completed. And i didn't find 805 ink cartridges anywhere. Till now ......."
3,"HP All-In-One Printer price is very attractive but running cost of ink cartridges is very high.Scanning is good quality but can scan only one page at a time & you need a separate file binder software to merge all files in single document.Now coming to cost- (discounts can be available occasionally)Printer HP 2131 costs close to Rs 2,300 (under discount offers)It uses HP 803 Ink cartridge.B/w cartridge costs Rs 702 & colour cartridge costs Rs 836B/w cartridge can print around 60 pages for Rs 702 & colour cartridge can print max 40 pages for Rs 836thus cost of single print is Rs 11 Rs/page (B/W) & 21Rs/Page (Clr)HP's claims for number of pages are under economy mode & under lab test conditions - actual user will get above stated numbersrefill kits are available at half prices of original cartridges but quality of colour prints will be compromised.Thus recommended to purchase only for occasional users with low usage.Not cost effective for regular & heavy users.Please also check my review for HP Deskjet 2135 for cost per printYou can encourage me to write further reviews by hitting YES button :)"
4,Printer is good. Scan and print quality also good. But setup takes more time to understand the product and installation. I did myself and it's working fine. Thank you Amazon for the good product.
1,A very bad product. I can't imagine HP is selling such a part printer wherein the cost of one print out is almost 10 bucks. The ink cartridges are not even able to print 100 pages and cost of cartridge is 1000 bucks so it's cheaper to get print out from the shop then buy this piece of junk.We even went to the HP store to sort out this but they have no clue. ( Or sometime ignorance is bliss)
2,"Fantastic delivery by Amazon. BUT STRANGE, was not in normal Amazon packaging???USB cable faulty, careful study shows a duplicate as no ceramic finish, plus pins are not in line.Installation is done by me using old cable, printer working fine no problems there.WHY IS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO EXCHANGE CABLE ONLY? don't want to return whole product waste time, and had disposed of the original packing.Strongly recomend anyone, not to accept product if not in amazon packing, think this was my problem.however was in hp packing and sealed, but who knows who is responsible? all i need is a cable, price on amazon approx 1500, printer cost approx 3000. ""crazy"""
2,"Good decent printer. But difficult to find replacement cartridges. Made huge mistake by buying this printer. If you doubt me, check in Amazon for HP 805 cartridge. Even HP website don't have them. I can't even return the printer. When cartridge dries up, I can't buy original cartridges. May be have the printer as show piece."
1,"Worst printer. Just to check, gave a print for 50 black and white pages. The original cartridge got over. Original 805 model B&W cartridge would cost you around 800/-. Which means one black and white print will cost you 16/-. U can go to a photo shop and get a print on canvas at this price. Worst printer. I regret as there is no return only replacement. Please don't get cheated."
5,"FIrst of all a big thanks to Amazon for quick delivery (within 2 days). Also thanks to the delivery boy for his behavior and politeness. Really impressed.Now coming to the main topic.  I got HP Deskjet 2131 Printer at just ₹2699 during republic day sale.It is very easy to install the printer alongwith its cartridges. Its looks are superb. Printing quality is also great (I have attached the snapshot of sheet that I printed just!).  The scan feature is just rocking because it works very fast. But the printing quality should be improved.So friends, go for HP Deskjet 2131 printer without any tension."
1,"waste  of the money to buy this printer, the link will just dry within 2 weeks if you are not using it, the new cartridge cost is very high , you buy 2 cartridge at the same cost of printer, the cost of printer ink is more then human blood. better use your own blood for printing it will be much cheaper"
1,Per page is too costly approx 16 to 40 Rupees per page do not recommend for homeIts better print the pages from outside market.Also shared in the Facebook and recommend my friends and colleagues do not purchase this printers .
1,"Defective product, not able to print a single page. Carriage struck in the sides of the printer loudly. Now I have to contact HP service. Very painful process"
5,"Got New and good working Product,if you don't want to buy cartridges you can use ink to refill the cartridges,ink can be found in local stores.ink is 50% cheaper than cartridges and there is a lot of link in the bottles"
1,Don't ever buy this printer...instead go for ink tank ones...although this one is cheaper the ink cartridges will cost you the same amount in which u can buy a new printer again... not worthy from such a big brand HP...they made the printer price less but kept cartridge price the highest among all of its range...simply fooling customers..even cannot use any other cartridge and refilling was also complex.. sometimes works sometimes not :(
1,"Cartridge is very expensive....not recommended to buy this product .Not Cost effective at all ,Priniting from local shop will be cheaper than printing at home"
5,"All in One printer  which will scan,print and copy(Xerox) 👌👌😀I have done 100 printouts in 1 day, still ink level showing full.Photos are printing very nice.Xerox copies also giving good print.Scan we can do using hp smart app downloading in laptop/pc"
1,"I got a second hand product  the product was opened and on side the barcodes were torn and then everything was just rapped with a tapeI always thought when I read review that ""it would not happen to me I will get a good product"" but here we areAlso the main box was opened and over it there was a plastic tape put to show as if it was original seal u can make out with just the packingThe product looked as of the person has been using it and he soled itPlz think about this when u buy this product"
4,"Build quality is great, the design and colour looks great, printing cost is little high as it Is an inkjet printer so if you need a printer like for occasional use like in project time then you should go for it, else go for laser If only blank and white print is needed, else inktank, also keep a track of this printers price, as it keeps going up and down when i ordered it costed me around 3.9k but somedays later it was 3.7k so keep checking if you can wait for like 1 week or more then order from the official hp site, there you'll get it for more reasonable price, also the no external packaging was done or given in this printer which is bad, what if it got damaged during shipping, it would result in the seller losing money and also I'll end up losing my time and maybe money if i found the damage later on like internal or if i don't have a recording of me unboxing it and found it damaged, something like that."
4,Nice product but printing price is very high. Don't buy this product because its ink cost is very high . But in home use it's OK. So one star missing
5,I luv this i really luv the colour print its exactly the same we are about to wonder.... But im very sad when i come to know that the price of ink catridge is too high. Only we can take 100 copies using one catridge its price is nearly 1000rs. Im disappointed
1,Very poor product replacement needed immediately..no parts available & it’s a very of so let product
5,"Printer is good. Printing quality is remarkable. Cons- Ink exhausted very fastly.If you can arrange ink from any shop or online, compromising a slightly degraded quality, its printing would be much cheaper. But if you are bound to buy cartridge every time ink is low, it would definitely become an expensive deal on long run."
1,"Bought this printer on 19.08.20.After printing perfectly almost 10/12 pages , it is not working. Customer care suggests to visit a nearby service centre. If this is the after sales service, then I would definitely never ever opt to buy an headache with a handful of money."
1,"I sincerely regret purchasing this product. .there is a major flaw in design it self. Only from one side paper support is there in the tray. So there is no proper  ""driven in "" for paper into the printer. It is drawn into the printer  from unsupported side it goes on an angle. So print comes as spoiled. I talk to Amazon person they told only replacement is there for this printer ,no money back(may be because HP aware about the flaw in design) , they connect to HP support they told they will arrange a technician that day itself, but no one come for service until now(3 days). I don't know why a reputed company like HP is selling these type of products of no use & keeping their after sales support very bad. When you purchase a printer from HP ,please think twice"
3,Printer cost is low but ink cartridge cost is too high.
1,"Changing my review from good to bad. Because in just 7 months the printer started showing problems . Claiming warranty takes forever which FYI means a customer support executive to just hear your complain with nothing done in real.. The ink leaks . Printer throws out blank papers even after and keeps on automatically restarting. It doesn't even recognize new cartridge. Pathetic printer. DO NOT BUY IT IF ITS FOR DAILY USE. BECAUSE ONCE IT STOPS WORKING IT IS GOING TO SPOIL YOUR DAY, EVERYDAY"
5,Nice printerScanning quality is very goodColor printing is very good
4,I BOUGHT IT RS 2900/- ONLY ....THIS IS VALUE FOR MONEY ...WE CAN PRINT THE DOCUMENT THROUGH MOBILE PHONE ALSO WITH THE HELP OF OTGTO CONNECT THIS PRINTER WITH MOBILE PHONE FIRST WE HAVE TO INSTALL HP SMART PRINTER APP AND HP PRINTER APP FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE THAN WE CAN EASILY PRINT PHOTOS & DOCUMENTS FROM MOBILE PHONE ETC.
3,Product is good for the budget. Unable to get the specified 805 ink cartridges in any online sites including Hp store.Printer is ideal now without the relevant cartridges.
5,"stylish, good product, excellent printing quality and suitable price."
1,Cartridges are very very very little life...🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴Poor productDont buy...I am thinking to make the video..Where I throwing this printer from 5th floor..- 10 star
1,This product is a scam because it’s ink consumption is very high and demands constant change in cartridge and this results in excess expense. I have used this printer for hardly 2 weeks and I have changed the ink cartridge twice already (max 20-25 pages printed)Please don’t get tempered towards the product because of its brand and cheaper price. I hope my reviews helps both the seller and the buyer in their respective ways!!P.S - I look for the seller to contact me and compensate for this fault product.
1,There is No ink available for the product i have been sitting without ink from past 1 week wat is the use of buying such product
4,The scanning resolution is perfect and printing output is also good. The only problem lies with paper input tray. while pulling the paper inside sometimes the paper gets jammed.
3,"I got this one primarily for scanning the old photos and save them in PC. It does it's job. Nothing to complain about scanner. About the printing, good for few prints but really this is not a heavy duty printer. For serious printing and printing too many papers, go for some higher version or a laser jet. This printer is just for scanning and printing few papers and not for heavy use.Print quality: good but not for heavy useScan: Good and it does it's job.Durability: not that good for heavy printing, good for scanning. Body of the maching is not that heavy and not that sturdy.Installing: very easy to install, nothing special engineering really needed."
5,"Lightweight, requires no power outlet, just a Usb connection with a laptop / computer. Automatically powers on when connected and drivers are installed. Most laptops dont have dvd drives but their drivers are easily available online. Everything works as advertised. Picture quality top notch, very accurate colours and high resolution. Will easily take a page or even a book if it’s around A4 size. I use this for scanning sketches and illustrations and it’s much better than even the best of smartphone cameras for capturing details and colours. Best value for money, no complaints."
3,"This scanner is cheaper than Canon LiDe 120 and offers better resolution.  But installing in win10 is a tedious job.  After struggling more than 3 hrs following things I have realized.  1.  Before installing, disable ur antivirus. 2. The accompanying CD has win8 drivers.  U need to connect to net to get win10 drivers.  3. It is not possible to configure all the buttons.  pdf button and copy button are working and others are not working.  4.  Document and text scanning has to be improved.  Colour scanning of photoes is good. 5. I bought this scanner on 10.11.2018.  Received on 14.11.2018 and installed it on 15.11.2018.  When I tried to register for warranty, I got the message that it is beyond the period of warranty registration!!!  I have emailed a complaint to Epson and waiting for the reply.  Previously I was using Canon LiDE120.  In less than 30 minutes I have installed and configured the scanner.  Its document scanning is really good.  The scanning software for Canon LiDE 120 is really easy to use.  Still I have not tried the OCR software came along with Epson scanner."
1,"Installed software through supplied CD but none of the machine buttons worked, though scanner light was on.  Even though Utilities like OCR and Copy utility installed but was not functional. Repeated UNINSTALLING and INSTALLING through the CD or even through Epson India site did not work through USB 2.0 connectivity on Windows 10 platform. Software installation was done as per company's prescribed process. Even company's engineer could not make it work. Left with no option than to return the machine. Seems to be a software compatibility problem. Even Warranty registration reflected expiry in Sept 2018 instead of Feb 2019.  The machine was already registered. It seems some other buyer bought and returned the machine to supplier who in turn re-sold to me. Returned the product. The Courier pick-up guy was not trained to handle a delicate Scanner machine. His handling of machine's packaging was very crude."
2,"EDIT:The scanner stopped working in 1 month, hence downgrading from 5 stars to 2 stars. It seems like it is a common problem. The first piece that I received had this problem, and I had ordered a replacement thinking that it was a one off thing. But after dismantling I realised that the ribbon connectors inside are loose and will easily get displaced a little bit causing the device to stop functioning. Since this is the sort of product that you expect to carry in your bag, the build quality should have been better. I am looking for some other portable scanner now.______I got this as I needed a scanner that was portable and would work directly with my laptop without having to use an additional power supply. I already have a 3-in-1 printer-scanner-copier, and while it's great as a copier it gets seldom used as a scanner. The reason is that the inconvenience of going to the scanner, turning it on and connecting with my laptop is too off-putting to scan a single document. With this, I find myself scanning and archiving more documents than ever because of the great convenience. The scan quality is also much better than that of a normal printer-scanner. The top can come off which means you can put in something thick like a hard book if you wanted to.The first piece of the scanner I received did not turn on. I had to get it replaced. The replacement works fine. So if you purchase this scanner make sure you have the option to get a replacement, and do check that it works before the return period runs out. Get the scanner software from epson.com and not epson.sn - that one doesn't work."
1,May The product I got was not good  enough It took 45 Seconds  to Preview and scan one page .I returned the product back .First time in my life I was not impressed by Japanese Quality
5,"I have used this scanner for scanning documents and photos of various sizes using a PC and Mac, perhaps now about a dozen times. The scanner has been easy to install and use. I used the CD that came with it only in the PC. With the Mac I could use it as soon as I connected it via USB. The results are good and once can choose scan resolution as needed within the limits of the specifications.I like the fact that the scanner itself needn't be plugged in to the wall. This makes it very portable as one can move it around with a laptop with ease. I highly recommend it for home use. I do take a good care of it by keeping it in a drawer away from direct sunlight and dust when not in use. I am hoping that with proper care this scanner will serve well for a long time. Look out for a sale as it goes on deep discount from time to time.I received the scanner in excellent condition from the seller and in a timely manner."
4,"Overall I would really recommend this scanner. I have scanned close to 1000 photos so far and quality is as expected.Pros:1. Better than expected scan quality. Even small photos scanned are good in my 32 inch monitor.2. Photo scan app is really good to use. You can scan multiple photos at once and finally click save to folder.Cons1. If you are scanning old pictures (black and white or polaroid ones), it has little difficulty in identifying the exact picture border due to less color. So try multiple option in professional mode to get better one.2. There is no clear option in Photo scan app once I save all photos. So have to close and reopen again."
4,"This is my 8th Epson V39 Scanner, the first one still worksV39 requires only 1 USB cable for both power and dataV39 run on the same Epson software on Windows.V39 scan cover's hinge cannot take thick books but  idle to scan documents and cheques and papersScan quality is great in both scanners as far as document is concernedScanners come with 4 physical buttons, which when connected to PC, will automatically trigger the Epson Scan app to start, and switch to the button function.Feels a bit fasterV39 use Mini USB Connection but Micro USB or USB 3.1 Connection would give it more power and sturdy design, Also  the Connect sud be in botton to avoid wear and tear"
3,The product was purchased on 7th Aug 2028. On receiving the product it was realised the product has limitations on warranty based on shipping date from manufacturer and not based on purchase date by customer.  Finally when I checked the product warranty on aprons website it show the warranty remaining on product was just 7 months... it is always better to buy products in shops than online.
5,"This scanner is perfect for my watercolor illustrations that I scan & turn into cards or tags for printing. I scan at 800dpi & get a perfect quality print on card paper. The quality is as good as the scans I used to get from an industry size professional scanner at the card printer store. I am very happy for the value for money as I no longer have to make a trip to the scanner store every scan & while having this machine the house, it does not take up space. I use it everyday & out is lightweight enough for me to pack up & unpack on a daily basis."
5,"Good Scanner,easy to Use, portable and it is value for money. it can Scan Color as well as Black and White and Only A4 size and Below and it cannot Scan A3 Size Paper.Note : While Scanning always allow the Scan to get complete before you Click on any Tab from Software or else the scanning image will get Corrupted and if it happens then Simply disconnect the Scanner then Scan a New Page will lower DPI & then you can raise the DPI again & continue to Scan.Always allow the Noise from the Scanner to get Completely Stopped First while Scanning any Current page OR  New page."
5,"Reviewing 2 years after purchase. This has a load of features, works on Linux, Mac and Windows.I found that Multi-function Printer + scanner often broke down, so went in for a Laser Printer + Scanner. This is a great purchase. I scan 10-20 documents every week at the minimum and no troubles so far."
5,"This plug-and-play device makes scanning a cakewalk. I've used it (off and on) for more than a year and it has never failed me. It's great for scanning small pics into much larger versions, with all details visible. I use it in conjunction with Photoshop, so performance is seamless."
2,Everything was good ..even the scanned photo and document was very good. Only problem was that i have received the defective one and was already used by others because when i was trying it to register it for warranty it was showing already registered and just 6 months left for warranty
1,Broken product
3,I am very happy - all 35 pages pdf  size18mb and Great picture quality.Easy connection and installation.It is good light weight and bad was packing.
5,1. Plug scanner to computer via usb cable. Hence no other power source required.2. The CD does a neat job of installing all the latest driver when connected to the net.3. The 1 page manual provides an easy setup.4. The auto scan when used is quite quick and does a decent job5. Scanner is quite light weight.
1,"This Scanner is waste of buying. I brought this product a year back. While buying this scanner, it gave me good scanning experience. But after just a month later, the scanner connectivity bus got struck up. I took the scanner to Epson service center (The nearby service center is 250 kms far from my locality). They took 3 weeks of time to sort out the issue. Even after servicing, within 15 days again its got struck up & i got irritated & raised concern to Epson team. That also helpless. Please dont buy think to buy scanner."
4,When the document or photo is placed on the glass in the direction of the hinge of the flap cover it gets scanned upside down. Therefore I keep the item to be scanned 'upside down' so it gets scanned 'upside up'
5,"This is an excellant product. The software that accompanied in CD is excellent. I tried only full auto mode scanning. It has few other modes like Home, Office, Professional etc. For me the full auto-mode is enough and it scans efficiently. There is no separate power cord and its nice and simple with just USB cable. I love this product."
4,Light and easy to setup and use... Just plug into USB and you're set... I love the photostitch feature... I was able to scan a newspaper size poster without much effort... Good documentation and instructions. Good buy!! Hoping it will endure...
5,I received the scanner early in the morning on Jan 18 (ahead of the 8pm deadline) :)The product works as advertised and gives crisp clear scans. It was especially useful with it's portability as I was able to get copies of certain documents firsthand from originals (instead of photocopies) as this works off the USB port and I carried a laptop along.No issues observed with the product and am satisfied with the purchase!
4,Pros: scanner is fine you can scan as many pages as you can( i scanned at a stretch 150 pages). you can even merge scanned pages.Cons: i cant find any button to crop pages. you have to scan total page
5,Received exactly in 24 hrs after purchase. Packing needs improvement. But scanner was in good condition. Installation is very easy. I could install software smoothly without any error on my win10 OS and Mac 10.13 OS. Performance of scanner is nice as of now.
3,"After first three to five copies, the print quality of the scanned files do not happy me up to my expectations. 4800*4800 dpi !"
4,"It is easy to install and easy to use. Good for small business/home if you need only scanner. Workong great for me after 4months. However, if your budget permits, go for Ink Tank MFPs."
1,I have a HP i7 laptop with Windows 10 Pro. I could neither install the software from the CD or Net. The V39 also refused to power on. I requested a replacement. Same problem. Clearly Epson is palming off obselete products. I am very disappointed.
5,writing this review after being used this scanner for 3 weeks now. as the name says this is by far the best and easy to use scanner in this proce range. photo scan quality is realky amazing!!! very much satisfied. scanning speed of documents and photos is impressive.
5,"Will not work with Linux. no matter what you do. I believe latest LED drivers to blame,However this works fantastic in Windows."
3,It's light Weight but build quality isn't satisfying... The packaging was bad and when I tried registering for warranty it says date expired but I does the scanning part pretty well
4,"Some driver issues with the latest Windows 10 update, but that can be rectified. Otherwise awesome product and trusted brand."
1,Don't buy this product. I bought this scanner for office use past 1 yr been using this. But this scanner automatically gets undetected from Windows 10 computer after 5 min of connecting. Not able to identify the problem till date.
5,Good quality scanned image and easy to cary light weight and no need adaptors only need usb cable and comfortable with my 15inch laptop bag...
5,Wonderful scanner but showing error from 2400dpiUpto 1200 dpi scan clarity is good
1,Company service is third class and total waste of money
5,Honest review would be very much satisfied with the product. Does all what it is for. Impressed. Scanning quality superb. Good for both office and home work. :)
5,"As far as the name Epson is concerned, no need to worry about their Product Lines.  Good scanner at an affordable rate."
4,This device does exactly what it has to do very well. Picture quality is great. Its really easy to use. I didn't know about Epson printer or scanner as what I heard mostly were HP and Canon but this product changed my opinion about that. Just go for it.
5,Very good product. No need to say anything. Go for it!!!
2,I received and setting up the scanner...but can't register the product even after filling correct details in epson registration page..
1,"Mac users beware! It doesn’t work on Mac and You cannot return this product. Although the description says eligibile to return within 10 days, Amazon just won’t accept a return. 1 star for not mentioning in the description that THIS PRINTER DOES NOT WORK ON MACUpdate: Brought up my old windows desktop and tested the printer. Prints came good but it has roller (continuous dot) marks when printed on glossy paper (see the attached image). Contacted Amazon and they replaced it. The new one again has the same problem! So, look like the issue is with the printer model/batch."
1,the Cyan ink bottle is only half in quantity I contacted cannon for this but there is no response from them this is a cheating of some kind.
5,I bought this printer for 7603/- Only With Extra 2 year OnSiteGO Warranty. I am using this printer for around 5 days and here it is my experience.The Look of this printer is very good.it comes with 2 Extra Bottle of Black Color. Installation of this printer is so easy follow the manual or call for support it takes around 10-15 min for Ready The Printer for work.Print Quality is very Good.Printing Speed is very good. For 1st Print it take 30-40 sec time but then it take around 10 sec for BW print and 30-40 sec (Based on your content) for COLOR print.Pros--Cost of printer is very less as compared to other ink tank printers.-Cost Per Page is less around 8-20 paisa per page.-Printing Speed is very Good (8-10sec for BW/10-20sec for COLOR)-Cleaning and manianting is easy-Borderless printing is avilable-Document Scan with MAX 600DPICons--SOme time it make NOISEOverall this product is very good : )
5,"Model: Canon pixma G2012.First of all, abt the printer: Its best at it's price segment .I got it for 8k...well it's orginal price was 11.5k.Along the box you get 3colour ink bottles, n 2+1 blk ink bottle, power cord, connector to pc cable, user guide, warranty card, install soft cd.Note: Canon Pixma G2010 n G2012 are same (only you get 2extra blk ink bottles in G2012)Pros:1)Canon colour prints are always best than it's competitors like epson n brothers printer.2) It's very durable n having less paper jam.3) print output is vast you can use the printer for abt 6months without refilling if you are using regularly also.Cons: (these are not actually problems or negative sides, rather these are customer points of valuation)1) bigger in size than other segment canon inkjet printers.2) print speed is 10pages/min, so it you want more faster prints then go for laser printers not inkjet ones.3) the supplier company doesnot provide extra package over the original printer box, (although canon company's package is quite enough).Apart from printer i wld like to mention the size of box is large n weights 10kg around (with printer itself 6.4kg). So you can guess it's bigger one but portable, thus shipping is done by surface shipment(means it comes by delivery truck) so it takes some time to arrive n be patient to wait.As air shipment doesn't assure the product to be received undamaged so amazon prefers to ship via surface shipment to assure it reaches customer end safely."
4,"This is a very economical and user friendly product.1) Ink Tank is integrated and filling ink is very convenient.2) Can make quick copies and operation is very easy. Can directly  take a color photocopy also...3) Saves a lot compared to Ink Catridge printers.4)Most importantly it works on Office/Home  Battery back up system, (remember  Laser printers require higher power and often don't work on UPS systems.)5) Cost per page is low.6) Scan quality is good.7) Allows manual duplex printing.Cons1) PC Hangs during high resolution scanning......2) Paper feeder on top , so cant leave the paper in the tray always (you can't close the protective flap when paper is in the feeder).3. Paper falls down after printing , if the paper holding tray is not pulled out.4. Not for professional, heavy use...."
1,Not working properly paper jam print quality low color print not proper mix colors print
1,This product isn't compatible with Mac OSX. Confirmed by Canon India. The older model G2000 is compatible with Mac OSX. Strange that the newer model isn't supported. Product video is misleading.
5,"Print quality is good.. i tested color printing on both A4 and 6*4 Photo glossy paper it is good i will rate 4 out of 5..you will get 3 bottles of Black ink, 1 Yellow, 1 Cyan, 1 Magenta.I strongly recommend you guys watch Canon Pixma G2000 series Installation videos on youtube. there are few complex steps while getting it to run correctly...."
3,"The item delivered at night.  Invoice provided with (downloaded) has no mention of product serial number.  For availing warranty, service centre matches product serial number printed on product with that of the product serial number mentioned in the invoice.  I requested invoice with product serial no.  but not provided till date."
1,For black and white printing this printer is good but color printing is really worst and not worth for color printing...no return policy makes buyers very difficult as this product really un-realible
5,"Reading all the mixed reviews I wasn't sure if I made the right choice. But now I can say that I was right. Packaging was good, installation was easy, took hardly 30min for the complete process and the prints are awesome. BW prints are crisp and clear, color reproduction is amazing. I have attached an image printed on normal paper at high quality. This image is blurry as my mobile camera is not good but the original image is a lot better. Scanned color image is almost similar to the original. Only issue is that the USB and the power cord are a short. And the best part is that I got it for less than 7,500 during Amazon prime sale under lightning deal and HDFC bank offer."
5,"Awesome print, standard color xerox has turned out to be so good and crisp with colours and details. Amazing product. Check out the picture. One on the left is colour copy and right one is magazine."
2,"I purchased canon pixma G2012 printer through online which is received on 30/06/2019 Sunday in good condition. But I am failed to install the printer to my windows 7 computer.  Because I think the installer CD drive was not sent for the machine, but it was for G2010/G22110/G2210/G2410/G2510/G2610/G2810/ & G2910. Photo of the CD is added. Now in this condition I wish to get your help and suggestion about easy installation of the machine to my windows 7 computer so that I can install and run it smoothly. I am a regular customer of amazon. When I insert the installer disk in my decktop com. and click on MsetUp4. exe it shows that 'this program can't be used with the current operating systems.Thanking youMatilal Debbarma, customer."
5,"Go for it ,No doubt bestI was shocked that people and shopping sites were giving very less feedback for this cannon product. Some people are following crowds , crowds are going for Epson then all following instead of applying their brain.I purchased it at price of 7199 after 10% cash back discount &and at this range no one can compared it with other . I am using it from 2mnth without any problem.Print quality =superColor/Black print= superScanning= superThe main advantage of this printer is that it compact Design you love it , it's ink tank was inside the printer so you can move printer easily without any disturbance."
5,"Works decently (using for 6 months or so). I'm down 2 bundles of printer paper already but the ink is more than 3/4 full even now. Of prints ~97% greyscale (B&W)(70% draft quality and 30% good quality print), 3% colour (varying qualities on printer paper). Not the most portable - because the ink tank printers are meant more for economy than portability - need to ensure every tank is locked down before moving to prevent ink spills. Had a few papers stuck up with cheap 65gsm paper. But no problems with standard 70gsm and above (most of what you get in shops.)Scanning works well too. Canon software works well for all basic purposes( that's as much as i need).All in all, i think, this is the cheapest home printing technology that you can get right now. I printed a bundle of paper in a day as i found its effectively cheaper than getting it all photocopied and definitely much cheaper than getting it printed in a dtp center. And canon functions well.Only thing I would have liked to have is wireless connectivity (could have got a higher model for a little more)."
2,Initially the printer was amazing purchased in October 2018 but now i.e. around July end i started faceing issues of paper jamming and then the color head of the printer is damaged according to me and i am unable to find any color head for this printer online even when i found one it costs 3.5k with many negative reviews. I would soon be calling canon customer care and then update the review. I wish they give some discounts regarding it's still in warranty period.
5,"The printer is very good. Easy to install and look wise is also very good. The print quality is very good; I do not understand why some people have said it is bad. It is very important that the manual is read while the installation is done though it is very easy, it is highly recommended to read the manual.Over all the printer is very good, works very nice, and quality of printout is excellent."
5,"The printer is very good and u will get 3 blank ink with box and one set of 3 colors, very easy to install and use the ink tank is inside printer which takes less space compared to HP where ink tank is outside"
1,print quality is worst... it gives zigzag printing... canon and amazon said that this is not fault. not considering it even issue...
1,It's a waste printer as before we learn printing one page we would have eventually wasted all the color ink. It's sprays the ink internally without a paper thus wasting the ink. Quite difficult to understand and adapt the behavior of the printer.
1,Product name is Canon Pixma g2012. And kit including warranty card is of Canon Pixma g 2010. Cross checked with Canon India. They refused to provide any service in warranty. Even serial number is also not matched to any of Canon product.
5,"Bought for home use, which could be an overkill!, but cost wise better than cartridge ones.Comes with 3 black ink bottles, which is a big plus.Easy to install on own, taking care when filling ink - and better opening one bottle at a time.Worked well with Linux , not needing any driver etc.At tank filling, and initialization, levels in drop by 15% for black ink, around 20% for colors, since some ink will get filled in tubes. No ink levels seen in Printer settings, obvious as its manual check, though it has low ink detection.Regular prints come out fine. Photo printing (on 150gsm) comes ok with no streaking, except for roller lines which etch onto the page but not noticeable from a distance. Photo printing would need some calibration wrt to Monitor & print color. Better to use either canon supplied software or other photo suite.Scanning utility interface (IJ Scan) is not that friendly with multiple dialogs coming up rather than managed it in a single app window.On Linux not yet gotten scan to work successfully."
5,"Good product overall. The only drawback I felt was the paper feeder. In this printer, the paper feeder is at the back of the printer. Because of this the paper feeder is open all the time and there are chances for dust to accumulate."
3,Writing review after using it for 2 years.Print quality is fineSpeed is a bit slowColours are perfectMajor drawbackDoesn't support mobile printing...which seems to be marketing strategy as it has usb...some software print using mobile seen it on youtube but it's disheartening that CANON cheated on this part as they excluded this model from their app of mobile printing...other brands of this range support this feature as its very basic one just need to update  software for it.But after repeated requests they denied that its not capable but I have seen a shop owner doing that perfectly using third party software...SO CANON IS AT FAULT THEY SEEM TO DELIBERATELY MAKING INCONVENIENCE FOR PEOPLE SO THAT THEY WILL GO FOR HEIGHER MODEL
5,"Hi Have reviewed multiple feedback and then placed my order and when i received the product, I was happy to see the performance.Quality is GoodPrinting time is also perfect and Black & White print is really fast with excellent quality.The most important part that I observed, is it through errors in details like : You did not power off properly and switched off directly from Plug, Paper Jammed, print quality change etc. I liked the printer, and would suggest people that opting this printer is not a loss.I know in this model Wifi is not available but happy to take a bit effort to print through USB as at this cost I cannot expect Wifi.....Thanks a I hope this review would help you to decide."
3,"Pros: Multifuntional, i.e. print-scan-copy or all in one printing machine, Low printing cost, good print quality.Cons: Ink blockage in pipeline if printer not used for few days and flushing is d only solution for recovery, and a huge amount of ink wastage/draining will be there for d flushing operation.Very much noise during paper intake.Sometimes paper jamming hazard.Power cable and usb cable orientation is improper and length is short.Verdict: Over all performance is better than other printers in d same price range and hence can be bought."
1,"Very much dissappointed with the performance os the printer. I installed it as per the guide book but lot of noise is coming and the printer is not responding at all. All sounds like kat kat kat is continuously coming and the error shows E03, sometimes E02, P02 etc etc. I specially ordered it for my 4years daughter so that she could have her exams smoothly during this lockdown period. But now I have no choice but just to wait for the replacement. I dont know when the replacement will be made but one thing is sure that CANNON cannot compensate the loss which my daughter will face because of the non availability of the printer. Very very sad experience."
5,"I had great confusion between Canon and Brother. Finally bought this Canon G2012Reviewing after using 3 weeks.1. The printer is Canon G2010 as model when connected. The only difference they added is there is a LCD display and copy + button. Else is same. But LCD is useful to know status. There are two blacks ink additionally in the box...which will face our black prints throughout years.2. Print Quality is awesome. You can expect a photo print quality when used glossy sheet (attached yellow poster).3. Normal sheet printing aslo great. (Attached vintage poster).4. Speed is as followsAn A4 borderless color printed at maximum of 40-60 seconds.An A4 document printed at 5-10 secondsAn A4 xerox at 2-10 Seconds.Speed varies based on colours used5. Connectivity - Laptop connectivity is good.. Use can also print from Android using OTG. (Nokoprint app recommended).6. Scanning - Quality is great... You can scan and print which looks like printout. We can also scan and store it as pdf.7. Canon software - There are A-Z printing functions available in the app... Only thing is the app is slow. There are options to print borderless, collage, passport size maxi, calendar, visiting card, pamplets.8. Overall you can go G2012 if you need multi-purpose printing. Scanning - Xerox - Print - Borderless - Mobile print.Highly recommended if you are more creative."
3,"it started making noises from paper feeder after 4 days of normal use, even with silent mode.color ink also makes good quality paper wet and deformed shape.i am okay with this just for using to print papers for reading offline. it may not suit to others for regular home use.it is also very bulky and heavy than shown in.pictures.i highly doubt the published pages per ink bottle. the color ink seems going away quickly."
5,"my usage is very less maximum 50 pages per month. its still running good quality of printing is great. black ink capacity is higher than epson, HP. two black ink bottles are bundled with this printer scanning is also very good. only problem after ink filled move this printer or when relocating take this printer very carefully to avoid ink spillage."
3,"PROBLEMS IN THIS PRINTER :-IF you use TNPL paper , the paper would get jam very often. Printer is a bit noisy too.The cartridge placing area and when you loadand lock the cartridge it automatically unlocks and black cartridge which result in paper jam and ink loss. If you do ink flush to fill the pipe with ink in case of removing and re inserting cartridge it would consume 30-40% of your ink within each ink flush .ROLLER JAM is a common issuePAPER LOADER JAM is another issueerrors that i received are E02, E03 , E04 etc. This is my replacement product for first G2012 .It is solely for WINDOWS No good ink tank printers in this price range other than hp 310 but their services are bad but Canon i think its better but I'm not sure . If budget is around 8300₹ there is no other options available than hp 310 and Pixma G2012 . Overall its a great choice for Students and Office work . Print speeds are slow but decent"
5,"Value for money product. Easy to use , ideal for sharpen high dpi photo printing... Always use genuine Canon ink to get accurate colour of photo printing...Very good quality scanner... At xerox time , if we print 2 or more copies of one document,1st page print needs some time but other pages other pages print quickly...3-4 A4 b&w pages/min & 2 A4 colour pages/min ; 1 4/6 inch borderless photo print with high resolution in a minute....It's don't have OCR & AI to clear background colour of documents & auto straight document facilities... Also, it has no wireless printing.... It has an advantage, to print on inverter during power cut...G2012 has no facilities to print from mobile & on internet , only usb printing is supported on windows (Mac not supported)...Overall , it justify it's price..."
4,"I loved print quality, I bought it mainly for my kid as we had to take print of his assignments and then scan them back in to laptop and send them to teachers, thans to corona :). Print is  very good, even color pring is very good, not too concentrated, just right amount of color is used by printer. I wish it had WIFI. Just because WIFI is missing I have to take my laptop and connect it with USB and then print scan what ever.  Well we can live with it though, not a big deal, but WIFI could have made things much flexible. Overall product is excellent and it wont disappoint you. Remember : No WIFI."
3,"After using it for more than 1 year, this is the update on the review:If you are not using atleast once per week, don't think about buying this printer. The ink gets dried inside the head and you need to do deep clean and refill the head with ink to mkae this work.During the lockdown period, when the printer was not used for just over 1 month, even after all kinds of cleaning and ink filling it did not worked for majenta ink color. Half the tank of ink hit consumed, but no improvement was seen.Had to take the head out and using the instructions on you tube clean the head. This and manual refill of the head got it working back.Now after the school holidays I have to do the same thing again as again the printer has stopped printing properly after being unused for 3 weeks.Old Review:Migrating from another Canon MP all in one printer with excellent photo printing capabilities with a high cartridge price to a ink tank printer these are my key observationsPros:>Very low print cost>quite fast at draft qualityCons:>Pictures are washed out and lacks colour depth like earlier canon printer (in both normal paper and coated photo paper)>install is not easy unless you use the video guides and are handy with computers and printers>Software is not as user friendly as it used to be"
5,I am using this printer for around 45 days on windows and here it is my experience.The Look of this printer is very good.it comes with 2 Extra Bottle of Black Color. Installation of this printer is so easy follow the manual it takes around 10-15 min for Ready the Printer for work.Print Quality is very Good. Printing Speed is very good. For 1st Print it take 30-40 sec time but then it take around 10 sec for BW print and 30-40 sec (Based on content) for COLOR print.Pros--Cost of printer is very less as compared to other ink tank printers.-very low ink consumption.-Printing Speed is very Good (8-10sec for BW/10-20sec for COLOR)-Cleaning and manianting is easy-Borderless printing is avilable-Document Scan with MAX 600DPICons--Some time it makes NOISE-Some time paper jam at colour printing on 75-80gsm normal paperOverall this product is very good
4,"Model: Canon Pixma G2012.I got it for 8635/-. This is a good printer at this price range.Pros:1. Fairly good print speed2. Two additional black ink bottles3. It produces high quality prints compared to many other brands I have used4. Original product from Vietnam, managed to register online easily for warrantyCons:1. Driver for G2012 seems to be not available. But I have used G2010 driver as it is compatible with this printer.2. Noise, noise, noise. What the hell is this Canon? This is the noisiest printer have I ever used. Those who like train's running sound will surely enjoy it.3. Borderless printing is not up to the mark. Borderless print is supported well on some types of papers. But it doesn't support well on normal paper and executive bond sheets. Therefore, those who want to use it for letter head printing might face some issue. Canon has to learn more about borderless printing from BROTHER printing company.4. Printer software is not up to the mark. I have used printers from multiple brands including Brother, Epson, Samsung, HP etc. I would say this is one of the worst have I ever come across. Software has to be more user friendly, with more features. In my experience BROTHER has better software.I will be updating this review after using for another 3 months. Anyway, irrespective of the flaws, considering the price and the print quality I would rate 4 Star for this machine."
5,"It is a multifunction printer it means you can use this for print, scan and copy (black and colour both)Print quality is goodEasy to install, just download drivers from Canon website or install from CD (included in box)I am attaching some photos and video of printerBox Contents : 1 printer1 bottle of cyan, magenta, yellow (for colour printing)3 bottles of black ink (you will get 2 bottles for FREE) :D1 User ManualAnd 1 CD for drivers (you can easily install drivers from Canon website if you don't have cd drive)I installed mine from their website.As I mentioned earlier you will get 2 bottles of black ink for FREE FREE FREECost of printing : As mentioned on boxBlack and white print - 9 paise per pageColour print - 21 paise per pageYou can print approx 5000 pages from 1 bottle of black inkAnd approx 4000 pages from bottles of colour ink (cyan, magenta, yellow) combine.Hope my review will help you.."
4,"One of the best and economical printers in the range. Has superb durability, I did 1500 pages in one go (colour n Black white mixed). No issues faced. The no. of pages that can be printed per cartridge is not as mentioned in the description. I used up 50% of the B/W cartridge for around 1200-1300 pages in one go.Colour printing is slow but can be managed. Will give best colour printing results on photographic paper ( even better than laser printer).Best suitable for small office n home setup.. heavy duty n easy to use."
5,"Canon Pixma G2012 wa delivered in one day, thanks Amazon for same.  Two additional black ink bottles provided in box. This adds to value of printer.InstalltionInstall instructions are clear. The booklet with printer has detailed instructions. There is also video available for installation steps. Steps are easy but it helps if you have some experience of working with electronic equipments. Be careful while putting print heads and filling up ink tanks.SetupWith Windows 10 there is no need to install drivers separately. Connect PC/laptop with provided USB cable and operating system will setup printer.Size and weightThe printer is larger than average home inkjet printer. You need to keep is horizontal while moving as it has fluid ink.Print QualityColor print quality is good. The print speed is also good. I printed couple of color prints and colors were pleasing. I need to check scanning and photo copy. That I will update after trying both functions."
5,"Value for money. Print quality is good.There is option for selecting couple of printing resolutions.Very helpful for printing my kids project work and other urgent documents.The scanner and copier options are also very helpful.I have stopped running around cyber cafes and photocopy shops as I am doing printing, scanning and copying in the comfort of my home.I am using it on my windows laptop. Wish I could have used it on my other Mac book air laptop too.May be Canon should include this option too in this model."
4,I was looking for scanner and printer for home usage (for occasional printing). I decided the hp 2131 which was coasting around 3100 but shortly it became out of stock. So I went for this one and it costed me 3300 on freedom sale.Prints are clear and also the scanning quality is good I scanned my brother's college id card it was clear . Speed is also good and it is quite lightI will post full review after more testing.
4,"Good printing.good working.But,ink problem.....So,sad...This is good product."
3,"HP Printer is very good, no doubt and a buy at the price. The only problem is the ""loss-leader pricing"" of the replacement cartridges which become uneconomical in the long run..."
1,"I won't recommend this. Hardly it worked, it's not at all taking papers for print. Waste of money."
5,"Nice product. As usual printing cost will be high, though i bought it for scanning purpose. Okay for a4 size paper scanning but can't handle a3 or larger. At 300 dpi b/w scanning takes approx 10 second."
1,"Printer catridge 805 not available anywhere including hp store, without catridge the printer is idle no use.please don't cheat people like this.If the product has no support from its manufacturer please don't list it."
1,"Waste of money. Because I had printed around 75 pages with black and white,by that time ink is totally completed. And i didn't find 805 ink cartridges anywhere. Till now ......."
3,"HP All-In-One Printer price is very attractive but running cost of ink cartridges is very high.Scanning is good quality but can scan only one page at a time & you need a separate file binder software to merge all files in single document.Now coming to cost- (discounts can be available occasionally)Printer HP 2131 costs close to Rs 2,300 (under discount offers)It uses HP 803 Ink cartridge.B/w cartridge costs Rs 702 & colour cartridge costs Rs 836B/w cartridge can print around 60 pages for Rs 702 & colour cartridge can print max 40 pages for Rs 836thus cost of single print is Rs 11 Rs/page (B/W) & 21Rs/Page (Clr)HP's claims for number of pages are under economy mode & under lab test conditions - actual user will get above stated numbersrefill kits are available at half prices of original cartridges but quality of colour prints will be compromised.Thus recommended to purchase only for occasional users with low usage.Not cost effective for regular & heavy users.Please also check my review for HP Deskjet 2135 for cost per printYou can encourage me to write further reviews by hitting YES button :)"
4,Printer is good. Scan and print quality also good. But setup takes more time to understand the product and installation. I did myself and it's working fine. Thank you Amazon for the good product.
1,A very bad product. I can't imagine HP is selling such a part printer wherein the cost of one print out is almost 10 bucks. The ink cartridges are not even able to print 100 pages and cost of cartridge is 1000 bucks so it's cheaper to get print out from the shop then buy this piece of junk.We even went to the HP store to sort out this but they have no clue. ( Or sometime ignorance is bliss)
2,"Fantastic delivery by Amazon. BUT STRANGE, was not in normal Amazon packaging???USB cable faulty, careful study shows a duplicate as no ceramic finish, plus pins are not in line.Installation is done by me using old cable, printer working fine no problems there.WHY IS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO EXCHANGE CABLE ONLY? don't want to return whole product waste time, and had disposed of the original packing.Strongly recomend anyone, not to accept product if not in amazon packing, think this was my problem.however was in hp packing and sealed, but who knows who is responsible? all i need is a cable, price on amazon approx 1500, printer cost approx 3000. ""crazy"""
2,"Good decent printer. But difficult to find replacement cartridges. Made huge mistake by buying this printer. If you doubt me, check in Amazon for HP 805 cartridge. Even HP website don't have them. I can't even return the printer. When cartridge dries up, I can't buy original cartridges. May be have the printer as show piece."
1,"Worst printer. Just to check, gave a print for 50 black and white pages. The original cartridge got over. Original 805 model B&W cartridge would cost you around 800/-. Which means one black and white print will cost you 16/-. U can go to a photo shop and get a print on canvas at this price. Worst printer. I regret as there is no return only replacement. Please don't get cheated."
5,"FIrst of all a big thanks to Amazon for quick delivery (within 2 days). Also thanks to the delivery boy for his behavior and politeness. Really impressed.Now coming to the main topic.  I got HP Deskjet 2131 Printer at just ₹2699 during republic day sale.It is very easy to install the printer alongwith its cartridges. Its looks are superb. Printing quality is also great (I have attached the snapshot of sheet that I printed just!).  The scan feature is just rocking because it works very fast. But the printing quality should be improved.So friends, go for HP Deskjet 2131 printer without any tension."
1,"waste  of the money to buy this printer, the link will just dry within 2 weeks if you are not using it, the new cartridge cost is very high , you buy 2 cartridge at the same cost of printer, the cost of printer ink is more then human blood. better use your own blood for printing it will be much cheaper"
1,Per page is too costly approx 16 to 40 Rupees per page do not recommend for homeIts better print the pages from outside market.Also shared in the Facebook and recommend my friends and colleagues do not purchase this printers .
1,"Defective product, not able to print a single page. Carriage struck in the sides of the printer loudly. Now I have to contact HP service. Very painful process"
5,"Got New and good working Product,if you don't want to buy cartridges you can use ink to refill the cartridges,ink can be found in local stores.ink is 50% cheaper than cartridges and there is a lot of link in the bottles"
1,Don't ever buy this printer...instead go for ink tank ones...although this one is cheaper the ink cartridges will cost you the same amount in which u can buy a new printer again... not worthy from such a big brand HP...they made the printer price less but kept cartridge price the highest among all of its range...simply fooling customers..even cannot use any other cartridge and refilling was also complex.. sometimes works sometimes not :(
1,"Cartridge is very expensive....not recommended to buy this product .Not Cost effective at all ,Priniting from local shop will be cheaper than printing at home"
5,"All in One printer  which will scan,print and copy(Xerox) 👌👌😀I have done 100 printouts in 1 day, still ink level showing full.Photos are printing very nice.Xerox copies also giving good print.Scan we can do using hp smart app downloading in laptop/pc"
1,"I got a second hand product  the product was opened and on side the barcodes were torn and then everything was just rapped with a tapeI always thought when I read review that ""it would not happen to me I will get a good product"" but here we areAlso the main box was opened and over it there was a plastic tape put to show as if it was original seal u can make out with just the packingThe product looked as of the person has been using it and he soled itPlz think about this when u buy this product"
4,"Build quality is great, the design and colour looks great, printing cost is little high as it Is an inkjet printer so if you need a printer like for occasional use like in project time then you should go for it, else go for laser If only blank and white print is needed, else inktank, also keep a track of this printers price, as it keeps going up and down when i ordered it costed me around 3.9k but somedays later it was 3.7k so keep checking if you can wait for like 1 week or more then order from the official hp site, there you'll get it for more reasonable price, also the no external packaging was done or given in this printer which is bad, what if it got damaged during shipping, it would result in the seller losing money and also I'll end up losing my time and maybe money if i found the damage later on like internal or if i don't have a recording of me unboxing it and found it damaged, something like that."
4,Nice product but printing price is very high. Don't buy this product because its ink cost is very high . But in home use it's OK. So one star missing
5,I luv this i really luv the colour print its exactly the same we are about to wonder.... But im very sad when i come to know that the price of ink catridge is too high. Only we can take 100 copies using one catridge its price is nearly 1000rs. Im disappointed
1,Very poor product replacement needed immediately..no parts available & it’s a very of so let product
5,"Printer is good. Printing quality is remarkable. Cons- Ink exhausted very fastly.If you can arrange ink from any shop or online, compromising a slightly degraded quality, its printing would be much cheaper. But if you are bound to buy cartridge every time ink is low, it would definitely become an expensive deal on long run."
1,"Bought this printer on 19.08.20.After printing perfectly almost 10/12 pages , it is not working. Customer care suggests to visit a nearby service centre. If this is the after sales service, then I would definitely never ever opt to buy an headache with a handful of money."
1,"I sincerely regret purchasing this product. .there is a major flaw in design it self. Only from one side paper support is there in the tray. So there is no proper  ""driven in "" for paper into the printer. It is drawn into the printer  from unsupported side it goes on an angle. So print comes as spoiled. I talk to Amazon person they told only replacement is there for this printer ,no money back(may be because HP aware about the flaw in design) , they connect to HP support they told they will arrange a technician that day itself, but no one come for service until now(3 days). I don't know why a reputed company like HP is selling these type of products of no use & keeping their after sales support very bad. When you purchase a printer from HP ,please think twice"
3,Printer cost is low but ink cartridge cost is too high.
1,"Changing my review from good to bad. Because in just 7 months the printer started showing problems . Claiming warranty takes forever which FYI means a customer support executive to just hear your complain with nothing done in real.. The ink leaks . Printer throws out blank papers even after and keeps on automatically restarting. It doesn't even recognize new cartridge. Pathetic printer. DO NOT BUY IT IF ITS FOR DAILY USE. BECAUSE ONCE IT STOPS WORKING IT IS GOING TO SPOIL YOUR DAY, EVERYDAY"
5,Nice printerScanning quality is very goodColor printing is very good
4,I BOUGHT IT RS 2900/- ONLY ....THIS IS VALUE FOR MONEY ...WE CAN PRINT THE DOCUMENT THROUGH MOBILE PHONE ALSO WITH THE HELP OF OTGTO CONNECT THIS PRINTER WITH MOBILE PHONE FIRST WE HAVE TO INSTALL HP SMART PRINTER APP AND HP PRINTER APP FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE THAN WE CAN EASILY PRINT PHOTOS & DOCUMENTS FROM MOBILE PHONE ETC.
3,Product is good for the budget. Unable to get the specified 805 ink cartridges in any online sites including Hp store.Printer is ideal now without the relevant cartridges.
5,"stylish, good product, excellent printing quality and suitable price."
1,Cartridges are very very very little life...🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴Poor productDont buy...I am thinking to make the video..Where I throwing this printer from 5th floor..- 10 star
1,This product is a scam because it’s ink consumption is very high and demands constant change in cartridge and this results in excess expense. I have used this printer for hardly 2 weeks and I have changed the ink cartridge twice already (max 20-25 pages printed)Please don’t get tempered towards the product because of its brand and cheaper price. I hope my reviews helps both the seller and the buyer in their respective ways!!P.S - I look for the seller to contact me and compensate for this fault product.
1,There is No ink available for the product i have been sitting without ink from past 1 week wat is the use of buying such product
4,The scanning resolution is perfect and printing output is also good. The only problem lies with paper input tray. while pulling the paper inside sometimes the paper gets jammed.
3,"I got this one primarily for scanning the old photos and save them in PC. It does it's job. Nothing to complain about scanner. About the printing, good for few prints but really this is not a heavy duty printer. For serious printing and printing too many papers, go for some higher version or a laser jet. This printer is just for scanning and printing few papers and not for heavy use.Print quality: good but not for heavy useScan: Good and it does it's job.Durability: not that good for heavy printing, good for scanning. Body of the maching is not that heavy and not that sturdy.Installing: very easy to install, nothing special engineering really needed."
1,Today received package.. Setup done correctly.. but not single page came out printed.Printer unable to print pages ....blank pages comes out of tray every time !!!!Pls suggest any setting or thing need to done with initial setup which I might not done yet...OR is it defective piece ???
1,"This device is having a severe issue while connecting to Apple devices, namely apple iMac, Macbook Air.Its an issue with drivers as drivers are not functioning appropriately on apple devices.Logged a case with Epson technical support team and received pathetic response from them as they are saying that this is an issue with Apple devices and they want apple to create drivers for Epson product... Pathetic...Technical team is not a technical one.. worst experience.. Never go for this product if you want to use it on Apple device and also you are not bothered for any technical support may need in unavoidable circumstances. Pathetic experience..."
1,Epson L3110 printer is not good its worst printer please don't purchase this model go another model in this printed photos bad and not setting4/6 paper setting is problem West your money Epson service center said about this model is text printer only so not a photo printer please don't purchase this model i safar this
4,This is nice Printer which is very easy to install the process to be followed is given online in many videos. The process is very simple1) Unbox the entire printer with all wires2) Then find the 4 ink bottles & open the part to pour the same3) pour the ink in the right ink cartridge of the printer4) switch on the printer & then a long press of the red button post which it would take close to 7-10 minutes (ignore the different sounds)5) your printer is now ready once the lights stop blinking6) insert the cd & connect the printer to the computer7) follow the process as in the CD.Will take a good 20 mins if you plan to install all the drivers.The print quality is good. The price seems a little high but only time would tell if the printer is worth the money.Would have been a 5 star product except for the plastic used that looks a little flimsy. Plus have seen a lot of videos confirming that it can print only 30000 sheets.
5,"This Printer is awesome, and fully automatic, it can print HD quality photo without color distortion. Only one problem, regular printing is must, else printer head will jam with dry ink. Till 2 months, I have taken around 1100 pages color and b/w experience awesome pleasure. I will suggest to buy this rather previous models. Only black ink is reduced quickly."
5,"If you were using CHEAP Inkjet Printers with expensive Ink or EXPENSIVE Laserjet Printers with EXPENSIVE cartridge then it's about time you switched.Bought on 19th June 2019, Delivered on 24th June 2019.Used for 1 day, but took about 600 prints in a day. Both, coloured as well as black n white.Opinion - Excellent print quality and very cheap also.Basically, the print quality will not be upto the level of a laser jet but the cheap operational cost makes it worth buying. For whatever purpose you want to use it, the prints are awesome. Even the photos are printed in an excellent manner on any type of paper.Before judging the quality please ensure that you choose the correct type of paper you are using in the printer settings. Example - If you choose glossy paper in the settings for a photo but are using a normal A4 paper then the print will not be that great. Whereas, if you choose A4 paper (Plain Paper/Bright White Paper) the same print will come in an excellent quality.The printer has wifi direct option, if the printer is in range then kindly use the network of Printer itself, it is quite fast. If you are using it in an office then you can use it over a Wifi network (Setup can be done in a normal way using network SSID also and using WPS button on the router also).The printer is fast when Standard quality is selected for printing whereas the printing is slow when High Quality is selected as it takes more details into consideration (For reading purposes, not much difference between both, Standard is the option you should choose).For printing double sided, settings need to be selected from the printer properties. It is not automatic, so you yourself will have to take out the paper and input again in the manner shown in the dialogue box which appears automatically. It is hassle free and printing speed is good.I would definitely recommend buying this printer to everyone. It is economical, convenient and user friendly.PS - You might decide on the basis of other reviews also but then again I have tried and tested the printer. I bought Onsite extended warranty for 2 years also so I'm set for a period of 3 years without any hassles. I hope the review helps. If you have more money go for the one with digital display, but do check the quality of printing on that over youtube reviews before buying."
5,"This is currently the best inktank printer one can buy in this price range. Very satisfied. One would not miss the touch screen as once u connect the printer with ur phone with epson app, all the functions can be accessed and setting can be configured. Scan quality is very good and this is one of the best printers you could buy for photo printing. The quality is very good. There aren’t any problems but if I have to nitpick, I found that the print speed to be slow when u give colour print through phone. That might not be the case with everyone as I could have a problem with my network or it can be fixed in a software update. Other than that, this is the printer you can chose blindly for home and home office. Very satisfied and finally the per page cost is also very low compared to inkjet pronters. The right fit for my home and I believe for many homes too👍🏻"
1,"I have used purchased this product as a replacement for my Epson L220. After one month of use (around 1700 pages) I am not satisfied with this product. below are my experience in detail.SPEED: Speed is no way any improvement over its predecessors EPSON L220 or EPSON  L380. It has average printing speed with a very frustrating issue of  getting stuck between prints for 3/4 sec if you print more than 5 pages continuously. this problem really tests one's patience  specially when you have a lots of  color copies to do.PRINT QUALITY: Print quality is average.My previous L220 prints little better images than this model. document print is below average too.. photo print is not recommended. can not pull more than 180 gsm.  ONE MORE major  problem is print head need  to be cleaned every 2/3 days. line between texts is a common problem and text are not sharp as it should be.PAGE YIELD: I wonder why Epson mark this printer as eco print. I have print only 1700 pages (mostly text only) and as you can see in the image above the black ink level indicator is already down below the third level, means one more step down the tank is empty. As per the  EPSON web page , B&W page yield should be 4500 pages. I don't think it can print half of that count. its really very disappointing should be shame for EPSON.My verdict on this product is that this product is not suitable for high use, doesn't worth the money and totally not recommended for commercial use. One star as it goes."
1,"Very very bad product . Stay away from buying.1. Build Quality is very poor , very poor quality plastic used. feels like it may brake here and there.2. Initial Setup is very much difficult. there is no display so its really very hard to input ip address and ip details.3. Wifi direct is there. but no where the password is written.4. Wifi network address needs to be configured each time the printer is powered on.i am not able to take a colour print or scan a page as set up is yet to be done. will write the print quality after the setup and first use."
5,"Model : L 3152Seller : Appario RetailPrice : ₹10350Bought on : 30th Sep, 2019Extremely good product, print quality is excellent. Setup is also easy.This product is very similar to L3150 but it has a blue highlight.Before setting this up please read  comprehensive user guide which is available in L3150 product page in pdf format. Trust me setup is very easy.Many people are saying that WiFi setup is complicated but it's not. Using instruction anyone can setup wifi connection. From then it will connect automatically but it takes 1-2 minutes to connect. Till now I have not used the cable to connect the printer with computer, WiFi is all the thing.N.B. : I have used WiFi direct option only.Recap:1. Fill the ink2. Charge the ink3. Run nozzle test (1 page)4. Take a printout of WiFi password and all that stuff (3 pages)5. Setup WiFi5. Download Epson iPrint from Play store6. Start printing and scanning.Hit like if helpful.🙏🏼"
1,Don't buy. Not value for money. If you want multipurpose printer like Epson old L SERIES printer which can print on anything. This L3110 supports only on 70-80 GSM paper..
1,"photostat not working more then 4 pages same with the scan taking more then 3-4 minute for loading or i don't know why taking time so much, i am owner of my business facing everyday same issue. totally waste of money."
1,"I had HP 6830 before i got some printhead issue...Don't waste your moneyIt is not a good printerSpeed is slowPrint quality is lowWifi response time is slowU can not give continuous command.. u need to wait for previous task to complete...Black and white are okBut colour is not poor...Only good thing is ink tankThat's it!!I will update you more later..After my complaint..I m a prime customerI called in customer careThey saidIf it is damaged only then, we can take it..So suggest u to go for Hp ink tankHp ink tankHp has much much better quality.."
4,"Its working fine, speed is too good. Earlier I was using Leaser Printer. Leaser printer ke takkar ka hai speed main. I can also take print/ Scan while there is power cut. Best Printer for Small and Medium office, don't know why others putting adverse remarks perhaps they are using it as photo printer, actually its not a photo printer and not suitable for the people engaged in photography profession. but for others it is ultimate."
1,This thing does not work. I tried to reach Epson customer service but couldn't connect. Amazon customer service is also not helpful. Both Epson and Amazon are giving bad experience.
1,Don't ever go call your printer service man they will just waste your 50 percent of ink and there is no solution for good printDaily you have to do head cleaningNo worth of buying this
1,"L3150 is not a good printer , printing is very slow , scanning is also very slow copy is very very slow"
1,"This is  is not a user friendly product, trust me.I had an epson L150 -the ink tank non wifi one.The build quality of that product and print was excellent .This on the other hand was rubbish,If I print over wifi direct even if quality is set in high ,It still is a 5/10 print.The ink tank seems to finish ink fast.The epson app is the worst,so undeveloped and troublesome to use.I can't find a way to connect the printer to the  wifi ,I can't  find a way to use remote printing  or to even register my product on the epson site as INDIA is not listed in the countries allowed to register.It's low quality printer.And who uses a wps router? I don't see why I can't directly connect my printer to the wifi without that.The bottom line is ,unless you want to break your head using this product.Dont buy it,my cousins got an hp wifi printer and I used theirs ,setup was easy and overall side by side.I really realised how bad epson is at their tech.The last printer I had was good but this one is disgusting and low quality build.I REALLY REGRET BUYING THIS PRINTER AND I DON'T LIKE ITS BUILD QUALITY OR PRINT QUALITY."
5,Good
4,I think I had taken a very good decision buying this from amazon because The first printer I received was a bit defective and did not work properly but amazon helped me through that tough time they replaced it with a new one without any call or message they didn't even ask a question for replacing. I never thought amazon would give such service In these though times now the pros and the cons of the printerPros1.Epson customer service is very good2. Print speed is very fast and much better than canon and hp but the print quality is not that good if you compare with canon printers3.Now the best thing about the printer is hp andCanon use print head where the ink dries but this printer stores the ink where it has to print and then prints it that's the main reason why I bought it above hp and canonCons:-1.Very big compared to hp and canon printers2.Is a bit expensive than hp and canon3.Paper gets stuck if you a slight old paper and if you use a paper that is folded the ink gets printed in the paper you( can notice it in the first photo)And I see many people ask can you print with you mobile with the usb versionAns:Yes you can print with noko print application though you can see some adds in the appI have written by using 30 minutes of my time hope you find it helpfulAnd if you are confused where to buy from amazon or Flipkart I would recommend you to purchase it from amazon
1,Pls don't waste your money
5,Print quality  is really good. Budget and cost effective printing.
5,"Pros: 1.Very small size, Less weight,only 4.5 kgs. Brother Hp weighs 10 kgs in this category.2. Very cheap to refill. OEM epson inks are cheaper than competitors. Also duplicate inks are half the price and available easily. You cant get good duplicate inks for hp and brother models.3. Very fast Printing speed. 33 pages p/m in BW mode is amazing.4. Easy to refill ink tanks. Easier than filling a watterbottle😜5.multiple printing options ie. You can print even visting card using this printer.Cons: 1. Could have added PVC id printing options. Higher GSM card getting jammed.2. Sometimes full color printouts on 80GSM papers gets stuck and torn because of some exposed plastics under the printing headWill post a long term review after few months"
5,"It's amazing. This Ink Tank printer is so much better than my HP Deskjet 3630. Here's why -1. Printing speed is substantially faster2. Quality is superior.3. Build quality is great.4. The EPSON software is highly customizable5. The Noise is minimal, you won't even notice that your printer is doing its job unless you're in an extraordinary quiet environment.6. And most importantly, the COST OF PRINTING is way too low. The inkjets will burn your pocket if you print 100s of pages for your study or research or whatever. And believe me the injection process to reuse cartridges are just plain harassment. What you get with Ink Tank printers is cheap Ink bottles that are just too easy to refill and cost of printing will be like 1/500th compared to the inkjets, at least theoretically.So, don't think twice about the cost of the printer compared to the Deskjets, this one will save you a lot of money in the long run."
1,This printer is very problematic. The conventional Epson Blinking lights error is still existing on this model. Just after printing 10 gloss paper printing the printer doesn’t work. Now forever the lights on the printers blink and I cannot do anything about it as there are no solutions for this sort of error other than taking it to service. I requested for refund instead they providing me replacement. I just hope the other piece works just fine.
1,Pathetic support...Since last one week trying various options to install printer software and driver...but not getting through...eventhough service person temporarily managed but again failed to do setup...both online. And with CDs also... asked customer service agent also...got feedback that same problems with this series ....going to return the printer....Disappointed with EPSON....
1,Very bad product.. Printer printhead jam just within 3 months/500 pages. Very bad after sales service. Customer care executive are not supportive. And service technician doesnt come at scheduled time. Overall a very disappointing product.
1,"The printer was in good condition the delivery was quick and superb. I called up Epson technical team to send someone for installation. They responded quickly and the guy came in 2 hours.The bad part was that it took him around 1.5 hours to get this printer up and running since there were some initial firmware issues. Once it was resolved the printing was happening correctly but the scanner/copier failed to work at all. The technician tried several times but it did not work. I had to, unfortunately, return the item."
2,Scanner glass damaged ... on arrival..........
4,"WiFi connectivity from laptop to printer is really a difficult task but one thing you have to remember that if printer is connected to laptop through WiFi there are two options named as Epson l4150 and Epson 553D32 will be shown under printers and Faxes heading and whenever you want to print you have to opt EPSON L4150 Series for data cable connected process and EPSON553D32(L4150Series)for WiFi connected process under the heading ""How do you want to print your picture"""
1,"The printer is best for first 14 days (its my personal experience) afterwards its start showing problem of ‘both light blink’ i.e. paper jam, no printing no copy. After searching the solution in YouTube (due to pandemic situation onsite visit are hold by company) it came to know that, this is a universal problem in ‘EPSON’ printer and surprise that still the company not able to solve this.Once log the call, the call center revert quickly while discussion with the technician he confirm that it’s a hardware issue need to solve in service center only. My frank opinion before anyone wants to purchase this please visit YouTube and search ‘Problem in EPSON’."
1,"paper jam problem,head errors,malfunctioning"
4,"1st day experience. Info page showing fail status and wifi password cannot be retrieved. Lines appearing in prints and not solve even after head cleaning twice and waste lots of costly original ink. Printing stops in middle and paper has to pulled manually. Though to replace the printer and Amazon told to contact epson. Epson once disconnected my call saying techical problem. After called them they gave complain number. This printer was not in my budget still somehow managed it and this happening. Very important exam after 3 days. Now should i study or stress my head this box which epson calls printer. Aaa thuu. Will amazon or epson compensate for the lost ink or my precious time or my cool of mind to study.Update after 16 days usage.Printer is good. Print quality is good. Fast. No auto duplex is sad. Ink is costly.Advice: no screen so, installation was difficult. Better call technician for installtion. Will update later if any problem found"
5,"If we use normal paper to print black-n-white, quality is not same like my HP laser printer, but if we use glossy photo paper to print image, quality is just AWESOME! However, I am having problem to understand how it works in wireless mode, it's not very smooth to make it work from Mac or iPad or Android. I would give 10/10 for quality and cost, however ""Easy to use"": 6.5/10. May be we could not figure it out properly :("
4,Very easy to use and convenience of wifi. Easy setup. Good accurate color reproduction on photos. However on normal kodak photo paper (200gsm) it makes roller marks (multiple vertical lines due to pressure and not ink). I don't know why we can't improve this technology to use something like pinch rollers in cassette decks which dont scratch. Very silly to have this kind of issue in printers made in 2018.
1,"Amazon doesn’t allow me to return the product. I won’t be able to return the product after 24h September. They just hold the return date to be passed. The product is not convenient because when a paper is jammed, I have to open the front cover with a screwdriver. I am not willing to do that every time. Please support me for returning the product.Thanks!"
1,"CONNECTING TO WIFI EVERY TIME IS A HEADACHE , IT DOESN'T CONNECT AS QUICKLY AS A CELLPHONE, YOU HAVE TO ERASE THE OLD SETTINGS , SWITCH IT ON AND OFF SEVERAL TIMES TO GET IT CONNECTED. PRINT SPEED IS TOO SLOW. PRINT QUALITY IS OKAY. IF YOU GOING TO USE IS MAINLY AS A WIFI PRINTER , STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER. I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW AFTER 3 MONTHS USE AND I AM FED UP WITH THE CONNECTIVITY PROBLEM."
5,"Iam writing this after using this printer for a month. Before its purchase i was confused with other printers like most of us are in between hp 410, 415, brother t 510w.To be honest this epson l 3150 is best printer with minimum ink price. Best in class picture prints provided u use fujifilm glossy photopaper of 180 gsm.Very sharp and clear images with original color combination.Photocopy works well u are printing less than 25 prints at a time it works smooth under 60 seconds it will photocopy.All I can say it's the best wifi printer with very easy installation, one can install on his/her own. Wifi direct function is so easy to use.Finally dont read too much reviews  about this just go ahead. Iam using this in my hospital with daily 1 color print and 10 photocopies.Iam fully satisfied."
5,We purchased this printer and are happy with the value for money that it is providing us. THANK YOU Epson and Amazon...
4,This is a direct wifi printer and it's really worth having it. Wifi increased the usability by many fold. Epson creative print application is not supported by this model and to me it's a negative point for the printer. Scanning speed gets reduced after few continuous scan however for few scan it is ok. Photo quality is better then L380 and is acceptable. Roller mark as vertical lines are observed on photo that is negative for photo printing. Epson demo person are not equipped to give demo with demo photo print.
1,"This product does not even have a LAN port. It is completely misleading product description. I just wasted my 12,000 bugs in this useless machine. Unfortunately Amazon didnt honour return and I ended up keeping this useless product in my office."
5,"When I was needing for a printer which suits me , then I went on searching for many blogs, articles and videos that which printer should I buy then I ordered this one .My requirements was - ( for a research student )1) Fast Printing ( Duplex- both sides)2) For longer use ( I don't use printer daily , that's why I neglected ink-based printers)3)Servicing and Brand ( Servicing means , cartridge is easily available and affordable and the printer have brand )So , I came with this one having all functions that I needed.Now , Pros -1) All above three2) Better printing quality3) Very easy to use , plug and play , can print 200 pages in one goCons -1) Not have led lights .2) I bought @13k , which I think is bit more ... It should be somewhere between @11.5kI have used HP m1136, and other HP products , but 'brother' can beat them in Quality , Fast printing , Auto duplex and Servicing .Go for it ."
5,"I have been racking my brains for the last few days since I received the printer to find a fault with the machine; disappointed that I cannot find any. This machine has more sophisticated functionality than I require for my limited home office needs; the two- sided scanning and printing, the two-sided scanning of Id cards and printing of both sides on a single page are some of features that I can think of. Kudos to Amazon to make it affordable to me via its red hot summer sale."
1,"The toner cant be refilled only replacement, its cost is Rs. 3500/- every time. Pathetic after sales support.Strictly dont buy this scrap."
1,"The description doesn't say this cannot be connected to LAN which is a basic feature for a printer. This neither has WiFi nor the LAN port. It's just useless and Amazon cannot accept the return. Its waste of money, NEVER buy this useless printer."
4,"Lot of people are complaining that it doesn’t have wifi or LAN. For their information, the connectivity type is already mentioned, that is USB only. It’s a nice product in 11k price range."
5,Writing this after 8month usage product is good but tonor filling is not easy if you do your self u need assistance for tonor filling so in this range there is no wifi but i print with otg cable print quality is good i daily print a book product is fine but i will be disappointed by that there is no backlight on lcd which is bad
3,"Product is good but its not yielding  as many prints as they mentioned, not even near by the number 2600. in my first full toner it yielded 1600 pages only.kindly provide me invoice bill once again."
5,Very good product.Auto-rotate feature.Easy Installation.Plug and print.
3,"Tldr: Printer is good, the software isn't great.Bought the printer for home use. It was very easy to install. The instruction manual was detailed and the instructions to download and install the drivers on Windows 10 were simple. Installs easily on MacOS also.Prints well, and is quite fast.The Interface to scan is not too great. It's easy if you want to scan a document into a pdf, but images are a bit complicated. It was easier on my old Canon Deskjet.Copy function doesn't work great with IDs. The photos usually end up with high contrast and black out at times. One workaround is to scan and then print.Overall, the printer is good if using primarily to print/scan documents."
5,"This is my first Brother made printer, found complete satisfaction, print quality is clean, sharp. Design is so nice. So many features available. I like duplex printing feature. software is also easy and user friendly. Scanning is just perfect. Speed of scanner and printer is fast as they mentioned. overall good deal."
1,worthless printer and seller distributed wrong information on amazon portal about wireless connection and product other features related.Please amazon check all details regarding products .i am not happy purchase this printer its just like a black marketing
5,I had this printer when I was in Canada. Hence I bought it here too. Amazing print quality as expected. Scanning and software installation is much easier. I have hp mx1130 laser jet. Compared to hp this is way better.
5,Very good product and fast delivery by Amazon and very good paking . product is too good than comparison. And lot's of options available in brother printer...thank you Amazon and thank you brother
4,"Excellent printer. Does the job. Consistent print quality and fairly easy to use. The parts feel made with fragile plastic but for the price I dont think I should complain.The only problem is the LCD display. It’s very hard to read the display and this is a real shame as this is the only “user interface” and I believe Brother should introduce a backlit display or something similar.The other disadvantage is that the software that comes with this printer (also available for download from the internet), is heavy and tends to make your computer very slow."
5,"If you require an easy to use, office like print operation and quality at affordable price, look no further, this is the printer for you. The installation was hasslefree, you can download drivers from the link provided in the manual and within 30 minutes the printer is installed. The cartridge drum has a orange locator and the manual has markings and depictions to help you place the toner cartridge in the cartridge drum. The entire process of setting up the printer was a smooth experience. Press the start button, press the print on the PC and the printer starts in a jiffy, the speed of printing is lightning fast and the two sided print happens automatically and seamlessly. Overall, the print quality and the print operation and installation is superb and plug and play. Have to test the scanner though. This is a very capable printer for a home office and can print in bulk and fast. Go for it."
5,"Setup is a breeze thanks to the included CD. If a CD/DVD drive is not available, then the drivers have to be downloaded from the Brother Support Website. The size is around 200MB.TIP: When choosing the printer model to download the drivers from their website, choose Asian Region and then select Indian Specific Models and you will find the drivers there."
5,"Overall a good printer.  I had some initial set up issues.  Could not control the contrast and the darkness of the prints.  Learning the ID printing and dual page printing techniques were a bit involved.  It took a few attempts to get them right.These features were very useful and most used.  I am quite satisfied with this printer now.  I do not know the support available for this printer in India, but let us hope that I do not need one. :-)"
5,Excellent printer for both home and office use. Crystal clear prints till now.very good printing speed.Overall highly recommended.
4,"So advantages are already mentioned so I am talking about it. What I observe is it requires a amt of space and also draws a large amt of current.. Another thing is that if using an extension box, even if the switch is off,due to large drawing of current you can get small shock if the laptop material is  metal... These are not the disadvantages but something you need to care about.The print quality is awesome and don't forget to register the product in brother site to check it's authenticity."
3,"Pros:Easy very good Black Prints and fast prints , dual side always a plus. ( Brother quality print are always good)Easy installation!Cons are no WIFI (Big-ve for today) , no EthernetStill you can make wifi prints via shared router, youtube if you want."
5,"I am fan of brother products since last 12 year first i bought only laser jet with tonner it printed 2600 copy in single tonner , in monsoon this printer dont spread ink like other printers do , never heat and auto updated driver"
5,"It's the most amazing printer at this price, I've been using laser printers since 94, the beg. Era of printers, but brother has simply outclassed HP etc, just don't, think twice , if u wanna have monochrome printing needs."
4,Price print quality it's ok but display have not visible no back light .direct print fast .but using from computer  its take first scanning then Printing take too much time.for 10 print its take 8 minutes . I am not satisfied with this  I am RETURN  I am buy little more price  around 20000 .
5,"It's a mind blowing fantastic printer for office and business use,  print quality is excellent,  and duplex printing add extra advantage to this printer,  double side printing is awesome,  everything is goodCon--- it needs good maintaince,  so use properly,  don't play game with it, I mean don't take it lightly,It's not working in inverter,  if you still use using high power inverter then may be internal parts damages"
5,"Brother printer is good,"
2,"1. ABNORMAL MACHINE RUNNING NOISE WHILE COPYING / PRINTING DOCUMENT2. CD RECEIVED WITH PRODUCT IS NOT WORKING, DRIVERS DOWNLOADED FROM NET.3. LCD - DIM SO NOT READABLE EASILY4. INVOICE RECEIVED, IS NOT LEGIBLE AND NOT COMPLETE."
5,"This is my first Brother made printer, found complete satisfaction, print quality is clean, sharp. Design is so nice. So many features available. I like duplex printing feature. software is also easy and user friendly. Scanning is just perfect. Speed of scanner and printer is fast as they mentioned. overall good deal."
5,Got this for home use. It does exactly as it says and the printer is rather fast than the printers I have used before. The duplex printing facility is also very helpful.
5,"If I have to rate this product across all catagories on a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate it 9 out of 10. Delivery was well in time as it appeared at the time of ordering it. Quality of the printer and print is great in its class. It is indeed a product with good value for money. I am completely satisfied with this laser printer so far."
2,Better write the try HP laser printer with auto duplex or cannon. I have proof don't neglect this review.  It won't print 2000 copies
2,It's display is so poor... We can't see things in its display properly. They also didn't provide return or replacement. software installation is also a difficult task as the cd along with it won't run.We have to go to the website and download it.Overall Printing quality is good.
1,"It has been mentioned on the printer itself that 2600 pages minimum it would print, however, it was able to print only 2000 pages. i am suprised on seeing the differences."
4,Since last 5 years am using Brother Printers .i am telling simply its Pretty hardworker.... But its very impossible to get  Customer care support  .. I tried and installed myself ....
5,"Very Good ,Value for Money Product."
5,Value for money. Easy to use. Good quality printing. Had my doubts before purchase. But it is all clear now.
4,"Nice and convenient printer, user friendly and economical"
5,Excellent printoutsOnly Black and white printouts
4,"The product was packed very well... The setup was very easy. The print quality was great. I bought it for School use, overall a good product"
1,Sacner is not that good at the time of photo coping.  Scan to pc is ok
1,"The scanner causes weird line to appear at 4800dpi. As you can see on the uploaded image, the right side of the iris has a vertical line, a defect in the scanned image. After researching this problem on the internet, many of the users of this particular model are facing the same problem. I conclude that this particular model is a No GO!!"
3,"This is my 2nd Epson scanner, the first one still works, but needed 2nd one for 2nd computer setup for 2nd kid as schooling these days is on computer only.I tend to compare this with my 1st one, V33:1) V39 requires only 1 USB cable for both power and data, V33 has a separate power brick (the connector of which has gotten loose with age). Winner: V392) V39 and V33 run on the same Epson software on Windows. However, while scanning multiple oages in same PDF, V39 fails to ""add page"" approx 5% of time (definitely a software glitch), so you have to scan the docs all over again - quite irritating. I have used V33 for years, works flawlessly. Winner: V333) V39 scan cover's hinge cannot take thick books, V33 could take much thicker notebooks and textbooks. Though if you keep the door open in V39 and scan, its not a problem. Winner: V334) Scan quality is great in both scanners. I am not a computer artist, so cannot comment on color accuracy, but for all business purposes, absolutely no issues in V39 and V33. Winner: Tie5) Both scanners come with 4 physical buttons, which when connected to PC, will automatically trigger the Epson Scan app to start, and switch to the button function. Winner: Tie6) V39 feels a bit faster, though not 100% sure. Winner: V397) V39 can stand vertically to save desk space, but unless you want to scan only 1 page and hold the oage carefully befor quickly shutting the cover, I find this practically useless. Winner: TieIf I could, I would purchase the V33 again, but since its an old model and no longer sold, V39 comes a close second."
5,"For Small Office & Home use, this is an excellent product for regular scanning works.Scans up-to 4,800dpi for people working intensively in design & graphics industry. I use 300dpi which is more than enough for home photos & documents scanning. Can scan a full A4 photo in 15 seconds and documents in about 10 seconds.Easy to use & install, as it took me less than 10 minutes to connect-install software-scan for the first time.Summary: Excellent cost effective product (Sub 4,000) for regular scanning purposes."
5,It is my first day experience.I am not an expert of using computer. But I did not face any difficulty regarding installing the software.The quality of scanning also very good. I recommend this product for domestic purposes.
4,"My daughter need to submit a lot of Homework and Exam worksheet online by scanning the handwritten worksheets. She also need to submit the project work that also involves scanning multiple documents and then merging them as PDF file. Initially I thought of buying multi-function printer however my print needs were not much and I could manage them by going to the printing shops. Also printer has a maintenance cost for cartridge and papers. It also takes a lot of space. Hence my daughter suggested to buy scanner instead. This scanner has solved that problem.  Though the scanning apps that came with this are not that intuitive/user friendly, I had to do some trail and errors to finally understand how to create multipage pdf. Also there are so many different APPs to do same things so sometime I think why didn't they provide just one APP instead of so many. I keep forgetting which App used last time. Due to this I have reduced one start. Otherwise the product is perfect."
1,"The device is recognized by the system, but the software always displays the error ""cannot communicate with the scanner"". Further digging shows that this is a common problem encountered by this particular devices' software."
5,"Cute,light, fully functional occupied very little table space. Can be put on stand when notin use, I could scan and digitize about 2500 photos in about a week Some of the photos are 65 years old. some pcitures wer shot using my Old Clik III camera. USing high res scanning and bit of cleaning in photoshop images stand out."
5,"Best scanner in reasonable price it scans picture in colour,black and white and other format on various pixel,dpi also u may scan picture format jpg,jpeg,pdf and other format ,even u may attach all scan pdf in one single file with the help of this scanner in seeting section .I love very much scanner light,delicate,easy to carry and simple to use and in reasonable ,value for money."
5,"I like the scanner very much due to its easy installation, use, light weight  and most importantly its scan quality. Initially it took longer time for CD to install the software but when I again restarted the CD it took few minutes to install. Thank you Amazon."
5,The quality of the scanner is amazing. Performance is also good And easy to use And install.
3,"Good product, did more than 200 pages scan far last one month. Important thing - drawback is error coming in between scanning pages, it leads to again scan from start. Which is time waste"
5,"It’s as described, loving it. Of course as already mentioned by seller that certain size documents cannot be scanned .Rest it is perfect for home use"
5,Easy to use scanner. Just followed the instruction provided in a sheet and it was set up. Very easy to use and works perfectly.
1,"Faulty scanners, I dont blame epson but something is seriously wrong with the way the product is behaving"
5,THIS PRODUCT VERY NICE WELL WORKING. BUT I WANT BIG SIZE SCAN GLASS FOR LEGAL PAPER SCAN IN ONE SHOT. NOW ITS SIZE AFFORDING ONLY A4 PAPERS.
5,This is the best scanner at this price range for all the home and office needs. Really easy to install and after that its just plug and play mechanism. Used it for scanning handdrawn illustrations and the settings really came in handy.
5,"I was using HP scanner, after iOS upgrade it stopped working, now I am using this and fully satisfied."
4,Slow and takes time to scan
4,"Works perfectly, the only issue is you can't stitch scans larger than letter size reliably. Apart from that it is perfect."
5,Good product!!it does its job
1,It stopped working after 1 scan. It is BAAAD!

5,Good Product
5,"I have seen many buyers complaining about this product, that, it is not recocnised by windows or mac,  it happens because of a mistake. First you must install the CD driver provided, and when the interface ask you to connect the printer cable, that is USB, then only you should connect the cable. The rest work like magic! I have provided a sample image scanned in 300 DPI, a bird manual with creamy paper, observe the detail! I strongly recommend this product."
5,"As most users reviewed this has some problem and will not connect post setting up. As per the instruction I set it up and connected the scanner to laptop when requested and it was all fine successful set up. Post setup once I started the IJ Utility tool within few seconds it started throwing connection error and every time you connect you will receive the same error. I tried on 3 laptops and it all the same.However, Amazon replaced this product promptly and the second one is working like charm since first installation without any issue. I'm using this scanner for almost more than a year and it produces great scanning result every time. So I definitely recommend this product."
5,"Just make sure you FIRST install the Driver from the CD and connect the scanner only when the driver installation wizard prompts you to do so. The wizard tries to connect to the internet for downloading the latest stuff, so just make sure your machine is online before running the driver CD. Scanner is working great.All the negative reviews are from people who connected the scanner without first installing the driver from the CD. If you messed it, just disconnect the scanner, go to device manager and uninstall all the scanners from the list; restart the machine and try running the CD first."
5,"I had previously purchased an Epson Scanner (Epson perfection V39). The first one never worked. The replacement stopped working in around 2 months, and had a bad build quality. I purchased this next. And this one is much better.First of all, when you get this, there's a lock-unlock slider at the back. You NEED to unlock it. Otherwise the scanner will turn on but won't work.I am using this on a Mac. When I was using the Epson scanner, it installed a software that kept on bugging me to register the product every few days. But this one does not need any installation of any software/driver at all on a Mac. Just plug in the USB and open Image Capture. Image Capture is an application that is preinstalled in all macs. You will find the scanner on the left in the Shared category. Just use it from there. No need to install any software or drivers, it all works out of the box. The scan quality is also great out of the box.I really like how sturdy this scanner is. The build quality is great. You can also lift the upper lid to make space for books, etc. The cable that comes with it is the most solid, heavy duty USB cable that I have ever seen. And it is a standard USB-C to USB-A cable, so if you have a laptop like the new macbooks with USB-C port, you can also use a standard USB-C to USB-C cable without any dongles.I think if you are looking for a budget portable flatbed scanner in India, you only have 3 options - Canon LIDE 300, LIDE 400 (this one), and Epson perfection V39. Out of the three, I think this one is by far the best. I can safely recommend this one."
1,"Worst product. After trying so many times of uninstalling and installing software, still scanner not working on windows 10 and MacBook as well. Getting scanner communication errors."
2,"DO NOT CONNECT THE SCANNER UNLESS ASKED DURING SOFTWARE/DRIVER INSTALLATION.Pros: Resolution (crisp & detailed pictures), speed and software front.Cons: Blue shade is quite dominant in the scans. Colour reproduction is not so good as far as photo scanning is concerned.Some misalignment is visible at higher resolutions 3600+ dpi (Came to know from a review video). The body is not so strong, though lightweight.I replaced the product because of noticeable blue dominance in the scans, considering it as a fault in that particular item. Unfortunately, the replacement was completely faulty and couldn't scan anything at all. So I had to return the product.I would recommend you to compare Epson v39 with this and then decide which product to buy. If budget is not an issue then go for Epson v600."
5,"ProsSimple instalation but when prompting to connect da cable then only connect, before that instal da cd with internet connection must when instaling.Software conrol panel i like da most, we can scan 1document in document mode, da next one if photo we need not to change settings like epson, just click da photo mode thats it.All da modes wil be visible in single panel.Super speed 6to 8 seconds for 1paper.ConsNothing i recognise.If ADF feature there then somemore better."
2,"Updated review after 9 months.It has stopped working. It does not power up when connected to laptop or any USB power source. I am trying to contact Canon for warranty.Old review -Using this since 1 monthDrivers installed easily on Windows 10. Drivers could not install on Windows 7. Also your computer needs to have disk port run installation CD.Pro: No need for external power supply. Picture quality is good. Easy to handle and operate. Multiple pages PDF, editing image options are there.Cons: Could Not install on Windows 7 machine."
1,"Worst product I ever seen. It can not be connect to PC for a single time. I called customer care, they suggested me to visit service center along with it and PC! Even Canon has no technical support over telephone!Don't buy this at any cost.Total loss of money and time.It will make you big harrasment for life time."
5,"Product working as it should. I was a bit sceptical after reading some of the negative reviews, but bought it anyway and fortunately I recieved a working product.Followed the advice of one of the reviews here suggesting to first install the drivers from the cd, and only to connect the scanner after the driver pop up says so. Everything went smoothly. Satisfied with my product."
2,Scanner is good but issues with buttons. Buttons on scanner does not seem to work. Checked online for solution. Many have reported this problem but was unable to find solution. If any body can help me sind a solution to this and if button are functional later on I may increase rating to 4. Till I find a solution rating is not more than 2.
1,"It came well packed without any scratch but it failed to work with Windows 7 laptop, Windows 10 laptop and Mac mini. On each machine it gave error ""Cannot Communicate with scanner"". I miss to check review comments else would not have bought it. Now I am stuck with it as there is no refund option."
3,"Received a faulty product. Was not working. Then contacted local Canon service center & got is replaced with a new one, under warranty. The replaced one is working fine as of now. There was an option for replacement from amazon, but didn't opt for that as I was in doubt if the replacement product could have also come faulty."
1,"Hi, this I've not used after bought 15 days, now I've installed quality of scan output is extreme, but every time we need to unplug and connect the cable if we scan after 15-30 min break means, it shows scanner not connected, once unplug and connect it works, it's terrible, i can't return this due to not used 15 days and return period was over."
1,"Don't waste your time in this product. Have been loving canon products for years but this is an utter disappointment. Bought the product installed properly, but couldn't connect to the pc even a single time. Showed error unable to communicate with the pc. Tried installing on both win7 aswell as win 10 . Got the product replaced, same issue with the replacement, returned it back, reordered the same issue with the third scanner aswell. No telephonic support from canon,they ask to bring the machine to the service centre.Searched many forums, the problem is universal, but no solution available. Result Lot of time wasted."
4,There should be an Photo Editing app. Along with it. Not so easy to use
5,Function and quality are as expected. Produces clear scans at lower resolutions. Setup for the scanning app was fairly simple through the Canon website. The single USB cable for data and power is a lost less mess on desk than an extra power cable.
5,1. no driver issues on Windows systems up to Win 10.2.Software  included is best and fully configurable for various needs3.Fast and USB  C so no more cable mess4.Scan quality is excellent.
1,"After purchasing the scanner worked very fine for 4 months after that when going for scanning it says:-cannot communicate with scanner for these reasons:scanner is turned offusb cable disconnectedplease check and try againscanner driver will be closedcode:2,156,33"
1,"Scan quality is crap, its sluggish. Scan a book or a page from the book and you would know what I am saying. Legitimate photo scan is good. My recommendation on the same budget Epson v39 perfection. I would go for that one"
5,"4800 DPI mode is available only in ScanGear mode. You need to type the DPI yourself. The output images are incredibly sharp and very very high resolution. Love it.THE SCANNER IS NOT FOR NOOBS, YOU NEED TO BE TECHNICALLY SMART."
5,"Excellent scanner. Very good picture quality. Easy to use.  Very fast in scanning. Quite easy in installation.  Highly recommended. Feature rich,"
3,Just received it today. Showing these errors. I installed from the car and then connected the usb as suggested by other reviewers. Pls help.
5,"I like the scanner. Very easy to use and store, comes with the stand for vertical storage.My major disappointment was when I found it won't work with smartphones. Other than this issue, this is a good product."
5,cannon lide 400 scanner is working very well. no any software issue no windows issue. this is working on win 7thanx amazon for given help in selection of this best product.
5,Product quality is excellent and fine
5,"Installation was no issue, just follow the instructions. I followed online installation instructions.It would be good if the scanner had a USB port to copy the scanned files."
1,DONT BUY - Error codes and no resolution. Defective product. Upset with Amazon and Appario on selling such defective products
5,Excellent.. no doubt.. just go for it.. and the online set up from canon online is so easy.. the only think is tha body is made of weak material..
4,Only issue that Scan copies doesn't get saved at the location selected. Though overall performance is good.
5,Value for the Cost and Easy to use.
4,Replacement product is very good
5,super one
5,"Excellent scanner works very well sharp images ,fast and reliable"
4,"It works well and is easy to set up and use. The lid seems a bit flimsy, though. Overall it is a good product."

5,Original Product. Reasonable Price.
4,Fast scanner.Simple to use.But not sturdy and seems to be delicate top>Far better than hp scanjet200
5,The product is simply the best scanner in the market at this range. So easy to use and gives great scanning quality.
5,Good Buy
5,Scan quality and options are very nice. It does a takes a little time to scan which is fine as its dependent on the DPI settings you need. If you are an artist or designer it will definitely serve your purpose. Works nicely with Mac
2,First of all build quality is very poor.It takes time to scan. Provided micro usb cable which does fit in the port.Had to purchase one locally to install.
4,Some colours can not identify by scaner and it's giving black and wilhite picture finally
5,Works amazing.

1,सेलर बेईमान (घटिया) है । और इसका जिम्मेदार Amazon है । Amazon घटिया सेलर के साथ काम करता है ।
1,"I had previously given a 5 star rating, but changing it now only after 2 days of use.The entire print has a grey undertone to it, and there are black bands on both edges of the paper.Have made repeated calls to Amazon to have the unit replaced, and they tell me that they have processed it, but no reply over email, no ticket number of the request or any communication regarding the replacement process. It feels like they are trying to stall so that the window to request replacement is over and I am stuck with a defective machine.Very disapoointed."
1,printer have manufactured defects. brother engineers say it physically damage. and it is now out of warranty. I am speechless. what a bad experience.
5,"This is a revolutionary product offering from Brother where in they have reduced the cost of printing in laser products similar to ink tank . The toner costs only 900 rs which is way cheaper than HP and canon toners which cost 4000 rs and the price of the prduct is also cheaper than HP and canon lasers. All in all a great product with god functionality and additional features like duplex printing. if you compare this to the top selling model in the market - hp 1005 , which is priced at 17k , this is a clear winner as it is multi function , plus duples , 3k cheaper plus cost of consumables is only 900 rs !!"
5,Awesome product got in just 11000 bucks a great deal and a great product.
1,Brother DCP-B7500D Multi-Function Centre with Automatic 2-Sided PrintingVERY BAD PRINTER & BAD SERVICE FOR SERVICE CENTER...DONT PURCHASE BRODHER PRODUCT......
4,"The print quality is great and it's quite fast too. Automatically prints both sides of the paper. Scanner and copier functions work fine. I had no trouble with installation. I'm quite surprised at the connectivity options though (the lack of them to be precise). It only has a USB port. And that's it. Not even an Ethernet port. If it had Wireless connectivity, it would have been ideal for me. But it doesn't. It's pretty expensive for what it has to offer, but it does print very well. I've had big problems with inkjet printers, and I've learnt that ink tank printers have problems with printer heads becoming bad in a year or so. So, laser was the only option for me. I don't print very often and I don't want to keep changing the cartridge  every time I want to use it. I hope it lasts a while - it looks quite sturdy."
1,"NEVER EVER PURCHASE THIS PRINTER, WORST EVER PRINTER I USED. PURCHASED 2 MONTHS BEFORE, CARTRIDGE AND DRUM DAMN LOW QUALITY"
5,Writing this review after two months of usage. Print quality is good. Its easy to install and I did not need an engineer from Brother to assemble it. Its very easy.  Printing speed is also good. Its easy to install and use. Scanner could be a bit faster. All in all its a good printer and great value for money. Very good for home or office use. Though I wish they had given some color options.
1,"this printer is after 5 months was given this xerox and print, every time change toner and their price is 1000 rs. I especially tell you didn't buy this printer"
5,Toner finished in only 12 days....i dont know how they said it print 2600 pages....i only printed arround 600 pages...It is completed one month again toner has finished by just taking fifteen pages daily...coste is 900...again we have to go on printing shop for cheapest print
5,Value for money...Very nice printer34 page per minute
5,"Having spent my life trying to get good prints from ink-jet printers, worrying of ink levels, getting my hands/clothes stained with ink and cost of cartridges, this Brother printer is now complete peace of mind, I have finally find found Nirvana. The duplex printing feature, the well designed backlit LCD with user-friendly menus, the auto wake-up and sleep, the fully covered bottom tray design, the 2 sided ID card copier on same page, clean backside, all are well designed features of this printer, go for it."
1,After using of 2 months the printer is asking for replacement of toner cartridge.Shall I have to refill or have to purchase a new one.Kindly suggest....
5,Best printer.Printing Speed is osmloaded with lots of features.User friendly software.Far better than HP Printers.
5,Very very best macheen i am very happy
5,"Super product without any problem, blindly trust in this printer if you are going to buy a new one. My first printer is from Hp but...after corona pandemic, i hate china and chinese products....so blindly trust in this japanese product."
3,Easy to install in computer. Print quality best. Price of toner is a little bit expensive as compared to the other models of brother.
1,"Brother after sale service is worst, after one month it's not working. To decline warranty brother company have many reasons."
1,"Second side printing is not working, paper always jams when both side print command is given. I brought it 5 days before only due to both side printing but not a good product for both side printing."
1,I only print 965 copies my printer toner is exhausted. It claims to print 2600pages but cant event print half the number of pages. Dont buy if considering cost effective printer else everything is fine.
1,Miss some line or words during printing
5,"After 5 days of use - Very much satisfied , thanks brother & Amazon for such beautiful product, I have a small business & it serves the needs perfectly, printing & copying is fast & perfect . Without any doubt go for it & brother is almost 110 years old company , Trust Brother . It will definitely make you Happy . 👍"
5,Best deal.  Waited for 10 days for price drop.  it fluctuated between 13000/- to 14500/- and finally purchased for 12500/-.  Best features among other similar printers.Delivered within less than 24 hrs.
5,"The printer has a good speed, The print quality is also very good ,the first toner given with the printer doesn't print up to the claimed 2600 pages."
2,"Ther is not wiFi.no EDF,Function is to difficult ."
5,"Yes, its on my side, my brother. Nice printer for professional work. As we need lot more prints due to Book Publishing work. Thanks amazon.in for prompt and secure delivery."
5,"1- QualityPrinter is very goodPrint quality is very fine2- User friendly3- Manual guide has perfectly explained each and every steps for installation. So, I have not faced any difficulty for installation."
3,Not at all value for money 1st cartridge over on only 1200 pages and it is mentioned 2800 pages  it cost appx 1.5rs per page not at all recommended.
4,"Does what it is supposed to do, really well.  But fit and finish not so great.  There are visible gaps and very tacky.  Also noisy during print.  But its a printer/scanner and it does its job really well."
3,Good Quality and easy to use
1,"Don't buy for business purpose,because 1 copy nearly 1.20 rupees,there is no possible change toner,cartridge change  every time (940/-)"
5,This machine is good quality but i fine out more cheaper price thats why i have return the printer
3,The product delivered is opened not seal  with brother tape  the seal is broken this is very disappointed for customer to received .
4,"Everything is good.but there is no official support for printing through mobile.However,u can use third party apps like NokoPrint for printing through mobile devices..."
4,Refilling ink cartridge is said to be not possible?
5,value for money
3,For printing it's a good product. Problem comes at the time of scanning multiple pages as the only drawback is it doesn't has the duplex scanning option.Overall it's a fine product.
5,"I purchased this printer in January 2020 , a month ago. It’s worth money spent. Only problem is of scanning of A5 or legal papers as the length of scanner glass do not support it. Installation is very easy."
3,"Three in one...Scan,print, Xerox for home use it's much useful for covid 19 epidemic situation.Print quality is excellent."
5,Very easy and yes value for money
4,"This is an amazing all in one printing-scanning-copying machine. Offers more than other models like HP.  Opted for this as it has an auto feeder, which makes copying/scanning of multiple pages much easy. In the HP machine, you had to insert and scan one page at a time. In this, you just load the pages on the feeder and it does it all automatically.The only downside was the default setup this machine comes with.  I would say its very user unfriendly. After spending few hours and browsing through all the forums and international Amazon site, I learnt how to set up this machine for best use. My printer was setup correctly, however on the wireless printing mode, it used to go to sleep mode after a few minutes, and none of my devices were able to detect the printer there after. This was a pain, as I had to eventually go to the machine and restart it to get it out of the sleep mode. Brother needs to fix this as not everyone is good with machines.Anyways, here is what you should do right after installing the software on your PC.EDIT: Before reading through the steps below. Make sure you update the firmware on the printer, as it might automatically solve the iissue. If it doesn't, then go through the steps. Firmware can be updated by downloading the Firmware update tool available here: http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadtop.aspx?prod=dcpl2541dw_as&c=as_ot&lang=en Go to the printer , Click on the Menu Button, and pull up ""Network"" settings using the buttons on the printer. Under that, go to WLAN and click on set up wizard. Use this to connect your printer to the router/wifi. Once you are connected, do the following steps.On your printer, press Menu button and :1. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP->Boot Method - Change it to Static2. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> APIPA - Change it to turn it OFF/Unchecked.3. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> IPv6 - Turn it ON.After following these steps, your printer will always stay connected to the network. If you don't follow these steps, then your printer will not show up while you try to wirelessly print/scan from your device(after few minutes of turning on the printer). I hope Brother sets up the machine to run these settings by default."
1,I strongly recommended you all dont buy very poor service from brother i purchase it before a month & i only 33 page print problem comes and 1 time motherboard changed but again problem come and no one listen even i call customer care but only delay delay delay from there sides
4,"First about price - >During Great Indian Festival Sale, I was able to get it at an unbelievable price of just Rs. 11600/- and considering its MRP is beyond 18000, its was just amazing. (10% bank discount+2k discount during lighting sale+1k cash back) Now About Delivery Experience -> Horrible. Order got lost during transit and after much request and followup Amazon ordered a new product for me at no additional cost. When the product did come after about 12 days, the delivery people were dropping the product box (which was again entirely sub-standard packing without any amazon boxing) as if it was a bag of cement.About the product ->Pros:1. A True All-in-One Laser Printer. If you do research before buying, its really hard to get every feature in a same printer. This is one such rare printer where you will get almost every feature which any average user can think of.2. The most useful feature among all is ofcourse the - Wifi & the ADF. Wifi allows you to print it from your laptop or mobile (or PC with wifi adapter). ADF allows you to copy documents by feeding them automatically. It saves a LOT of time than the conventional flatbed scanning and copying.3. It has Duplex Printing thus allowing to save time and paper both easily4. Setting up is easy just install using Drivers from CD provided or from the Website of Brother Printer and following the steps. Remember to update firmware as well.5. The Input tray is closed-type and can hold 250 pages6. At the risk of getting Warranty Void, Cartridge can be refilled as told by many. Haven't done it yet as I have just bought but YouTube is full of videos showing how to do it using any 3rd party toner powder.7. Fast and Decent Printing and Copying. Good Scanning as well.Cons:1. Costly. If compared to other brands it is costly. Toner and Drum are costly as well. But it has all features so I think its value for money.2. Cartridge cannot be refilled without getting Warranty Void. Brother Printers should provide Official Toner Powder for Refilling if not 3rd party ones.3. Delicate and a little flimsy. Quality of plastic is ok but parts are so delicate inside and out that you doubt about its durability.4. Drawing high electricity and hence cannot be used on UPS or even on most house-Inverters5. Wifi Setting up is glitchy and re-setting it up is a headache6. Noisy7.  No duplex Scanning. Only Duplex Printing. Thus while copying no use of auto-duplex feature. Auto-Duplex work only when printing.Verdict ->  If you get it within 15-16k ...go for it...Value for Money, fast and Heavy Duty Laser Printer"
5,It's Awesome.This Multifunction Printer is superb for Professionals. Printing speed and quality is really awesome and all other features add cherry on the cake.Packing of the product was fantabulous. Really well pracked with all sort of precautions taken.
1,I am an advocate by profession - this printer is not meant for advocates who requires to print pages on both the sides only on legal size papers. This is useless for me now. I am ready to sell it for half rate and the product is in warranty.
5,"I've ordered this multi function device for my home need and it does a fantastic job. Mostly I am using it for my kid's school assignments. The print quality, duplex printing option, Copy & scan function, Admin tool, etc is simply superb. It's easy to unpack, easy to install. The quality of the print is so neat. Device does not heat up too much and it's noise free operation. Wireless printing option is the added advantage because of which I can place the printer wherever I want and not necessarily in my working table.Initially I had some trouble in setting up the scanner function (it's my bad that I have used WiFi router's different frequency band in my laptop and in the printer so the scan was not working). I did not have time to explore by reading the [online] manuals so I casually emailed the customer care team just in case if they can send me a reply. Surprisingly, within 2 hours I got a call from them and they have assisted me in screen-sharing mode of all complete set of options available in all functions, the features, setting up various printing options, etc. It was like a one simple online demo. I am super happy and satisfied with this purchase. I will definitely recommend."
1,"U can't use without problem, regular problemsDefectives: adf reader stucks, line come on print out page, images come black, repair man from company can't solve problemAdvantages: super connecting WiFi, scan is good , customer care giving good service"
5,"Everything good except wifi direct printing from mobile.All type of printing and coping features works wellTakes 10-15 seconds while startup and then prints very fast.Bought only 10 days before so cant say about durability.Brother iprint &scan app on android is very very slow to work with while printing.I used many hp deskjets and inktank printers, all gave me mental tortures time to time  but this printer looks like my real friend i was looking for."
4,"First of all my reasons of buying this printer: (a) I don't print a lot; the inkjet and ink tank printer head clogs up if not used regularly (b) I hardly print colour but when I do, I wish quality (c) I wanted full networking - Ethernet/Wireless (d) I wanted ADF for scanning/copying and auto duplex printing. This printer ticked all requirements.The printer arrived today (20-Sep-2020). This is my very first observations review. I will update after 4-6 months.  The print quality is superb as with most laser printers.[A] Packaging & Unpacking: Printer comes with toner in sealed bag, USB cable, the main guide + CD ROM in a pouch, and very neatly packed in the huge box. It had sticker tapes to prevent movement of parts. The quick instruction sheet (A1 size) had neat explanation. There were no issues while unpacking. I installed the toner cartridge in a zilch. The printer is nearly 10 kg and must be ""installed"" at a fixed place - fairly heavy. It is bulky too like most laser printers.Rating: 5/5.[B] Setup and installation: The printer comes with a CD ROM. Most laptops today don't have a CD-ROM drive. Not a big issue. I downloaded the s/w from Brother website. I wanted to connect the printer over ethernet. I am fairly competent at networking having setup my complete home network with cable model, wifi router, wifi repeater, a NAS, assigning static IP addresses to important devices, etc. Printer must have a static IP address. I connected the printer via ethernet cable expecting automatic recognition and DHCP address assignment. But I had trouble figuring this out. I could finally enable the Wired Networking on. I enabled Wireless as well and manually set that up. All this one has to on the printer, using menu and +/- and OK keys. It is tedious.[C] Usage. I was able to print from laptop with no issues once the printer was setup. I have heard about the ""wake up from sleep"" issue. I did not face this issue either. After a good 45 minutes, I printed another page, the printer did take time to wake up but it was not showing offline. Maybe because I have to networked via ethernet. I could scan a legal size page using the ADF - no issues. I was facing this issue with my older Epson L210 printer.[D] Print from mobile. I was able to print from Samsung M30 and M31 with absolutely no issue. No ""wake up"" problem. The small irritating issue is that paper size defaults to ""Letter"" in mobile print option. But it is a mobile phone issue.[E] Amazon delivery: Great as always. Delivered in one day in spite of COVID issues.So far, I am fairly pleased. I am docking 1-star off for installation difficulty."
5,"Awesome quality printer under 16 to 17 k.. Best product from brother. I use various printer from various company,but this one is the best.. Thanks amazon and brother"
1,Performance very bad! Lines appearing while scanning & paper getting stuck after just two to three Printouts! Waste of time & money!Pls send your experienced engineer to set it up properly this Sun 10th June!
5,We are using this totally good. Compare with other brands it's 90 present dust free.
1,I strongly recommended you all dont buy very poor product. i purchase it before a month and motherboard changed(Installed  DCP-L2540DW instead of DCP-L2541DW)..Its Very big lie..
1,"*WARNING*: Amazon does not accept returns on this product. If you see the return button option, it will not accept it, rather the call will go to Amazon customer service which will say that returns are not possible. So the return button is highly misleading. Once you buy, you are going to be stuck with this product.As for the printer: It's problematic when a bygone era product is disguised as ""WiFi"" printer. Setup of WiFi is torturous. Connecting is painstakingly difficult. Keep the connection on is chore. The printer randomly goes to sleep mode.  WIFI once connected, forgets the connection, you have to go through the whole process again. Who have designed this monstrosity?If you are thinking that this is a WiFi printer: It's not easy to use the WiFi!Pros: Seems well made from outside. Test print had good quality. That is the only pro.Cons are many:WiFi printing is a hilarious joke. Not possible for average user, i would say difficult for even a little tech savy user.WiFi printing by Android is very difficult and does not work fast. If you want 5 copies, printer will keep displaying recieving data for eons, and then print one. The next one will then start ' recieving data' for a while and print. I was wrinting this review, and for being silent for a 5 mins the printer printed the 5th copy.Brother customer service in Pune: 3 phone numbers, none of them working.Brother customer service number : call any time you are 10th in the line.I tried to solve the problem by diving deep in my router settings, YouTube videos, internet forums etc. However can a average person have time to do this? Also why should I do this in the first place. I paid more that 17k to do hours of search?I have never reviewed a product this badly.And I can't even return this."
5,This is an absolutely great network printer for a small or medium sized office. It does duplex printing and will print on A4 or Legal Sized paper amongst other options. It has a nice large toner store so it will go for a long while before needing a refill and it does auto scanning as well as photocopying. I haven't had to get the ink refilled yet so I don't know how easy or cumbersome that is or how well that works.It's definitely better than anything I've used from HP or Canon.Note: Do check online about disabling sleep mode because some people have complained about that. When it goes to deep sleep if you give a print command it won't print unless you go to the printer and wake it up. I disabled it and I haven't had any issues.
4,"Firstly, since I was confused, this printer can handle legal size paper- print, copy and scan.Easy to set up the printer. Wireless is a bit tough to set, but once you're done, it works perfectly. Prints are great including the ones on Legal Size Paper. Scanning could have been faster, but can't complain much at this price. Photocopy is absolutely hassle free. ADF works great. I'll update the review after exhausting the first cartridge."
4,In with WiFi connecting my model is DCP L-2541DW..but it showing in display DCP L- 2540...Pls.clarify this..and there is no hologram to check the item whether it is zenune product or not....and one hook is not fitted correctly.... Pls give clarity... Item arrived in time...good service....
5,"Best printer. Much better than hp or samsung. There is no other feature left  other than color printing which a printer can have. It has adf, wireless printing and scanning that works flawlessly, copying and print speed is the best at 30ppm. Very easy to use nad setup. It has a very good range of wifi connectivity.  Got it for just rs.12000 in amazon great india festival."
3,"The print quality is about average, when compred to a simple HP 1020 printer.The speed of copying is very fast - photocopy is great. The speed when printing over wifi from iphone is slow, however from macbook or pc is as fast as usb (almost).Looks like its heavy duty stuff. The auto document feeder works flawlessly so far.The screen is dot matrix. I was expecting a more user friendly coloured lcd screen , like you get on inket brother printers. The options are hard to get and toggle with as its like a calculator screen which is outdated.So i like it , it does the job, and is sturdy. It also has a good deal of storage for sheets , so u dont have to refill paper too often."
4,Print quality is great. It is quite easy to install but if you are a non techie person it might me a bit tough. There no wireless printing issue. If you want to get the best wireless connection you need to set it up with a computer. It’s a great printer for its price. It is go to printer is you are a home user who prints 5to 10 pages per month as the the is no issue of ink drying like inkjet printer.
1,"Worse after sale service by Amazon,seller ,brand.Installation specifically written free of cost still brand ( brother) charging 500+ gst for installation n demo.Inspite complaints to Amazon n seller Neither of two concern about it. Amazon wants we to make complaints , writing mails instead self action.if owner of Amazon is viewing this my review please get into it on property to avoid negative publicity of Amazon.This is my last purchase from Amazon.Thanks..."
5,At this price point this is simply a wonderful printer with Wireless as well as Duplex feature. The only challenge is the LCD screen which is too small so installing the printer on the WLAN is bit of challenge especially when it comes to typing in the WLAN password. One needs to use the arrow keys provided on the right of the screen to navigate through the keyboard one charachter at a time.Barring this installing this printer on the wireless network was a breeze and hassle free.
1,"The photocopy machine (Brother DCP-L2541DW) which we have purchased from Amazon India, that said machine is damaged and poor quality."
2,"I bought this printer thinking its good tech and is wifi printing enabled, but the printers wifi settings constantly gives trouble. Everytime, we have to call customer service which charges money for every visit despite being in the first year of warranty. Better to go with companies like HP that are mass printers and don't give these problems"
5,"Earlier I gave a good review of the product but I was proven completely wrong. Printer needed service 3 times in 6 months for the same problem. Service engineer attended every time promptly, opened up the printer, scraped a few electronic points using a screwdriver and got it working. After the last service, there was no go. it still does not work and is in warranty. More so, Brother India senior management does not respond to emails nor do they take action. Avoidable, that all I would say."
5,"Amazing Japanese build quality. Easy to set up and use with minimalistic buttons. Its a black and white printer and does its job well. As long as you do not have children with heavy art project requirements, then then this is the perfect home home office printer for a working professional."
3,"It s a reasonably decent multifunctional printer and operates alright. However, do not buy if you want to connect wirelessly. The wireless network configuration and the connectivity are very unreliable and do not work for more than a few hours. You will have to repeatedly reconfigure the network configuration by selecting your Wifi Network SSID and entering the password/key using a hard to use interface."
5,"Great quality prints and very efficient system overall. If I get this on a discount, iTunes completely worth the purchase. I've been a HP user for many years, and I was fed up or changing printers and paying for expensive cartridges. Brother does a great job overall. I may update my review after one year of use. So far it has heen working really smooth."
3,"Print quality is nice but have to face lot of jerks for the installation. Setting up of port via switching on both Wifi button on the printer and WPS button on the router doesn't work and had to install through brother support. Moreover, if would need a copy of one side and two sides, the process is herculine and not automatic where I felt a lot of pain."
1,"don't buy this printer there have some technical issue like1, when we use refile cartage printer showing replace toner anytime on display and PC too where printer setup software installed.2, printer going on sleep mode after 1 hour,  and if printer in sleep mode printer not taking command for printing and scanning too after rebooting you can use again3, Cheques printing mode not in this printer, you can't print cheques4, technical service support also not good.5, You can't use Refiled cartage with in Warranty period. if you used refilled cartage Brother not give you service free service relented printing quality issue."
2,Well they advertise it as with wi fi printer but it's wi fi capabily hardly work. It rarely can work flawlessly on wi fi. Installing driver using wi fi is a hit or miss. Mobile app is DAMN slow and impossible to our practically.Please note that I am absolutely comfortable with setting up technical stuffs and I do understand how such devices work.
1,"After installing this printer, my Modem now only allows one device at a time to connect to wifi broadband.Earlier it used to allow multiple devices to connect.Otherwise there is no issue with this printer. It can be a bit slow in copying data over wireless from mobile but that is not an issue for me"
4,"I have been using this printer for 3 months, The print quality is awesome sometimes papers stuck for 1 sided prints but except that issue I didn't feel any bad thing about this product,I thought it would acan legal size papers but it doesn't, overall good product ."
5,"I bought the Brother DCP L2541DW laser printer a few days back. I am really impressed by its performance. This is my first Brother product, and I was really apprehensive to switch brands because I have been a fan of another brand for many years. However, my experience with Brother multifunction printer amazed me. The quality, ease of use and intuitive features are some of the advantages that I have noticed. It has wi-fi, auto duplex printing and many other features. If you own a small business or if you are a home user who has lot of print, scan, photocopy requirements, I would definitely recommend this Brother printer. It is affordable and easy to use. If you are a bit tech savvy, you can set it up yourself."
3,"The print quality does not Look like a Laser print quality , it is more likely a inkjet printer quality .Dissatisfied with the feedback. Just make sure if you want to invest such a huge amount for a inkjet type of printing ."
4,A bulky printer. The toner last for about 1600 prints only. And a replacement cost RS 3500/- Quite expensive. After sales service is poor. They are not prompt and take their own time to resolve the issues.
1,"While printing on a letterhead there are weird artifacts all over the paper. The service technician told us that this is ""normal"" as the printer is a ""hot roller"" one, whatever that means. His solution was not to print on letterheads but only on plain paper.We are going to take further action against this."
4,I have two printers variant one of is HP brand M126NW and another one is this DCP-L2541DW these both are like similar but BROTHER one is best with good connectivity and quality even speed is super as compare with hp one go with it blindly if u really need good printer .Order with Amazon always best Thanks to amazon service for bring this on time
5,"Perfect. ADB and dual side printing is awesome.Just one problem , it cant hold more than 14 to 15 pages print in continuous printing it starts falling off so you have to manually remove many time printing large documemt."
5,The best multifunction BW laser printer in the class when compared to HP MFP126nw and the canon pixma. It has auto duplex printing and the ADF is a great option to have. Can scan upto 35 sheets very fast.
1,The product is very slow. Takes 10 to 15 seconds to scan a single page and at this cost u can buy two scanner and printers which aren’t portable but surely works faster. The products drivers and softwares are on a CD!! Who in this era uses laptops with CD readers. If a consumer is buying 11000₹ portable scanner it is not a wrong assumption to make that he or she is using a very sleek modern age laptop which this product is totally useless with. And how amazon baits you into this is by saying that u cant return this product u can only replace it with same product!!! Total wastage of money
5,"If you have a fast life where documentation is a main factor all the time,or if you have to take important documents from here to there,this is a perfect item for you. Simple,fast and very easy to use. You will get options for scanning. Both side scan will save your time and effort. From voter card to old document,you keep a copy of everything in your laptop. Just plug and play. Or you can install povided software. Driver of the scaner should be installed first. It is a recommended product from me."
5,Easy to use.  Now due to coronavirus physical courts are closed and efiling cases are started.  This product is easy to use and scanned legal size papers both side at a time.  20 pages are automatic document scan is also most useful feature of this product.  Plug and play.  I suggest every advocate to buy and use this product
1,"False Discounts.Seller has no responsibility.They sell,do not provide warranty card or details by Amazon's funded sellers.Amazon leaves it to yourself to resolve.The customer care acts as big dada.This is second time I have faced Amazon for their profit are encouraging sellers to sell anything."
5,Have been using it for three months. Very fastband smooth operation. Double side scanning. Excellent ediiting by the accompanying software.
5,Excellent Product
5,Very useful. Scans what and however you want.
5,"It’s made in Japan product , so no worry about quality and durability. Just Plug and Scan"
5,It is a very good product. Picture quality is so clear and easy to install.
5,Very fast scanner. Both colour and black and white are available.
5,"Very good product by canon, you can easily handle it."
5,"For dedicated scanning, quick,efficient, easy-to-use"
5,Portable scanner for legal paper scanning.
5,Amazing product. Very compact and fast. Resolution is also appropriate. Delivery was on time. Probably the best of all I have searched in the Amazon.
5,Amazingly quick. If you change the setting to 150dpi. Takes 3 to 5 seconds. Clarity is good. Automatically saves in a folder date wise.
2,It was just like an opened and used one. Nothing in company's original packing. If Amazon wants its name its ok but manufaturer's original packing must be there. It makes difficult to furtger sale the product
1,This scanners should not be used as ADF and should not be loaded with more than 1 or 2 papers at one time. If u load then the paper which are loaded will get ink smears on the top side. Thus the original documents will be damaged. If u want to scan one after another paper then it is suitable. Not an ADF as described by canon. Leave alone 10 papers. It is not possible without damaging the originals
4,"Pros: Delivered in time. Setup is easy. Liked Mobile app feature. Did test prints and satisfied. Got full volume of ink in default print cartridges, which are 680 series. These cost RS 1150 as combo, for kind information to co-custumers.Cons: The power socket was wobbling, a poor design. But I managed with a tape inside so it holds good. This is on the down side.Caution: Any printer goes for a toss as the time passes because of dust accumulation. I had the experiences of dysfunction of wifi connection, double side printing, paper injection mechanism etc. This is my 4th printer in series. Bought printer cover as well because for me dust control is top priority given the worst experiences in the past.Value for money at the price of RS 5999/. Flipkart sells at RS 4999 or 5199. Amazon should compete here.Trust the above helps."
3,"My cartridge ink is over within a week, I have not taken even 100 prints also. Never used color as well. Bad quality cartridge. False promise on the number of prints it gives."
3,Print quality is good but the cartridge performace is so poor. Just print 75 paper and cartridge  empty.
5,Got the product with no cartridge and with one used cartridge in machine where black was empty and color was half.....also packing of old quality as if used piece
1,Worst product . Especially software for this product is very poor.Need 8 apps to run a simple printer.That too tiring steps that will take almost one day for successful installation if you are lucky.Cursing my self for buying this.Please buy some other PrinterI am using printers for past 20 years never faced such a tragedy
3,This is the position of the catridge after just one print. Totally dissatisfied with the catridge quality. Installation is way too easy. Printing directly from smartphone is also easy. Nice product but useless catridges.
1,"1 Printer Cartridge will print ~80-100 pages(one side only) only and that too when we took print in Economic mode, Plus if you try any hack to refill cartridge...It would not work at all. Every time you have to buy cartridge of Rs. 650-750 range... If u r ready to spend Rs. 8-10 per page(single side) you can go for it. They are earning money by selling highly priced cartridges and low cost printers...It is a trap..Don't buy, our most regretted shopping ever."
1,"Bought this product absolutely two months back, Now i am getting a error msg on the screen Cartridge is not compatible with this printer, and when i talk to the Hp Customer care and this is one of the worst customer support that they got. They are asking me to buy a new Cartridge, Very Funny.......Simple Words, Only worth for Two Months, If you got an extra day or Month you are very lucky.....Worst Product, and More Worst Customer Support..."
1,"It so harrasing ,not easy to set up ,it takes more time and total disappointed"
4,"Printing quality is very impressive, you can choose up to various printing modes like draft, normal & best, you can directly print by hp smart app from your phone, there is a mobile fax option too, Printing speed is also fast but not very fast, main problem I m facing is an alignment problem in an input tray, whenever I want one print out then additional sheets also come in an output tray automatically sometimes though they are not printed but still it's frustrating.  Overall it's a good printer by hp."
5,"Easy to handling and good connectivity throught WiFi and Easy to install and good product to use and maintain easy. Category also 680/- RS something, both black nd white and colour"
1,Very poor quality product. The printer was making loud noise and yesterday its stop working. I hardly printed 10 sheets. Yesterday when I was trying to Print a page i found its making a loud noise and on opening the front panel i found that cartridge was banging left and right and then came the shock i found two pieces of a platstic strip. On research i found it is called encoder strip. I am frustrated and don't know how to fix it.
5,Nice printer for home use at this price. Printing speed is little bit slow however for home use it's manageable. Overall printing quality is good.I am not sure how much prints we can get from one set of cartridge but as of now we took 50 prints and still the cartridge showing 75%.
1,"I received a very  cheap quality printer as i used only for one time second time it was not getting on, as I came to know  that mother board is out of service,worst! pls think before buying it."
4,"Althoughh the printer is very good, the promised extra black cartridge has not been sent along with the printer.the gift voucher of Rs. 1000/- which can be used in BATA  and other outlets not enclosed. Please arrange for immediate compliance."
5,"So far good prints. Didn't use high quality paper till now so can't give any review on that. 80 gsm paper prints are good. Good for school projects. Loving the scanner. Document feeder is a relief when scanning multiple papers. Photocopy print quality is manageable, definitely not great. Great thing is any material can be scanned, ofcourse that shouldn't exceed A4 size and shouldn't be sharp. I scanned the front of a purse and it came out very nice."
3,Not see
5,"I was confused with Canon pixma E560 and HP 3835 but after searching all reviews and HP support system I bought HP. Only disadvantage with this is that it does not have auto duplex feature. But other good features like print speed/no. pages weigh down that disadvantage. Go for it if you are looking for long term, home/small office use wireless printer."
1,"The product looks good and also i dont have any complain for quality but the issue is with the cost per print, i have installed 3 sets of cartridges and in one set not able to print more than 15 - 17 pages, so its better not to print anything on this, its a showcase product for me now... i strongly suggest not to but this product"
5,OUTSTANDING PRODUCT FROM HP VERY SATISFIED AND ULTRAFAST DELIVERY FROM AMAZON I ORDERED IT YESTERDAY IT SHIPED TODAY AT 12:02 AM AND GOT IT TODAY AT 4:42 PM VERY ULTRA FAST DELIVERY FROM AMAZON I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT ALL THE FEATURES ARE EASY AND USEFUL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE READING MY COMMENT TRUST ME IT IS THE OUTSTANDING PRODUCT FROM HP NO ISSUES WITH HARDWARE SYSTEM ALSO ACCEPTS IT EASILY YOU CAN BUT IT
5,Overall I am satisfied with this product. Did not check print quality for an image.Pros1. Value for money in this price range2. Easy to install3. Looks great4. Touch displayCons1. Copy quality is not sharp2. Eprint feature is not easy to configure. You need to assign static IP on your printer to use this feature.3. “Print anywhere” feature is not available on this model. The HP smart app on the mobile detects printer only on home network where the printer is available.
1,"This is one of the worst printers from hp. Installation, connection, ease of use everything is fine. BUT IT JUST DOES NOT PRINT IN COLOUR. I have been wasting days with tech support trying to resolve the issue, but nothing has happened till date. I asked for a replacement, they behave as if they can't even read that line. They just keep making case ids after case ids.I've been using hp printers for over 2 decades, never had any single issue with any of them.IF YOU WANT A HASSLEFREE PRINTER... PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER... REST IS YOUR CHOICE!"
5,"I bought it around 3 weeks ago, and found it really useful and up to the good standards. So far no problem. HP Smart print app enables print from anywhere. Dedicated printer email id enables me to print anything by sending the document to hpeprint.com email address.The size of the printer was a little larger than I expected, but that's fine. Also, not sure if anyone uses Fax these days.Overall a good buy."
5,Product is really good but No extra Black ink included
1,"2 days after buying the product i m facing printing issue for which i tried to contact to HP service care but they are just saying that , your call will be transferred to so called senior. and after that i waited for half an hour then they disconnect the call. this happens every time.when i asked that why u r not connecting after tranfering the call then they replied that its not my problem.who is responsible for it?now i will take some leagal action against it if i will not be served within 2 days."
2,"Print quality is great, very easy to install and operate but within two months of purchase the document feeder stopped working. Without document feeder we cannot copy legal size paper. This ghe major flaw I have faced using this printer otherwise ig is great."
4,Good product but connecting online with devices is bit of challenge. It appears apple devices synced very fast but windows taking time.
1,"Overall NOT Recommended.-Dosent work with Phones-Useless App doesn't work at all-Scanner is not working, App Dose not Support.Wasted loads of time make it work.-Dead Slow Printing-Does not work with Phones."
3,"Cons:Not worth the money. Problems with colour printing-sometimes it prints in grayscale. Driver needs to be reinstalled every time this issue occurs. There is no option to select colour and grayscale separately which means a colour document will always print in colour. It uses a lot of ink for colour prints. The power connector is loose.Pros:ADF is a great feature reducing manual work.Overall, if you do not need adf, you can always go for a cheaper model like 2621. HP as a brand is good and my previous model 2545 served for 7 years without many issues but this model certainly has its own problems and it is definitely overpriced."
1,Printer is extremely slow even from Laptop via WIFI. It takes ages to print. Want to get it replaced or corrected.Any help ? It does not respond at times and looks a complete waste of money.
4,"A great printer. Scans well, prints fast, works good online and offline. Connectivity options are best. The best part is the email id of the printer. We can send the documents via email directly to the personal email id of printer and it prints automatically.The problem is with the direct wifi connection. Prints takes too much time or often fails to print incase of wifi direct connection.Second thing which should be improved is the mobile app of the printer. App only shows some specific folders of internal storage. There is no option to find the documents stored in sd card memory. I can say app is a disaster while compared to printer functions.And yes, i like the touch screen as well."
4,"Scanning via Auto Document Feeder scans random parts of the page. No solution from HP support till date. This is an inherent flaw in this model that HP knows about since many years and has still not fixed it. You can see several threads about this problem in the HP forums, just google it. Other than this issue it works fine"
3,It's been exactly two months since I've purchased it... I'd not recommend it for colour prints since this really has too many issues. What I mean is that investment is really too high to what you get in return! Though I'd like to mention that the black and white print outs are Good and it is easy to install and use once you get it installed in all the aspects! I'd rather suggest everyone reading my review to invest in some ink tank printer cause it would be a one time investment and returns would be good!
4,"The printer is very good. Quality of print is nice. Installation is very easy as well. You will get lots of vedio in YouTube related to installation. One issue is that if you try to scan multiple documents at one go from top, the scanned pdf gets most of the images and data cropped. This issue is being reported by multiple user and whatever workaround given by HP didn't not work. So basically the multiple image scanning at one go functionality was not properly tested by HP before the product release. But if you are scanning individual document by opening the copier lid, it works fine.Apart no other issue. Printer is awesome for home use."
1,I get the order faster and then i used it for 2 days and 3rd days it's stoped working i don't know what's to do whether take it to hp care or return to get replacement .... I taken it to hp care .. after one week they handoverd it to me and again it's stoped working .....In hp care they suggested me to DON'T BUY AT ONLINE . Because they have sample items ... Ugh worst ever ..
4,"After using the 3830 extensively, got this. The usual HP issues with the cartidges being short on ink and running out just when you need them the most is present in this as well. What peeved me the most was the intermittent and unreliable printing over direct Wi-Fi or over the home network. Perhaps it's my printer, or something else.Why buy this? Document feeder for scanner. If you need to scan multiple pages, the document feeder is valuable feature.Also, re-filled cartidges can be used if needed. Don't go with the rated prints, you'll get about 150-200 B&W pages on the regular 640 cartridge and 120-130 pages on the color."
4,"This works well... initial setup is not cumbersome...better to connect to a computer and do the setup i recommend from my experience.. firmware update is necessary to enable the scan feature(in my case ).. print quality is ok ok , print alignment is not that great,may get better later I think.. copy black and color both works fine, quality is also good..."
1,"Cons and only cons1. Gave print in Black and white, it is printing in color.2. Too slow. Description mentioned 8 ppm for black white print. It is hardly 3 ppm.3. Black cartridge got over with mere 60 prints.4. HP Smart doesn't know what is happening to the printer.I have to find a way to return this god-awful product."
5,I purchased HP Deskjet 3835 All-in-One printer from Amazon 2 months ago and my review is based on my experience what I got from it.Pros-I myself installed the product and I had no problem installing that as I got irritating people printed with manual.Pages printing qualities superb and decent timing is taken to print a page.It is good for home purposes.(My opinion-you can go this for this printer it's good pages printing quality is also excellent .It can scan copy fax its wireless also can use it through mobile also using its app available on play store).@3999Cons-ink is little bit getting drained.
1,"Really bad quality product from HP and pathetic support.The paper gets jammed every time I try to print. (Se picture attached).I contacted HP support, the support engineers came after a week. They initially said a part is faulty, but later didn't change it. They said its fixed no need to replace the part. In few days the paper jam issue started happening again.Its really painful to contact, first they will make you talk to a bot. After 30 mins of chit chatting with the bot, if your session isn't timed out, you will receive the support phone number."
4,"Product is good did what it meant for, only suggestion is if they provide step by step how to install in PC and Android phones will be more easy for users"
5,Very useful
4,good
5,"I bought this for registering my father's jeevan praman . Installation is easy just follow the instructions and proceed, packing and delivery was good.

5,"after sales service is pathetic, service center in faridabad is pathetic, useless service center, i had to wait for 25 days for replacement of defective cartridge. after sales service has to be improved, need to improve service centers.HP 2332 Deskjet Colour Printer is Superb, Fantastic, Excellent, very nice looks."
5,Excellent product with good well packed... Very very satisfied.... Print catridge cost also lower than any ink advantage catridge.... BLINDLY GO FOR THIS PRINTER ONLY FROM AMAZON AS IN FLIPKART FAKE BRAND SOLD BEWARE...
5,"Easily the best printer in this price range. Bought it for 3.1kHuge upgrade over my old printer. Fast printing speed, no smudges, extremely good print quality. The scan quality is also extremely good. Scanned images have proper color ration and reproduction.The setup took a little more time than expected. Other than that, awesome machine."
3,"A little about this printer:1) Build quality: 3/5 - flimsy and prone to paper jams if paper is not inserted carefully.2) Scan quality: 4/5 - really impressed with this one.3) Print quality: 3/5 - OK for casual use. Not great, not bad either.4) Software and drivers: 3/5 - installs a lot of unnecessary plugins, which cannot be unselected during installation. You have to manually remove each one after installation (e.g FTP plugin, Dropbox plugin, etc.)5) Cartridges: 1/5 - no surprises here... 6 prints in, and the provided cartridges' ink levels have already dropped to 75%.6) Additional points - unlike Canon, HP has its own Android app to print from a mobile phone via USB OTG cable, so that's a plus.Since I only use a printer/scanner for emergencies (2-3 prints a month), I always go for the cheapest option, which in this case was this one for Rs. 3099/-. The only difference between HP DeskJet 2331 and 2332 is the colour (the former is violet-white and this one is grey-white) so grab whichever is cheaper. Inkjet printers are a scam in general - the printers are cheap but the cartridges are crazy expensive and the ink runs out before you can say the word 'PRINT'. If you're the type who prints a lot, better go for a laser printer. They are more cost efficient in the long run."
5,Excellent product for home use....you can print around 120pages in black and white...and 100pages in colur...if you are rich then use new cartridges....all the times....but if you are not then...buy hp oroginal inks.....and fillup the cartridges...each time...with injection.....this will let you to print 6000 pages in 600Rs ...wherelse if you use cartridges...then you can print only 120pages in 600 rupeesThank you.
1,This was the worst printer i have ever ordered.  Please dont buy this product at all. This product's ink cartridge finishes in less than month and with less than 100 prints. And if you buy a new cartridge then it will cost approx 1300 rs if bought of hp. That means it will cost approx half of the printer. Which means 1300 rs for just 100 prints. I would rather get it photocopied from a shop instead. 13rs per page . And I'm also very disappointed in hp co. Which is producing this product.  And  please consult any printer seller about this product and you definitely won't find any advantage.Its totally not worth the money .
5,"If you are doing regular printing or official work then I would not recommend this, as this does not have ADF.But if you print sometimes or occasionally like me for admit cards. train / plane tickets or other docs, then go for it. It has what it says, print, scan and copy features both color and black & white, I havee done all, no issues and comes at much lower price and that too from HP. So it is a good deal overall for home use.Before using it make sure to remove all tapes inside as well as outside (there will be a manual for it in package so don't worry), slide the shifter where you put blank pages as it is not adjusted for A4 sized papers, load the cartridges properly (comes with the printer and easy to load as well)  and register the product & install the software & drivers for it from HP site."
1,"The page started getting stuck from the very first day. Not a very good product from hp.As if having this printer is not bad enough the customer services sucks. It is like adding insult to injury. There is no way to contact seller to fix the issue, only channel of communication was Amazon's canned response chat, and that was pathetic as it didn't even give me option to list my issues.It just kept on cycling through the same responses.I'd give negative reviews if I could. AVOID AT ALL COSTS - NOT ONLY THIS PRINTER BUT THE SELLER AS WELL."
3,The look of the printer was great but the connection was vry poor when iwas connected to the laptop or phone . Other than the connection the remaining was great .
1,"Don't buy HP products. Learnt the hard way.Firstly this product will not work with latest mac version, at least I could not get it to work after spend 3 hours trying everything possible in hp site and other internet suggestions. HP customer care is absolutely pathetic. They will receive the call and pretend that they are not able to hear. So, forget any support from HP.Now amazon will say the the OS mentioned in the product is windows 10.7 so any other OS is your problem. There are answers here telling this product works with mac and even in HP site it is mentioned this series does not need a driver for mac (mac is preinstalled with the drivers) and can print/scan. But I doubt it works with the latest mac OS, maybe it works with older versions.My suggestion is avoid this unless you use windows 10.7 as you will not get any help from Amazon or HP.Also, preferably buy a wireless printer as that way you can try printing from your ipad or mobile other than you laptop, but for this wired dumbbox there's not much to do"
1,Product is not installing in my laptop. And neither I am able to replace the product nor I am getting any technical assistant help.
4,"I just received my printer today. After printer set up and driver installation,  I am providing my review.  I am very happy with the packaging,  printing and xerox quality. Though scanning quality is okay, can't say it superb. To conclude,  good printer at INR 3,099/-."
1,"Order was delivered in a day by Amazon. Great work. But the printer installation is so 90s work. You need to physically go to HP site, download drivers and complete the installation. Who does all this in 2021? But here, HP wants you to waste 2 hrs to do all of this. And then too, you cannot be sure that copies would be printed. Took me another 15 min to figure out why the hell scanner is working but printer is not- inspite of installing everything correctly as per the process. Absolutely disgusting. Pls don't go for this. Invest in buying somehting non-HP."
1,The printer is worst.And not returnable or refundable.My 3100RS are wasted.Please whoever it is of you are reading this comment I request you to not buying it.Go for Epson or Canon or Brother printers instead of this.
4,"Works fine for the price I paid as an entry level printer . Needed to do a few prints during WHF and supports that perfectly. Once you get the drivers downloaded and setup it works fine . Need to restart the laptop from time to time when prints don’t go through but I think it’s a common software issue I’ve faced with another HP deskjet printer tooI had to order ink cartridges again as the ones supplied are just for starting and don’t have a lot of ink , so if you plan on printing a lot it makes sense to order that when your buying the printer"
1,"I wanted a printer for occasional use that would be economical also , so basis the description went ahead with this one. It says it comes with a preloaded cartridge ( black and colour) and can print 100 pages with one cartridge ( black ). I printed max 15 pages in first use ( 12 black and white and 3 colour). The next time I had to print something was a month later and the cartridge was out of ink already even though the levels were still showing the same as before. By the way the ink levels were showing low even when the printer was installed after delivery. I didn’t have the time to fight with Amazon for that so just let it go. It’s the worst ever experience and so disappointing to see Hp and Amazon both get away by selling such a shoddy product and also cheating the customer by sending almost empty catridges with a new product ( also doubtful because the printer had some dust marks but Amazon wasn’t ready to exchange and wanted to dump another one which we denied ). Please don’t buy this printer from Amazon and if you do please ensure to check if the cartridge is full."
5,Nice printer easy to use . Just install drivers before using in laptop . Got for only 3100 . I like the product as it is best for home usage but yes it is going to little bit costly in term of refilling.
1,"Don't buy the printer, very bad experience over last two months.Update after using for few months:Print quality is getting worse despite running clean and alignment often with new cartridges.Both color and black printer cartridges cost about Rs 2500 each time since the default one that comes with printer doesn't last longer. You will end up spending several thousands of rupees on cartridges alone since this printer wastes ink and lot of pages with misprints as well as doesn't give good yield.I have been using several models of HP printers for more than 25 years.Doesn't work with Mac OS, works with Windows 10 only but takes a while to get the printer installed.Doesn't print anything some times.When it decided to print it takes forever to print a page most of the time.Doesn't get connected most of the time.Can't print resolutions above 300 most of the time.Haven't come across such basic printer in last 25 years."
1,"The product isn't good at all. They don't have a return policy, it takes lifetime to print a copy incase it decides to print or else it doesn't majority of the times."
4,"Writing review after a month. The print quality is good for general printing and also for photo printing on glossy papers. I printed almost 80 black and white pages and about 10 color pages. Yeah, the black cartridge is empty now. And by watching YouTube videos I refilled my black cartridge , with Aprodot ink (cost around Rs. 120) and it worked well. (Just put ~3 mL of ink in cartridge hole by a syringe). The printer costs me Rs. 3300.Overall good printer ... better if you buy a wireless printer else it is awesome. And don't believe if anyone says refilling a cartridge don't work , as long you would take necessary precautions (just watch YouTube video) it will work fine.JUST AN ADVICE - Cover your printer with cloth whenever you aren't using it :)"
4,It's nice product for commercial as well as for private use...I personally used it...worth for money...but it is china made...and there is no bluetooth or wifi connectivity...so I feel this 2 disadvantages...but overall very nice product..go for it
1,"This is about the HP AIO Desk jet printer  2332, I bought on Amazon  on 16th of Nov 2020.The claimed printer print yield is 120 pages Black & White.  Now, on 2nd of Dec'20, little over two weeks, I have so far printed about 55 pages , only text (no graphics so far) and Black and white.. and the printer reports no Black Ink.50 Pages per cartridge is atrocious; outright loot and doesn't even meet the claimed product specifications as per HP (120 pages). My print need is about 150-200 pages per month, mostly B&W.. and @ 750 per Black cartridge, every month I cannot invest Rs 1500 to Rs 2150 on Black cartridges alone... the Printer cost itself if Rs 3,000/-. HP IS LOOTING  CUSTOMERS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. But this is too much...@ claimed print yield of 120 pages @ cartridge price of Rs 750, PP Print cost is 6.25. a local xerox company offers service at Rs 6 per page. What use is owning the printer?.stop buying HP anymore..  Loyalty doesn't pay"
4,"First I got the message that the order is been delivered but in actual it's not then I raised a request for return since there is no option for complaint on the product delivery apart from phone number Hence Amazon team quickly resolved my query and then the printer is delivered within 4 hours that time I thought I got trapped but it gets resolved quickly Thanks for that. As of now, it is working as expected let's hope for the best in the future."
4,Mainly bought it for the scanner. Cartridges become dry if you don't use regularly. Mobile can't be connected to the printer. Every time you need a PC/Laptop for printing or scanning. But for copy/xerox you can use it directly.My advice is to go for a wireless one.
4,"It does what it says. It prints well, scans well & also copy well too. Its super easy to install. As the price is less, can't complain much but the printing cost is too high. Its good for occasional printing. I tried by printing color photos to glossy papers but the quality is not that good. Overall good experience."
4,I got 2 Cartridges with the Printer...one Black and One color plus I purchased one additional color Cartridge with offer...print scan and copy is very good quality for home use but for business use more good quality printer may be required...easy software installation and cartridge installation...Overall good Home use Printer in the market
1,If there is no internet availability the scanner wont scan even though the printer is DIRECTLY connected to desktop.  The software hangs multiple times. Something urgent to print or scan then expect delays. All works fine till you reach your 2nd or 3rd cartridge then all these troubles start for software hangs
1,"Started malfunctioning from day one; Amazon replaced it, and the new unit has now started malfunctioning in less than 3 weeks time. As the return window is closed, we are unable to get the same replaced."
2,"Never ever purchase any product from amazon. They hardly entertain refund request. After complaining the issues, they will trouble you a lot giving various instructions for troubleshooting, will ask for images and a lot more. Only replacement is available. Flipkart is much better in this sense."
5,Value for money device..very useful and reliable if your primary requirement is scanning and low volume printing. The functionality of the HP Smart app on non-HP systems needs to be impoved.
5,"Very nice delivery.... i am impressed with the delivery quality, one of the best printer for home and small office purpose.Blindly go for this printer its best among all."
3,"Printer is good, but the cartridges are very expensive, if you want more prints go for ink tank model."
5,"The all-in-one printer is a good value for money.The only catch is, if you need to print large number of pages, inkjet is not a choice. A Laser printer would be a better choice. Laser printers are costly, but economical for heavy loads.Another thing is, at least 1 color and 1 b/w print should be given per week to avoid the ink getting dried out."
5,Produt is good.... It is better than my old same model printer.
3,Very nice prouduct for office and home but delivary is not good
5,"I am very much satisfied with HP Deskjet printer purchased a month ago. It's very useful to my limited use of personal printing requirements. Though initially I had little problem with adding it to my Laptap, with the help of Support Team I could make it without much difficult. This product is very useful for personal use and also gives Value for money."
4,"Normally it is ok, but the USB cable is loose, very loose and I had to attach it with a cellotape"
4,Good product - the refill cartridges are costly - but value for money if you can refill at home.It is good for home use - scans upto A4 and Letter sized papers.I have been using this printer for a couple of months now and satisfied with the performance.
5,"Setting up was a bit difficult, but somehow I searched for the videos online and set it up. Took print out and scanned documents, at the rate it is worth it."
1,"I bought it on 15th April, this was delivered on 23rd April 2021. Since then, I have hardly printed 15-20 pages and its USB wire is not working.Don't know whom to contact, I will try reaching out to HP, but you guys don't waste your money purchasing this.Thanks,"
1,its only  print 3 to 4 page properly then started blur printing and no option for darkness and cartarage is very costly .
1,"Printer came damaged,While installing it gave errorWich means Scanner damages,Worst customers support by canon,new product now under replacement after several call annoying support..Will not recommend anyone to purchase printer online...Really disappointing"
3,It is good only for plain paper printing. If you print on glossy paper its color spreads. Buy it only If you want to print on plain paper otherwise not.
3,Prints 500 rs notes properly but 2000 rs notes are not the right color. Not worth the money spent.
5,"Very good product,Easy Installation, scanner picture quality is very good and printer quality also very very good, useful... Thank you Canon"
1,"Got a defective piece. Very bad packaging. As soon as I got the printer and turned it on, the yellow light started blinking and I had to call the service center and they told scanner is defective when I told them the support code - 5011. They informed me that scanner is defective maybe because of manufacturing or due to delivery."
1,Useless printer. Please dont take. I got for 2k and cartridge left nothing after 30 prints or less. You will go on spending on cartridges which is 600 to 900. So printing cost around 20 to 30 for a bnw paper. Such a useless printer dont take if you got for a rupee also. You cannot fill ink only cartridges work.
4,"This printer is very light weight. For Print quality you can see the image printed on A4 size paper I have attached. I liked the print quality at such low price. Honestly if you want an all in one printer in low price you should buy this. I got the delivery today and installed the printer myself. If you'll need any assistance you can call the canon service centre their engineer will install it for you at a certain charge. It's easy to install yourself all you need to do is to read the manual, instructions carefully and follow step by step. Print speed is also ok. You'll not get a laserjet printer speed but it's completely fair with its price tag."
3,"BUT NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING ON PHOTO GLOSSY PAPER AS INKS (ALL FOUR COLORS) DOES NOT TOTALLY STICK TO THE PAPER. WE SHOULD WAIT FOR AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES BELOW THE FAST ROTATING FAN TO DRY THE PAPER. EVEN THEN IF YOU MOVE YOUR FINGER ON THE GLOSSY SHEET THE INK GETS DISTURBED AND PICTURE QUALITY LOOKS SHABBY. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING ON GLOSSY SHEETS.REST ASSURED,  FOR DAY TO DAY PRINTING THIS IS THE BEST PRINTER I HAVE USED SINCE HP 300 ALL IN ONE WHICH I PURCHASED IN 2005."
1,"Printer is cheap as of 2500,but but butCost of cartridge is 2400 approxAnd if you want to buy cartridge daily then go for small cartridge which comes with this printer I.e extra small, which even fails to print 40pagesSo cost of printing 1 paper becomes 20 to 25 per page.Also very noisy in operations.Better to spend 7000 on laser printer or inktank printer."
4,"I bought it Amazon sale for scanning the documents. Even after two years it is working well. Though printing quality is average, and it's cartridges are very expensive, but for emergency it is good, and best for scanning the documents and books. Till today I have scanned more thank 25000 pages, but no problem occurred. The only problem is that after about 1 year it's usb cable became faulty and I purchased other usb cable from a local store, and printer is working fine."
1,"This product is not working after one month of use. After using for one month, it showed cartridges ink is over, after replacement of ink, it stopped printing, on showing it to local shop, I got to know that it's chip is damaged. Complete waste of money. When I called customer care of Canon, they said this product work like this only and is poor, I am shocked with response received from Canon. Will not recommend to anyone. I just want my money back or cannon/ Amazon should replace it."
4,Very handy and light weight product but this product not comparable for photo printing
1,Installation is not free - they have taken Rs 1000 for installation - Why should they take money for first time installation
1,I am regreting after buying this price of waste.i was very happy happy while i bought this but as soon as the time come when the this printer ink got over i try to get the same in market and believe me the pg-745 xl cost me somewhere between 2500 to 2600 ah! thats the price of actual machine i simply thrown this peice of wasre in the dustbin and i rather bought a laser printer and that too b/w although that's not colour but it done the job perfectly. If you are going to buy this product buy at your own risk because at first it will be treat you good but after you buy this you will end up losing a good amount of money from your pocket.
1,"Item not working, no option to return or replace the items .. even though replace option is showing in Amazon, it won't allow to replace request .. it will redirect to cannon service centre. But after selecting the model in ivr call, call will diconnect automatically .. not recommend to buy . No proper service alao"
1,The printer works fine but it's inks are very expensive. I landed purchasing more than rs.5000 worth of ink in one year. It's color cartridge only contact 1500
2,Carrying ends after 20 prints. Refilling samagra the cartridge. New cartridge costs 1000 rs each. Spanning and print quality is ok.
4,"I needed a printer for home use. I was looking for something basic with all the three important features that a printer should have such as Printing, Copying and scanning. And like I said I needed something basic because for home use at best you're gonna need 4-5 prints in a month usually and not more. So I found this printer which I received just today. Does it do what it says? Yes, It does  and overall it's a great product and I am quite satisfied with it's quality and features. Although the print quality could've been slightly better. Don't get me wrong overall it's a great product for it's price and comes with all the necessary accessories that you would need for a printer but the print quality is just above average. It does the job and it doesn't look bad. Just not great like you can see in other slightly expensive brands. Anyway I don't regret buying it. I still got more than what I paid for, therefore I am quite satisfied."
5,"100% satisfied with this product. The print & scan quality is excellent. Also the printing performance is super,  printing 10 to 15 documents per minute. Really awesome, just I want to say thank you Amazon. I can't imagine how canon supply the wonderful printer in such type of budget. Rs.2300/- . Dear friends if you want to purchase a printer for home use then this is the ultimate choice, don't loss the opertunity. Go to Amazon app & order now...."
3,Printer installation is easy 3/5.  printing speed is 3/5. Print quality is good 4/5. But worst thing is ink cartridge is getting low soon. Just for print of 6pages in which 3 are mix black and colour. It showed me the reduction of 10% of total ink.
1,Pathetic in the very beginning... Cannot be installed as the windows can't detect the printer. Canon customer care is useless. No support on call. Gave number of a local repair agency which is not recwiving the call. Waste of money and time.
1,"Very bad product.... Complete wastage of moneyThis product is not working After using for few pages your catrage is empty . after replacement of cartridge, it stopped printing. Complete waste of money. When I called customer care of Canon, they said this product work like this only and is poor, I am shocked with response received from Canon. No warranty this product in canon service center only show in .Will not recommend to anyone. I just want my money back or cannon/ Amazon should replace it."
4,"I ordered this on 23rd October and the ink(black) was over on 3rd November. I printed just 12-15 pages in total. Either the ink cartridge was old or that’s how all the cartridges are. I’ll know once I replace the cartridge, but by then I might have to change the colour cartridge as well. All in all disappointed.I’m still giving it 4 stars because the printer itself is easy to install and use. The print quality is good, too. I am using it for home use, so maybe I’ll use it for important documents only.YET, totally annoyed with the cartridges provided."
5,Good printer.I bought it for ₹2000/- only and had got ₹700/- cashback. Overall price of the printer for me was ₹1300/- .Prints pages at ₹0.50 each. Print quality is not too good but ok for home use. I donot change ink cartridge. I just refill them at home.Scan quality is excellent.Xerox is also good.Software is also easy to install and easy to use.
3,Low cost but Not recommended.Print per page cost is high.Only you will get 25 to 30 page.Printing quality is okay.Ink will quickly drain out.Document scanning quality is not upto the mark . My passport scanning and very old document scanning quality is not good with this printer.Other Document scanning quality is acceptable.
5,Very nice product..already used the same model for 5 years and now purchased again.good for use if you have to print 8-10 pages a day..cartridge are costly but can be refilled from any refill shop by paying 50/- rupees. Not very optimistic about color print since my requirement is for black and white prints daily.But you can definitely buy it if your usage is limited
5,"It's a great experience! It's my first Printer and enjoying the experience. Ease of use. Would upload the video on You Tube and update my review. I would appreciate if any IT support is provided for installation. I struggled a lot, but finally was able to when called up the IT support.At this price, great buy. Black ink cartridge got exhausted. Got it refilled via Cartridge World. A genuine store. Great Service."
1,What a crap.my catridge is low in just 15-20 printouts.LISTEN EVERYONE.DO NOT BUY ON AMAZON INDIA ANYTHING WHICH YOU THINK YOU CAN DIRECTLY PURCHASE FROM THE VENDOR NEAR YOU OR EVEN A STORE.AMAZON FO NOT CARE IF YOUR ITEM IS BAD...I PURCHASED A PRINTER N the ink finished in no time .whether you use the printer or no you still have to replace yr ink which finishes you use or no.Amazon please sell product which can value peoples money. Atleast now when people are jobless during this pendenic.Just dont sell product ehich put people hard earned money to a waste.
5,"Product is excellent with this price,easy to install and printing.picture quality is excellent,"
5,"First, its beautiful bit delicate though!Came well within quick time and had sturdy packaging, no complaints!Easy to install. Has color and black cartidges which need to be fitted, just follow picture instructions.CD for driver installation. If your laptop doesn't have CD player such as mine (surface pro 4), just google key words and download.Once you install, go in start menu and open canon printers to scan documents.To print, its ready to use without software installation. Print quality is good.But, remember its for home use, worth for ~100 pages per month.Use judiciously!I dont know why bad reviews. Its adequate.I purchased because i badly needed scan and print of my visa and option was same day delivery. I am happy.Thank you.If you want to purchase, go ahead!If your use is heavy, buy next heavy version. For me its enough."
1,"its not working properly not even a single button works nor USB ,various noise. the very first time showing the upper black and colour ink orange light., printing apps too donot recognise it,and bluetooth is not working either.its diffective,today on sunday i got some extra time to work on it but my whole day is wasted.remove this item from amazon ,i want my refund."
1,"Please do not buy this product even if the company gives u for free. The ink if it gets over, after refilling it the printer does not work. If we buy cartridge it will be costly and the outcome cost /print does not come good also. Though it looks cheap to buy. But later you will suffer with this. Please don't buy this product and waste your 2800 RS also. Utilize that money somewhere else."
3,"I bought this very recently.  So far so good.  It is economical. We can print, copy, scan is what I liked.What I didn't like is - the  USB cable from printer to connect to external device (computer) could have been longer that what is given.  It is tough sometimes to connect with laptop or computer which is placed just a bit longer to the printer.What is missing - WiFi. Hmm, need to spend some more money for this. But it could have come for this price itself given the technology advancements so far ! I know I shouldn't expect though!I'm happy as I've been using scan and prints (less) for a while. I used it for <2months now, since last week it won't turnon now :-) Not sure of the reason.  Time to contact the customer support now  :-).If I get quick resolution in few days, then I'd update here and improve the rating ! Hence giving less rating for now!"
1,Well this all in one printer seems cool for its price but it will cost you more than you think..  The ink cartridges can print only a few pages and you need to buy new cateidges every time which costs around 400 alone..  So it will cost you too much...  There is no refilling option you will have to buy a new cateidge itself...Apart from that the scanning is good but the scanner option in there app doesn't work all the time.. It keeps saying location undeminded and stuff but if you keep trying and trying it will scan ultimately..  Well I won't recommend this.. Go buy some good product.. They might be costly but they will be worth it.
4,Got it 4 days ago . Made in Vietnam(not chinnese crap).Automatically got detected by my laptop and able to print directly .For printing from mobile using poko print app . Colour Print quality is good and can be seen in attached picture.Printer needs to be handeled carefully especislly flips at top and bottom as they look fragile .Need to check how many prints i will get before cartridges exhaust as it was one negative thing i have seen in majority of reviews .Iam going to order inkjet 100ml bottles to fill cartridges following youtube videos
3,"Cheapest printer which contain scanner and worth it for occasional use besides print cost is high than other printers per page so this printer is not  for daily use . For students and other home stuffs this printer is worth to buy. Sometimes little minor issues can be happen but it can be solved by reading manual both offline and online. The print quality is ok , not so good but for occasional use its better to don't mind it . And the service it provides at this low price is worth it for buying."
1,I received twice and both time I received a defective product. Please Don't buy this product from Amazon
1,"Printer printed hardly 40 pages in draft mode and started displaying about exhausting condition of the black ink cartridges. While describing about the product, per page printing cost was not mentioned in the advertisement. This way an important aspect of per page printing cost or out put per cartridge was hidden. Such a high cost print can not be afforded, hence I would like to return the printer and get my money back. Would suggest to mention prints per cartridges or cost per print."
1,"update, it stopped working in less than 6 months. working fine for the price but manufacturer konwingly designed printer in a way that uses little colour ink for black print which u can clearly see as shadow and also in many reviews on internet so you get out of ink early, another thing is its catridge which is around half price of the printer which is also not available easily and printer is slower than tortoise. Good for small requirement in home and office or shop."
3,"I purchased this printer a few months ago and have used it for several printouts till now. I had to b really thoughtful about its feedback , simply because buying printers online is quite a challenging decision especially the notorious reviews posted by many. At the end you trust your gut and make a decision. For most of the time people desire everything for the lowest price possible however please bear in mind quality demands research and money! So this is what i feel about the printer -1. It looks great. Infact it looks pretty classy.2. I love the print quality. It does so much justice for the image you want to print.3.  I paid 4890/- for the printer. The image print output is pretty satisfactory.4. I printed a lot of sheets. Like, i totally went crazy with my print outs. I was working on a vision board project (more like a vision wall) and It required quite a bit of printouts. I hate going to the printer shops with the images I want to print as I have privacy issues. But so happy this printer did not even fuss once and facilitated smooth and steady printouts.5. The installation was a cakewalk. It is compatible with my iPhone and Mac. Easy peasy. I love user friendly technology.6. I have always inserted one sheet at a time. Why? because i find that arrangement quite hassle free and convenient.7. A couple of times the paper got jammed. #commonprinterproblems. I did not feel that I should mind that. Given the convenience of home printing. Everything is better at home.8. I took prints on regular sheets as well as glossy sheets. I would tell you this- , sheet type hardly made a difference. In future i'd use a regular sheet. Not a glossy one. I just tried glossy because may be I expected 'photo print quality'. While the print quality was great, the final print washed out the glossy effect. So it is redundant.9. The printer uses the 803 ink cartridge and that is where the catch is.10. 803 print cartridges clearly read that they are disposable and meant for single use only.11. The original cartridge exhausted quite early. I am able to say this as I later ordered the refill ink and refilled my cartridge and I was able to get more prints this time. (It might be because with the original cartridge I printed glossy papers and they consume more ink. MAY BE. I'm just guessing.)12. I watched a couple of Youtube videos and learnt how to refill the cartridge. I followed instructions and Viola! my printer started to shoot prints again.13. Now , when you refill the original cartridge the printer's ink indicator does not read it. Which you'll learn to adapt because in moments your printer will be shooting pages after pages.14. SO after several and many prints It was time to refill the cartridge. and Guess what...It did not work. I tried everything. The prints turned out horrible. The ink was spilling all over. Even inside the printer and that made me very sad. Nobody likes a tardy looking gadget!15. My conclusion is that HP is right. 803 does not allow a refill. Even though the ink sellers claim and list that it does...It does not.16. The first refill was may be a lucky shot. It worked. I was very happy. The second refill was a  complete fiasco.17. Eventually I discarded the cartridges.18. I logged in to Amazon and wanted to place order for fresh cartridges and guess what. Out of all the HP models , 803 has the most expensive cartridge. That made me very thoughtful and cautious.19. Unless HP does something about the price of the Ink cartridges, the ink will blot your enthusiasm.My verdict - It is a great printer. I love it. Love the print quality. But 803 is an EXORBITANTLY PRICED ink cartridge. May be i'll try the refills again when my next cartridge arrives and update my review just in case i am successful beyond the first refill attempt. (UPDATE- the refill completely did not work with next new cartridge ran dry. Also I noticed that the new cartridge printed half the amount of papers from last time. Not sure of the decline)I am not complaining because ultimately I have to take everything into consideration. But going to the printer shop is a BIG NO for me.Review Update 7th March- I realized the cartridge purchased from Amazon I.e 803 for this printer is not compatible. My printer didn’t read the color cartridge. It was an old generation piece and the black ink cartridge leaked during printing. It basically suggests that the cartridges are either refilled or not genuine. I later purchased them from HP website. Even though expensive I was content about the fact that they are genuine and have same business day delivery. I love the Amazon returns policy. They accepted the opened cartridge and refunded quite promptly.Review Update - Jan 24- it’s been six months the printer has been completely useless and I e been wondering what to do with it. Selling it on OLX seems like I’ll be cheating the buyer. I switched to a new ISP and the printer would not connect. I registered the call with HP CS . There was a lot of hassle. After spending around 72 hours back and forth they sent a technician. The printer just didn’t detect any connection with the phone, laptop and the WiFi. Technician refused to take any responsibility and said Ive been entering the password wrong. The technician and customer service people were so smart to place the blame because apparently the only device not connecting to the WiFi amongst the whole list of gadgets was the printer.Final Review is that as excited I was , it fizzled out so bad, that it is ridiculous to even think of giving the machine away for free as I’ll lose face if someone asks for a demo! I thought I’ll bear with the super highly priced ink but for a printer that doesn’t sync or connect, it’s a waste! It’s like a marriage which you realize is going bad within 6 months of being married! The benefit with the printer being - you have the freedom to discard it!Interestingly I also feel that the shelf life of this printer is meant to last only for one bundle of sheets you buy. The printer exhausts post that! If you’re looking for a heavy use...you must buy the really expensive ones! Yes. That’s true.HP customer service experience is 0/10."
5,"Printer Is Good But My Experience It Is Not For Heavy Use If You Use It Heavy,Large Documents Print Than It Is Surely Loose Your Pocket For Buying Ink Cartridges!!!..It Is Only For Home And Occasional use..I Am Buying It During Amazon Great India Sale Very Discounted Rate So It Is Awesome Deal For Me.Received New Hp Seal Pack.Pros:-1.Wi-Fi Range:-Its Cover My 2Bedroom and Hall Successfully But Little Bit Take Time To Connect My Wi-fi Dongle(My Desktop)2.Automatic Updates:-Printer Is Automatic Update When It's Connect To My Wi-Fi RouterA Little Bit Difficult Process To Add To Printer On Wi-fi Router And My Desktop ..After Some Try I am Successfully Connected To Printer With My Wi-Fi Router.CartigesBoth cartiges is original color print is good if you print branded photo color paper butI am not understand why my black color cartiges vaporize automaticaly and create light black spot on my new printer many places.Anyways this printer is good for light use and home use like personal photo print,personal printout,importent document to scan etc."
4,"The cost per print is very high , I hardly went up to 40 pages and the black ink is already depleted ! , the connectivity is not an issue seamlessly connects with your devices , but the rate at which the ink depletes is very fast , this is suited for people who print once in a while and also when they need the print to be confidential which you don’t get in an internet centre. Strictly not for people who print a lot."
3,"I bought this product and returned it after 4 days.Coming straight to the pros and cons :Pros :1.Its quite affordable in a price range of 5000-5400 ,given the multi functionality (print,scan and copy)it performs true to its claim.2.Its super light to carry around. Can be moved around easily if needed as it uses cartridge which is dry and does not form bubbles as in an ink tank printer.4.Gives good prints both coloured and b&w.5.You have the choice of purchasing either of the cartridges, depending upon your usage,  b&w or coloured,in case of find it costly to buy both,and still it would function absolutely well.6.Gets easily connected to a laptop by the USB.CONS:1.The most difficult part of this printer was connecting it with the mobile wifi or wifi direct as they call it in the absence of any physical technical support and one gets immensely hassled in this process,as they do not provide any demo or at home technician service to help you connect for the first time.It requires a whole lot of things like router,dual band wifi, and though they claim and try to enable an easy connectivity with wifi,which it isn't at all.After some time you almost give up on trying to connect with wifi and simply get your work done by directly connecting with laptop which it does good .2.It is not mentioned anywhere on the Amazon app the cartridge that you get with this printer are only dummies meant for 20-25 prints ,and not the real ones.And so you need to buy them along with this printer if you have got to print at least 50 pages.3.Though its inexpensive ,but its costly in the long term as it gives you only 100 bw pages per month with a newly bought cartridge which is way less than the ink tank printers.So this printer is budget friendly,and a good deal for low usage like occasional homework and assignments of children,or ticket prints etc."
5,"very nice air-printer.. no need of wire connection..  i connect it to my wifi router (wireless) & use that printer with all devices (mobiles, laptop & computer) which connected to wifi..."
1,"Never Buy this model for one reason :-original new cartridge gives hardly 20 color prints , even black color prints as well.  Print quality is VERY GOOD and BRIGHT.manufacture manual says 165 color prints ,it's NOT true ,they need to change this statement."
5,"The printer is super cool. Obviously the printing cost is very high, no doubt. But at the same time you should know how to get around it. I refill the cartridges myself.. And to be more specific, I refill with the original ink bottles HP Gt 52, yeah.. The print quality is awesome. If you want to further reduce the cost, use the local ink bottles that you get at around Rs 100 for 100 ml bottle. That would be much cheaper. One bottle gives a print capacity of 1000 pages. One time refill would give a print capacity of 100 pages. So technically, the print cost is reduced to as low as 10 paise. I am still using the cartridges that came with the factory shipping and have already printed more than 500 pages consuming only 50 ml of ink.."
5,Couldn't really pair using mobile but was able to pair with Mac using wifi Direct. Very limited instructions provided. Had to press a few buttons to print out instructions stored in the printer itself. So took some time to figure it out. Connection using usb was instantaneous. Works just fine. Cartridge was included and printer displays cartridge left. Happy with it for now.
4,"Very nice product. Wifi configuration took time, but results were amzing. printing directly from phone, makes life more easy. i  was expecting this to be duplex printer, but didnt find that feature, need to explore more.Recommended product for home purpose and small office purpose, Copy and scanning is easy through HP smart app on Mobile phone. Overall nice product"
5,Does what’s it’s intended to do . Setting up the app took a while but now it’s smooth . Print quality is better in this price range . Haven’t used it much extensively but whatever I did was smooth.
3,"I have been using this printer for the past 3 months and I am writing this review now as I wanted to give the other customers a very genuine review on this product after using it.First of all, this is not absolutely the best printer for daily use. The one and only reason for that is the ink price.The HP 803 cartridge used in this product will always give you a headache while buying a new one. The cartridges set (Black n color) will cost around 1800 rupees which is quite high for an ordinary customer, and the cartridges last for only 200-300 page prints in normal quality. There is an option to refill the cartridges after it is exhausted but it won't work after 2-3 refills probably.I used this product for my project printouts, study material printouts, making copies of documents, bills, etc in a regular basisfor the first time after the cartridge was empty, I was able to refill it using the ink bought from the Amazon.in site itself and was able to take another 150-200 printouts before it was empty again. The 600 rs ink bottles are enough for 10 refills. But on the second time after I refilled and started using, after few prints the cartridges were spilling out more ink and sometimes no ink at all which resulted in incomplete printouts and waste A4 sheets and i had to buy a new set of cartridges which was nearly 43% of the product costPROS1. Excellent Working2. Good Quality Printouts3. Easy to use3. Copy/Xerox Feature (Both color and B/W)4. Wireless connectivity (Very easy printout using phones directly: Requires HP Plugin installed in your phone)5. Good HardwareCONS1. Cartridge too costly"
4,"Cartridge rate is higher except that all are nice. It is nice printer for home use and price is also affordable. If the price rate is adjusted than this is the best wireless printer. It can scan,print and we can do xerox in it."
4,"I don't know why the seller has listed this product as HP Deskjet 2622, even though what I received is 2600.Anyways, for Rs. 3999/- it is not a bad product at all. Every feature is the same as mentioned in the description. The printer comes with 2 cartridges (color and black) that was very easy to install. The print and copy quality is perfect, and fast also.I am happy with the product, apart from the fact that it is giving some problem in connecting with my phone. Once I was able to print directly from phone, and the next time, the phone showed the printer is unavailable.OVERALL: Very good product for the price."
5,This printer HP Deskjet 2729 is really amazing. It's printing quality of both color and black &white is very very clear and good.I like printing quality of this printer.Dislike about this printer is that it is pretty slow during wireless connectivity.But I can say that just go for it...
1,"If you have no where to waste your money, this is the one. Most irritating product I have ever purchased on Amazon. The functionality of printer is hilarious and if you don't have patience, my advice, refrain from purchasing. The ink run at super fast like Jamaican Usain Bolt speed.Note: Amazon you should publish my review or don't wala such product."
1,"The product is not recommended at all whether you use it for home or office.best are ink tank printers. twice or max thrice the cost but worth it and effective plus cost saving.Color photo quality is worst of all the printers (Epson, HP, Canon) i have used on kodak paper.Cartridge charges (rs. 700 each) are too high and yield is like max 40 color photos/print and 80 Black n white prints.I had some urgent need of photos so took the printer in use and all i can see is the pink color photos.Very bad experience with HP this time."
1,Worst...after 20 pages b@w ink showing low...nd dat was only documents print out..
4,"Product is really nice, I have booked Canon first, but it was faulty. So ordered this HP2622. What I felt is the plastic quality is much better in HP.First when you on the printer, connect to the printer using Wifi, then one page will open there you can connect the printer to Wifi networkOnly problem I noticed is when I put single paper, the paper does not go properly inside and the printer throws feed error. After multiple attempts (30time) figured out that the paper to be inserted below the roller to have proper feed or else the roller will pull the paper one side, this is definitely some problem to fix or what I dont know"
2,"The printer is good, but the black cartridge got over in just about 45 pages printing, not satisfied with this though, haven’t counted on the colour printing yet..."
5,The colour cartridge sent with the printer is defective.So either replace the whole order or replace the cartridge by tomorrow.
4,"Many buyer's here complaining about wifi setup for printer is hard, Might be taken note of by HP. With hp smart setup application for mobile and desktop/laptop it was seamless experience and really easy to setup printer + wifi for wireless priniting without any  trouble. Infact, mentally i was ready to face same problem but no such problem faced by me luckily.As of now, I am not using any USB cable to take my printout, Everything via Wifi, Be it from laptop or Mobile. In case, Anyone still feels the same issue, Refer to the blue book titled Reference and Support. On 1st page in bottom you will find the solution itself.Cons -  For now only 1. Explained below.I gave 4 star because, Ink is fast depleting property be it color or black. In case you have daily print out of anything more then 5-6 pages, Don't opt for it. Otherwise, Excellent for Kid's homework and minimum printing job."
5,The printer is good obviously so no issues there but initially i was given a used product which i wasn't happy with i got the replacement and it was great. I liked the product as its compatible with all my devices as long as it's connected to my wifi. Without the wifi i can connect the printer to my laptop and presto!! It works. My advice please look up the setup videos by hp before you get started.
3,I've been reviewing it . After my 8 months of usage . This is a low load printer . I never expected slow print from this product . I've been looking for better one again .Pros:* Speed in Connectivity* Easy to access at low price* Compatibility* Easy to equip and less weight.* Colored printsCons:* No double side  print available* Sometimes we've to wait to load* Maintenance is bit high compare to laser jet
3,"I bought this printer for home use. The cost and features are good. You can print from mobile as well. The wireless printing works very well. The printer is quite good.Now comes the catch. The cartridge cost. HP 803 original black and color cartridge costs anywhere between 1200 to 1500 rupees. Contrary to the claim I was able to print not more than 50 pages before the ink dried. It could be that ink dried due to non usage for couple of months. However, the cost of new cartridge is mind blowing. Looks like companies make money out cartridges."
3,"HP needs to work on improving customer experience. It's a nightmare trying to get the drivers and getting the WiFi feature work with the product. I choose to use cable for quick printing. Print quality is ok ok. Packing was good. Comes with cartridge. For scanning, one need to have hp snart app installed and nedd to use it for giving scan command to printer."
1,"We received this product and unfortunately did not start using it within the 10 day period allotted for returns. So once we tried to use it we had continual issues printing, it actually didn't print. After many calls with HP support they agreed to send a technician after they realized it was a printer defect. The technician came and then said he would have to come back with a replacement part. After that visit he no longer responded to our calls or texts and we've been unable to get a hold of anyone from customer support. We've had this printer now for a month and it hasn't worked nor are we able to get it repaired or replaced. Terrible experience."
2,"ProsGood looking with pure white exteriorEasy to installConsLonger lasting cartridge is a false statement, i got the new printer with dry cartridge, had to order a new one, which dried out with 20 to 30 pagesBulkyWhite color sure looks good but prone to getting dustyAlways takes 2 to 3 attempts to connect with phone appI used the 3050 model prior to this for 6 years and still find print quality better in thatCartridge is difficult to find in ecommerce sites and even in HP onlineNo resale value - due to the cost of cartridge and very short self life, nobody wants this printer"
3,"Printer is really good, easy to setup and operate. Very handy with print copy and scan.Unfortunately soon after printing two papers, I started seeing problem with the default cartridges that came with the printer."
5,This is my favourite product that I brought in 2019. Easy to install and use and the wifi  connectivity is also strong. I brought it for printing homeschooling materials. And it’s working efficiently plus it’s budget friendly when you manually refill the ink. You need to be a little patience with the ink filling thing. Scanning & copy also functions smoothly.
3,Printer good.wifi function dont require other working hot spot as it has its own wifi to connect mobile or ipad.so nice use.Issue with hp 803 cartridge orignal orderd from amazon but printer didnt recognise it.techincal support team said to clean points of contact and all but nothing happnes now my printer is usless on table .just first cartridge change caused issue.also coslty cartridges .so not recomend
5,I bought it bcoz of brand name.And it provedGreat print quality but it could be better.It's easy to install.Easy to use.Effortlessly print.The cartridge should print more pages.The cost per print should be less.Overall it's best in its price range.
3,"A good printer for beginners or school kids, because it's very simple to setup and use, but the high CPP @Rs.5 to Rs.7 is not worth it. Will discard it very soon and get an ink tank all in one with auto duplex ADF. Don't let the low initial cost fool you, at best you can get about a yield of 100 b/w pages, so unless you absolutely need a printer immediately and can't afford the initial cost of an ink tank, I would strongly advise against buying this."
1,"I made a mistake... humble request to you please don't purchase this...Warranty got over its not working ( not turning on) machine has turned into a piece of junk .. after warranty service is too bad, no troubleshooting steps over the phone for every single thing you need to take it to the service center....Cartridges too costlyInstallation easy but print yeild is very low.Those who think that this printer's supplied cartridge will yeild around 50-60 pages(colour or black) are highly mistaken it didn't give me a yeild more than 10-15 pages (colour) & 20-25 pages(black) .So if you think that this is going to give you a high yeild so you must give a second thought about it.Wireless connectivity is easier but it goes worse if the button is pressed,creates problems in reconnecting with the wifiI requested for replacement but Amazon team cancelled and it's returning to seller now I can't get a replacement I need to wait for the sale so as to get it's price dropped bcoz it's the second time it's price has increased from 3699 to 4499 now..."
4,THE printer is fine .service was good but the problem is..IT IS BETTER TO BUY A NEW PRINTER THAN A NEW CARTRIDGE..i always use genuine things but this printer is only worth 3 colorful pictures..that is it..even black and white depletes before 40 prints..if the pictures are not that colorful then may be a few more..HP or any other printing companies needs to see this..the manufacturing costs for this cartridges are not that much..but still it is unfairly priced..you can not heavily print at all not even lightly..that is the problem..it has to be more efficient
5,I liked the printer for the price and quality. But the free cartridge which I received with the printer was defected. And had to buy a new cartridge. So just because of the black cartridge I wasted my 3 days thinking y the prints r not clear. And when I gave the colour ND black and white print separately I figured that the black cartridge is a defect that the seller has given me.
1,On receiving the printer I was able to connect the printer wirelessly and print copies without any issues. But the second time since I moved out to another Wi-Fi network I am unable bring the printer to set up more and connect the printer to the network. I tried a lot but unable to get the printer to connect to Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi light keeps blinking does not stay on.Can someone help me? I cannot return the product as the return Window is closed.
3,"Would suggest look for a notch upper hp printer. , this is for the basic home user , has WiFi connectivity for easy prints directly from mobile . Installation took a bit of time with WiFi not getting connected properly but once done then it was working fine . Too many pages get sometimes stuck though"
5,I bought this product yesterday and tested all its functions which are working perfectly. Results are very good. So far so good.......rest time will tell
1,"This is very worst product. Cartridge stopped working after 20 page print. And help line said go to service centre which is more than 90 km, and they said buy new cartridge which is 1800 INR cost. Now think guys printer is 3000 n cartridge is 2000. Don't buy this hp is robbing Indian customer s.Anyone can call meI want to sell this dabba for 1000. 2 months old.PRAFUL9818868839"
1,"Basic problem? The paper in mechanism. IT DOESN'T TAKE IN PAPER. Its a vertical feed at the rear, and horizontal out the front. Either the paper just dosen't get pulled in, OR gets pulled in titled to one side (right) and hence the printout is skewed, OR (USUALLY) the paper tilts a bit, then remains there, while the printer prints (no idea on what!) And shows the job done. In last 40 tries Ive only managed 1 print and 2 photocopies. DON'T BUY."
5,Nice
5,good cable
5,Nice
5,good cable
5,very easy to use and good auto scanning and paper feed
5,Works flawlessly. Great support from the seller taking time to explain clearly what it does and does not. It supports legal sheet size.
5,It is really worth of money to scan different sizes of paper.
5,"Considering the combo offer and the print quality, I would suggest one must go for it. I haven't had the chance of using the coloured inks until now but I believe they must be equally good.Problem: the only issue I have found is that the ink sprinkles just a little while adjusting and removing it from the filler. But that's okay, it's almost negligible but I thought I must mention it.The rest, it's a good buy."
5,"Product is looking as shown in presentation, but not used since yet. I must edit my review after using it"
5,"Super quality ink! Have used only original ink before, due to my daughter online class, we need to print a lot of homework, assessments, class materials etc... so this time we search all type of brands finally decided to take this one, and results is too satisfying!!! Recommend to all parents who are struggling with the online class headache 😂"
4,"Good for EPSON 3150, 3110 printer. Easy to refill type bottles.Satisfied with quality and printing"
5,"Good product at very good price. I purchased 05(04color +01 black extra) at jst rs.800/-. Print quality is good, not as original but at this price it's very good. Packing was ok need to be better."
5,I had a doubt about the print quality but I've been using it for months now no difference in quality and print as much as the original Epson 001Just go for it...
4,"I have ordered this product 2nd time bcoz i was fully satisfied with this product previous time, its same as original no problems at all finished 2 black bottles previously and want to use it again but its little expensive i mean i payed 300 for 2 black bottles but i think paying 200 is enough afterall its non genuine ink and packing was not good packing box was twisted when i received the order"
5,Nice but take care when you refill your printer may have licking do it gently and nice print quality and colour
5,Working perfectly with my epson inktank printer..
4,good
4,Ink quality so good but but it requires nazel check frequently 400 to 600 pages.You can easily take print 5000 + copies in one bottle.Epson L3101.
5,Good for Epson ink tank printers...
1,The received bottles are not sealedInk is only 75% in bottlesNot recommend to buy
5,I am using proffisy ink refill black for my epson printer and its working very fine. Also the colour is smooth and dark. I am happy with the product.
5,Good product thanks Amazon
5,Supppeeerb

4,Good ink for espon l3152
1,The quality is not so good and I have filled the ink in the printer. Please help me to sort this out.I will remove my review if this get solved.
5,Have been using this company's products more for quite some time including compatible toner and inks and must say the quality is very good and so is the price
2,No please don't use this ink.... Because its duplicate ink and damaged my printer..... Lens...
4,"Like the bottle which is enclosed by rubber cap not to spill allover when made upside down, but better if they have given syringes to pump the ink into new cartridges as of model's for 2021"
5,Nice products i am happy
3,Good product
5,The product is very good and it value for money. Thanks amazon for good product
3,Gud but not better printer work effect

5,Good product 👍
5,Good Quality
5,Good Product at a reasonable rate.
5,Value for its price.
5,Now i ran out of ink. Where can i sell my kidney?
5,Is this that expensive ?
4,Best for office use and business people workout every thing
1,Made a mistake buying this scanner...stopped working within 20 days now I can't ever return it...total waste of money
4,Very fast scanning..and not brake... Value for money and easy to use...But main  one problem is this scanner is battry life is not too much good.Means Bettry not long lasting... But charging very fast..Overall very nice...
5,Works fantastic. Had issues with using it for the first time as there is no proper manual given in the box nor any helpful resources online. The right way to go about it with a Mac is :1) connect usb dongle to the computer.2) scan “restore defaults” printed on a sheet inside the box3) scan “ force pairing” printed on the same sheet.4) start Text Edit. Scan any product and the number will show on the screen.No software / driver installation needed.I-ball must give some instructions for using this product on their support site.
1,"I bought this to avoid the hassle-free management for my warehouse. When it cam and I used it. I found the followingCons---  Barcode Reading Speed is very slow--- Does not recognizes or punches barcodes in single attempt sometimes--- I tried it on my back panel motherboard 3.0 USB Port (Same problem there too)--- At times, it shows a message of USB device not recognized (Changed multiple ports on 3 different PCS - same problem)Pros---Handling grip is too comfortableThanks"
5,"Amazing product, using since the past few months.Range is good as described,Scans faster than TVS wired scanner and more accuratelyAnd battery life is amzing, lasts easily for 4-5 days due to auto switch off feature"
3,"Installation is little bit tricky.Very good features.Quick scanning.It goes for sleeping and need to pair everytime on wakeup.Concept is good.Good lookings.Good built.Still not the best. For the price paid, its okay."
5,"I used last one year ,Battery Backup very good, Per day i use 400 clicks, i charge that device nearly 6 times thats all,Good Product ,Before i use TVS and one another one good product,Good Product i Cheap Praise"
5,This is a stunning product by iBall. Sturdy body and good grip. Scanning is really fast and accurate compared to other products. Best Buy!
5,AmazingAfter 4 months i have not charged it a singal time an it still works. Thats it.
4,Nice product but it can only read on printed paper... It can't read barcode on computer screen that's the main issue you have to waste paper for scanning the barcode.
4,Working fine.Suitable for all for both android app as well as desktop n laptop.Very bad instruction manual book. Reducted 1* for that.
4,"Positive points : Good product, easy to use, scanning speed is good, Range is ok.Nagative points : datewise scanned data, total available scanned data in memory not available."
2,"Most of the time picks different items during billing, that creats problems"
5,Good
5,"Close your eyes and buy it guys. i work in India Post, & i am really enjoying working with it. easy to install and user friendly."
5,This product works like a charm. Easy to use and great build quality.Buy without even second thought.
1,very bad product and not return me product.not a gud product.not connecting on computer.
5,100% OK & Usefull
1,"Dear  Sir/Mam,I bought a I ball scanner Model No. WBS-650MV just few day before, it is not working so please help us how we can  use otherwise its urgent"
2,Sometimes it is unable to read the bar code of different products..
1,i am giving rating second time.after use of 3 month .it is not scanning
5,I am a retailerI use this on regular basis for billing purposeThe accuracy and scanning is just superb !Battery backup is also too good!
4,So far its working fine. Only time will tell how long the battery will last as the battery is not replaceable.
5,Great productGood scanning speedTotally satisfied with product
4,Scanner is good and durable. Does the job as it is given in the description.
5,Good quality and value for money ! Surprised that not many competing in this category.
5,"I ordered 2nos. Iball wifibarcode readers.I received one new piece and one old piece,which is not working.I regret verymuch for this type of delivery."
5,Good
5,superb
5,very nice product.
3,Good but price is high
5,Good
5,Good product with vibrating while scanning
1,The box recived in damaged condition...nd the red light is not workng properly....
1,Poor
1,"It’s not capturing the correct price, waste of money. Better buy some reputed brand,not trusted and poor performance"
5,"Very good product, used a barcode scanner for the first time, but it was very good scanner at the first time."
5,Good
5,nice quality
5,using it from last couple of months...no issues at all
3,Printer is good but ink runs out quickly especially Colour Cartridge ink.  The print quality is good.
4,"The product is overall good. Pretty decent for someone who has basic home requirements or small business. It does the job. A couple of things to keep in mind:1. Colour image print takes a lot of time. In some cases, it takes upto 3 minutes to print a page. This is mostly dependent upon the file size of the photo. Bigger the size, higher the time. At certain times the print quality may not be that impressive as you may expect.2. For setting up the printer, company has not given a user manual. This may get a little difficult for people who are not highly tech friendly, as bringing up the printer on your local LAN maybe some trouble. A printer on LAN helps you print pages with a lot of convenience.Other than that I found it quite decent!"
2,Printing quality is not good as expected. Disappointed.
3,"Writing this based on 7 days use experience.Pros1. Wifi Printer, having scanner, copy and Fax at low price.2. App based use for convenient print, scan, fax.Cons1. Colour print quality is just average.2. Ink provided along with Printer can last only less than 30 color print.3. Print speed is very slow over wifi. May be 2 paper in a minute4. Getting connected to wifi for printing is a painPersonal thoughts- My use is only 20 page print in a week currently and thus can live with this.Those expecting quality colour print, or high speed printing or print requirement is too much may search for other option, as ink cost will be too high comparing to getting printing outside.Yet to print photo paper to assess quality.More review after new ink installation and few months of use."
3,"1,Can be buy for Minimal uses purpose.2, scanner and printing is slow but reasonable price3, Worsted connection with wifi,many time disconnected , again it will take more time bro reconnect4, Print quality good.5,I purchased only for ADF scanner. That fullfilled.6, I bought 3 days before (6/11/2020) so i don't know reliability.7, cartridge - I taken 10 colour print copy but cartridge ink level shows less than 50% . May be  i can take another 6-7 copy only."
1,It doesn't have a scanner. We purchased a wrong product.It is a total waste of money.
5,"Actually it's a good product. Printing quality is also nice. But there is problem in connection with HP smart app (Mobile version) via ""Wifi Direct"". Actually it's not even a problem it's just a mistake. I had applied for return  and ordered another also. No doubt product is really nice. But now I came to know that it was not even a problem. I watched some videos contacted HP but nothing worked out well. Here's the solution:-1. First connect to a wifi network ( you can also use hotspot).2. Setup the app. Login to your HP account.3. Press Wireless and Resume buttons on printer at the same time for 3 seconds. You will see a small printer and mobile icon on the bottom of the screen (means ""Wifi Direct"" is on).4. Now disconnect you wifi and connect it with your printer.These steps are for the setup. Next time just directly connect to the printer. You will not be able to use internet while you are connected with the printer.I haven't tried it yet. But is 100000% correct. Hope this is helpful...PS: I sold it for Rs 4100, printing cost was so much I gave me around 400 pages for Rs 2000. I tried to refill the cartridge but I didn't worked. Cartridge got condemned. Think before you buy. Good for less use!"
1,"The software is very buggy. Even if paired and connected via WiFi, it does not detect the other 5 in on state even if printer is on. When detected and given print command via mobile it takes ages to transfer a single page document to the printer, and then it prints only half the document wasting the paper.. really frustrated with the printer, wasted almost half day for printing a 1 page document yet no luck..Edit: Updating review to 1 start as even replacement piece was faulty."
1,Can't access the value because no one from Amazon or HP has contacted for installation. Very poor service. A company person came and dumped it at office. No knowledge hot to connect because it's a technical product. It is not a child's play. Also while ordering extended warranty option was missing now it is reflecting. Very confused whom shall I call for the remedy. Either buy in directly from croma or Hp they provide full solution till installment and extended warranty
4,"1. Suitable for small office and home office2. Scanner is good.3. WiFi connectivity is not great4. HP smart is a cloud based app. If you install HP smart half the drivers do not get installed. Reliability is low.5. HP support was very helpful in getting the application package/drives/installation for this device. (Alternatively you can look for drives/set up for Hp 4100 family series drives/app and install)6. Post installation of dedicated app and drives, the device is working beautifully."
1,"I am totally disappointed with it so I replaced it bt after the  replacement while the verification they made cancelled so the product could not replaced. I lost my money 😭😢😢😢. And product is not working properly, while printing it takes whole papers and printing will be in the corner of paper."
1,"don't waste your money on this, within 10-15 pages your black cartridge will be over, and within 10 pages your color will also over, then after that, you cannot refill your cartridge, directly you have to purchase a new cartridge with cost 1400+ for 2 cartridges, wireless connectivity also not good, also it is very complicated to use, the best thing I can say about this is DONT PURCHASE IT."
1,"This is not working properly taking multisheet at a time, ink drying quickly even in black, setup is taking long time and not easy to understand,Quality of the priniting also very bad, it will trouble lot to normal printer user,Service center of hp is very pathetic not even bother about the customer..."
3,"HP DeskJet 4123 Multi-Function Inkjet Printer with ADFThere is absolutely no documentation with the printer. The one-page instruction takes you to a website that is not helpful. It took me a while to get it to work on Windows 10. USB connection didn't work. Can't comment on the quality of printing just yet, but looks pretty average.Do not buy if you don't know what a printer driver is, where to search for it, download and install it. Ideally, such ""home printers"" should have a plug and play installation."
1,"It's works very slowly , I don't like it ...I ordered it but when I connected it via wifi the name of this device is 4100 I don't understand what is happing here, bit confuse this product is real or fake the blue sticker which was their above it's surface in every product in the review. ...But in my product nothing shown like this..I don't no this product is real or not ?"
5,"speed of the print & cost per page print is what the major difference for model to model.At this price range, its decent one.Best for home usage(max 100-150 prints per month).Cons:* Configuring wifi is not simple(especially while using iPhone/Mac). Company can consider giving manual for the same."
5,"Works as expected. I'm totally satisfied with this printer. It's pretty good for home or personal use. And fully loaded features with ease like wireless printing, scan, copy and a 35 page auto document feeder. But it wolud have been better if the catrideges could have printed a few more pages."
5,Wireless printer with app for phone and email id to print from remote location. Other ways also for remote printing. You dont need any cable to print from phone or pc. Cartridge are cheap and print quality also good. Document feeder is a plus thing for hasel free copying or scanning
3,"When it works, its great. But that is exceedingly rare. Paper just keeps getting jammed over and over again. I am honestly trying everything I can to avoid having to get a print out because of the paper jamming issues. Guess it is more environmentally friendly because you will only get a print out when its the only option"
2,"When printing, it prints good but the cartridge finishes up fast though not many print outs taken.Another issue that the printer is not connected wirelessly... It connects on Wi-Fi once, then if I switch it off and on it again, I have to reconfigure it or use cable for printing."
1,No support from HP at all .. the Customer Care number provide in the site is not reachable.(1800-2000-047)
5,"Very satisfied with this printer, copier & scanner. Good part is it comes with ADF.Best multi function printer in this range."
4,The set up is not easy how ever once done especially the Direct WiFI once set up it becomes a good product.
5,Ordered this for my colleague and he loved the WiFi print option. He kept telling me how great the printer works.
5,"The product was delivered as mentioned. Packaging was good. Installation through the hp app and wifi connection was a little time consuming, however not that hard. The prints are good."
2,It's just been a month I bought this product and have us d it just twice and now getting issues with the connection issue printing issue and sometimes gets error as ink over where in ink is also there is cartridge. Really not happy with the product in just a month.
4,My criteria was once a page print per week or 15 days also it has xerox and wireless connectivity so m happyU need to call a technical guy for setup do book in advance wd hp its freeNot tried scanning rest all is good
4,Received the product well in time. Good product in this price range. Print quality is average. Driver is not included in this package. This is creating problem linking with PC. Otherwise it is a good deal.
5,Printer was well packed with safety. Configuration of wifi with HP smart App and Wifi-Direct is easy. i button helps in getting information or you can check YouTube videos also to setup. 805 cartridges are available tricolour and black both.
4,"It's a good Printer from HP, But consuming lot of Ink. If you are using very rarely you can prefer this printer and scanner is also Good. WiFi Tech is great and we can print from phone also through the connected router which is Good to use on the go."
1,This product is not working not working I said
1,Hp ka printer lena apne pese barbad krna h ....qki ek br ink khatam hone pr dubara ink nhi dal pati ..or to iske sare function sahi se kam nhi krte h....bs me itna khna chahunga ki ...hp ka koi bhi printer mt lena...vrna tumhare pese brbad ho jayegnge ...bs hp walo ko pesa kmana h ...
4,"Print quality is avarage, colour printing trough WiFi takes a lot of time and ink to complete. I have given 3 colour print and the output is good but after 3 prints colour fades on paper. I will recommend go for HP 2700 Series, and the document feeder is quiet useless because it damaged the corner of the pages."
2,No of prints per cartridge is very less. Color cartridge exausts very fast. Each prints costs you more than 10Rs.Technology wise it is good. You can fire prints via wifi. Setup is bit tricky
1,Printing or xeroxing output not clear...After 10pages of printing full dots appear ing....Paper getting stuck inside very often....Noise coming around while copying...Totally not compatible and user friendly...
1,First of all its wifi is not working properly.Secondly it's colour isn't that much good as per printing quality.Thirdly it's not cost efficient.Fourthly It would cost you around 3 INR to print a single page of sheet.Lastly it's not a good choice for me.
2,"Very slow , WiFi very poor performanceNot worth buyingAlso hardly 50 pages printed for 5th std school assignment, now the cartridge is empty."
5,मोबाइल से कनेक्ट करके मोबाइल में सेव डॉक्यूमेंट का प्रिंट कैसे निकाल सकते हैं समझ में नहीं आया बाकी पिक्चर क्वालिटी फोटो कॉपी प्रिंटिंग सही है
1,Printer is not easy to install.It doesn't accept the new cartridges.Cost of print is very high.Number of prints is very low. I wish to exchange this printer if possible.It is better to purchase ink tank printer which is economic.
2,Printing cost is very high go for ink tank printer
5,this is the only reliable reliable barcode scanner for heavy use. build quality is excellent. i have tried other cheaper barcode scanners but they all come with complaints. the reading is also pretty fast.unlike othe brands the tvs barcode scanner reads not so smooth barcodes easily too. my only compaint is the price. but then again you get what you pay for. i had bought two of another brand barcode scanner with less than half the money of this one. those ones broke at the usb at  2 weeks of usage. lost my money.
5,"Works like a charm. Before this i had wireless one, but soon it was dropped on the floor and stopped working, immediately i ordered this one to replace my older wireless scanner. It is working like charm and looks like it's not that fragile like wireless ones.. recommend."
1,Did not scan barcode numbers on to notepad / excel workbook. Please speak to seller. Support team only checks if it can be transferred on notepad...Not very happy with support's response.
1,"Hi Team,This scanner is having very wide laser which causes problem with scanning of small barcodes also round barcodes. It is not working for many items in retail store. Please fix it earliest or replace it with proper scanner.Thanks,Machindra"
1,I just received this product on 1st August and this is not scanning TSC printed  thin barcodes ....... I just pour my money into ash... Thank you TVS

5,"Robustly built printer, resulting in good quality prints and zero failures. I love this printer."
1,"The scanner was delivered to me on 14th June 2020 after paying more than Rs.24,000/-. Today on the 26th July 2020 scanner was required for some urgent work, therefore I tried installing and using it, but in spite of many efforts, I failed to install the scanner.I called the CANON helpline, they asked for some number from the machine which I conveyed to them here comes the shock, I was told by the person on the other side that product which was delivered to me about 12 days is already out of warranty.So is canon cheating us in connivance with Amazon?buyers please, be-aware of fraud which may be happening on Amazon. Better be safe than sorry."
4,"I think DR-C225II  is better than the DR-C225 scanner. It can support longer sheets. The speed of the scanneris very good. The eCopy PDF Pro License key was provided, and only the driver CD. It took a day to figure out fromwhich link on the Canon site one needs to download the ecopy Pro software and the CardIRIRS software. Canon does apoor job on their web site w.r.t support. Calling Canon India support, responded immediately, but they had never heard the name of this software or how to install it. Finally the Canon link was located / provided by the seller.  Thesoftware works great.  Conversion to editable PDF, and exporting PDF files to word for editing are also great.One can scan BW, or colour. It scan both sides. Speed is great. Good for archiving all  old important documents, thatone can now discard after scanning (years of documents for tax purposes , etc !) .  While it is for A4 size, it can scanlonger documents. Only the width is constrained. If you setup the FOLIO option, and fold the wider document, thescanner will stitch the front and the back into a single page. Amazing. (you need to fold is right and make sure the paper does not skew one way. .Installation was fine on Windows 10 Pro x64 bit. I had read of numerous issues faced by others, however it was so straightforward that it installed in now time with no fuss.  It took a while to understand the scanner and thecapture software. Overall I think its a great scanner, and easy to operate."
5,This is the best scanner used by me so far. Speed is good. Scanned 600 pages in 1 hr approx. Comes with CD of drivers. Operating software is easy to use. Provided to me with invoice but when I called canon india they said out of warranty. On telling date of purchase they said ok show invoice when required. Comes with a licence key of eCopy Pro Pdf 6 free but can't find the link to download software. But performance of scanner is overall 10 pointer. I wish if some one could tell me from where to download Ecopy pdf pro office 6.
5,Total Value For Money and wonderful easy to use features
1,"Scanner is good, but its warranty is already expired when i contacted canon, is my scanner is used?? Please dont buy from scanner india seller.... Already two comments on the priduct having expired warranty ,same happened with me..."
1,"Don't even think of buying this product such a deffective 1,always, paper got stuck,for each and every month i need to replace its bush of coast 2800 in waranty period also,i comment this and report this to amazon but no use,plz don't buy it such a irresponsible supplier also"
5,Good product from Canon japan
5,"I bought after seeing reviews on Youtube. Its Easy to use, quick, Good Picture Quality, easy to Install. Scans 30 pages ( front 30+ back 30) in a minute"
4,"Good product,Time saver,Automatically scan both sides.Scan upto 30 pages per minute"
5,"High speed, duplex scanner. However, it scans only loose documents, not suitable for bound documents or books."
4,One month is going to completeWorking wellCompletely Satisfy
5,The scanner provides clear and fast scanning solution and has been very efficient.
5,Product is good working excellent
5,"Easy to use, but would have better if it were wifi enabled"
5,Excellent
5,Good product
5,Gud
5,"The best, compact, user friendly and fast scanner. Overcall best performance. Available at reasonable price. Quick service and response at installation. Overall awesome.After one month usage working fantastic and giving superb output duplex in high speed. If you want to use commercially then go for wifi option scanner same model."
5,Very good device
1,Highly annoyed. The seeker thought he would be able to cheat by packaging the product in such a way that he would be able to hide all the defects. It looks rather like a 3-4 year old second hand printer. The lid was broken. The parts looked worn outThere was no cartridge and USB cable in the box. I would rather buy from official HP site. It’s also cheaper over thereThis is in addition. It’s been over a week and the return has not been made so my money is stuck so I would recommend you guys not to buy from Amazon. I am one of the unlucky guy whose money is stuck. You could be the next one. I have called Amazon more the 10 times still no update from them.
1,"Do not purchase this product. Waste of money. It is having cartridge issues. Even though I installed SETUP cartridge which came along with the product, it is showing error to install SETUP cartridge."
5,Works very well! Print quality is good and speed also good. Works like a charm on wireless network via mobile app! Not tested via USB yet.Arrived on time thanks to amazon logistics!
5,"I don't know why people complaining about the speed of the printer. The printing speed is well upto the mark, even above the mark if it is printing in draft mode. Obviously it is not a laser printer.Installation is hassle-free. Connection is very stable (have not checked USB connection). Print quality is very good. I have also printed from different devices like mobile, laptop and tablet. Only thing is that for android devices, it is by default changing quality to Normal Mode, not Draft mode.Regarding cartridge, till date I have printed 20-25 A4 pages including 5-6 colour prints, still the printer is showing the cartridges are full. Will update when the cartridges empties."
1,"This printer is just a way for HP to make you their customer so that you have to buy their expensive cartridges (800 rupees) every week or so. One cartridge is able to print only 25-28 pages which makes the average cost of one page to almost rupees 30/page. This is the worst investment you can make for a printer. Don't get manipulated seeing the cost of the printer as eventual costs of running would be too high to sustain. Also, the return window closes in 7 days so until you realize how useless this printer is, the window will already been closed and you're now stuck with a useless, too-expensive-to-run printer."
3,Very cheap material used for paper feed tray holder. It was broken on first use to hold papers.  The two pieces that hold the paper tray to an angle were already broken. Packaging was not sealed at all.Interestingly printer was wrapped in a plastic cover making it look completely unused but it is hard to say if it is a refurbished or reused/returned product.Print Head alignment does not work easily.
1,I had huge connectivity issues and the there is no response from service of Hp . Pathetic . Don’t buy
5,Very good for home use.I am enjoying it well.Refilling shops are very less for this catridge which is the only problem I saw
5,Good print quality but installation process is very mind disturbing because when we want to give print via our mobile and at that time you have to face many problem in installation.
3,Suitable for home printing. Printing done only after connecting to computer. Wireless feature does not work.
1,Very bad experience . Not at  all good.Regret buying this.
5,good quality product value for money
4,Installation process is very difficult
2,Taking much time to print a single page.. unhappy
4,Good
5,Schoolwork sheet printout but not connecting n smart phone
5,Good
1,Didn’t work .
5,Nice
1,Ink cartridges are used
3,Randomly thros up an E1 error which is paper eroor. Anytime you try setting A4 as the paper size this error pops up. Unable to use the printer
1,"Don't buy this product. I bought same printer which has manufacturing defect . I raised a incident with HP but there is no resolution yet . HP is very poor in providing services .scanning is not working and to print one page , it takes 10 min . Most important , HP doesn't care after sales"
5,Best printer in Market. I will recommend this purchase to everyone. It is worth the value of your investment. Go ahead
5,"Best home printer, very useful, worth to have it. It is a very cost effective product . Print very well"
1,Broken printer. Replacement has been such a big hassle that I had to cancel and return. Scanner glass completely shattered om delivery.
5,"This is the scanning beast. Can scan 2 sides in one go in no time. Good for offices having large document scanning tasks. Takes A4, Legal, cards, photos."
4,"Overall a good product, but costly"
5,Great product....
5,Good and fast deliveryWorks fine scans upto 10 papers front and backInstallation takes time
1,"Fully Waste Product. Output File size becomes huge. Wen contacted customer care,  they said nothing can be done.. Dont buy this product. Rather buy Cannon.  Its bit higher priced,  but worth"
5,"Small footprint but excellent performance, used only for a couple of days but impressed with the performance so far."
3,Ok
3,"Printer is superb, scanning quality very good but bad things of this scanner is only operate thought light, not with inverter"

4,Satisfied
1,Received a defective product.
5,Good
5,"Value for money and Easy to useTime saving, Don’t give bad feedback, excellent product every office should have this product. Jet Speed to scan"
3,Rollers leave black mark on the sheets. This is unexpected for a brand like HP. Disappointed with the performance of the scanner
5,Good product for time saving
2,"I bought one of these, a decade back, in person from a store. It was great. The one that i got from Amazon, when i tested it..it left oil stains all over the papers i tested it on. Even after a 20 tests, the oil din't stop leaking. Clearly, the seller had a defective old one lying around for a long time, just oiled it, packaged it and gave it away to Amazon."
1,The scan of papers is extremely bad and replica of the copy is difficult to read. Lots of lines and dots in the soft copy even after trying over multiple copies. Scanner tends to sway from direction of scanning and requires a person to stabilise the paper with another hand so it’s difficult to use when trying over multiple papers.
5,Useful product. Good service given by Tobo
2,"Mobile scan or portable scan are same & no difference,but flat scan are best which is not possible with this device."
5,Working good
5,Good product..
5,good
1,"Ridiculous, We received a broken red brick in the box. I heard such stories from friends and others on social media but today I've experienced it."
1,"These guys have sent me a completely used product, it has pen stains on it and there is a lot of dust in all the crevices of the device also the device wasn't at its default settings. Do not buy this, it's safe to say that the product is complete TRASH!"
5,Product is just awesome works verry well no issues and even scans prfctly ...juat there was very late delivery to me a si have ordered on 1st of august and i got this product on 21st of august..
5,Good quality product and it's very easy to use.

5,"got this product for 1699, its worth buying a products.the product is awesome"
4,The product is exactly what is shown. A 90° usb extension. I use my laptop on my bed with laptop's side resting on the mouse's usb port which caused the wire to wear down. That's why I needed this. I still think it's a bit too expensive for what it offers but it's chepaest of its type at Amazon(Rs449 right now) and I can't find this in nearby stores or other online stores so that will have to do
5,Too expensive but didn't have any other cheaper option. Very good quality and visually good looking.
5,I bought this so that my laptops usb port would not bear the strain of frequent use. It works well for that purpose. The cable feels very high quality.
5,Superb quality. Definitely will last long.
5,Quantity is excellent... But price could be better
5,Sturdy product
2,"I have a desktop and a laptop computer. I was in search of a good KVM product to share the same mouse and keyboard among the desktop and laptop. I found a couple of USB switch on Amazon. I have decided to buy this product after I see good ratings on Amazon.Now, I have been using this for few weeks. I have connected a Headset, mouse, and a Logitech Gaming Keyboard. During this time, I found a vineyard problem with the product. I have started experiencing some keys performance problems with keyboard. Keys on The keyboard Becomes unresponsive. I don't see any patron in the keys. After sometime keys would start working without doing any changes. But, on the other hand the problem start appears with other keys. When I connect the keyboard directly to the desktop I don't see any problem.It didn't full fill my purpose."
5,"So I got this because I regularly use a laptop when I'm out and a PC at home, but they have different softwares and CAD packages on the two machines, and I use one mouse for both, so I wanted something whre instead of having to unplug my mouse adapter everyone I wanted to use the other device, I could easily swap between the twoThis is an especially big deal for me because my hands are often so cold that my trackpad on my laptop doesn't recognise my fingers, so I rely on the mouse for that.I wanted something that was much quicker and easier because I often find myself swapping between the two whilst I'm working.I got this after a friend recommended one to me, and it looked to fit the bill wellI'll admit, it seemed a lot to spend on what's effectively a glorified switch but it is working wellThe build quality is alright, it has a lovely power coated finish although the plastic connectors leave a little bit of a slight gap which makes it feel less premiumIn terms of function, it's incredibly easy to set-up, simple to use and swaps between the two very quicklyThe button could be a bit larger and placed on top instead for easier switchingit would also be nice if it had some bracket so you could mount it permanently to something like your desk to stop it slidjng around, but I'm going to design a 3d printed housing for it instead and I'll share details of it she I do so people can have it fixed down properly, I'm planning on mourning it under my desk hidden away but in arms reachOverall, it has made it just slightly easier to swap between teh two and that is something I do likeit swaps over quickly and it looks really neat, it matches my nice iclever powered usb port station which is the same powder coated style"
5,"I have a gaming desktop and work laptop sharing the same big monitor.In the case of switching the keyboard and mouse, it was a daily task this device made it easy for me.It should have auto-switching in case of a single device connected.Cable quality is great and for Keyboard and mouse it really doesn't need a power"
5,"I wasn't sure if this would work for my setup since it needs external power from 5V adapter (micro USB) or included USB from computer. It actually works better than I thought. I have 2 home computers and one has USB ports that stay powered on. When I turn on the other system, it AUTOMATICALLY switches to that one and everything is seamless. Because my USB front panel isn't working, this switch is perfect for flash drives too. The blue light are very bright but I have it tucked inside a desk and it hasn't been a problem. My monitor has 2 inputs so I didn't need to bother with a video switch."
5,"I use it with a main system running Linux Mint and a secondary system that uses rapsberry pi and is used for entertainment and downloads. This allows me to use two net connections at the same time.The switching is easy but takes like five seconds. The only issue is that I have remeber to switch to my main system after shutdown of rasoberry pi, else pi will not boot. Looks like it take too much power."
5,"I have a PC for gaming and a LAPTOP for work. Every time I had to open my laptop I had to move my keyboard and mouse. Thanks to this, I am able to use my PC keyboard and mouse with my laptop with a click of button.PROS:1. USB 3.0 x 4 ports for connecting your peripherals2. USB 3.0 x 2 ports that goes to your devices2. Good build, I would not say its excellent3. Can power devices with high voltage requirement4. Does not move around easily, it has a rubber base which holds it at one placeCONS:1. Does not come with a 5V micro USB adapter, I had tp scrounge my cable dump to get one to power my gaming mouse and keyboard"
5,"I bought this so that I can switch my devices between my pc and macbook Air. Works as good as its supposed to. You get to use 4 devices with systems (obviously not at the same time) without the rewiring hassle.The build is decently good. Made of plastic, but is sleek and sturdy. The usb ports have just the right amount of tightness, the switch button is satisfying to click without any springy feeling. LED indicator maybe useful for some, but I don't look at it.If you're looking for a 4 port usb switch, this is perfect."
5,Desperately needed this to share single keyboard/mouse/camera/mic between two PCs. Looks very premium.  No mess with double of everything. Clean wiring and clean table as a result of this. Cables provided are nice and good quality. Saved money too.Found it after a lot of searching. A lot.Thank you Amazon for a great product. 30% lesser cost would have been great.
4,"I have 3 computers. I use this for my work and my gaming pc or laptop, which ever i feel like using. Works as intended. It makes my desk much cleaner with a lot less clutter.The only problem I've had is my Bluetooth headphone disconnects and reconnects if i switch between the computers, not sure why because i use the switch only for my keyboard and mouse.(Edit: After the first two days, I haven't noticed my headphones getting disconnected)Overall great product 👍"
1,"If you are looking to use this with a keyboard and mouse please DO NOT BUY.I have one wired mouse and a bluetooth keyboard attached and the erratic mouse movements and repeated / missed keystrokes are just not worth it. I'd rather spend 2 mins plugging in the mouse and keyboard on the other system than deal with this.They know it's a rubbish product so they won't accept returns as well. I've ordered a replacement, maybe that will work better, but I have a feeling I've just lost money on a horrible product that can't handle a mouse and a keyboard."
5,"I am using from months & the USB switch is working fine for me.I has to frequently switch between 2 laptops, so the wireless mouse & keyboard are connected to the USB switch.Just one press on button of USB switch and I am able to take the mouse & keyboard on needed laptop.It brought the freedom to access, 2 workstation with 1 set of mouse & keyboard.Recommended to go with it."
3,I have a razer rgb keyboard and logitech g410 mouse connected to this switch. I have a laptop and a desktop. Oftentimes the switch doesnt properly switch over the connected system. Keyboard and mouse will receive just power but no data. Also i tried connecting external 5 volt supply. Still buggy. Not worth the money.
5,"I have one word for this product - Boon.This has been a gripe of mine for as long as we all have been working from home - inability to share peripherals over LAN to work laptops. Now I have my Keyboard, mouse and headphones all hooked up to this unit, and it has been seamless. There is no apparent input lag for gaming. I've ordered this product when there were zero reviews and ratings, I cannot even imagine a situation where it has paid off better."
5,"The product is working is expected. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the provided cables, it's way too good.I didn't feel the need to use supplied USB-A to micro USB cable for external power supply. Using a mouse, a keyboard and an external hard disk worked fine without it."
1,"I bought this like everybody else to switch between desktop and laptop share common keyboard/mouse pair and other use devices. The device worked well for about 10 days, and then stopped working - the USB keeps connecting/disconnecting on the system - keeps switching between the systems, and both systems keep buzzing with USB connect/disconnect sound - if you know what I mean. I tried switching power supply, cables, systems etc. nothing helped. Ironically, this stopped working 2 days after the exchange window was valid. Guess, my money is wasted now :("
4,"Works like a charm. Does what it is meant to do. Just a feedback, it would be great if the product had some weight in it, maybe metal below, as it keeps of flying around as the cable provided are huge and heavy. A factory provided double sided tape or a Screw holding hole would have been great."
5,"comes with heavy duty USB cables.and easy to setup and overall i am happy seeing it is help me to switch.it has usb power socket as well, but this works w/ or w/o separate power.It is always better to use the external power  bcz the USB ports in the laptop may not be supplying enough current.I am using 4v/3A mobile charger to power this hub and i have custom hardware with high power rating is connected w/o issues for weeks now."
5,Excellent product. Quality of cables is too good. Works as described. Plug and use no additional software needed. Addition power cable is also provided to drive power hungry devices.
5,I am now able to share a single keyboard and mouse between my office and personal laptop. With this product I was able to remove the clutter on my desk and keep it clean.. very good quality too.
5,I was looking for a hassle free solution to toggle between my work and personal laptop. This switch selector gave me the solution I was looking for. Its very easy to install and use. The size is almost that of a pocket HDD and light weight. With a click of a button I cab share my keyboard and mouse between the two stations.
4,It is available for cheaper if you buy it outside and the it is made out of plastic so durability is a cause for concern but it does what it advertises.
4,I have only connected my keyboard and mouse to it and it functions perfectly. There is a 1-2 second delay when you switch from one to the other.The quality is average and there was a rouge screw in the one I received and will have to open it up to get it out.
5,Solved my worry of continously shifting between work and home pc. Product make is good and buttons are firm. Using this along with a hdmi switch to avoid cluttering my work space.
5,"Easy to setup and run. Works great on Linux and windows. Good quality usb cable, packed with the switch."
5,Easy to use with two computers or laptops at a single time. You can switch from one to another just by a click only. Its light weight and durable
5,Nice build quality - of the main unit and also of the USB cables which come along.No complaints at all.
5,"Works like a charm... Using it for usb mic, hdmi video capture and mouse... Quickly swirches between my mac and windows laptop... Using it for 2 weeks now... Will update again if i find any issue..."
5,"I have 2 laptop's, one I have connected to my office laptop and another to my personal laptop.Now I am able to easily switch between both of them and sharing a single keyboard and mouse."
4,"As i am using two computers, this product comes handy to operate same keyboard & mouse. Sometime device needs power connection to use keyboard, for hard disk it is always.Its is a best product."
5,really fully if you are use dual system and operated with single keyboard and mouse. yhe this is product help you to use
5,"This product works as advertised. I needed to to easily switch my peripherals my work and home PCs. This product is smaller and much lighter than I expected. I was able to plug and play with no issues. Overall, It just works for my purposes."
1,Please don't buy this product as it is unreliable. It worked perfectly fine until today when it suddenly stopped working. Pathetic!
1,"The switch randomly changes source. Even if there is only  a single source connected, it randomly stops working for few seconds every other minute. Totally not worth the money."
5,It is working as described.
1,Stopped working after 3 weeks
5,"Good product, easy to setup, meeting my need to share keyboard and mouse between 2 laptops."
4,"It is not a bad product after all, it is easy to use and no need of an external supply.Cons: it shows a minor lag while switching"
5,Work well as the mentioned in the description.  No issues after using it for a week.
5,u can connect audio input devices( usb mics) but u will need to plug in the micro usb
4,"Works well, no lag between the switching. Easy to use. Would have been good if it did not draw power separately."
2,"Delivered seal opened product, these days I am seeing these type issues with amazon"
4,Overall it was an easy self installation and the print quality and print speed is as expected and solve the purpose for home use. The WiFi direct setup was done easily and prints well but the setup for WIFi with router is documented as simple 2 lines step but somehow is not working properly and need some better detailing.HP certainly wins my bet ahead of Epson and Canon after all my initial research.
5,Recently bought hp smart tank 516 printer. Built quality is quite good. You get very simple instruction manual very easy to follow. Filling the ink tanks to printing was very easy. After downloading the application n connecting with printer via wifi was quite good. Took some document prints as well as photo print on photo paper. Both were good. So far impressive. Need to see how much print can be taken with the given ink.
1,Multiple follow up for installation but there is no sucess.The technician assigned is super busy and never call you back. I  afraid how can they support when there is an issue in the printer.. Poor support
5,Awesome. Worth the money
5,nice quality
1,"Very difficult to install WiFiStruggling , there is hardly anything in the manual"
5,"Easy to install, print quality good, wifi easy to setup."
5,"Wonderful Printer. Easy to setup, good quality, print quality is good."
5,Good product for home use
5,Great printer. Great features.
3,Print speed is very slow.
1,Printer is not at all working....Not connecting to wifi
2,Do not work this printer
2,Colour print quality is really bad.
3,"For this price,Build quality is too bad"
4,Awesome
5,Window 7 not supporting in my system.so help me .and how work in my window support my computer required.which window
1,I got a used product and when i opened the ink bottles were empty and all the inks and peintheads were already stabled in printer that means someone has used it.

4,Software be download from futronic homepage. But it cannot be used more than place. It can be used main lock the computer.
5,Excellent product
3,"It was delivered a few hours before the time given. I have just set it up and using the HP app on my phone to print, scan and copy. You can email and send documents on WhatsApp too. HP app is impressive. Responds to commands quickly.Packing was impressive. Unpacking not time consuming. Setting up through HP app on my iPhone was smooth. All functions work well. Connected it to Alexa and the voice commands works too. The only thing to note is the gap between claim of speed of printing and actual printing time it takes. If you are using it for personal use and are not in a hurry the printer speed will not annoy you. It's slow, very slow. I believe it prints not more than two pages b/w in 60 seconds."
1,"This  printer - HP DESKJET INK ADVANTAGE 2700 ALL IN ONE printer of HP make  was purchased on sale, but it ended up with worst product.  The paper jam occurs more frequently, the printer was very very very slow,  print on both pages option not available, and the top loading paper mode was giving more trouble.  The box was not opened for the first 4 days due to Covid pandemic instructions.  The courier boys were first source of spreading covid, and to take utmost care, we have not opened the box containing printer for the first 4 to 5 days till it is completely sanitized.  After installation we had faced so much of inconvenience in paper loading.  The printer is absolutely non-performing, and malfunctioning.  You are requested to immediately take back and give refund or give credit for future purchases.  I am a prime member and dont disappoint by claiming any excuses.  Simply the product (printer) which was purchased on sale was a dump product and is a totally mal-functioning and worst product.  Immediate necessary action may be taken at your end."
3,"Well, the hp 2700 delivered initially had problems with the paper feed. The paper was pulled to one side and got crumpled inside. Amazon team was kind to give replacement within 48 hours. The replacement (same model) was tested and is working fine. Quality control needs to be in place either at HP end and before delivery."
2,"Though the print quality is descent, I could only print 6 color and 24 black prints using the cartridge that came with the printer against the claim of 150color n 450 black prints...."
3,"If one is decently tech savvy, but without the knowledge of the inner workings of a printer the online demo of how to install a cartridge is not up to mark. Ideally it should have been a 5 minute job to download and set up the printer, but because this model is not listed on HP website it shows demo for other model and the cartridge installation section doesn't mention that you have to pull the cartridge insertion slot from the side where it is usually stuffed. I spent another 10 minutes wondering where the cartridge insertion slot was as per the web demo only to figure out myself it is tucked to one side and needs to be slid to the center to insert the cartridge."
2,Great service by Amazon surprise to see the delivery boy early in the morning...great lots of thanks for delivery person for delivery within 24 hrs and nice product received.But HP service has a big big issue.
5,"Very good quality printer and scanner. Easy to use, especially with the wireless connection. We are using this a lot for our work as well as for our kids online school assignments. This is especially helpful because we don't want to go to a cybercafe during pandemic."
5,This printer is working super duper. No catalogue is available with this product except the one featuring essential basic things. But it takes you to the website from where you can set up the entire matters. I am a layman  of 67 years with not much exposure to the nitty gritty of all these but I could manage the entire set up by myself and the printer was in action in less than one hour. Do not regret in purchasing this. I use it at my home ( no commercial need.)Satisfied. Worth the money spent.At this time of writing this review I do not know how much prints one can have from the first cartridge I got along with it.
5,"I initially hesitated to buy this printer reading the reviews,but as it was an emergency I bough it. It got delivered in 2 days, packing was flawless. The wifi setup is easy enough, It took me less than 15minutes to learn everything about it and print from my phone. The print quality is great and it's fast enough, atleast as fast as they claim, 7pages per minute(colour, std quality) ,best quality printing will take longer time and will be taxing for your cartridge, might not need that for most cases. Please ignore other reviews, You can trust me and have a wonderful experience with this printer. Btw I bought it for 5399 ₹, which is excellent value."
2,"Installation was not easy even for the person whose living is earned by working with all such devices. Before he could show me how to print, curfew & lockdown have kept him away. There's no manual in hard copy to help me. Instead of messages from the printer such as ""no paper"" etc there are symbols & they're placed on top, not facing the user. Crippled as I am, not knowing what is showing on top because I'm sitting in front of the desk, not able to ask someone to tell me what symbol is lighted up, & even if they tell me, having no manual to guide me, the printer is unusable at present.Online videos are focused on wireless use & using via phone. Nothing else seems to matter.Because I hadn't found another printer that's not designed similarly, & this was all I could afford, I bought it. Now I'm sorry I did."
4,"The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the first three pages that I printed, the ink smudged across the page. That apart, I am well-satisfied with this product. My usage is not heavy but I generally end up printing between 5-10 pages per week, and this is good enough for my purpose. Linked up well with the android phone also. I don't understand why the latest app was not available in the given HP page, but as soon as I installed the printer app, it blanked out my phone and asked me to install the ""new"" plugin. I mean, where's the point of having two different plugins for the same purpose. Would have been much better to update the main app, rather than force the users to install multiple plugins."
5,"In the past I have used printers of various brands as I do a lot of printing and scanning work. My two year old printer is an Epson ink tank. This is the first time I am using a wireless printer and I am satisfied with the ease of printing and scanning. No more wires required, just connect to the printer wifi and print. The set up was a bit confusing because they have not mentioned much on the printer's manual. The printer's wifi password is also not there on the manual, you will have to print the password from the printer itself. It's a combination of digits. I still have not figured out how to use my home's wifi to print using this printer. There are two ways I use this printer:1. By connecting usb cable from device to printer. This is wired printing.2. By connecting to the printer's inbuilt wifi from any device. This is wireless printing.The third way to print is using your home's wifi which I am not interested. The built quality of the printer is good. However, the color in the cartridge gets used up really quick. I bought this to get print quicky and wirelessly. I still have my Epson ink tank printer for heavy printing. All in all this is a good wireless printer in it's price range."
5,"The printer, scanner and copier, all the functions work very smoothly. You need to give it some time after proper setup so that you can get the best possible speed of printing.Don't fall for negative reviews. People don't understand how the things work in these printers, hence they assume that it doesn't work properly and give negative reviews. Yes, some of them might be genuine issues but I'm sure that not all of them are problematic.If you find problem in detection of page (wrong page size shown) then it is just because of that blue stopper marker, slide and fit it to the tightness, with the page width, I assure you the wrong page size problem will no longer be the problem anymore.Use it wisely to get the longest lifespan and also protect ot from dust to achieve the same...Thank you..."
1,"This is my second printer from HP. First one was 377x series and a best one. Got it for less than 5k. But had a manual hardware damage then I bought this one. Both are pure personal purpose. Highly overpriced with Less capabilities and a complicated one to use!! Very disappointing and regret now. Instaed of this headache , might by one more - but I doubt if it's from hp this time ..."
4,Easy to setup and was delivered next day. Additional black cartridge promised as part of the order was missing.. overall decent for home use.
5,". HP support videos are useful to setup the printer with cartridge etc.printer is easy to setup using hpsmart app on phone. Also once it's setup can be easily accessed from laptop,ipad when all are connected to same wifi.As of now cannot comment on cost of each print..since our usage is very low and just bought it 2 days ago."
1,This product is not user friendly specially through Wifi and mobile Hp app. When the product is purchased online the company or dealer should arrange for installation of the product through their engineer /staff. We are suffering a lot in the absence of this facility. It has become regular practice not to care for after sale service or follow up personally with customer by email or phone through their idle staff just to ask whether the product is working in good condition? and to the expectation? My product is not working till date. Although the cartridges are costly we must get the output as assured by the company. Since last 10 years I am using Hp printer but this time I am totally upset specially in current pandemic situation.
3,"Agree with another reviewer. The quality is questionable.The first printer I got had a defective paper feeder. The ink receptacle also had problems. After every print job E would flash on the printer display. HP support was useless.Fortunately, Amazon agreed to replace (no refund).The second printer set up and works fine."
5,"Quality 10/10Weight - lightSpeed per page - color print slow, black print good.Overall best printer for home usage (300 pages per month) best use.Wifi dual band, easy installation, HP Android application, Alexa, Google Assistant, LCD display Print, Scan, Copy . All in one best printer."
4,"I have ordered yesterday evening and recieved it today.User manual doesn't have much details but got installation demo video on YouTube for 2700 series which helps to get printer installed.Installation is very easy. As of now, printed few b&w and colour pages and happy with the quality of printing.Will write another review after using it for some more days."
2,I recently purchased HP printer 2788. It has printing issues as it prints only on fourth corner of page while rest remains blank. I called customer care of HP they informed about motherboard issue which is manufacturing defect. I asked them to replace the printer but they didn't agreed and said that someone will visit to fix it or I go myself to center to get it done. This is a really bad approach. My printer is under warranty thereby needs replacement on manufacturing defect. I am requesting Amazon as a seller to help with this and get the warranteed product replaced.
1,"Not detecting A4 size paper, no option to connect to agent on customer care, service centre in gurgaon does not have any provision of complaint registration, they don't know email id for complaint registration and very rude behavior by Ms. Babli who attended my call. She doesn't know anything on how to provide support if customer is facing any issue."
4,HP printer 2778 is great for wireless printing and features for wireless connectivity. Initially i had problems with slow printing issues abot 3.5 mins/page but calling up the HP customer care solved my issues on slow priting. Rest all is fine with this printer.
1,"Both HP & Amzon fooling customer. I started facing issue in product within 1 month of purchase but brand is not able to provide proper warranty services, they dont have any service center nearby my location & asking to visit 200kms away service center which is truly impossible for anyone. When approached Amazon for help, they too not able to help due to policy concerns. In short complete waste of money."
1,"After printing, almost 150 black cartridges are empty and colour after 20 pages (A4). The product description was around a rupee and few paise for black and 2 rupees for colour print. Nut in my experience, it is 5.30 rupee for black and white and 40 rupees for colour printer.A complete waste of moneyPrint quality was good, but the installation process was a little time-consuming (registration in the hp smart app and time taken to detect and register the printer)."
3,the printer keeps getting stuck as there is some glitch with windows 10. works fine with my pc's running older versions of windows. Just wont work well with pc's running on windows 10.Setting up the printer is simple and fast . just when printing there is a problem onec the first print job is given then you have to manually reset the print spooler service after every job .
1,"Very bad, it doesn't even get connected, worst product and worst support from Amazon as well as hp I have experienced so far"
2,"First Printer is made in China. It's language also comes in Chinese. Wifi connectivity is very poor, every time while you give print first pair your device it's taking to much time . In box showing Model No. 2770 but in software it's showing 2700 series, and printer also showing in Wifi 2700."
3,First time I received the printer was not even starting. Though it was brand new condition.I ordered replacement and had issues with print quality with stripes and mirror imaging of pictures. Bit shocked with hp quality and unnecessary taking all the troubles. May be I was having bad luck
1,Product does it job but overpriced during sale. Just a false hype created to sell this model.Also paper feeder seems defective getting paper size errors.
5,"Not so easy to install but manageable despite the lack of instructions for this model. Wireless works great but since my WiFi password changed I have been using with wire as am too lazy to figure out how to reinstall it. Print quality is great and I don’t use colour just black and white draft prints which give me 350-400 pages from new cartridge. I am happy with that. The ones that come with the printer are for test only and lasted less than 30 prints for me but the cartridge is pretty affordable so I am very happy with this buy. Would recommend as it’s lightweight, easy to use and prints regular pages pretty fast (not colour)."
3,"The specifications stated that the printer is compatible to windows 10 and 7 along with some other os. But the printer hp2778 which was supplied to me was not compatible to windows 7 and compatible to windows 10 only. Although at the time of ordering I got it clarified also. Moreover on the package carton also mentioned compatible to windows 10,7. Due to this non conformity I had plenty of trouble in installing the printer. Ultimately I have to get set with a laptop having windows 10 as os hence incurring additional costs and inconvenience."
5,"For home use it is very good printer. With Wifi feature I can shift my printer to any place in my home. I took photo prinout on A4 photo paper and print was very good, but it took lot of colour ink. Overall satisfied with the printer."
1,"This printer is not working properly. Not able to connect to wifi or laptop.  Not able to print documents from my laptop.  I want to replace it, if possible."
1,The product didn’t work after installation  - had to call hp engineer who said that the PCB is not working and they Would repair it instead of replacing the printer
5,"Very good product.Printer is light weight, easy to install n set up. Print quality very good. Got 2 cartridges with it. Compact.Highly recommended 👍"
1,IF I COULD GIVE LESS THAN 1 STAR I WOULD.THE PRINTER IS CONSTANTLY THROWING PAPER MISMATCH ERROR. TRIED DIFFERENT SETTINGS BUT TO NO AVAIL. COPY SIZE GETS RESIZED AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN SETTINGS.I AM FED UP OF THE PRODUCT.
2,"First paper will not get straight,it has lot of error,ink get half exhausted after 4 th colour print. I didn't like the product ..Not a value for money.."
5,Very compact lightweight printer. Wifi is working nicely. Installing HP smart in Laptop is a little tricky but at the end it's working fine.
4,"Vary wrost product, waste of money, cartridge ink finished within 15 days and unable to refill it, refilled but not getting actual colour. Very bad product. Not expected such thirdclass quality for HP"
5,Very nice product and software as well.. must buy for you or your secretary...
5,Compact and well made card scanner. Recognises text quite accurately. I bought this one after doing a lot of research on review sites. Almost all of them placed this one as the best of the lot. I'm fairly happy with my purchase.
5,Software is awesome. Scanning is near to perfect and quick. Searching contact is easy.You can locate address on Google Maps. You can mail directly from this software.
1,"The product failed to work and attempts to return were futile.  We tried everything possible, it just does not work.  Such a waste of money.Dont buy."

5,"I had some hesitation on buying this product as there was no warranty support etc. The product came neatly packaged, and was delivered much ahead of the promised schedule.The product did NOT have a user's manual, but it was easy to figure out the operations. This product also comes up with a slide in which negatives can be firmly placed, which makes the whole scanning process easy and error free.In 5 days I could digitise around 800 of old photo negatives. This device requires a USB memory card, and stores all the images into this.  I am attaching two digital photos taken from old negatives. The original photo was taken in year 2001 at New York. Notice the colour difference among the two images. The green shade comes when negatives which are not of good quality (i.e faded out due to improper storing) are scanned."
3,Photo comes with green shade ...
3,It is good design but steel not connectedIt app not connected I join in wifi but steel not connected
4,"Used this for scanning codes, live gauges and with Revheadz app. Good tool but pins are not gold plated. Latency average is 0.1 secs. Runs always on even after removing key. Frequent dropouts but fulfills the needs. Must have in a car."
5,"Works well,used it on my duster 110PS,safari,eon and dominar400There is a bit of lag but not too much value for money"
1,In the image on website there is cd but when it reached me there is no cs. There is a page .You have to scan.I tried many times but not working.I dont recommend this.

5,"Its great. It serves my purpose of digitising my library.However, Software is not up to mark. Often there is a mistake while splitting the page. And it can't perform OCR on Indian Vernaculars (but can on Cantonese, Mandarin and other Asian scripts). How sad is that?"
5,"This product is swesome, its package is so nice and safe for the item. A must buy for someone looking for book scanner. Amazon service is much better than i expected may be the best of its kind."
3,"1.When scanning double Page, two pages not coming properly.2.Size of the file also very big more than 14 mb of a A5 size 100 page, when scanned with general scanner it is 4mb with 300 Dpi.3.Speed also not upto the mark whatever wrote in manual.4.not worthy"
5,"Best product ever, I scanned 86 pages of book at low quality, low size, it took 2 mb of space and best quality at the lowest settings. Go for it.Thumb cots only auto-removed when two page setting is applied.86 page took 2-3 minutes, as I am a new to this."

Very easy to install (took only 5 minutes) and use.- Its able to capture the print quickly and without any issues.- For Windows 7: Its plug n play and For windows 10, drivers can be downloaded from there website.-  Comes with a OTG cable (Not USB type C).- It can be used with mobile also. Android app can be downloaded ( Link is provided on there company website).- Can be used for aadhar/kyc/pension validation.- Built quality is also good.- 1 year warranty."
3,It's not up to my expectations as the OTG cable does not meet my requirements. I had expected c type cable but on opening the box I found the OTG cable is not c type. So I could not use it instantly.
5,The scanner is easy to install and use with Jeevan Pramaan software downloaded from Jeevan Pramaan website. Follow the instructions after downloading booklet.Thank you.

5,"Purpose:I bought this scanner to digitise 1000s of 1970s, 80s pictures of our family. Most of the photos were already faded and lost colour.Progress:I have already completed scanning 2000+ photos and works like charm. Exactly what I expected.Feedback:1. Works perfectly on my Mac (despite some reviews say it doesn't). I am using latests Mac OS version on MacBook Pro. Was not hard setting it up on my Mac. Just downloaded the latest version software ""Epson Scan 2"" from the website and it worked.2. Picture Quality is much better than any other scanners I tried (& bought) before trying this one. Quality is close to what you can see in the picture, is what you will get it on your file. Other scanners, though they claim 48 bit colour, they gave colour banding issues.3. Faded colours are auto corrected if the feature is enabled during scan. (I still had to do some on Photoshop)4. Both Colour and Grayscale pictures worked perfect.5. Best part is, when you scan multiple photos, the photos are cropped into separate files and colour restoration works for each photo separately.Overall: No complaints so far. Bit expensive though."
5,The Epson V600 photo has to be the most efficient and budget-friendly scanner out there. If you are a photographer who shoots on film and wants to have more control over your negatives then go for it!I have scanned 500’s of 35mm & 120 mm film negatives and I found no flaw as of yet.PRO TIP : You can get yourself a free Silverfast scan software by just entering your product ID number. Go to the EPSON website to get more details on it.
4,Good Product.
5,very nyc product. best for DMIT test
5,Great one......but was confused earlier how to download software. But found API exe on Futronic.tech website. Thanks for prompt delivery to Amazon....But one suggestion...no product info leaflet inside....had there been some info regarding how to setup and take prints....it would have been easier

5,"After reading mixed reviews, i was quiet skeptical to buy this scanner. I have requirement of scanning aroud 100-500 pages/day in legal size. My operating system is Mac, which confined my options further more.On Amazon, the product was not available so I played a gamble and got it from local store in Lucknow at around Rs. 18,800/-. Its performing pretty well.Also, I want to update, rhe EPSON site has numerous softwares and drivers available. All the support is available for MAC. One of the best options available for bulk scanning, specially for Advocates where most of the Hon'ble Courts in India are shifting to e-files.Good product.Overall rating: 5/5"
5,"This a perfect scanner I was looking for. Lawyers who find it difficult to scan bulk legal papers , this is a ease to them. It is fast in scanning and has multiple of settings to allow you to scan as per your requirements size and clarity. The only issue with this scanner is it consumes more space, more than a normal printer size and it has to be connected to a particular device. It has no wifi. But overall the scanner is the best at this price and brand offered here. Highly recommended.👍🏻"
5,Beauty of a product
3,Good
5,The packing was very good. The scanner works fine. The product and quality is also very good. Works faster than all my scanners. I hope it continues to work like this in future as well.
2,"Scanner's Feeder is not detected the papers, so i had to return it. If the documents are old, then rollers of feeder have to clean very frequent (in after a single scanning)"

1,The product was not as described on the site. So cancelled on mtual agreement.
1,Box is empty... After so many requests there is no response from their side.. It is total harassment...
1,Fraud. Misdescribing the product in the heading. Got only the case. I have refunded earlier they send me back the product again.
1,"HP is cheating the customers. It's cartridge is use and throw and the new cartridge is sold for Rs.4800. You can't use the refilled cartridge. We have been cheated and suggesting everyone, not buy this. If you change a new cartridge every time it will cost you Rs.3.14 for a page printing.  HP has become MAD. A Big NO to the printers having this type of cartridge 110A."
1,"i will not recommend this printer because after finish tonner, while you will refile this very costly,Rs 200 only ink refillingRs 300 only for the chip because of this chip-based cartage.Rs 200 for drum etc.if you go for new cartage than original cost will be around Rs 5000/1500 pages, if you go local than Rs 1400/500 pages.not easily available in local market."
2,I got this printer and wanted to connect my phone to it. I am told that it won't work on an IOS and neither a MAC because it aint compatible. Tech support people should know that wifi printing doesn't really use drivers and its just configuration. At the time of calling I was already able to print through my MAC. While connecting through my phone it was asking for the printers network key. I was told to call HP for the same. The truth is that to get the network key just print the network config from the printers menu - simple. Also while listing out product information do mention the GHz band in which the printer will work - its 2.6Ghz only and not 5Gz as modern day broadband networks are. Or if you have a dual band router. A customer who is not technically sound will either return your product or will give a bad customer satisfaction score as I am doing.
3,"I purchased it for 16500, choose ed over cannon product.This is difficult to install...my computer didn't recognize printer.no hp package helpful.hp wireless app is also useless app.i used mopria print,scan apps and finally got print through android phone.My computer still not recognise the priner through USB . don't buy"
4,"I have been a Canon follower for a long time as it had delivered fairly good results, but lately have been miffed by its compatibility to Mac operating system.(I  use a Mac computer). So i hesitatingly purchased this HP printer.The HP smart software is really better than the Canon software in usability and the smart tasks feature is quite friendly. It can color scan documents and photos which is really good whereas its competitor Canon model will not do this even though it is priced higher. This model can scan in color but cannot print in color.Connecting to the HP smart sometimes takes a little long especially uploading to Evernote, ( i don't know why ? )but manageable.I have not really calculated the cost per page as i am not a heavy user to factor this aspect in buying this machine. Overall happy with the machine."
5,"Printer is sturdy and work well except that it doesn’t work generate code to log in the account to use HP smart application,"
5,This hp products is very good and printing quality very good and useful items.
1,The scanner is not working with windows 8. After many try by support team they ask me change the O.S. but why should I change my O.S because of printer..So guys who have windows 8 or 8.1 don't purchase this printer.
5,"Thanks for amazon for giving me great deal to buy this printer at very attractive cost, printer is very good for home or office use also delivery service or packaging of big size products is very nice."

1,"Within 2 hrs of purchase i realized and experienced that running cost of 6075 is BOMB. In a rate of if you keep printing 10 pages Blank and white and 5 color daily., cartige will drain out in week. So, maintenance Cost would be 6,000 Rs per month., as good as buying monthly printer.Other issue:Makes lots of noicePrinting is not crisp, has shadesSlow printingDemoed issues to Amazon support and asked if i can get replacement for other models and they said per policy they can replace with 6075 but not other models.Any selling has to help customers and their satisfaction, but here even if customer is offering more money for better product, Amazon is not willing to exchange.Honestly, get any printer which running cost is low and print quality is good and fast."
4,"Happy with the advertised features like auto duplexing of prints, printing with mobile, laptop over WiFi using the HP App, scan and copy. The most unique feature that I noticed while using the Printer, is the paper storage tray-box. The papers are stored in a box that is like a small drawer near the base of the printer. It’s like a hidden box and to me, it’s a nice invention to keep the papers tucked neatly and dust free. When it runs out of paper, apart from the notification that you get on the app, a light also starts blinking to remind of paper shortage. Also, the printer makes nice sound (wind chime) when it starts and also when it is turned off. A blue light keeps emanating from the point where the paper comes out after printing the documents and the light looks awesome and cool. In the past few weeks, I have taken over 200 prints and the cartridges are still holding up though the printer has been showing notifications of low ink level for last 10-12 pages. Not sure, if this helps - but you will need to disconnect from WiFi and connect to the printer when requesting print from laptop or mobile or tab. Another cool thing is, you can setup a unique email address of the printer and send a print over the email. I have not tried this feature yet but will do so in sometime. Attached are pictures and video for reference. ThanksPS: deducted one star for little struggle that I faced during installation as instructions were not clear and had to download updates and trouble shooter to complete the installation."
4,This is the latest model of HP printer launched in 2020 and the design is sleep look Compared to the old model also the led notifications are futuristic. Connects perfectly and the print quality of the paper is Good.. If you see any change is the warranty it might show bit old but when you call or check in the virtual chat it will reflect correct with your serial number. Will post my second review after a month to see if any issues in the future
5,"Looks classy & does the job well. No complaints!People complaining about the ink getting over quickly should realize that cartridge that came with the printer is a ""starter"" cartridge. The actual HP 682 that we would need to buy once the starter cartridge runs out would last much longer."
3,"The products build quality is superb, installation part is easy, but there are zero controls on the printer itself and all is controlled through an hp app, the color toner gets finished faster than you can imagine... Only 20 color print outs and it's already gone... So printing colored is expensive. Would recommend people to go for ink tank options as this one is having expensive printing."
5,"Jan 05, 2021So far I've printed only with regular paper and the prints are good. Will update the review about print samples when I get some good paper and print.Ink - runs out pretty fast. After some 12 to 15 prints the colour ink level is down by 10% so I'm guessing it will give me a total of about 100 prints before cartridge replacement is needed. thats about 7 to 10 bucks per colour print... not bad because any shop prints colour A4 for about Rs. 30 to 50 and this prints much better quality than the small shops that do these prints.WIFI - this is the most amazing part about the printer. Tried printing via Wifi from iPhone, windows 10 laptops and Desktop, and from Android phone and it works perfectly.Size and look - its really compact and looks slick! I looked at various ink tank printers and finally decided on this because whats obvious from the numerous reviews out there is that ink tanks are for the bulk printing folks. We will print 2 or 3 prints per week and at 7 to 10 rupees for a print in colour with all the features this printer offers us unparalleled value.the ink tanks seem to print duller colour prints because that for bulk low cost printing and not for a discerning buyer. So if you are looking for the best prints in a 10K  printer then this one is hard to beat!will upload photos of print soon.Auto duplex printing is an added advantage and works well too..."
5,"Printer is super easy to install. All the functions like copying, scanning, printing can be performed smoothly. Built is strong. Cartridge installation is also very easy. One can easily set up the printer by following installation guidelines on the HP Smart app. And one can also choose advanced settings on the app and it will take the user to the HP website. The user needs to log into the account and there are a lot of options for settings to choose from. Make the most of the app features to utilise the printer to the fullest."
3,"Printer looks premium but it functions erratically. When papers in the tray are less than 15-20, it won't recognize the same and we have to add more papers. Even after adding papers it will show error and than we have to clear the ""paper jam"" by opening the top cover of the printer (though physically there was no paper jam). Moreover 1st page printing takes longer than the expected time."
5,"Best feature is auto-duplexWifi works flawlesslythe lighting and sound features make it look premium and cutting edge.fits really well with the aesthetics of the room.idk why people are giving it a bad rating. i was reluctant to buy it looking at the ratings, but then i saw some youtube unboxing and bought this with fingers crossed. Im more than happy with my purchase."
4,"It was easy to install. Took just 15mins to complete the process. Print quality and speed looks okay.They provided only starter ink cartridges so I suggest people to not judge the printing cost per page by using starter cartridge.Need to check after using originl cartridge for the cost effectiveness.Overall, I found this printer good. It is the only model with auto duplex (2 sided printing). So I am happy about it."
5,"Very budget friendly yet very economic printer. We get auto duplex printing below 10k price range which is the main point inspired me to purchase this one after reviewing so many printer models from different brands.One may think that cartridge type inkjet printer may not be economoc when compared to ink tank inkjet printers. Well partially it is true when your printing volume is very high compared to occassional printing.One thing is that this model comes only on white. Hence, care has to be taken to keep it clean. Setting it up is very very easy. Before everything you have to download hp smart app in your phone. It supports Bluetooth printing also. Hence, turn on the Bluetooth first, open hp smart amd it will detect your printer. Once hp smart detects it it will ask for you to setup wifi connection for your printer. Requirement of laptop is not essential to setup this printer. That is one of the biggest point of buying it. A mobile/tablet/ipad is enough to get things done."
5,"Strictly for home user who wants no headaches and prints occasionally. Very easy to setup using HP smart App. Did not face a single hiccup while setting up or using it till now.I have taken around 30 prints till now, print quality is very good. Build quality is very good, scan lid could be more sturdy. contemporary design, look and feel. Paper tray is tucked in at the bottom very nicely.Print speed is Ok, not great and not bad either. Duplex printing is awesome. Scanning with high resolution takes time, but usual day-to-day documents which we want to scan with medium or low resolutions, the speed is decent. It came with starter cartridge, so cant expect it to last long,If you are using office laptop for work from home, Its better to set it it up first time using your personal Mobile first. Install HP Smart App and set up the printer. Once done try using add printer wizard in office laptop and add it. HP smart app might not get installed in office laptop as most of the time MS App Store is blocked.Printer maintenance (cartridges) is a not very economical. But for a low usage home user it does not matter would not even notice it. For a low usage Home user who wants all features (Auto Duplex, document feeder, scanner, copier, High quality prints) with great looks, compact design AND is not too pricey this is the best fit."
1,"Worst product from HP. Even though I managed to print 3-4 pages, the printer failed to initialize right from the moment I switched it on. Even HP engineer visited my place that too AFTER 8 DAYs(lodged complaint on 9th Nov 2020 and he came on 18th Nov 2020) of complaining and gave up on it saying we'll issue a DoI and take the product back."
2,"I will mention only one point which is horrible,in this printer according to me,u cannot connect it via USB cable only,it won't work,u cannot connect it with cellphone or laptop directly via wifi.It will connect only with a third party wifi signal to which the laptop or signal is connected.lastly the worst part u cannot connect two devices one after another if u connect second device then the first device won't connect again.Start up is also very slow and takes a lot of time,there is no screen on the printer touch screen panel"
1,"Cartridges are outdated (just like filament bulbs in the age of LED bulbs). Check the cost from HP itself:Cartridge: Rs 5 per page (see below for more)Ink tank: 18 paise per pageThere is no comparison !!The above cartridge cost as per yield of the HP 682 cartridges ~ 480 pages (Black & White) & ~150 pages (Colour). This is like a petrol car giving 30kmpl in city traffic. It is less than half. If you get 200 pages (black - Rs 792) or 75 pages (color - Rs 972), you are lucky.HP is fooling people by still selling the cartridge printers. These are best seen in museums.~*~"
1,"I was delivered HP 6075 printer with only one black cartridge installed. The colour was missing. A brand new hp printer does not have cartridge installed, else how will we know if the cartridge inside is genuine not refurbished. Amazon support team is excellent in helping with return. But this kind of experience is bad. Eventually I will be buying offline from one of the malls."
4,The printer does the job as in the description. The reason i chose this model was only because of the auto-duplex feature which saves a lot of time and effoet. No problems whats so ever. Had a complication in setting up the printer for wireless access. The connectivity is not consistent. You need to assign a static ip address to the printer for it to work properly. Apart from the wireless connectivity there are no other complaints I've.
4,"After reading the mixed reviews about print quality ,installation and catridge issue, I was a bit skeptical to buy this printer. But after using the printer for a week now, I can say it is the best choice I have made for my needs of home printing. The printer is  very nice, sleek and is light weight. Installation was bit of a struggle as there were no clear instructions and I had to google to figure out the steps after the app is installed on phone. But once it got connected it has been running smoothly. I have used all the functions - printing, scanning and copy and all are working smoothly. I would recommend this printer for people who wants a printer for home i.e for school project/ scanning/ copying few documents. It occupies less place and not very huge as compared to other printers."
3,Bought this close to 10k rupees. Overall it’s for home purpose only. Print quality is good.I went to high price just for duplex printing.Con:Scanner is just ok. I say it has bad scanning capability. 300ppi scanning is good. 600ppi takes 40 seconds. For 1200 ppi one must die and take rebirth to see it.Don’t thing scanning is fast like what we see at xerox shop
5,Installation was smooth and didn't take much time to sort things out and make it working. HP smart app is pretty user friendly that way.4.2* from 328k reviews does say the app is good enough to do what is expected out of it.My 5 stars is purely on the value for money it carries with wifi and auto duplex features.
5,Pro'sThe size is very sleekThe light indications for various events and errorsThe paper tray has a yellow light indicating the tray is not closedDuplex printingGood quality photo printsEasy to Print using phoneCon'sThe cost of ink and prints are bit expensive but that a case for any inkjet
4,Good print quality and easy to print.The main disadvantage with the printer is its very hard to install/Setup. Got no installation manual with the printer..and the one available online doesn't help.with the wifi set up. Had to do lot of trial and error methods to make the printer work on wifi.Also no specific set-up videos onYou Tube for this particular model.
2,"The printer is not as user friendly as claimed. Event after following all the prompted actions, it encountered problems while connecting through HP app on IOS. With much effort, the printer finally started but still did not receive print command from mobiles. Had to connect to PC using USB for printing. So much for dual band direct WIFI feature. Will update review after using it for a month or two."
1,Had to return because the product was damaged and had black ink marks
1,"I thought the low cost printer, might be equivalent to 4279 printer. But this one very downgraded model. DO NOT BUY and DON'T GOI Feel bad  why brought this mud boxBetter go for INKTANK printers"
5,Received the product in good condition.. Packing was good.. Print quality is also good.. Fully satisfied with product.. Would recommend others to buy Hp products...
5,"Wanted a printer for home and home office use. Max usage of 200-300 pages per month. Delivery on time, setup/installation was simple and without any hitches. Printing smooth, already printed 200 pages with the cartridge supplied along with the printer. Overall satisfied."
3,The cartridge printed only 20 black pages before starting to display that printer is low on inksThis is suprirngly odd as I bought same printer for myself 1 month back - and the Catridge is still running good despite being printed 200 pages.
4,Please HELP!I need a cover for the printer HP Ink advantage 6750 I just bought from Amazon. I dont see a compatible cover online for this printer model.
5,"First day usage review:Got early delivery. Thanks to Amazon.Packaging was good and device is very light weight.Configuration and setup was very easy.Tested colour, B/W printing - working fine.Tested photo copying - working fine.Tested scanning - working fine.This works fine with USB cable and WiFi on Windows 10 laptop.Working good from iPhone mobile too.Thanks to HP and Amazon."
1,It's Very Bakbass Product I Ever Purchased From Amazone. The print Quality is very Pood.  It's had not All colours. Bad Product. Plz donot purchase it. Go for another lazier prienter. I want my money back
5,"Good product for home and children use. Print quality is fine. Not like laser printing or professional work, but good for students. Color printing is also good. Wireless printing gives a good overall experience and easyness."
1,"First printer worked perfectly. The second printer is defective, the cartridges that came with it were dry, its a month now and even after repeated calls there is no response from the customer support.I have had excellent experience with hp products but this last product and after sale support is such a disappointment ."
4,"Hello everyone,Just received the printer. Printing, scanning & copying works fine from mobile & PC. To have auto duplex function, please install the correct driver from the HP website. So far the printer works good. Need to check how many pages it prints per cartridges."
1,It's printing cost is very high.It Cartridge cost approx INR 800/=each (Black & Tri Colour).Company wrote that u can print 480 pages from Black Cartridge and 150 pages from tri colour but it's not true. After 200-250 print app will show u very low on ink.I will not recommend any one to buy this product.
1,"This is a horrible product, doesn’t detect your mobile or any other device it takes hours to print or scan a single page. It is easier to go to a market and get it the print than priting from this useless machine . I would give a 0 out of 5 star to this. Doesn’t work on a 300 mbps connection. Dont buy!"
5,"Setup was a bit time consuming. Google cloud print, Airprint setups are a little tricky. Printer works well. It is opted to use WiFi always."
5,Good product. Works flawless as advertised.
1,ultimate third class product. none of the option is esay to install nor east to take care of it. printing cost too high. company making customers fool by making false statement regarding cost of printing . its not at  all cheap or user friendly . WORST IS THE IDEAL WORD TO EXPLAIN it
5,Very easy to install . Running very smoothly.
5,Nice product
1,"Don't  buy this printer, you can only print 20 to 30 A4 with a cartridge!"
1,"please do not purchase this printer, initially it works smoothly. I purchased it in 2016, in a year i printed only around 50-60 print. in 2017 i also printout only 10-15 copies. Now its not working  as shows continuously light blink and did not take print from computer. I have checked it various OS, other laptops,desktop also. But it wont print, only continuously blinking light. I asked to my friend who purchase same printer before 1 year. He is also facing the same problem. Even he exchanged new printer from thana office becaz his printer is in warranty. The new printer also shows same problem after 3-4 months. And this problem is not repaired, we also given for repaired but it doesnt solve."
4,"Price is so attractive, but consumes lots of ink. And picture quality is okay for this price. And best for office uses.Hp says ink cartridges need to be replaced but it could be refilled easily with the help of YouTube videos.I am satisfied with this product.But now a days better printers with ability to print from mobile devices are available in market with attractive prices.I just wanted a printer for emergency printing needs only so I bought it and I am happy with it."
1,I brought it for home use but product is not working... I try to call Amazon but there is no contact details. Try to refund/exchange it but i was told I can't exchange. How come company like HP and Amazon not responding for default product?? Very very dissatisfied.
1,making very ugly sound..and after print 20 pages shows low ink..worst printer ever
1,"प्रोडक्ट खराब है , चालू नहीं हो रहा है।"
5,Bought it for 1.7k worth for the money. I'm using HP laptop so no need of installation anything. Color and black cartridges available in the box. Checked both color and black and white print out. No issues at all.
5,"Call me old fashioned but i prefer paper over digital, so when it comes to read notes i want them in my hand , or when i want facts over a topic i want all the material in printed form, This printer helped me a lot in that , i got it for 1800 rs from Amazon, and it's worth so much than that , first of all its size is so compact and its built is very sturdy ,and i have a epson ink tank filter at office but this prints faster than that , speed is really impressive! Just go for it , pfa images depicting size of the printer"
5,"Good quality of printing,easy to install, getting colord  prinout eazliy at home use"
3,"Only buy if you know well about refilling cartridge and troubleshooting problems afterwards. Otherwise it will cost you a lot money. It only prints 100- 120 pages per cartridge. Replacing both cartridge may cost up 1500. So it costs 6-7 rupees per page. If you can refill the cartridge, then it's an value for money printer( then it will cost you time, lol)"
5,"Despite of all the negative reviews posted about of this product, I would say that this is a very good printer with competitive price. It always not true that cheap products perform bad. Yes, this one is a bit dedicated and you need to handle it very carefully.So far I have printed more than 100 pages black and white and more than 25 color pages including 6 full page images.You need to refill the cartridges at home, which as easy as to use the printer itself. After refilling black cartridge it is still working well.The only thing that you need to keep in mind that print at least one page daily, otherwise the cartridge will dry and that will create difficulties.Thank You..."
5,"If you are looking for a budget single use printer. This is best in the available products.My previous printer was also hp, but was very old, but there was no problem with it. Just Its cartridge cost was more than the price of this product, so bought this. Size is very small and it easily fits inside my almirah."
1,"It uses up a lot of ink while printing! And with pictures and double-sided printing, the paper (normal printing paper-A4, 70-75 GSM) takes a long time to even dry! Would not recommend it at all. Do not get lured by the cheap price of the printer. It ultimately is not at all an economical printer."
5,"working fine from last 15 days. took 10-15 colour prints and its doing good. not sure how long cartage will last but its good for now. Also, i noticed genuine cartage is as expensive as printer :)"
4,"First it is value of money 100 percentage,and thank u Amazon  delivered the item in 24hrs I unexpected, this printer advantage is print good quality, I print continually 20 pages the print is little bit slow and it's support android phone connect with otg cable working properly, I study many commands in this printer but 50percentage are fake comments iam thinking, we insert a4 size paper means it did not stuck so use a4 sheet paper for good use, and I print 20 pages in 1 day,  so it is good to use and we can refill the cartage easily it available in you tube you can see and fill the ink Easily, The we get 100 ml ink bottle in Amazon or flipksart at the prize just 250 rupees, and I use and command later✌"
5,NICE PRODUCT BUY EVERYONE ITS SMALL AND LOW WEIGHT OF PRINTER IT IS BUY THIS
5,"It does exactly what it says. I don't print often so I didn't want to invest in a costlier printer. This worked like a charm,  the colors are vivid, the B&W print is sharp. It's not too slow but it is a bit noisy which is ok. It was easy to set up. Happy with it so far."
5,"We print about 10 pages a month, so this printer is perfect. Yes, it's a bit slow (10 sec/ paper) and a little noisy, but honestly that's nitpicking. The speed or noise are not disturbing in any way. I also read a lot of reviews about cartridges not being available - not true. It was probably an issue in August alone from when the reviews are. Only problem with this printer - double sided printing is not fun. I'm still trying to figure out how it works when there are more than 2 pages."
4,"For very occasional home use, this is a very good printer - I previously had a MFP Inkjet that stopped working after a very long gap of not using it, For those who have very infrequent use, I think this small form factor is better. It is so light weight and fits just above my CPU - see pic! (so I can remember to take occasional prints to keep the printer live). Bigger printers (like Ink tank) definitely turn out cheaper per page in long run provided you have that much use/ year. But in a scenario of WFH in the corona lock down needing to take occasional prints for office and kids school use - this one is the best!"
5,The Printer is good for self home use . But the New Cartridge cost is more or less equal to Printer cost . HP should look in to Cartridges of Economical Printers should be cheap also
5,"Guyz. Dont go for any kind of cartage printer.. if you really need a printer, go for ink tank printers. I know its costlier, but almost 30 time (calculated) more efficient.. believe me of repent like me.. ,,🤣"
1,I am giving 1 star because its sucks inks like anything. Ink cartridge is too much costly and hence makes printer un usable and waste of monty
3,"I have been using this printer since 2019 and I just took prints and thought why not write the truth about it.I have printed over 2000 pages till now and I have been using the same Cartridge that came with the printer when I bought it.I just refill the Cartridge instead buying a new one. The New Cartridge by hp can only print 50-60 pages. You can refill and prints as many pages you want.Buy this printer and buy the ink bottles you get. 2ml of the refilled ink gives me at least 60-70 prints.The ink bottle will cost you around Rs. 150-200  and it will have 100ml. That's roughly 5000+ prints give and take.So total investment = 1500(Printer) + Ink(200) = 1700/-That's roughly 2 rupees per print! By the time you get around 2000 prints, your printer cost is covered and the next prints will be free of cost."
2,"This prints 20 to 30 pages only (incl.black and color print outs).The main drawback is once the original ink is over that's it..its a waste..either.You have to buy Hp black and hp color inks(price is higher than the printers price) or buy local brand inks and get an average colored print outs.My opinion is to better buy good printers which is more than rs.10,000/- so that the cartridges refilling costs you less and also you can take good qty and qlty color prints."
5,"Its good in this price range,  if you want to printer only 10-30 print in a month then buy otherwise go for laser printer if you need more printing as for more print , cost will be higher.Its for home usage"
5,Good for home use.its speed of printing is so best than other colour printer.its print quality is also best. but only one thing which is not good that it's cartridge cost is high.
4,Nice product
4,"It does the job alright. Easy to install on my dell laptop. As i use this to print confidential document occasionally( 3 to 4 per month) , it serves the purpose. Prints fast. Quality is also acceptable on Draft mode and Ink Saver mode. But the only downside is that although i used the black and white for printing 25 pages so far, the ink level on color catridge reduced to 50 %.  Not sure how this is possible. But black ink came down to only 75%."
2,Product are good but not CD drive and missing 1212 drive in online
1,Aftervtee prints only black cartridge stopped working properly. Printing half text. Did all trouble shoot n cleaning but it gives hard time
3,"Warning! It does not work with Mac. The printer was detected and job queued but nothing prints. I had to use a windows computer to print. In terms of quality, it is average. Cheap printer can't expect much. Black print few letters are smudged or unclear but acceptable. I'll probably throw it away once ink is over."
5,Awesome printer... Bought for only ₹1900 during the early benefits for prime members of Great Indian Sale Prime Benefits.. Must buy this printer for home use... Happy to use..
5,"Simply the best printer I've ever come across. I just needed a printer and not a scanner included which always malfunctions and ruins the entire product.The product was packed very well and was delivered within five hours of me having ordered it. Package included two 803 cartridges, one with black ink and the other coloured ink.Installation software was downloaded from the HP website and took a few minutes and I was ready to print within half an hour of halving received the product.It's been more than two weeks since I've been printing on and off and you don't need to print everyday to keep it going, once a week would be enough to keep the ink in the cartridge from drying up."
1,"Don't ever buy this printer, the catriges  will be empty just after 10 prints and no matter how many original Hp catriges you buy from Hp the printer never works. This printer is just a disposable printer. It never works after printing 10 pages. The seller didn't even gave me any invoice with the printer I am cheated by both Amazon and Hp."
1,"HP is selling absolute trash in the form of this printer.I have been hardly able to print a few pages and the printer is now not taking paper correctly.I tried all options but it always takes one end of the paper faster than the other and so the paper gets stranded in a slanted manner right at the tray, wont go in.Very disappointed customer, have been cheated before on HP laptops and now add a HP printer to the list. Never going to buy anything HP from now on, much better options out there.Stay away from this cheap excuse for a printer."
2,Read carefully before you buy. This seems to be an old model.
2,Software CD is damaged and I am unable to install the software. After printing 20 document pages the cartridge shown less than 50%. I wants to return the same but option is available in my order but it do not proceed after second step.
2,"Its cheaper to buy this entire printer again rather than buying it ink cartridges,One cartridge prints about 30  A4 pages at best quality, its a good emergency-use printer, but seriously dont waste your money, save up a little and go for an Ink-Tank printerThis has way too many problems for its costBut, the print quality is surprisingly amazing, the printer has that plug and play usability and its a one click print kind of a printer.Still the concept of ink cartridges has scared me enough after buying this printer.....would never recommend anyone else to buy this"
5,"I am writring this almost after 2.5 months of usage. The printer printed almont 100-120 black and white pages and only 10-15 colour pages. Those of you who are using windows10 on old laptop and PCs, installation can be a bit of a challenge. But the printer works fine even with old laptop models. Follow the following steps to installing printer drivers correctly:Go to : https://www8.hp.com1.Go to support option2.Click on Softwares & drivers3.Click on printer image4. Type ""HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1200 series"" full name (no initials) in the textbox5.Click Submit6.Download all the softwares, drivers and software utilities under drivers tab before installing for smooth installation.Note: Please check printer compatibility with your system before buying."
3,"Printer is good for home usage where u don't need to print daily or in bulk..its not for students wanting to printing study material, bcz it only prints 120 pages after that u need to refill cartridge..also since it's a basic printer, it's kinda slow.Otherwise print quality is good and colours are great and vibrant"
1,"Don't  buy this printer, you can only print 20 to 30 A4 with a cartridge!"
1,"please do not purchase this printer, initially it works smoothly. I purchased it in 2016, in a year i printed only around 50-60 print. in 2017 i also printout only 10-15 copies. Now its not working  as shows continuously light blink and did not take print from computer. I have checked it various OS, other laptops,desktop also. But it wont print, only continuously blinking light. I asked to my friend who purchase same printer before 1 year. He is also facing the same problem. Even he exchanged new printer from thana office becaz his printer is in warranty. The new printer also shows same problem after 3-4 months. And this problem is not repaired, we also given for repaired but it doesnt solve."
4,"Price is so attractive, but consumes lots of ink. And picture quality is okay for this price. And best for office uses.Hp says ink cartridges need to be replaced but it could be refilled easily with the help of YouTube videos.I am satisfied with this product.But now a days better printers with ability to print from mobile devices are available in market with attractive prices.I just wanted a printer for emergency printing needs only so I bought it and I am happy with it."
1,I brought it for home use but product is not working... I try to call Amazon but there is no contact details. Try to refund/exchange it but i was told I can't exchange. How come company like HP and Amazon not responding for default product?? Very very dissatisfied.
1,making very ugly sound..and after print 20 pages shows low ink..worst printer ever
1,"प्रोडक्ट खराब है , चालू नहीं हो रहा है।"
5,Bought it for 1.7k worth for the money. I'm using HP laptop so no need of installation anything. Color and black cartridges available in the box. Checked both color and black and white print out. No issues at all.
5,"Call me old fashioned but i prefer paper over digital, so when it comes to read notes i want them in my hand , or when i want facts over a topic i want all the material in printed form, This printer helped me a lot in that , i got it for 1800 rs from Amazon, and it's worth so much than that , first of all its size is so compact and its built is very sturdy ,and i have a epson ink tank filter at office but this prints faster than that , speed is really impressive! Just go for it , pfa images depicting size of the printer"
5,"Good quality of printing,easy to install, getting colord  prinout eazliy at home use"
3,"Only buy if you know well about refilling cartridge and troubleshooting problems afterwards. Otherwise it will cost you a lot money. It only prints 100- 120 pages per cartridge. Replacing both cartridge may cost up 1500. So it costs 6-7 rupees per page. If you can refill the cartridge, then it's an value for money printer( then it will cost you time, lol)"
5,"Despite of all the negative reviews posted about of this product, I would say that this is a very good printer with competitive price. It always not true that cheap products perform bad. Yes, this one is a bit dedicated and you need to handle it very carefully.So far I have printed more than 100 pages black and white and more than 25 color pages including 6 full page images.You need to refill the cartridges at home, which as easy as to use the printer itself. After refilling black cartridge it is still working well.The only thing that you need to keep in mind that print at least one page daily, otherwise the cartridge will dry and that will create difficulties.Thank You..."
5,"If you are looking for a budget single use printer. This is best in the available products.My previous printer was also hp, but was very old, but there was no problem with it. Just Its cartridge cost was more than the price of this product, so bought this. Size is very small and it easily fits inside my almirah."
1,"It uses up a lot of ink while printing! And with pictures and double-sided printing, the paper (normal printing paper-A4, 70-75 GSM) takes a long time to even dry! Would not recommend it at all. Do not get lured by the cheap price of the printer. It ultimately is not at all an economical printer."
5,"working fine from last 15 days. took 10-15 colour prints and its doing good. not sure how long cartage will last but its good for now. Also, i noticed genuine cartage is as expensive as printer :)"
4,"First it is value of money 100 percentage,and thank u Amazon  delivered the item in 24hrs I unexpected, this printer advantage is print good quality, I print continually 20 pages the print is little bit slow and it's support android phone connect with otg cable working properly, I study many commands in this printer but 50percentage are fake comments iam thinking, we insert a4 size paper means it did not stuck so use a4 sheet paper for good use, and I print 20 pages in 1 day,  so it is good to use and we can refill the cartage easily it available in you tube you can see and fill the ink Easily, The we get 100 ml ink bottle in Amazon or flipksart at the prize just 250 rupees, and I use and command later✌"
5,NICE PRODUCT BUY EVERYONE ITS SMALL AND LOW WEIGHT OF PRINTER IT IS BUY THIS
5,"It does exactly what it says. I don't print often so I didn't want to invest in a costlier printer. This worked like a charm,  the colors are vivid, the B&W print is sharp. It's not too slow but it is a bit noisy which is ok. It was easy to set up. Happy with it so far."
5,"We print about 10 pages a month, so this printer is perfect. Yes, it's a bit slow (10 sec/ paper) and a little noisy, but honestly that's nitpicking. The speed or noise are not disturbing in any way. I also read a lot of reviews about cartridges not being available - not true. It was probably an issue in August alone from when the reviews are. Only problem with this printer - double sided printing is not fun. I'm still trying to figure out how it works when there are more than 2 pages."
4,"For very occasional home use, this is a very good printer - I previously had a MFP Inkjet that stopped working after a very long gap of not using it, For those who have very infrequent use, I think this small form factor is better. It is so light weight and fits just above my CPU - see pic! (so I can remember to take occasional prints to keep the printer live). Bigger printers (like Ink tank) definitely turn out cheaper per page in long run provided you have that much use/ year. But in a scenario of WFH in the corona lock down needing to take occasional prints for office and kids school use - this one is the best!"
5,The Printer is good for self home use . But the New Cartridge cost is more or less equal to Printer cost . HP should look in to Cartridges of Economical Printers should be cheap also
5,"Guyz. Dont go for any kind of cartage printer.. if you really need a printer, go for ink tank printers. I know its costlier, but almost 30 time (calculated) more efficient.. believe me of repent like me.. ,,🤣"
1,I am giving 1 star because its sucks inks like anything. Ink cartridge is too much costly and hence makes printer un usable and waste of monty
3,"I have been using this printer since 2019 and I just took prints and thought why not write the truth about it.I have printed over 2000 pages till now and I have been using the same Cartridge that came with the printer when I bought it.I just refill the Cartridge instead buying a new one. The New Cartridge by hp can only print 50-60 pages. You can refill and prints as many pages you want.Buy this printer and buy the ink bottles you get. 2ml of the refilled ink gives me at least 60-70 prints.The ink bottle will cost you around Rs. 150-200  and it will have 100ml. That's roughly 5000+ prints give and take.So total investment = 1500(Printer) + Ink(200) = 1700/-That's roughly 2 rupees per print! By the time you get around 2000 prints, your printer cost is covered and the next prints will be free of cost."
2,"This prints 20 to 30 pages only (incl.black and color print outs).The main drawback is once the original ink is over that's it..its a waste..either.You have to buy Hp black and hp color inks(price is higher than the printers price) or buy local brand inks and get an average colored print outs.My opinion is to better buy good printers which is more than rs.10,000/- so that the cartridges refilling costs you less and also you can take good qty and qlty color prints."
5,"Its good in this price range,  if you want to printer only 10-30 print in a month then buy otherwise go for laser printer if you need more printing as for more print , cost will be higher.Its for home usage"

5,"Considering the combo offer and the print quality, I would suggest one must go for it. I haven't had the chance of using the coloured inks until now but I believe they must be equally good.Problem: the only issue I have found is that the ink sprinkles just a little while adjusting and removing it from the filler. But that's okay, it's almost negligible but I thought I must mention it.The rest, it's a good buy."
5,"Product is looking as shown in presentation, but not used since yet. I must edit my review after using it"
5,"Super quality ink! Have used only original ink before, due to my daughter online class, we need to print a lot of homework, assessments, class materials etc... so this time we search all type of brands finally decided to take this one, and results is too satisfying!!! Recommend to all parents who are struggling with the online class headache 😂"
4,"Good for EPSON 3150, 3110 printer. Easy to refill type bottles.Satisfied with quality and printing"
5,"Good product at very good price. I purchased 05(04color +01 black extra) at jst rs.800/-. Print quality is good, not as original but at this price it's very good. Packing was ok need to be better."
5,I had a doubt about the print quality but I've been using it for months now no difference in quality and print as much as the original Epson 001Just go for it...
4,"I have ordered this product 2nd time bcoz i was fully satisfied with this product previous time, its same as original no problems at all finished 2 black bottles previously and want to use it again but its little expensive i mean i payed 300 for 2 black bottles but i think paying 200 is enough afterall its non genuine ink and packing was not good packing box was twisted when i received the order"
5,Nice but take care when you refill your printer may have licking do it gently and nice print quality and colour
5,Working perfectly with my epson inktank printer..
4,good
4,Ink quality so good but but it requires nazel check frequently 400 to 600 pages.You can easily take print 5000 + copies in one bottle.Epson L3101.
5,Good for Epson ink tank printers...
1,The received bottles are not sealedInk is only 75% in bottlesNot recommend to buy
5,I am using proffisy ink refill black for my epson printer and its working very fine. Also the colour is smooth and dark. I am happy with the product.
5,Good product thanks Amazon
5,Supppeeerb
5,Ok
5,Works perfectly with my Epson printer.Just like the original.
4,Good ink for espon l3152
1,The quality is not so good and I have filled the ink in the printer. Please help me to sort this out.I will remove my review if this get solved.
5,Have been using this company's products more for quite some time including compatible toner and inks and must say the quality is very good and so is the price
2,No please don't use this ink.... Because its duplicate ink and damaged my printer..... Lens...
4,"Like the bottle which is enclosed by rubber cap not to spill allover when made upside down, but better if they have given syringes to pump the ink into new cartridges as of model's for 2021"
5,Nice products i am happy
3,Good product
5,The product is very good and it value for money. Thanks amazon for good product
3,Gud but not better printer work effect

5,Good product 👍
5,Good Quality
5,Good Product at a reasonable rate.
5,Value for its price.
5,I used this on my recently purchased MacBook Air M1. I got a minor scratch on the lid and so started looking for cases. This one fit the bill. It was selling for 1300 and with few cash backs that was on offer by Amazon for I was able to get it for around 1100. I received it nicely packaged next day and it fit the MacBook Air M1 perfectly. I had to push a bit for the snap but nothing alarming. The golden colour is nicely visible through the clear case. They had also provided keyboard cover which is good if you are going to use it open in dusty environment. Also supplied was the trackpad protective layer and some plugs for the USB-C and headphone sockets. Nice touch. I mostly use my setup closed like Clamshell and this is very useful to keep the setup safe.
3,"Overall a decent product with a good build.Pros:1. Good build quality.2. The "" World Map"" pattern on the case is beautiful and gives the laptop a funky look.Cons:1. Once the screen and base cases are fixed, the screen can't be taken all the way back due to the thickness of the cases. This is especially a pain when keeping the laptop on your thighs while sitting on a sofa/bean bag and working as the screen doesn't have the mobility to go right back.2. The base case clips the body only on one side (either left of right) and not both sides.3. The keypad silicon is meant for the 2019 air book model, not for the 2020 model. Another problem with the keypad silicon is the back light can't be seen once the silicon is placed on the keypad."
4,"At the first glance I thought that this might ruin my MacBook but it turns out it fits well. I don't liked the keyboard cover to be honest as you can read from the title & apart from that lid cover makes it heavy so you will notice your screen sliding down backwards. This might damage device so use it at your own risk. Otherwise at Rs.1299 you can't go wrong with this as there is all sort of protection stuff provided like trackpad protector, keyboard cover, port protector, lids."
4,The keypad shown in the pics  resembles the colour of the case but I received a plain black colour keypad which was crushed between the two panels thus making it useless.Otherwise the colour and finish of the product is flawless. Fits fine but a bit more loose than it should be. I don't think it'll be durable for more than 6-8 months again depends upon the kind of a user you are.It is absolutely easy to remove. No hassles what so ever. Colour looks really good on the new MacBook Air.
5,"So when i ordered this, i didn't know that i'l also get free keypad, touch pad etc guards along with the macbook cover.I am a using these macbook pads n covers from last 7 years.. Compared to the previous one which i got at 999, this one is a better deal coz i got extra safety pads too, which will cost you extra Rs 1000 if you'l buy it separately.Definitely a 5 star."
2,"The product is made in China and its fitting is awful the sides doesnt fit at all with macbook air 2020, keypad skin is a film which falls while using. Design is not upto the mark at all.The left side hinge missing which causing the cover to come out. Keyboard skin blows away with slight air.Ended up damaging my Mac air while fitting this"
4,"Pros:1. Case fits the MacBook Air 2020 Intel Model A2179 perfectly. Compact case and offers good protection. I have noticed that the Space Grey A2179 model unlike previous models scratches pretty easily, so this case will definitely prevent further minor scratches.2. Also comes with the keyboard protector, trackpad protector and port plugs which is useful.Cons:1. Matt Black variant leaves many fingerprints which are difficult to remove.2. Trackpad protector doesn't come with instructions and leaves lot of bubbles if applied incorrectly.3. Packaging was bad, could've been better."
2,"Not worth it AT ALL and here’s why:1. I got this product a few hours ago and have barely used my Mac since I put it on and you can already see finger print marks2. The material is cheap plastic - was expecting some rubbery texture for grip but well. Failed.3. The bottom lid is flimsy - if you pick up your Mac aggressively, it’ll come off slightly. It doesn’t fit well at all (I use the M1)4. Look at the keyboard guard - it’s a JOKE. The space key on the guard doesn’t consider that the actual space key on the M1 is HALF the size. So the space key on the guard covers the key adjacent to the space key as well.Won’t recommend you to burn 1300 bucks on this ridiculous product. Skip it."
5,"It fits amazingly and is a sturdy cover. The keypad and touchpad covers are superb, it doesn't feel that there's another layer on top of the original thing and it functions smoothly."
4,"Reduced two stars since the case is a fingerprint magnet, and the keyboard cover that came with it isn’t great quality - it stretched near frequently used keys within a few weeks.Otherwise, the case fits well for my 2018 MacBook Air and protects it well. Opening up the screen beyond a certain angle will face extra friction though."
5,"Price is on higher side.But No compromise on quality. An amazing purchase, but could have been better if range was kept b/w 800-1000 max.Rest keyboard guard, laptop plug covers and mouse guard excited the most as I didn't expected this in box.Thanks amazon"
2,"The product in the ""ADs"" looks very appealing, but isn't worth buying. The images uploaded are from the 2nd day of using my device. I am not a rigorous laptop freak. so imagine what happens with people who are on their laptop for 10-12 hours daily.Rather buy the transparent version, or laptop skins (dbrand, etc.) are recommended for anyone who doesn't like to see fingerprints at all."
5,"Lovely product , came with matt covers , mouse pad shield , rubber pligs for the opening and keyboard guard......its slim and nice!P.s- its for only 2019 / 2018 mac book air"
4,It is a perfect fit for A2179 model. However the trackpad skin was bent and so the sticker keeps coming off.  The thickness of the case is sleek and does not make the laptop heavier.
2,"Well quite disappointed with the product, Product was shown something else on the site, Apple logo was quite visible on the item shown, but when I got the product it's hard plastic material through which apple logo isn't visible at all.It's hard plastic so I guess durability will be there but not happy with what I got.As you can see in the picture, the fitment is also a problem. From the back side of laptop it is not get properly fitting the macbook main body."
4,"I have a Mac Book Air  A2337 (M1), the cover fits very well.I personally did not like the colour that I ordered which is 'Airy Blue'. The products representative image shows a bit of a translucent  sleeve, which I wanted, but this is a solid pastel shade -_-."
4,"Overall the product looks sturdy. But I received it in a bad condition, it was too dusty and the package was in a miserable condition. Including there were scratches on the top cover also with some mark on it but that’s not visible after application, Can manage tho but the keyboard skin is not worth your penny, it gives a weird look to the laptop and won’t stick properly. Looking for a replacement."
5,"It is an absolute stunner. My 7 yo daughter using her MacBook Air extensively for her online classes these days, has fallen in love with her Mac after putting up this cover. Looks quite safe too."
1,Pretty much useless. The back cover did not fit my mac a1932 Model 2019. Sheer waste of money. It is strange as to how Amazon has quoted the defective brand as 'bestseller'. Supremely misleading. Avoid wasting time and money on this.
3,"The case is good and durable and cools nice as well. But there are flaws as well. The keyboard cover provided with it doesn’t fit the macbook. Also the case doesn’t fit the macbook perfectly from the sides near the speakers, it fit perfectly only on one side and not both the sides at the same time."
2,Brought on september 2019Photo taken August 2020Defect: the Matt lamination on the case started ripping off after two months of use. A good scratch with your nail itself will rip the lamination.Material is good incase of protection.
5,"The packaging was good!the Cover is a beauty, looks stunning and feels so good. When you run your hand over it you can feel the engraving on it. Loving this... Gives an even classier and personalised feel to my MacBook Air.Loved it and it is very useful.the only demerit is, the keyboard cover which fits on the keyboard but some key are not corresponding to the actual keyboard keys.But overall it's all good."
5,"Extremely satisfied with the product. 1 day delivery with prime. you get a keyboard and trackpad protector with it. a good thought is to provide the USB C closing lid with it. minimal use of it but a good thought. overall, the cover is extremely hardy, easy to install (with the guide provided). 10* if I could."
2,The give keyboard silicon is for the older version of MacBook pro .so kindly i need a replacement . Ok the silicon
5,Excellent Product. Fits perfectly. Has rubber studs to fix on female Jack's of MacBook.Has a nice screen guard and mouse guard
5,Awesome perfect fit comes with keyboard cover and cover for all the ports I want to give it 100 stars. Just buy it
5,Fits Macbook perfectly. Good all round protection.Keyboard skin is good but You can't use backlighting of keyboard. Touch pad protector is good
3,The case for lid does not fit well. Bottom case fits perfect. Keyboard cover cuts are perfect but it spoils the aesthetics. The case came with a lot of scratches on it. Not very happy with the product and I am back in the market looking for a case that will protect my mac and not spoil the looks.
2,"Writing this review after 4 month of use. Product quality is not good as per price. Not worth for money it didn’t last for 2 month n started breaking from corners. No free movement, screen stop at 90degree angle. Once corner breaks you can move screen backward. Not worth more then 3-4 hundred."
5,Perfectly fits the Macbook air 13inch 2019 model. Upper case is too tight to fit though. Macbook becomes little heavy with shell case. Good product with few add ons. But it highly overpriced I feel. If you search in local market you might get it for a better deal
5,"I am happy with the product. Fits well to my Macbook Air 2019 version. Important to check you mac series number before ordering as it is very size specific. Came in good packaging. I have not added the keypad over, only the outer cover, and happy with the results."
3,"I bought this after heavy research and when it came, the top part fit perfectly (and quite beautifully) but the bottom part didn't fit at all. If it locked into place from one side, it wouldn't lock into place at the other side. I'm giving it three stars because if the bottom part had fit, it would have been perfect."
1,Worst case dont waste your money on it it doesn’t fit the 2020 MacBook properly even if it fits it wont come off i am not able to remove the top and it just looks bad and attracts fingers and the keypad protector also doesn’t fit properly
4,Fit and finish is okay. It MIGHT protect the MacBook in case you accidentally drop it but will definitely protects from scratch and stain. I haven’t received the trackpad cover.
4,"The product as such is very good. Value for money. The packaging, however,  was a little crumpled. Even though efforts were taken to ensure that the product stays intact, my cover had a little scratch on it. The silicon keyboard cover is not up to the mark. However, it does its job and does protect my laptop from harm beautifully."
5,"It is a perfect case for Macbook, where we can see the Macbook exterior and get good protection."
5,"Very happy with the product, comes with keyboard protector and touch pad protector too. Very good quality, since it is new I cannot comment on longevity but it looks neat and not too heavy as well"
4,durable product
1,product has factory effect as its one of the corner is going to fit properly by any mean. my product got cracked while doing so. bought it again but different brand
4,"Apart from keyboard cover rest everything was fine. The keyboard cover didn't rest properly, there was no adhesive and it kept moving"
5,I used this on my recently purchased MacBook Air M1. I got a minor scratch on the lid and so started looking for cases. This one fit the bill. It was selling for 1300 and with few cash backs that was on offer by Amazon for I was able to get it for around 1100. I received it nicely packaged next day and it fit the MacBook Air M1 perfectly. I had to push a bit for the snap but nothing alarming. The golden colour is nicely visible through the clear case. They had also provided keyboard cover which is good if you are going to use it open in dusty environment. Also supplied was the trackpad protective layer and some plugs for the USB-C and headphone sockets. Nice touch. I mostly use my setup closed like Clamshell and this is very useful to keep the setup safe.
3,"Overall a decent product with a good build.Pros:1. Good build quality.2. The "" World Map"" pattern on the case is beautiful and gives the laptop a funky look.Cons:1. Once the screen and base cases are fixed, the screen can't be taken all the way back due to the thickness of the cases. This is especially a pain when keeping the laptop on your thighs while sitting on a sofa/bean bag and working as the screen doesn't have the mobility to go right back.2. The base case clips the body only on one side (either left of right) and not both sides.3. The keypad silicon is meant for the 2019 air book model, not for the 2020 model. Another problem with the keypad silicon is the back light can't be seen once the silicon is placed on the keypad."
4,"At the first glance I thought that this might ruin my MacBook but it turns out it fits well. I don't liked the keyboard cover to be honest as you can read from the title & apart from that lid cover makes it heavy so you will notice your screen sliding down backwards. This might damage device so use it at your own risk. Otherwise at Rs.1299 you can't go wrong with this as there is all sort of protection stuff provided like trackpad protector, keyboard cover, port protector, lids."
4,The keypad shown in the pics  resembles the colour of the case but I received a plain black colour keypad which was crushed between the two panels thus making it useless.Otherwise the colour and finish of the product is flawless. Fits fine but a bit more loose than it should be. I don't think it'll be durable for more than 6-8 months again depends upon the kind of a user you are.It is absolutely easy to remove. No hassles what so ever. Colour looks really good on the new MacBook Air.
5,"So when i ordered this, i didn't know that i'l also get free keypad, touch pad etc guards along with the macbook cover.I am a using these macbook pads n covers from last 7 years.. Compared to the previous one which i got at 999, this one is a better deal coz i got extra safety pads too, which will cost you extra Rs 1000 if you'l buy it separately.Definitely a 5 star."
2,"The product is made in China and its fitting is awful the sides doesnt fit at all with macbook air 2020, keypad skin is a film which falls while using. Design is not upto the mark at all.The left side hinge missing which causing the cover to come out. Keyboard skin blows away with slight air.Ended up damaging my Mac air while fitting this"
4,"Pros:1. Case fits the MacBook Air 2020 Intel Model A2179 perfectly. Compact case and offers good protection. I have noticed that the Space Grey A2179 model unlike previous models scratches pretty easily, so this case will definitely prevent further minor scratches.2. Also comes with the keyboard protector, trackpad protector and port plugs which is useful.Cons:1. Matt Black variant leaves many fingerprints which are difficult to remove.2. Trackpad protector doesn't come with instructions and leaves lot of bubbles if applied incorrectly.3. Packaging was bad, could've been better."
2,"Not worth it AT ALL and here’s why:1. I got this product a few hours ago and have barely used my Mac since I put it on and you can already see finger print marks2. The material is cheap plastic - was expecting some rubbery texture for grip but well. Failed.3. The bottom lid is flimsy - if you pick up your Mac aggressively, it’ll come off slightly. It doesn’t fit well at all (I use the M1)4. Look at the keyboard guard - it’s a JOKE. The space key on the guard doesn’t consider that the actual space key on the M1 is HALF the size. So the space key on the guard covers the key adjacent to the space key as well.Won’t recommend you to burn 1300 bucks on this ridiculous product. Skip it."
5,"It fits amazingly and is a sturdy cover. The keypad and touchpad covers are superb, it doesn't feel that there's another layer on top of the original thing and it functions smoothly."
4,"Reduced two stars since the case is a fingerprint magnet, and the keyboard cover that came with it isn’t great quality - it stretched near frequently used keys within a few weeks.Otherwise, the case fits well for my 2018 MacBook Air and protects it well. Opening up the screen beyond a certain angle will face extra friction though."
5,"Price is on higher side.But No compromise on quality. An amazing purchase, but could have been better if range was kept b/w 800-1000 max.Rest keyboard guard, laptop plug covers and mouse guard excited the most as I didn't expected this in box.Thanks amazon"
2,"The product in the ""ADs"" looks very appealing, but isn't worth buying. The images uploaded are from the 2nd day of using my device. I am not a rigorous laptop freak. so imagine what happens with people who are on their laptop for 10-12 hours daily.Rather buy the transparent version, or laptop skins (dbrand, etc.) are recommended for anyone who doesn't like to see fingerprints at all."
5,"Lovely product , came with matt covers , mouse pad shield , rubber pligs for the opening and keyboard guard......its slim and nice!P.s- its for only 2019 / 2018 mac book air"
4,It is a perfect fit for A2179 model. However the trackpad skin was bent and so the sticker keeps coming off.  The thickness of the case is sleek and does not make the laptop heavier.
2,"Well quite disappointed with the product, Product was shown something else on the site, Apple logo was quite visible on the item shown, but when I got the product it's hard plastic material through which apple logo isn't visible at all.It's hard plastic so I guess durability will be there but not happy with what I got.As you can see in the picture, the fitment is also a problem. From the back side of laptop it is not get properly fitting the macbook main body."
4,"I have a Mac Book Air  A2337 (M1), the cover fits very well.I personally did not like the colour that I ordered which is 'Airy Blue'. The products representative image shows a bit of a translucent  sleeve, which I wanted, but this is a solid pastel shade -_-."
4,"Overall the product looks sturdy. But I received it in a bad condition, it was too dusty and the package was in a miserable condition. Including there were scratches on the top cover also with some mark on it but that’s not visible after application, Can manage tho but the keyboard skin is not worth your penny, it gives a weird look to the laptop and won’t stick properly. Looking for a replacement."
5,"It is an absolute stunner. My 7 yo daughter using her MacBook Air extensively for her online classes these days, has fallen in love with her Mac after putting up this cover. Looks quite safe too."
1,Pretty much useless. The back cover did not fit my mac a1932 Model 2019. Sheer waste of money. It is strange as to how Amazon has quoted the defective brand as 'bestseller'. Supremely misleading. Avoid wasting time and money on this.
3,"The case is good and durable and cools nice as well. But there are flaws as well. The keyboard cover provided with it doesn’t fit the macbook. Also the case doesn’t fit the macbook perfectly from the sides near the speakers, it fit perfectly only on one side and not both the sides at the same time."
2,Brought on september 2019Photo taken August 2020Defect: the Matt lamination on the case started ripping off after two months of use. A good scratch with your nail itself will rip the lamination.Material is good incase of protection.
5,"The packaging was good!the Cover is a beauty, looks stunning and feels so good. When you run your hand over it you can feel the engraving on it. Loving this... Gives an even classier and personalised feel to my MacBook Air.Loved it and it is very useful.the only demerit is, the keyboard cover which fits on the keyboard but some key are not corresponding to the actual keyboard keys.But overall it's all good."
5,"Extremely satisfied with the product. 1 day delivery with prime. you get a keyboard and trackpad protector with it. a good thought is to provide the USB C closing lid with it. minimal use of it but a good thought. overall, the cover is extremely hardy, easy to install (with the guide provided). 10* if I could."

3,"The market price is 28000 to maximum 32000 Rs (depends on location ), I am using one and I am from a very small town.The print quality is good. But the original cartridge (ink) cost around 2400-2600 Rs. This machine has sensor chip, which identifies refill or duplicate ink, so it can't be refilled. and customer has to end up buying a new cartridge. Some people suggests refill ink, but it will not work permanently, after 100-200 prints it will pop up a message saying unknown toner, or duplicate ink. Hence has to be replaced with a original cartridge, than print couple of copies, take out the original cartridge, re insert the refilled one continue for next 100-200 copies. This process has to repeated again & again to use a refilled cartridge or toner. But if you buy in 2800-3200, than its a good one."

Pathetic...Technical team is not a technical one.. worst experience.. Never go for this product if you want to use it on Apple device and also you are not bothered for any technical support may need in unavoidable circumstances. Pathetic experience..."
1,Epson L3110 printer is not good its worst printer please don't purchase this model go another model in this printed photos bad and not setting4/6 paper setting is problem West your money Epson service center said about this model is text printer only so not a photo printer please don't purchase this model i safar this
4,This is nice Printer which is very easy to install the process to be followed is given online in many videos. The process is very simple1) Unbox the entire printer with all wires2) Then find the 4 ink bottles & open the part to pour the same3) pour the ink in the right ink cartridge of the printer4) switch on the printer & then a long press of the red button post which it would take close to 7-10 minutes (ignore the different sounds)5) your printer is now ready once the lights stop blinking6) insert the cd & connect the printer to the computer7) follow the process as in the CD.Will take a good 20 mins if you plan to install all the drivers.The print quality is good. The price seems a little high but only time would tell if the printer is worth the money.Would have been a 5 star product except for the plastic used that looks a little flimsy. Plus have seen a lot of videos confirming that it can print only 30000 sheets.
5,"This Printer is awesome, and fully automatic, it can print HD quality photo without color distortion. Only one problem, regular printing is must, else printer head will jam with dry ink. Till 2 months, I have taken around 1100 pages color and b/w experience awesome pleasure. I will suggest to buy this rather previous models. Only black ink is reduced quickly."
5,"If you were using CHEAP Inkjet Printers with expensive Ink or EXPENSIVE Laserjet Printers with EXPENSIVE cartridge then it's about time you switched.Bought on 19th June 2019, Delivered on 24th June 2019.Used for 1 day, but took about 600 prints in a day. Both, coloured as well as black n white.Opinion - Excellent print quality and very cheap also.Basically, the print quality will not be upto the level of a laser jet but the cheap operational cost makes it worth buying. For whatever purpose you want to use it, the prints are awesome. Even the photos are printed in an excellent manner on any type of paper.Before judging the quality please ensure that you choose the correct type of paper you are using in the printer settings. Example - If you choose glossy paper in the settings for a photo but are using a normal A4 paper then the print will not be that great. Whereas, if you choose A4 paper (Plain Paper/Bright White Paper) the same print will come in an excellent quality.The printer has wifi direct option, if the printer is in range then kindly use the network of Printer itself, it is quite fast. If you are using it in an office then you can use it over a Wifi network (Setup can be done in a normal way using network SSID also and using WPS button on the router also).The printer is fast when Standard quality is selected for printing whereas the printing is slow when High Quality is selected as it takes more details into consideration (For reading purposes, not much difference between both, Standard is the option you should choose).For printing double sided, settings need to be selected from the printer properties. It is not automatic, so you yourself will have to take out the paper and input again in the manner shown in the dialogue box which appears automatically. It is hassle free and printing speed is good.I would definitely recommend buying this printer to everyone. It is economical, convenient and user friendly.PS - You might decide on the basis of other reviews also but then again I have tried and tested the printer. I bought Onsite extended warranty for 2 years also so I'm set for a period of 3 years without any hassles. I hope the review helps. If you have more money go for the one with digital display, but do check the quality of printing on that over youtube reviews before buying."
5,"This is currently the best inktank printer one can buy in this price range. Very satisfied. One would not miss the touch screen as once u connect the printer with ur phone with epson app, all the functions can be accessed and setting can be configured. Scan quality is very good and this is one of the best printers you could buy for photo printing. The quality is very good. There aren’t any problems but if I have to nitpick, I found that the print speed to be slow when u give colour print through phone. That might not be the case with everyone as I could have a problem with my network or it can be fixed in a software update. Other than that, this is the printer you can chose blindly for home and home office. Very satisfied and finally the per page cost is also very low compared to inkjet pronters. The right fit for my home and I believe for many homes too👍🏻"
1,"I have used purchased this product as a replacement for my Epson L220. After one month of use (around 1700 pages) I am not satisfied with this product. below are my experience in detail.SPEED: Speed is no way any improvement over its predecessors EPSON L220 or EPSON  L380. It has average printing speed with a very frustrating issue of  getting stuck between prints for 3/4 sec if you print more than 5 pages continuously. this problem really tests one's patience  specially when you have a lots of  color copies to do.PRINT QUALITY: Print quality is average.My previous L220 prints little better images than this model. document print is below average too.. photo print is not recommended. can not pull more than 180 gsm.  ONE MORE major  problem is print head need  to be cleaned every 2/3 days. line between texts is a common problem and text are not sharp as it should be.PAGE YIELD: I wonder why Epson mark this printer as eco print. I have print only 1700 pages (mostly text only) and as you can see in the image above the black ink level indicator is already down below the third level, means one more step down the tank is empty. As per the  EPSON web page , B&W page yield should be 4500 pages. I don't think it can print half of that count. its really very disappointing should be shame for EPSON.My verdict on this product is that this product is not suitable for high use, doesn't worth the money and totally not recommended for commercial use. One star as it goes."
1,"Very very bad product . Stay away from buying.1. Build Quality is very poor , very poor quality plastic used. feels like it may brake here and there.2. Initial Setup is very much difficult. there is no display so its really very hard to input ip address and ip details.3. Wifi direct is there. but no where the password is written.4. Wifi network address needs to be configured each time the printer is powered on.i am not able to take a colour print or scan a page as set up is yet to be done. will write the print quality after the setup and first use."
5,"Model : L 3152Seller : Appario RetailPrice : ₹10350Bought on : 30th Sep, 2019Extremely good product, print quality is excellent. Setup is also easy.This product is very similar to L3150 but it has a blue highlight.Before setting this up please read  comprehensive user guide which is available in L3150 product page in pdf format. Trust me setup is very easy.Many people are saying that WiFi setup is complicated but it's not. Using instruction anyone can setup wifi connection. From then it will connect automatically but it takes 1-2 minutes to connect. Till now I have not used the cable to connect the printer with computer, WiFi is all the thing.N.B. : I have used WiFi direct option only.Recap:1. Fill the ink2. Charge the ink3. Run nozzle test (1 page)4. Take a printout of WiFi password and all that stuff (3 pages)5. Setup WiFi5. Download Epson iPrint from Play store6. Start printing and scanning.Hit like if helpful.🙏🏼"
1,Don't buy. Not value for money. If you want multipurpose printer like Epson old L SERIES printer which can print on anything. This L3110 supports only on 70-80 GSM paper..
1,"photostat not working more then 4 pages same with the scan taking more then 3-4 minute for loading or i don't know why taking time so much, i am owner of my business facing everyday same issue. totally waste of money."
1,"I had HP 6830 before i got some printhead issue...Don't waste your moneyIt is not a good printerSpeed is slowPrint quality is lowWifi response time is slowU can not give continuous command.. u need to wait for previous task to complete...Black and white are okBut colour is not poor...Only good thing is ink tankThat's it!!I will update you more later..After my complaint..I m a prime customerI called in customer careThey saidIf it is damaged only then, we can take it..So suggest u to go for Hp ink tankHp ink tankHp has much much better quality.."
4,"Its working fine, speed is too good. Earlier I was using Leaser Printer. Leaser printer ke takkar ka hai speed main. I can also take print/ Scan while there is power cut. Best Printer for Small and Medium office, don't know why others putting adverse remarks perhaps they are using it as photo printer, actually its not a photo printer and not suitable for the people engaged in photography profession. but for others it is ultimate."
1,This thing does not work. I tried to reach Epson customer service but couldn't connect. Amazon customer service is also not helpful. Both Epson and Amazon are giving bad experience.
1,Don't ever go call your printer service man they will just waste your 50 percent of ink and there is no solution for good printDaily you have to do head cleaningNo worth of buying this
1,"L3150 is not a good printer , printing is very slow , scanning is also very slow copy is very very slow"
1,"This is  is not a user friendly product, trust me.I had an epson L150 -the ink tank non wifi one.The build quality of that product and print was excellent .This on the other hand was rubbish,If I print over wifi direct even if quality is set in high ,It still is a 5/10 print.The ink tank seems to finish ink fast.The epson app is the worst,so undeveloped and troublesome to use.I can't find a way to connect the printer to the  wifi ,I can't  find a way to use remote printing  or to even register my product on the epson site as INDIA is not listed in the countries allowed to register.It's low quality printer.And who uses a wps router? I don't see why I can't directly connect my printer to the wifi without that.The bottom line is ,unless you want to break your head using this product.Dont buy it,my cousins got an hp wifi printer and I used theirs ,setup was easy and overall side by side.I really realised how bad epson is at their tech.The last printer I had was good but this one is disgusting and low quality build.I REALLY REGRET BUYING THIS PRINTER AND I DON'T LIKE ITS BUILD QUALITY OR PRINT QUALITY."
5,Good
4,I think I had taken a very good decision buying this from amazon because The first printer I received was a bit defective and did not work properly but amazon helped me through that tough time they replaced it with a new one without any call or message they didn't even ask a question for replacing. I never thought amazon would give such service In these though times now the pros and the cons of the printerPros1.Epson customer service is very good2. Print speed is very fast and much better than canon and hp but the print quality is not that good if you compare with canon printers3.Now the best thing about the printer is hp andCanon use print head where the ink dries but this printer stores the ink where it has to print and then prints it that's the main reason why I bought it above hp and canonCons:-1.Very big compared to hp and canon printers2.Is a bit expensive than hp and canon3.Paper gets stuck if you a slight old paper and if you use a paper that is folded the ink gets printed in the paper you( can notice it in the first photo)And I see many people ask can you print with you mobile with the usb versionAns:Yes you can print with noko print application though you can see some adds in the appI have written by using 30 minutes of my time hope you find it helpfulAnd if you are confused where to buy from amazon or Flipkart I would recommend you to purchase it from amazon
1,Pls don't waste your money
5,Print quality  is really good. Budget and cost effective printing.
5,"Pros: 1.Very small size, Less weight,only 4.5 kgs. Brother Hp weighs 10 kgs in this category.2. Very cheap to refill. OEM epson inks are cheaper than competitors. Also duplicate inks are half the price and available easily. You cant get good duplicate inks for hp and brother models.3. Very fast Printing speed. 33 pages p/m in BW mode is amazing.4. Easy to refill ink tanks. Easier than filling a watterbottle😜5.multiple printing options ie. You can print even visting card using this printer.Cons: 1. Could have added PVC id printing options. Higher GSM card getting jammed.2. Sometimes full color printouts on 80GSM papers gets stuck and torn because of some exposed plastics under the printing headWill post a long term review after few months"
5,"It's amazing. This Ink Tank printer is so much better than my HP Deskjet 3630. Here's why -1. Printing speed is substantially faster2. Quality is superior.3. Build quality is great.4. The EPSON software is highly customizable5. The Noise is minimal, you won't even notice that your printer is doing its job unless you're in an extraordinary quiet environment.6. And most importantly, the COST OF PRINTING is way too low. The inkjets will burn your pocket if you print 100s of pages for your study or research or whatever. And believe me the injection process to reuse cartridges are just plain harassment. What you get with Ink Tank printers is cheap Ink bottles that are just too easy to refill and cost of printing will be like 1/500th compared to the inkjets, at least theoretically.So, don't think twice about the cost of the printer compared to the Deskjets, this one will save you a lot of money in the long run."
1,This printer is very problematic. The conventional Epson Blinking lights error is still existing on this model. Just after printing 10 gloss paper printing the printer doesn’t work. Now forever the lights on the printers blink and I cannot do anything about it as there are no solutions for this sort of error other than taking it to service. I requested for refund instead they providing me replacement. I just hope the other piece works just fine.
1,Pathetic support...Since last one week trying various options to install printer software and driver...but not getting through...eventhough service person temporarily managed but again failed to do setup...both online. And with CDs also... asked customer service agent also...got feedback that same problems with this series ....going to return the printer....Disappointed with EPSON....
1,Very bad product.. Printer printhead jam just within 3 months/500 pages. Very bad after sales service. Customer care executive are not supportive. And service technician doesnt come at scheduled time. Overall a very disappointing product.
1,"The printer was in good condition the delivery was quick and superb. I called up Epson technical team to send someone for installation. They responded quickly and the guy came in 2 hours.The bad part was that it took him around 1.5 hours to get this printer up and running since there were some initial firmware issues. Once it was resolved the printing was happening correctly but the scanner/copier failed to work at all. The technician tried several times but it did not work. I had to, unfortunately, return the item."
2,Scanner glass damaged ... on arrival..........
4,"WiFi connectivity from laptop to printer is really a difficult task but one thing you have to remember that if printer is connected to laptop through WiFi there are two options named as Epson l4150 and Epson 553D32 will be shown under printers and Faxes heading and whenever you want to print you have to opt EPSON L4150 Series for data cable connected process and EPSON553D32(L4150Series)for WiFi connected process under the heading ""How do you want to print your picture"""
1,"The printer is best for first 14 days (its my personal experience) afterwards its start showing problem of ‘both light blink’ i.e. paper jam, no printing no copy. After searching the solution in YouTube (due to pandemic situation onsite visit are hold by company) it came to know that, this is a universal problem in ‘EPSON’ printer and surprise that still the company not able to solve this.Once log the call, the call center revert quickly while discussion with the technician he confirm that it’s a hardware issue need to solve in service center only. My frank opinion before anyone wants to purchase this please visit YouTube and search ‘Problem in EPSON’."
1,"paper jam problem,head errors,malfunctioning"
4,"1st day experience. Info page showing fail status and wifi password cannot be retrieved. Lines appearing in prints and not solve even after head cleaning twice and waste lots of costly original ink. Printing stops in middle and paper has to pulled manually. Though to replace the printer and Amazon told to contact epson. Epson once disconnected my call saying techical problem. After called them they gave complain number. This printer was not in my budget still somehow managed it and this happening. Very important exam after 3 days. Now should i study or stress my head this box which epson calls printer. Aaa thuu. Will amazon or epson compensate for the lost ink or my precious time or my cool of mind to study.Update after 16 days usage.Printer is good. Print quality is good. Fast. No auto duplex is sad. Ink is costly.Advice: no screen so, installation was difficult. Better call technician for installtion. Will update later if any problem found"
5,"If we use normal paper to print black-n-white, quality is not same like my HP laser printer, but if we use glossy photo paper to print image, quality is just AWESOME! However, I am having problem to understand how it works in wireless mode, it's not very smooth to make it work from Mac or iPad or Android. I would give 10/10 for quality and cost, however ""Easy to use"": 6.5/10. May be we could not figure it out properly :("
4,Very easy to use and convenience of wifi. Easy setup. Good accurate color reproduction on photos. However on normal kodak photo paper (200gsm) it makes roller marks (multiple vertical lines due to pressure and not ink). I don't know why we can't improve this technology to use something like pinch rollers in cassette decks which dont scratch. Very silly to have this kind of issue in printers made in 2018.
1,"Amazon doesn’t allow me to return the product. I won’t be able to return the product after 24h September. They just hold the return date to be passed. The product is not convenient because when a paper is jammed, I have to open the front cover with a screwdriver. I am not willing to do that every time. Please support me for returning the product.Thanks!"
1,"CONNECTING TO WIFI EVERY TIME IS A HEADACHE , IT DOESN'T CONNECT AS QUICKLY AS A CELLPHONE, YOU HAVE TO ERASE THE OLD SETTINGS , SWITCH IT ON AND OFF SEVERAL TIMES TO GET IT CONNECTED. PRINT SPEED IS TOO SLOW. PRINT QUALITY IS OKAY. IF YOU GOING TO USE IS MAINLY AS A WIFI PRINTER , STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER. I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW AFTER 3 MONTHS USE AND I AM FED UP WITH THE CONNECTIVITY PROBLEM."
5,"Iam writing this after using this printer for a month. Before its purchase i was confused with other printers like most of us are in between hp 410, 415, brother t 510w.To be honest this epson l 3150 is best printer with minimum ink price. Best in class picture prints provided u use fujifilm glossy photopaper of 180 gsm.Very sharp and clear images with original color combination.Photocopy works well u are printing less than 25 prints at a time it works smooth under 60 seconds it will photocopy.All I can say it's the best wifi printer with very easy installation, one can install on his/her own. Wifi direct function is so easy to use.Finally dont read too much reviews  about this just go ahead. Iam using this in my hospital with daily 1 color print and 10 photocopies.Iam fully satisfied."
5,We purchased this printer and are happy with the value for money that it is providing us. THANK YOU Epson and Amazon...
4,This is a direct wifi printer and it's really worth having it. Wifi increased the usability by many fold. Epson creative print application is not supported by this model and to me it's a negative point for the printer. Scanning speed gets reduced after few continuous scan however for few scan it is ok. Photo quality is better then L380 and is acceptable. Roller mark as vertical lines are observed on photo that is negative for photo printing. Epson demo person are not equipped to give demo with demo photo print.
3,"So I'll jump directly to cons:1. It's not really 8 inches in height. The height goes around 5 inches. In fact in ""Product Dimensions"" it says, the height is 28 cm which is equal to 11 inches approx.2. The build quality sucks. There's some patches of manufacturing glue visible on the product. Can very easily become scratched.3. Too expensive. This should actually cost less than a mug in my opinion."
4,"God sent product and much much needed for those who sit long time looking at the monitor screen specifically for the tallest people bending the neck to keep their eye level to match your monitor's display that lacks height adjustable stand.Functionality wise i could go on non stop praising about this product but the asking price is really high otherwise its a must buy if you suffer neck pain due to the reasons i stated above just go for it you won't regret, it got great built quality and look to keep it on the pc table and goes well with almost all color combo and a space under to keep the mobiles and its charging cables underneath nice and stealthy. Will update about its durability after a year or two.5 star worthy product but minus one star due to high price tag."
5,"Good product. Does anyone notice that they have a 5 pack at a better price which can be used under your speakers, under your TV, under your printer (A4 sheets underneath) and even as a stool? I used the last one to keep my record player which I do not use much. It freed up a lot of  space underneath. Now I need another for my wife's sewing machine but I have none left."
5,"Item supplied is item described.Product as specifiedWell packed.Delivery is great as usual from AmazonProduct Made in China.Height can be increased or decreased by using a Riser.One advantage is in low width table, if you place a monitor on this stand, you can use the mouse comfortably in the space below.Durability can be said only by time. Still it appears durable.The edges are smooth. No rough edges.Excellent finish."
5,"Beware of Limited adjustability. This product will come with a base and two risers, which can be configured for three different heights. You cannot adjust the stand to any other height except these three heights (2.9"", 4.2"", 4.8"")."
3,The product looks very similar to a patla stool (which is available for 1/3rd of the price). The riser adjustments for increasing the height is the only addition I can see on top of a Patla stool. But too costly for such a simple addition. Also beware that Amazon has smartly made it a non-returnable product (possible for a replacement only).
5,"I can't really talk about durability when I only just now got it, but it feels very sturdy. At the end of the day, this is an adjustable shelf, but it seems well designed for office work. I got this for my external monitor when after getting a riser for my laptop, I realised that the external monitor was also too low for proper ergonomics. One thing I really like about the design is how it generously frees up space under the monitor, actually giving back desk space I didn't have before.  . . Thus, more desk space and less shoulder and neck strain. Aesthetically, it's also great for a standard work environment."
5,"Though priced a bit on the higher side, the product is very good. I have kept my printer on this and now my study cum computer table looks less cluttered. There's so much more space now. The stand comes with two height options using the risers given with it. The risers fit perfectly into the slots under the top. Although it's all plastic but the quality is damn good and it looks sturdy. Also, the finishing and look and feel is premium. I got it in a lightening deal for 1039. I'd give full marks for innovation. This is my 5th AmazonBasics product and I'm happy."
5,"I bought this product to put my computer monitor on it, and now it holds not only computer monitor and two audio interfaces and one of computer speaker as well. Yet it is sturdy enough to stand it's tallest hight. I am Very satisfied with this perches.Customers who want to Buy this, just go for it. You won't regret."
4,"Read the leaflet if you can't figure out how to assemble it. Only time will tell how durable it actually is. For now, it's perfect for my 21"" monitor.  It provides the necessary elevation to avoid neck and back strain. Additionally, there's space for storage under this stand."
5,One of the best investment I have done for my home office.I am very happy with the sturdiness. My monitor  is not woobling. I have some extra space to keep speakers or books.The best part is the ease of use to adjust the height of the stand
4,I got exactly what I wanted. A relatively cheap option for my 32 inch Led TV. It's holding good and no complaints so far. My desk looks a little cleaner now I think.
4,"Happy with the purchase.With only one of the attachment, it is sufficient for me.The make is very good that it ll take good enough weight and will be able to hold even large monitors with ease."
5,Bought this riser for my tv as i needed space for my centre channel speaker. It was able to carry the weight of my heavy lcd tv quite well. Did not see the middle bending because of the weight. Excellent build quality. The materials used is real good and hence the product is sturdy.
5,This is one of the smartest choice I've made. Now I can place my PC monitor in 3 heights. There's space provided below where u can keep some books or wireless mouse...
4,"Pretty strong/sturdy. Can be used to keep anything on it. It has got 2 adjustable height setup. The are two sets of stands. One with 2.5 inches height, and another one with 1.5 inches height.  When assembled with both stands, you get upto 4+ inches of space under."
4,Better looking monitor stand than any other model including amazon basics metal stand version (incidentally using both). Sturdy too. Can safely raise and mount a 32” LED tv as well. Surface is little smooth which doesn’t induce confidence when placing monitor on this stand. No raised edges around as well. Keep out of kids reach.
5,"Super built hard plastic which can withstand average wait of monitors ranging between 2-9kg, fully worthy product, just slightly pricy."
5,This is an Excellent Product. It serves its purpose very well. Good for your neck muscles and posture as you will never have to bend to look at monitor. It is very sturdy and durable and will last for ever.
5,Very nice product. Price is bit higher side but its fulfill my requirements. Also I can store all the cables & small items.Also thanks for Amazon for fast delivery.
5,Very good stand. Saves space and you can keep few items beneath the stand as well. Its very sturdy and durable.
5,"It is an excellent purpose. Just what I had wanted. It is sturdy, stable and of very good quality plastic."
5,"Amazing stuff from Amazon. It served my purpose of keeping the monitor. Also has two modes for height adjustment. Simple elegant design. Go for it, worth the money."
1,I ordered it for my 15.6 inch Laptop... But trust me its too smal in size... My laptop doesnt fits on it perfectly... No matter quality is good but it should have been little bigger than this...
1,The product qualifies for toilet stool.it catogerized wrongly.so small that monitor and laptop base not fit.That's why it non exchangeable if one purchase by mistake you have to keep it and use for junks
4,"Good. The height adjustment feature is good. I wish it had Max height of 6 inches, that would have been even better for tall people with shorter monitors. But still a good buy."
5,"Excellent product, makes my monitor exactly on my eye level, which is very important to prevent long term fatigue. Build quality is solid looks great, very subtle & has two adjustable positions. Highly recommended."
1,"One of the monitor riser was damaged and we are unable to notice this before the return date expires. When we try to use it the new pack, it got damaged. Here we are attaching the image of this part.Please try to help us to replace the damaged one."
5,"Very useful product.....Bought 2 sets and all my loose papers now well organised, thanks to Amazon basics !!"
2,150rs plastic stool serves the purpose. Don't go for this with more than 1000 rs. Not worthy.
5,It should be able to accommodate a keyboard and hence save space on the desk
5,Nice and sturdy. Using it for my subwoofer stand. Its barable and nice grip.
1,Not very usefulIt comes with 3 fixed height settingsDo not buy
4,"Strong, sturdy however I feel its bit on the higher pricing range.... but the quality is good so no issues. Recommend this. But not a replacement for the regular monitor stands ( but obvious )"
4,"Solid basic plastic stand, does the job. Can store small items underneath."
5,Very sturdy product. Appropriate height adjustments to suit individual requirement. Best buy for work from home to reduce the strain of your neck.
4,It comes with an adjustable stand. one can easily adjust height of the stand as per one'e need. Quality of the product and material is good and of enduring nature.
5,Easy to install. Quite sturdy. Look nice on my desktop.
5,"It's expensive but very good size for table, loved the quality also!"
4,"Sizable Monitor Riser, fully Impressed. you can use for many purposes such as footrest, to keep big woofer and printer."
1,"Kodak scanners are a big disappointment.  I purchased one i3200 and 2 i2620 scanners all three products have issues immediately post the warranty period of 1 year (and within warranty period too).  The scanners have problems such as for duplex scanning back page scanning is not working, within warranty period the kodak folks replaced one small part to fix this and again this problem has come post warranty period.  The kodak service team charges 3000 for inspecting the product and then will charge additional for any parts + service cost! Outrageous. I have been using Fujitsu scanners for past 4 years without any such problem either with product or such exorbitant service cost!!  Strongly advocate not to but any Kodak scanners atleast these models!"

2,Cable material is stiff. Would not straighten. Ordered it for an old hard disk; it was not detected using this cable.

5,"Best product ever, I scanned 86 pages of book at low quality, low size, it took 2 mb of space and best quality at the lowest settings. Go for it.Thumb cots only auto-removed when two page setting is applied.86 page took 2-3 minutes, as I am a new to this."
5,Just what I needed to scan books without having to spend enormous amounts of time and effort in doing post-processing corrections.

5,Amazing
5,"Very Useful,Just Awesome"
3,Good product
2,"I was attempting to copy some pages of a book, and it has a serious flaw in it.  On the bottom, on one side along the edge, it has a set of wheels, and these seems to start and end the scanning process instead of letting you start and end the scanning process manually.  This means that the end of the scan cuts off the bottom of the image, and it is way too short for one to go across the page fully unless you want to spend 5 minutes stitching two images together, which I do not have time for, because it's thousands of them."

5,It is really worth of money to scan different sizes of paper.
2,"Custom buttons provided doesn't work , it stop scanning after 4 or 5 pages, it takes long time to resume the scanning function, it's irritating, there is no software updates also 😠"
5,"I am using this product for one and half year, very good performance without any complaints, worth its value"
5,very very nice product.
4,Hardware is good but software part is weak.
5,Excellent product with features like Book scaning Object scaning at very affordable price.

2,"I am a research scholar studying for my PhD degree. I believed this rather expensive hand-held scanner will help me to collect research material. Given below are my concerns with this product.1. The process of entering time / date is so cumbersome and complicated, that I gave up.2. The description of the  LED  light which is supposed to provide scanning indicator , and the LCD display are all not clear and confusing.3. After connecting to my laptop, it is not detecting the Iscan !4. During scanning, the green light goes off immdtly on starting the scan.5. I have loaded the batteries, and also the 32 GB SD card; now how do I read the contents of the scan that I did of a few pages of a book just to test the devise ? Are you saying I have to now buy a card reader for the same ?"

1,"Slowest printer , After giving print option you can make a hot green tea in your electric kettle and can complete your tea..But for every print cup of tea is not good to health"
5,"At this budget it is fantastic. It is efficient and easy to use. I do not know why some people are saying it is slow. Because it is not slow. You have to set ""plain paper"" in the properties before you start printing. It is very fast. I printed 80 black and white pages in around 9 minutes. The problem is by default it selects the glossy paper and takes a hell lot of time. Obviously, if you are not printing photos, why would you select glossy paper. For document printing select plain paper and see how fast it can print! Quality of print is also great. There are three options - draft, better and best. I was happy with the draft quality. I printed 450 pages on a single day. It did not give me any trouble at all."
1,"Please don't buy this printer, the paper gets jammed each time. Amazon customer care was good, they got a new replacement printer  which worked for around 2 weeks. Again the new printer is having the same problem. I've given to hp service centre, will update you soonUpdate: hp replaced it with a new printer-another model ( working)"
5,"I am so unlucky beacause when I ordered it after that day the of the printer discresed.  Ok, I am happy to share you that I received a very good printer. I want to tell you that if your buying price range is under 5,000/- then you can buy it.  It's printng cost is medium not so high or low( 1.4  & 5 ). I buy this in 4,814/-  & my purchase date is 23/11/2020. I get this printer in three days after order in Coochbehar, West Bengal.  I install it in pc in four minites. You can also do it. I am a boy of class 8. I can do it easliy."
3,Now i understood why this printer is rated 3 star on amazonVery slow printingNot good for office purposePrint quality is okayIt takes 2-3 minute to get ready once to switch it onYou may go for this printer if you print 50-100 pages a month
1,"Had a very bad experience with both the manufacturer and Amazon. After receiving the printer I wasted by complete one day to install the printer and software as no demo was provided. Finally, when started using the printer, I came across several issues like extremely slow, paper getting stucked and printer hanged and need restart. Hence, I replaced the printer. The another printer which I received was already broken so good that I didn't had to waste my time to install. But here comes the returning issue. At first the delivery person who came to take back the return refused to take it back saying the serial number is not matching. I immediately called the customer care but they couldn't communicate with the delivery person due to language issue. This all happened in between by office meeting. Then customer care re-scheduled the return and finally the same delivery person took the printer back and thankfully Amazon refunded my amount back with no more issues."
5,"Order experience - Ordered last night, arrived today morning. Unboxed - cardboard/thermacole suffered some tear but product was intact & plastic sealed with wires & both cartridges. Plugged in tested copy and print - works like a charm.After Sales Support - Did not know how to use manual duplex (print both-side), called tech support - he guided and explained me process/steps; tried it - worked as expected. 1 hour back got a call from tech support to confirm resolution before closing ticket. Really liked it.Overall feedback - I read so many negative reviews about paper jam, ink level and issues after few days. I got concerned but as everything is working seamlessly and got great support, I feel positive. This is my second HP printer; I don't think there would be a better product with such features at this price."
1,"I have received last week due to got busy in some family function didn't get time to open it. as return/placement date  mentioned 6/Jan/21, i opened last night and  found used product delivered.1) Only cartages wrapper present in box , cartages attached in to printer , cartages should be seal packed.2) as cartages are  attached to printer it means they are used.3) No information booklet present in box.4) printer inside box is opened without any wrapping. 100% sure this product is used and then return by someone, same has delivered to me.Although its mention on order ""HP DeskJet 2335 All-in-One Ink Advantage Colour PrinterReplacement may be possible through 06-Jan-2021""Amazon saying relacment is not possible as date has been passed although replacement request raised on 6th .Better not opt for amazon for costly product and specially this seller ""Appario Retail Private Ltd"" who has delivered this item._----------------------------------------_--+-++++-Update, got immediate replacement with new printer but new printer is not working copy and print function not working.Even after talking with hp support they are not able to solve the problem, somehow amazon ask to return the product."
1,Worse printer m facing problem now. The ink is full but it shows no print n no ink . the demo page can be print but . the light keeps blinking saying no ink.  HP is a cheater. Its waste of time as bought for college print works. This Printer is a scam. Check youtube as well it says this printer is always creating problem no use.  It was late to change as mine amazon package cover was thrown so. It won't be accepted to return. They said only can be replaced . so total waste of money and time
5,Good quality print. Good packing condition. Value for money.
1,"I purchased this product and was unable to install driver on my Windows 10 laptops. [Note: Both Windows 10] The call to HP was long wait and finally I got through. The person tried to install device driver but wasn't successful. He was installing HP 2300 series driver. After that I did some research and tried to install F2200/F2224 driver on my old Windows 10 laptop and it worked on one of the laptop. The message on newer windows 10 laptop was that you are using older version of device driver. A service engineer came but  couldn't do much. Surprisingly he told me that your laptop has a problem. I explained that it's a DELL laptop and not an assembled one and uses legitimate windows 10. I tried to tell him that windows 10 might have a newer patch and there might be a patch for driver as well. But he was not very keen probably trained by HP.  I am keeping printer and will update if at all HP sees this and comes back to me with resolution as I have told him that I can even wait for 15 days. He also said I am free to give whatever ratings I want. ??My service ID: BRFZ7243A descent product but extremely poor HP service. It's not a technician's fault but the attitude of parent company HP. They want to make money but don't care about educating their technicians. This is how they train people. There is no attitude to help customers, no desire to learn @ issues and no desire to solve issues, no log checking, poor debugging. They are taught to close the cases by parent company. HP wake up...  Don't be complacent ..."
2,Stopped working in couple of week. This is my third and HP s second printer. First I bought from store lasted like 7-8 years without any issue as I remember. And this time bought online. Printer got internally damaged and one gear stud got broken. I don't know how this could happen in such short time (couple of times only) use.
4,"I have been using this printer for taking print outs of my Kids home work and documents.The print quality is not good as we get in the shops or office, but this will be enough the above said uses. Prints are little lighter on black and greyscale. I tried changing the settings , but it did not help.The test print with colour looked good, but I have not taken any more colour printouts.Printing in greyscale can finish up the colour inks very quick, so use it only if required."
3,"It just meets expectations of printing and scanning. However, there are quite a few issues which are not that satisfactory.1. The paper gets stuck very often when it starts rolling into the printer. The paper tilts to a side and gets stuck. The print is just OK.2. The scanning takes very long. And after using it for nearly a month, I am still to figure out how to create a single file from multiple scans. And settings are too clumsy. Not user friendly settings.3. Product looks too brittle. Not sturdy/robust."
4,"Being HP product is good. However for scanning you are compelled to go online i.e. through HP App which is not desired and very cumbersome. During which a lot of HP updates squeeze-in in your system. This printer has an HP offer of free headset. Here is the problem. The invoice sent with the delivery is thermal print out and is difficult to read contents in that more particularly the serial number of printer which is must for redeeming offer. The invoice if downloaded come in two parts /pages, i.e Part-1 invoice without serial number of printer and Part-2 Packing slip with serial number of printer and HP redemption cell do not consider packing slip and also invoice without serial number of printer. Hence offer not allowed. Sorry."
1,"Cartridge printed only 40 pages, and it empty now.You mentioned wrong printing quantity.Cartridge cost is rupees1553 for 1 set which gives approx 40 pages print.  Print is very costly.Never buy HP printer.Printer is cost effective but ink cartridge is very costly.Never go for it."
1,"I bought this HP 2335 printer and regretted it. I wasted 2 days of my time fixing this printer. Nothing happened. Then I called Amazon for returning this product. The representative said she would replace this product with another one. The replacement arrived the next day. But the replacement is also a junk product and it does not work. So, I am again trying to reach Amazon and I am getting the message that the customer service call back service is not available.I am a busy executive and I don’t have time to waste like this. I regret buying this product!Don’t waste your money buying this product  and also don’t waste your precious time fixing this junk!I don’t understand why Amazons customer service call back Service is unavailable. So how can we return the defective product?"
1,"There are too many driver compatibility issue and lack of integration for apple devices. Customers should not be going through this kind of unnecessary hassle.Instead of making multiple printers with almost similar features and price range, HP should concentrate more on ease of usage and superior experience for end user with better product quality and support."
4,Please send me Installation disc as I am senior citizen so as to enable me to run.Product is Good.Awaiting favorable Installation disc to solve Scan Issues.
1,The HP DESKJET INK ADVANTAGE ALL IN ONE PRINTER delivered on 31 December 2020 (13 Days back) was a defective piece as paper was getting jammed. As per the policy return of such items within seven days only is permitted.
2,The printing speed is very slow and not WiFi version only usb connectivity.Their promise is fake they said the black cartridge print 480 pages but this print only 100-120 pages and cartridge is empty.Like that colour cartridge print only 30 pages . My money is worst / waste . So I want you that don't buy this product this is fake claim of cartridge and printing quality is very slow
1,This printer is one of the most inconvenient printers I have ever used. The manual doesn't give any information. And the print and scan function doesn't work. Only photocopy works.
4,Fast to print. Clear prints. Ver good after sales service also. I had to get a replacement as the first one I received had a problem with paper loading. It got replaced very fast and the Amazon technician was excellent
1,It is totaly bad product there was no ink in this cartridge cartridge was empty and the costumer care is not helping us I totally waste my money kindly costumer care please help me to change this product
5,"Works perfect for my usage, we need max 30-40 prints a month.This works perfectly well and print quality is good. It's a machine now give it time to do its job for printing for few seconds. Not an issue for me atleast."
3,This printer very reliable to use and printer quality is good(I am talking about black print only) but I got defected tricolor cartidge and I have given the cartridge for replacement to HP authorised service centre. I will update my review colour print quality after I get the new color cartidge from service centre.
4,"Easy to install,  photocopy and printing is easy but scanning is little cumbersome. But works well."
5,This is 1st reviewI want to tell you all guys that this also work on LINUX without any extra app.Very easy to use
2,Print quality is very poor. The cartridge gives very less number of prints. Nowhere near to the mentioned 100-300 pages. Scanner is good. Giving 2 stars just because of that. No value for the money paid...
1,"Tried to contact customer service, so many times!!. Amazon customer service will ask you to contact the HP service team to get a job sheet for return. Now the brand new printer is sitting in the storage room. Gave up the idea of returning it."
1,"Invariably paper gets stuck, twisted. Have to hold n guide it. Takes hours to print.  The worst printer i ever used in 3 decades!"
1,I've ordered it and firstly I wasn't working then I replaced it hopefully that good product will reach me out but unfortunately again the same problem... Printer isn't working and roller are jam and and somewhere there is hardware issue...and wasting my time with this product... think twice before you go for this product.😔
5,It's very easy to use. This product is cheap and best.
5,"Very helpful & awesome printer at a reasonable price. Printing speed as normal, very good packaging & safely delivered by Amazon. Thank You Amazon & HP"
1,Printer was for Home use. But Printer DEFECTIVE.... NO INVOICE SENT EITHER.LABEL SHOWING WRONG SERIAL NUMBER AS CONFIRMD BY MR SAMUEL OF HP AS WELL AS MS MUSHKANHP NOT WILLING TO RENDER SERVICS DUE TO WRONG SERIALNUMBER>DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS SERVICE OF AMAZON
1,Worst printer one can buy. Please don't buy. The paper gets stuck all the time. The color is getting dispersed on rubbing. Unfortunately my return window is over by the time i realized.Now the printer is showing error carriage stalled and not able to use it.
5,It's not slow. Change the settings of the printing then it will be faster.Initially I felt same with my experience.Later on after changing settings it is working faster like any other printer
3,The power supply cable is not fitting the printer its very loose ofter its comming out
1,Terrific Experience.....I received a used product yesterday....both ink cartridge is not in sealed pack .Ink cartridge already fitted in the printer and it was used product.I call customer care but they said they can't replace my product now

5,Hi
5,Best and better fingerprint scanner
3,"No rd is registered, i had purchased and the device is not rd registered. Then I have to spend 425 extra for rd. The description is fake"
5,So quick function . i read some reviews about RD service absence. But its not true. I have check its have rd service already enabled. I done 2transaction on digi pay. And all you know digipay not run without rd service. Advised to all please check rd service status on morpho's original site
5,"RD service is pre-installed. Verify from rdserviceonline.com only by providing the serial number(5th digit is ""I"" in capital).I'll recommend using smartphone as the process is much simpler than using computer. You just need to download three apps (morpho rd service,morpho SCL RD SERVICE, main app eg. Jeevan praman). Just connect the device using an OTG adapter (ctype or micro usb) and follow the process."
5,Very good device for authentication through adhaar. Jeevan Praman works with it.My device came in rd services from the seller radium box.But they need to improve packaging quality. A box is to be expected with this delicate device.
5,"I hated the product until I found how to install it properly myself after not getting proper help from the support team, some people at the tech support are worst... They don't respect customers... I wish there should be a feedback system for customer service... Though, one good guy hinted me unknowingly which helped me install the device properly myself...Coming to the device,It's such a gem...Pros:1.Superfast2.Easy installation3. Connects in seconds4.Looks decent5. Drivers are available6. Good support for various sites.7.RD service pre-enabledCons:1.Worst Tech supportIf you have trouble connecting and haven't got good support at technical helpdesk, then ask me I'll help for sure...."
5,Baught it for 2200 only. Easy to install rd service ready product. Ready to use. Working perfectly fine. Very long cable length. Using it for DigiPay Aadhaar printing KYC and Jeevan pramaan services also can be used for UTI Aadhaar Biometric verification for matching PAN card application records
1,This product made me fool. It is fully Loss of money. Various of difficulties come in installation. Please don't buy SAFRAN ICONS MSO1300 E3 BIOMETRIC FINGERPRINT. Mantra and any other companies is more better than this product.
4,Packing was not good but product was safe thank you easy activation  value for money
5,"I purchased this from seller MHV Technologies.  The sticker on the product says Idemia. I checked the serial number on the rdservice website and it showed that the device was already whitelisted, which means the service was already activated. I installed the Morpho SCL RDService from Google Play Store without any problem and in a few seconds my Morpho device was ready to use. I installed the Jeevan Pramaan app from the govt website and my parents were able to generate their life certificates without any problem. The Jeevan Pramaan app automatically detected the Morpho device. Completely satisfied with the Morpho device.  Five stars.A point to remember while entering the serial number while checking validity is that the fifth character is I (I for Idemia) and not 1."
1,Hello teamRecently i bought your device Morpho Icons- MSO-1300 E3 Biometric Fingerprint Scanner with RD Service & Latest Version. when i am trying to connect to my phone  i am getting error ( No single device registered yet). I have gone through your FAQ and user manual but could not resolve the problem. Please support in this regards. Please not that i am trying to benchmark your product against similar product for Skill India project (Govt. of India initiative) quick support would help me in accessing and finalizing the product for our across India locations
5,"The product works fine. I wasn't sure after reading mixed reviews, however, after ordering it and using it I am satisfied. RD Service (device whitelisting) is valid as advertised. Just make sure you follow instructions properly when installing. Little complex when installing on windows PC easier on android mobile. Check instruction details, download latest driver, software from the Morpho RD service website. First time I also faced issues as I did not follow the steps properly. After following the steps properly its work absolutely fine. Go for it. It has 10 day replacement plan so don't worry."
1,"When i Purchase this device ,there was mention in specifications device is with RD service but whe device is delivered at my home ,I check the device it is not activated and RD service was not Activate."
1,"This is the fake product, there is no brand name written on the product b it is given error every time, I bought this product because in the description and display image product has morpho written on the product."
1,"Got it from glowing 98. Looking at the reviews I was doubtful. But the device I got was already whitelisted (rd service registered.) You need to enable otg for some mobile devices for the device to get detected.Worked with Android mobile, jeevan pramaan was generated in less than 5 minutes. Happy with overall experience , specially during this pandemic situation.The cabel is thin, so have to be a bit careful when using the device. Fingerprint scanning is fast.Morpho is not written on top left morpho and idemia are kind of same. Idemia is parent company of Morpho and india manufacturer is smart chip pvt ltd. UP.Glowing 98 did not respond to any questions about the product before , so they can improve in customer support.If you are in doubt , just go for it and see by yourself. If rd service is not registered , you can buy it from rdserviceonline for 375rs. (May take few days to register)The device I got was already whitelisted without any expiry."
5,very good product
3,"installed the device downloading driver from morpho rd service. however, I had to register it by paying rs 442.5 for one year. Initially telecheck was successful but after some time it went on giving message telecheck unsuccessful. I uninstalled it and reinstalled. problem resolved. Submitted life certificate successfully. Device worked perfect. The supplier could have included a manual to describe the procedure for its installation. Specially to inform about need for inclusion of path by editing environment variable."
4,Good Product with 1Yr RD.. Satisfied..But I received it by small plastic cover.Requesting you to send this product by small plastic or small box.. Packing is not a safe one for this electronic device...
5,Had purchased it for father's Jeevan praman life certificate finger scanning. You tube & Jeevan praman site are to be utilised for its installation ( which is not that easy if not properly followed). Worked well post installation for the desired purpose. Purchase worth its value.
2,"No packaging box for the product. It was inside a zipper pack and which was too not sealed. No user manual, no warranty card. No paper inside the packet. I can't trust the authenticity."
4,Yes I get free 1 year RD registration  but I'm not get OTG cable which always with in.
5,"The installation on windows platform was a bit tedious and showed device not ready. However, the inrerface on android mobile worked flawlessly and in one go. Hats off! Purchased it for jeevan praman - life certificate submission (required for continued pension) of my mother during pandemic.Only 2 apps need to be installed on android phones  1) morpho rd online services app from playstore 2) 1) jeevan praman app for android via download link received from jeevan praman website. Follow the steps in the jeevan praman app manual and you are good to go."
1,मैंने यह डिवाइस खरीदी लेकिन इसमें कही भी Morpho नही लिखा हुआ जबकि आपके पेज पर दिखा रहा है।क्या आप बता सकते है ऐसा क्यों? क्या आप ओरिजनल बता कर लोकल डिवाइस बेच रहे है?
5,Very nice
1,"Morpho device name missing on device, and is it original device, packing is very bad, no box, long time delivered. So west of time"
1,The product does not support higher end version (7 and up)of Android version. Add to it a total lackadaisical approach and response from idmei team. I have a query pending since Oct 2019 and they are unable to provide a response.I would not recommend anyone to buy this product with my experience on customer support from their end.
5,Used it for Life Certificate. Very good option at this crucial n difficult Corona time..Submitted life certificate from home it self no need to go to bank.
5,Device Works perfectly on jeevan pramaan mob app for generating life certificate. Very good initiative by modi government for retired senior citizens. Also takes off load from banks. RD services are enabled for device.
1,"Product detail indicates that the device is ready with R D service but, after paid ₹4190 I m feeling cheated because now I will have to buy RD service. No RD service given as mentioned in product detail"
1,Its works but api not provided
5,"I’m using it for my mother’s online pension verification, so that we need not go to bank once in a year for the same. It’s really wonderful."
5,I had to register the device at no extra cost. It worked perfectly and I was able to submit my mother's blive certificate.
4,Seller could provide the drivers and some basic information. There’s no indication of its status at any point other than the time it is actually scanning. That’s very confusing.
5,Installation is tricky. You need to search online for latest drivers. Once installed it works fine. It reads fingerprint quickly and clearly. It comes with rd service. Used it for jeevan praman for my father. Super useful during this period. Very grateful to this device.
1,Returned as purchased with Rd but no Rd service reference was given
5,I used this for Jeevan  Pramaan. Generated the certificate from my android phone in minutes.I installed Umang  and Morpho RD service applications and followed the instructions.
5,It's product is very good rd service activat no any problems very fast scan
4,"White-listing to be done before delivering the product to avoid inconvenience to the customer, as per the description in the website.After contacting the seller, device was white-listed. Seller was helpful in resolving the issue.I have used this device to update details on Jeevan Praman and it worked well."
4,product doesn't carry RD service feewe have to shell out ₹442 .50 to use it for online purposes including jivan praman
3,"Finger Print Scanner is handy but without manufacturer logo. Item is from Indemia, reads finger easily. Installation without manual is difficult for common man. Manual not supplied.Rd Service not activated as stated, I had to pay Rs.442/- extra for one year."

5,Great product
1,Very bad product..never buy it
4,"smart product in field of education, but pictures appear not much clear in 2 MP camera"
5,Good product and very useful for book scanning easy to install and use in this lowest price. & best camera quality.
1,"Didnt had the updated software  and very less support, quality of Image is not very good ."
5,It is perfectly good printer for home use.Printing is fairly fast. For home users it will be more than enough.I have attached a pic which compares printing in b/w and colour with original. Middle one is the original.
4,"Received in one piece, good for home purpose use. Using just first day, took some printouts both color and black, it's quiet decent. Don't know how many printouts i can get in one cartridge. Thanks amazon. Got on freedom sale only for ₹3400.Add on: Using the printer over a month and the cartridges gave me more than 350 pages of printout. I am happy with the printer."
3,"printer is good. there are some issues i faced that it can connect only with laptop via usb,no lan port. colour printing takes huge amount of ink and cost/page becomes more. try to purchase wireless printer. cartridge of this printer cost more than 650."
5,"HP Deskjet 2138 is a good printer for home use. I received the printer in good condition. Installed in few steps with the CD which was given along with printer. Received a colour and a black cartridge along with the printer and its easy to fix the cartridges.Print quality is not super good but good enough for home use.Print speed is actually better than i expect. ( i have used canon printer before and Hp is better than that).Scan quality and speed is average.  When you increase the quality(dpi), the scanning is even slower. ( canon was faster).  Still not bad.printer is compact light weight and its easy to use.For those  who wanna decide between inktank printer and cartridge printer like this one.... If you are looking for a printer for home use such as, ticket printing, school projects printing, occational document printing ..go for cartridge printer. If you are looking for printer for printing few hundreds of pages every month , all year, then go for ink tank printers.  Note that, most common problem in a inkjet printer is print head stuck with dried ink. this happens when printer is not used for a while. When you change the cartridge, you are actually changing the print head.  But with ink tank printer, print head is fixed and it requires service when its not used for a long time.Warranty issue.... when I checked for the warranty in HP website, it says only three months remaining. I called up the customer care and after sharing the invoice copy they assured me that warranty info will be reset.Edit/update :. After 10 days the warranty was updated correctly. So changing my 4 star rating to 5 star."
1,"I ordered the printer on 6-July-2020 and it arrived on 8th. Due to COVID-19, I kept it in a corner for a day. On 9th, I opened the package. The quality of packaging was good and no damage was observed.It took a minute for me to figure out how the vertical paper feed works. I then plugged in the system to my windows 10 laptop. The laptop was not able to detect and hence did not  automatically download the drivers.I then visited the concerned drivers website that came with the product flyer. This site redirected me to Microsoft store. Since I do not possess Windows store account, I was not able to install any driver software.I then googled for the drivers using the model name. It took me to a site where I could download the individual software components manually.I downloaded the installer. HP software is notoriously bloated and the software installation experience is poor. Please look at the images. First, it downloads software components which I do not need, then asks unnecessary questions, shows unwanted popups and post installation exit from the installer is not smooth.After a lengthy installation process, the first print failed. I had to then download Print and Scan Doctor from HP website. After a lot of time, it showed two errors. After fixing these and was able to print.However, the printout was black-n-white. I could not fix it.Visited the website. HP uses chat bot, so it was not able to help me. I was given 1800 toll free number. However Airtel blocks 1800 numbers, so I was not able to reach customer support. I then tried WhatsApp chat. A bot told me to wait on WhatsApp and that was it. I waited for an hour. None of the toll free numbers worked. Tried couple of times, but no response.I finally tried the 1800 number from my maid's phone (idea network) and it connected! Had to wait for 15 mins. When I finally reached the right person, she helped me in debugging the printer. I uninstalled and reinstalled the software. Post this, my laptop was unable to detect the printer. When I clicked on color management in printer settings, it opened Windows 10 display color management.Finally the lady booked a HP technical support for home visit. Now I have to wait for a few days.I have not tested Scanning or Xerox, yet. The paper on the vertical tray goes faster on one side than the other. Could be a hardware issue, but have to wait for the HP support person to comment.Please do not buy HP printers! They just do not work as expected."
1,Listed item description is completely false.....No any option for Wifi connectivity.
3,"Printer looks good , easy to use , all functionality available , xerox ,scan , print.But it is not value for money as cartridge cost is more and print per page cost is more.It print 260 black pages and 20-25 colour for me  . ON complaining to HP customer care they said as per standard it say it print 480 black and 150 color page  but quality/quantity  should be 5% of A4 size with draft quality. SO it means it should print 5% of 480 pages.so ideally we can say not value for money by spending 1100 rupees ( 2 cartridge cost) for 280 page total . So cost for page is  -  Rs 4/- approx  avergae in totaland cost for black page print - Rs  2.88 /-and cost for color page print - Rs 28/-"
3,"I am using this printer from 1 month & i found, it work good while scanning, Copy & printing. But the cartridge performance is very bad, Black cartridge even did not print 100 Pages. I am very much disappoint with the purchase because the time when I was willing to print my important documents, the cartridge gets over & you can not expect, it will over within a month when you are using only for home purpose."
5,"I was worried since there were so many complaints for this printer. But this was easy to install and worked easily and quickly. The ink cartridges that came with the printer has already printed about 10 4x6 colour prints on HP photo paper, and about 25 sheets.I did a lot of research on what kind of printer to buy, based on what I expect my usage to be. I expect my usage to be minimal... maybe 5-6 pages every week on an average. But I may not print anything for many weeks also. It's mostly to be used for my kid's school assignment work etc. And I can take some prints from my workplace too. So this is more for emergencies, and when colour printing is required.Every type of printer has a hidden cost associated with it. It seems the ink in the Ink tank printers do not dry easily. So that is good. but the Ink tank printers can have their printer heads clogged, due to no usage. That can be a substantial cost.The MFP printers is not value for money if you have very little usage, and it's no help if suddenly you need to take a colour print for a school project the next day!After evaluatign all types of printers, I decided that the inkjet ones were the most appropriate for me:- Was okay will low usage.- Had a colour option too.- The printer nozzle heads are in-built with the ink cartridge. So if one goes bad, I can quickly/easily fix it, instead of having to take it to a service centre.Of the inkjet printers, I analyzed the whole range and decided that I should buy the cheapest one. The savings can be used to buy the expensive ink cartridges. While there were printers (only) available for sub-2000 rupees, i bought this, since this was the cheapest with the Ink Advantage technology, which I hope uses ink more efficiently.I initially had wanted to spend on the wireless versions, but I realized that I don't have a desktop anymore. I just have laptops, so it's not too much effort to take my laptop where the printer is! I just need to plug in the USB cable, and switch on the printer. And voila, I'm ready to print."
4,"Good Quality, but only problem is that unable to print pdf files from Adobe Acrobat Reader.  Contacted HP support forum, did reinstall Adobe Reader and all other alternatives as suggested.  Nothing worked.  Only alternative to print pdf is to open the file in Browser and print it from there.  Googled about this issue and it seems this issue is there for many users and both HP and Adobe are not providing any right solution for this issue."
1,Printing cost very high. Even with original black cartridge hardly print 70 copies  rather than 400 copies. Colorado only 8 copies. Very disappointed. Never go for this .
5,The ink is good for at least 200 copies in black and white. I don't use colour prints much but it lasted for a year and the black and white for 6 months. The scan function is really useful and I scanned all my old photos many of them more than 30 years old. The copy function is useful too.i refilled the black and white one locally but it lasted for about 50 copies only. Maybe only the original cartridges are good for more copies. Definitely worth owning for the scan function and occasional printing.Also it can print only with the black and white cartridge. The HP 680 black and white cartridge costs about 600 only
1,The paper tray cannot take adequate number of pages
4,As the printer is good but my self used it and as my experience those who buy this product should know thant catridge come with box can only print 70 to 80 B&W Prints an 50 colour print and new catridge is about  700 rs so this printer is not for mass printing you can buy ink tank or laser printer1 print goes about 1.4+.5 =1.9 rs soThink thrice before buying
1,"I am very sad to see such a big brand 'HP' and 'Amazon' have delivered broken printer at the time when I was planning to provide it as gift to one of my cousins. I requested multiple times that provide new one as early as possible as I had 2 days in backup.. These guys even did't deliver it again and funny part was that, it was available in one day delivery. Till now waiting for that and could n't give it to her that gift at her birthday. I seriously very sad and want any action by these big brand who make such a mistakes."
3,If you can afford 5-6 rs per page than buy this printer. Otherwise there are no added benefits. It consumes ink too much and moreover the reward was not given by HP stating that they need printer serial number on invoice. How can I arrange something on invoice that is generated by seller. These people just protect seller and steal reward from customers.
4,"The printer is great. The print quality is excellent. The scanning function also works like a dream. And the ink is widely available. But the main problem lies with the ink. The ink just costs way too much, nothing like the number of pages mentioned in the promotional materials. Also, if you plan on printing just black and white text, make sure to find and turn on monochrome option. If you just use greyscale, it will use the colour ink along with the black ink for unnecessary reasons."
5,"Bought a printer for first time. Superb choice. There are options for printing quality in the laptop when conneted to it for best quality or normal quality. Just one con that it is a wired one, you have to connect the usb cable to the laptop or computer if you want to print what you want, there was no app in the playstore which could help with a printer with a usb connector the hp smart app on the playstore only prints in the bluetooth Or wifi printing. Except that everything fine nice delivery with no damage but there was no outer cover provided by amazon should have provided cause of safety from 😷 u know... Although amazing product with good printing..."
5,"I really did not expect this printer to be much, but it's actually very nice. The setup is super easy, the print quality (even in draft mode), is very good - for both color and B&W prints. The ink consumption also seems to be not very heavy, because it's been more than 45 days since I have been using it, and the original setup ink is still working fine."
3,Disappointed with HP again. The colur catriage that came with the printer stopped working within couple of days and I didn't even print 6 pages.Atleast black catriage is working!Apart from that it's all fine.It is value for money and the catriage is reasonably priced.Try and avoid HP printers this is the second time it has happend to me.
4,"Setup: The Printer is easy to setup, even on Linux. Though linux is supported through hplib, and not through HP official drivers, it was easy to setup, share via file sharing as well as google cloud connector.Remote Usage: Would have been great if HP would have provided support for using it over the network using HP's own mobile apps instead of forcing users to use google cloud for printing from mobile.Printing cost: It is cheaper to get printouts/ copies at nearby cybercafe/ copier shops than on this printer. So buy this all-in-one only if you have low volumes but still need the convenience.Overall, a good buy for the price."
2,"Overall a very flimsy product which will work well only for a year to a year and half. Had purchased this product in May 2018. I always kept it covered with dust proof cover when not in use. And I am also gentle in operating it. But inspite of that, by around Jun of 2019 the print quality started to deteriorate. I changed the ink cartridge and a few more pages printed well after that it has become very bad with portions of the paper totally blank. The product lacks overall build quality"
1,The product was either damaged during shipment or a defective product.The product arrived as promisedThe outside box was fine but the styrofoam that is placed on either side of the printer was broken. Didn't think much of it when i setup the printer.Installed the software from the CD and installed the print catridges.The first copy i tried to make came out blank paperThe second copy was smudged.I tried to print and that was smudged as wellIt is of no use if it cannot do the basic function i bought it for. Return started. Waste of time waiting for it and setting it up.
1,It seems defective products are sold through Amazon and becomes useless. The printer gave me trouble within 2 months of purchase and the service department of hp was not ready to send a technician. But after much hassle and arguing they sent one technician who made a fool of me and it worked well only when he was there. I took it to the local repair shop and they told me that the problem is with logicard and it’s not available. Even after buying a new printer I was unable to use it after 3 months. Please don’t cheat people with great discounts and sell defective products.
1,I bought this printer last year in June and it stopped working last month giving blank printouts although the ink and all is there. It was supposed to be in warranty till June 21 but the warranty in system is already expired in Apr 21. Looks like Amazon has given old product which doesn't have full year warranty left. Very disappointed.
3,So it was right that It prints only 20-30 pages color print and 50-80 pages black printso it costs you more than outside xerox shopsbcs one cartridge is worth 650/- and both cost you 1200/- means 26/- for a color print (25 pages avg) and 8/ for a black printso please buy on your on risk1 more thing when you copy it cuts your boarder writings so please leave 1 inch on each side or place it on uppper cornersPlese go for Inktank(more costly but worth) if you can otherwise it's okk
1,Printer attached colour cartridge within 15 prints over black cartridge also same. In open market new colour and black cartridge's also very cost.so don't by this product and amazon not accept return also.very bad experience.so don't buy.
4,"Size of the printer is relatively small and comparatively lighter than other ink advantage printers.The print quality is good.It can take scan,copy(xerox) also.It has only wired connectivity. It doesn't support wireless connectivity.The cartridge model number is 680."
5,"Nice printer if you want only black and white print for office use. Colour print is good but not great, scan quality is satisfactory, and main thing is the cartridges are run out very quickly, but if you refill your cartridges then it's not an issue. In this price range for normal office use this is best printer, and build quality is not good like average and looks is really very nice."
5,There was no outer packaging but the printer received safely without any damagePrinter is good. I have used it for the past three days working greatHP is always goodOverall product is goodThanks AmazonI would definitely suggest this for anyone who is buying it for scanning purposeif printing is the main activity then can go for some ink tank printers
3,"The printer is simple, easy to install, drinks less ink and is overall economical with good quality output.However, this good quality is maintained as long as you are giving prints on regular A4 paper (both color and b/w).As soon as you put in a higher GSM paper, particularly photo paper or sticker paper, the ink starts spreading or the output colours don't match the soft copy. This is especially true for color printouts. So, do not fall for the official specs of the product which mentions higher GSM print out possible till A4 size.This is a good product and definitely is easy on the ink consumption than other printers as long as you need only regular A4 printouts."
1,"I purchase this printer one year back, it worked ok for me for one year. And exactly after one year, it did not work. It was not switching on. I checked with service guy and asked for a dashboard replacement which cost above 50 percent of printer cost. It is phetic HP is selling such kind of product, which did not last above one year. My suggestion don't buy any HP product."
4,The printer is good and does the printing and scanning job well.The only issue I came across was the software and device detection
4,"H.p is always the best, This product is good"
5,"Nice product at this price. I got it for ₹3150 during GIF . Nice product . But cd is missing in the package. But I easily installed the software using the user guide. For those who want information about the software installation(in absence of cd), whatsapp me on 9847052995"
1,"With a low volume of printing (less than 100 pages in a year) and after replacing cartridges with company originals, the printer has failed."
1,"The print quality is utter pathetic and cartridges have syringe holes when took out...used piece... already a year, so can't return...check your piece after buying"
3,This model has no Wi-Fi feature as described by amazon
4,"Cartridge is expensive BUT you can easily refill this by yourself , buy ink from market and refill it manually. But yeah Don't panic if you're doing it for the first time.Print quality is Good.Easy to install and use. Looks cool but not for heavy usage. Just for personal use only."
2,The printer is compact and light.. But the real problem lies in its paper tray.  Suited for one sided printing only.  Duplex is manual and messy.  Paper needs to be inserted correctly only then it is useful.  Cartridges are economical and long lasting in Draft print.
4,Good product

5,"I purchased the Secureeye S-SK100 Secure Key USB Fingerprint Reader hoping to accomplish three things. I wanted a fingerprint reader that works with Windows Hello to speed up the login process to my Window 10 systems. I also wanted a device that can encrypt/decrypt my personal file and folder on my official laptop and also on my external hard drive and pen drive. I want authentication on websites or password manager for my websites such as Dropbox, Google, Facebook and all my net-banking sites.And the good news, Secureeye S-SK100 accomplish all these three parameters, easy to install ( installation guide is already provided in technical specification column of amazon page), now with single finger touch I can log in and log out from my laptop, my personal data is completely secure in encrypted form, trouble-free login to all my website, no need to remember 10 different passwords, big reliefRelay a good product"
1,"Worst product .... It can't recognise fingure .... When I try to set up it for windows hello .... It shows me ""this device is unable to recognise you. Please try again""But thanks to Amazon that they refund my money within 1 days ...!!"
5,This product is exactly what you need for your PC/laptop. You just plug it in and register your fingerprint. Biometric systems embedded in this is wonderful.
4,"I bought this for my Dell XPS 15 which lacked a fingerprint and wanted to make it easier to sign in to the laptop. Installation was a breeze and never had an issue till date in using it. The drivers are automatically downloaded and then just forget that it is even there.The only feedback is that it is a big bulky and make it could be made a bit smaller. I do worry that keeping it in the bag etc will damage. Other than this small feedback, overall a fantastic product."
5,"Fantastic product it has served my purpose , this device is perfect for keeping secured logging into desktop or laptop with your fingerprint ( no worries of your password being hacked ) also it has file encryption which helps keep your files on your computer or laptop secured by accessing it through your fingerprint. Its a value for money device.Thank you Secureye for inventing such innovative product which keeps my computer or laptop secured."
5,Good product delivers the performance as described but sometimes the encrypted files don't decrypt and there is no way to recover the information back so causes data lossI will not prefer to encrypt very important documentsAlso it is not meant for encrypting Large volume  folders
5,"Nice product.I don't have to type the password on my laptop anymoreI just press my finger against the reader & it unlocks automatically. Also, I was surprised to find that I could also protect my files by encrypting it.Cheers Secureye !"
1,"Only Windows Hello login is working, but its native software doesnt work.So folder or file level encryption doesnt work. Storage of passwords or usage of passwords on websites also doesnt work.The technical support team is horrible and dont have a clue on what to do."
5,I couldn't recommend enough for workplace computers where you need to lock and unlock so many times and its so damn useful
3,Sometimes miss finger recognition.
3,I can use this product for login but not for file encryption as well as for website encryption because these functionalities only work by software that only supports win 7 and 8.1.So not for so useful for me.
5,Good but some times it is not recognise correct fingerprint.if softwere will update and fix this problem so it is best product and value for money.
5,Good... Satisfied...value for money....
1,THIS IS NOT WORKING NOT SENSORING MY FINGER PLEASE DONT TAKE IT IT IS ONLY WASTE OF MONEY PLEASE DONT PURCHASE IT
