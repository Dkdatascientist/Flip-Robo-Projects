1,"Order for Microware scanner, but received a product for iScan scanner, While scanning,  products always giving ""RED"" light error indication. It's a Amazon fulfilled product. But not a quality product, Amazon not checking quality of the product. Just charging high for Amazon fulfillment. This a second time happened."

3,Good
5,Best Product in its class.
5,"I bought this to connect my Roland V-drums kit to the computer which was at some distance. I was worried that the length would result in a lot of latency, but I was positively surprised when there was even less latency than my previous 3 feet cable in this 16 feet cable. It looks premium, feels durable, and most important of all, it's more functional than expected. I would recommend this for all musicians who need to connect midi instruments to their computers and get minimum latency."
5,Very good product. I ordered and got timely. Used to connect my 'Yamaha PSR I-425' midi to Image Line (FL Studio). Had to download driver from yamaha site. and it works perfect. strongly recommended.
5,## I purchased this cable only to connect HP Printer with my Laptop. So I couldn't test he transfer speeds.## I bought it for Rs. 749BOX CONTENTS:1. USB CableBUILT QUALITY:1. Soft rubber insulated cable.2. Quality of the rubber coating is good but I feel rough users need to handle it with care.3. Connectors are Gold plated & that gives the product a premium looks.4. The joint between the cable and connector is well shielded.
5,"This is a very good Cable. The covering is so good and it also works perfectly.I bought it for my keyboard and soon realized that i already have the same cable used in my printer. Also the next day i remembered that my aurdino also has the same cable, so now this is just a back up. So do check before ordering"
5,1. Connected my HP 4535 wireless printer to desktop.2. Cable is strong and of good quality.3. Print speed is not affected and there is no need to Install anything new.4. It's plug and play. Plug in the cable and start printing right away.It's worth the money.
5,"Hey guys I just tried this product it's simply awesome üíò and good enough for your midi composing....  I have YouTube channel (V V MUSICAL) I just trying some keyboard covers so 26/3/2019 CSK dedication video on using this midi cable to clear digital sound recording to my psr e363 to my laptop just simple try only all the sound captured very well if you want listen then grb your headphones to watch... Don't think about much more (video) but it's helpful for you take your own time to look, I just tried to this midi cables works only so I hope you understand guys simply go for it your home studio composing to next level üî• sound recording....I will also do in my future keyboard cover to another studio quality records....Thank you so much Amazon for this product.."
5,"So glad I found this. I'd been buying cheap Chinese cables for a while to use with my audio interface, a Roland Quad Capture. Some of them wouldn't even turn on the interface while others would drop out intermittently. This got to a point where I was concerned that the problem was with my interface. I decided to give this a try and it's been almost a week with absolutely no problems so far. I can knock the cable around and it doesn't disconnect. Maybe a little pricey but totally worth it for me since I'd been buying a s***ty cable every other week or so anyway."
5,"When it‚Äôs amazonBasics , you need not worry. There would be reviews with 1 stars. But those would be purely coincidence . You can blindly trust the product. Build quality is good. The hubs are gold-plated. You can definitely buy them fromHere . Though the price is certainly higher from other companies . You can go for either terabyte or this."
2,This would be the last amazon basics cable for me. The cable quality is really poor compared to the high price tag. It have good quality connector at both end but fun factor is that cable quality is really cheap.I also have the same experience with amazon basics Jumber Cable
5,"I had purchased similar cable from the local shop and although it was cheaper, the quality was bad. The connector of local cable did not fit properly and hence the USB connection had issues.But, this cable had no such problems. The end USB connectors were of good quality and the USB connection once established worked seamlessly."
5,"Love this thing, it allows me to hook up my laptop to my printer and print from my bed without getting up and having to do so from my desk.  Seems very well made, have been using it regularly for the last couple of months and it is holding up fine so far."
5,"I use this product to connect my Zoom G5n Guitar Effects Pedal to my laptop. I have other cables which gave me trouble, literally nighmares, but I thought I would gamble once more to see if this one works.Happy to say, it works like a charm.From the quality perspective its really good, sturdy and indeed the value for money."
5,"I ordered this for connecting my BOSS Katana 50 guitar amplifier with my laptop. So far, there's no issues at all. The wire seems very durable and the ports are connecting very well to the devices."
4,"Great cable, just seems a little softer than other cables but it isn‚Äôt causing any problems, it is working fine and the length specified is correct.Please like the review if you found it helpful:)"
5,I used this cable for my Canon LBP900 printer. Looks sturdy enough. Will have to use for sometime and verify whether it is durable or not. But by the looks of it you can say that it has value for money.
5,I bought it for Alesis V-Drum. Although it's 5mtr in size..It provides Extreme Low Latency. It's even better than company-provided 1mtr cable.& It works Flawlessly with Usb-Powered Midi Keyboards to..  With No Latency.
5,Very decent product I got it in high price amazon.Now this is 200 less. üòíSound quality awsome.Enough long for stage.Home recording .No delay at all. Drivers connect very well
5,"Awesome product by amazon , I use it for my printer where I have to unplug and plug back the wire 2 times a day , working flawlessly since 3-4 months , the original cable provided by canon lasted fr 8 months which was good considering frequent movement of cables that I do everyday , this product is working flawlessly , I also used TERABYTE cables they lasted 15 days each i used 2 pieces , SO go for amazon basic cable domt go for terabyte cable"
1,So much disappointed with this cable as it became so loose within just few uses and not at all worth for the price paid‚Ä¶ really not expected this with amazon brand product !!
5,"Very good quality cable. I connected it to Yamaha Music Keyboard, as alternate to old style MIDI cable."
5,"Before i purchase Amazon basic cable for printer, i purchased 3 different company's like Terabyte,  Multybyte etc but none of the cable supports  and connect my HP 1020 Plus printer finally i decided to go for Amazon basic cable i is amazing and connects as good as default cable comes with printer. Thanks Amazon Basic"
5,Amazonbasics products are very good and reasonably priced. Works as intended .. Using it to connect my laptop to the Marantz amp USB-DAC port for audio.
5,The rubberized feel and the sturdy design is what I expected and Amazon delivered that. The connectors work great with my Yamaha keyboard. Infact the connectors are gold plated and really strong. At first when connectors seem to be loose but then I found out it is perfect works like a charms.
5,"My friend advised me to buy amazon cables only. And yes, they are very good, happy with purchase and will buy more of different types."
5,Excellent quality cable overall but USB A side might feel like loosely connected.
5,Working good for me thanks Amazon ..it's received with good quality packaging and working perfect for my keyboard Casio ctk : 7300 in ...thanks Amazon üëç
5,"Amazon Basics product always have a great quality. They might be a little expensive than cheap knock offs but it is worth investing. This cable is great, does its job perfect and I am really happy with its Quality."
5,Nice sturdy durable long cable for connecting my laptop to a printer or my laptop to my Casio musical instrument keyboard.
4,It is a printer cable I bought to connect from PC to Casio Music Keyboard as a MIDI cable. It works for me.
5,"I'm using this cable to connect my Casio CTX 870 IN to computer for FL Studio and Cake Walk. It works perfectly even at 16 ft length. Previously purchased another low quality cable, but it didn't work.Thank you amazon basics. Great cable."
5,"It is a sturdy, well-made cable offering reliable performance."
5,In my Office we are using this cable in Hp Printer and the performance is very satisfactory.
1,I am big fan of Amazon Basic Wires but this one disappointed me as it's very slim. Looks like won't last more than an year even .
5,AmazonBasics always comes with surprise. I am now become fan of AmazonBasics. This is also great product the quality is really great. I suggest this product. Don't think much and go for this product.
5,"WORTH THE MONEY PAID, NO ISSUE FOR PRINTING. PRINTER CONNECTS IMMEDIATELY"
5,HiIt's nice amazon basic usb cable for laser printer
5,EASY TO USE.WORKS FOR HP PRINTER.
5,Used it to connect my alesis drum kit to the laptop. Works well and is good for recording.
5,Bought it to connect my Blue Snowball Microphone. The cable is long and sturdy. Works really well.
5,Another good Product from amazon is so good. Go for it
5,Amazing Scanner
5,Good
5,Works perfectly fine. I used it on a project I was building in python and was able to get it to work.The program provided works only for windows. You'll have to look for separate libraries in GIThub.
1,THIS PRODUCT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE RASPBERRY PIE. It is compatible with the Arduino platform. Don't get fooled
5,Good product. Totally working. Older model.
5,Super
1,Fingerprint sensor did not work. I thought this was a cheaper. Turns out they gave a low quality product.  My first total loss of money on Amazon
5,Awesome stuff. Easy to use
5,Good one but mentioning is better that it will work good at 3.3v only
4,Very nice quality product. Helped me to complete my project.
1,This cartridge is faulty. Gives very bad printouts. Drum is definitely worn out. Go for anything other than this brand.
4,Overall good finishing and print quality also satisfactory.
4,I have like your product print quality is very good
5,Good
2,UPDATEThe converter works for CAT control when the Rx and Tx lines were interchanged .. use a adapter inbetween this and radio to cross the rx tx lines
1,Unfortunately it's nit working for me and there is no return and refund.
5,Compare to other cables...it's good fr rs232 communication... good material
5,I am used sinumerik type cnc machine .it is working nice.
1,Not working
2,"A month after receiving the wireless keyboard, the switch on the keyboard has started malfunctioning. The keyboard now works very erratically.I am unable to carry it the very long distance to the Logitech service centre in Andheri-East as I have a spinal fracture. So, to me this product has been a write off of the money spent. Logitech should not incorporate the switch on the keyboard. It is a component that is most likely to malfunction on switching it on and off every day. Can Amazon help me with a replacement?"
1,"KEY BOARD PARTIALLY STOPPED WORKING IN 15 DAYS... MANY OF THE KEYS ARE NOT WORKING ONLY MOUSE IS WORKING , WORST EXPERIENCE FOR ME AS SERVICE CENTRE IS 40KMS FROM MY PLACE NERUL TO GOREGAON ... SO FOR ME ITS LIKE AFTER GOING WITH BEST AVAILABLE KEYBOARD COMBO IM LEFT WITH MOUSE ONLY CAUSE ITS NOT PRACTICALY POSSIBLE TO GO 40KMS IN MUMBAI JUST FOR KEYBOARD ..."
5,"Great product.Pros1. On off switch on keyboard and mouse2. Caps lock indicator3. Shortcut keys like calculator sound etc4. Nano receiver5. Compartment inside mouse to hold nano receiver.6. Spill resistant,  has pockets beneath so that water that enters can drain out easily.7.Keys need very soft touch.Cons ( Not a big issue though)1. No num lock indicator2. Mouse slightly small than averageGo for it.Nice product. I got for 1499 in lightning deal."
5,"This is actually a keyboard which one longs for. Smooth and silent typing, perfect in size. Spill proof feature and the extra key rows on top are the best part of it. The keays are placed in a flat tray which has few small wholes under it to drain out the liquid, if accidentally some falls on the keyboard. Top key rows idea includes some dedicated keys for shut down, calculator, media keys etc.The mouse clicks are also very smooth and silent with an on/off button just like the keyboard, though its a bit small in size as compared to other normal sized mice. But, I think, its not a big issue, as you will get accustomed to it in a day or two.Lagfree connection and steady performance will surely win you heart very soon.Overall, a great combo. Just go for it."
1,"Clearly, there was a clarification that this is a Logitech UNIFYING technology. The reality was that it was not. The biggest problem is that it does not allow me to return the product. Only an exchange. I do not want this product since it does not have the Unifying feature. I still do not know know to return this product and I am struggling, as of now. This is a highly overpriced product."
1,"The Ordered product is different from the received one. We ordered key board with mouse, along with battries. ""Logitech MK270r Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo for Windows, 2.4 GHz Wireless, Compact Wireles...."". And the amazon standard packaging is aslo not there. We received simply the logitech cartoon normal taped on the both the ends, resulted broken keys in this wrong product. suggestion to the seller and the amazon, Please try to improve these. I have returned to replace the same ordereded product. let me see what they are going to send."
4,"Before saying anything, here is the list of pros and cons:Pros:1. Build Quality, Looks sturdy, and premium.2. Keyboard's keys are soft to press, good for typing.3. The range is great (About 6-7 feet in my case).4. KB and Mouse both have On/Off Key.5. The keyboard has a Caps Lock Indicator.6. The mouse has an invisible optical sensor that means more battery life.Cons:1. The mouse is so small if you compare it with other brands like Dell, HP, Lenovo2. The price is a little high.3. Battery compartment cover on KB and mouse are a little bit loose.(But it's not like they will open by themself. Not a deal-breaker)So the overall package is good and you can definitely buy it. Just remember that the mouse size is a little smaller than the regular one. So if you have a big palm like me, you have to adjust to it but you will get used to of it."
4,"I wanted a full size keyboard to carry in my laptop bag. Most compact keyboards have the layout like laptops i.e. mini arrow keys and cornered page up/down keys, which is illogical because who would buy a separate keyboard which is EXACTLY the same as the laptop's keyboard?Hence I bought this Logitech one which was at a discount in a lightning deal. The keyboard buttons are super smooth, once you press a key gently there is no friction and the key will be pressed all the way down, typing is so much fun with it. Although it is a full size keyboard, it is still a little say 10% smaller than a normal PC keyboard, hence I can easily fit it in my laptop bag.Both the mouse and keyboard use a common nano receiver, earlier I had a wireless Dell mouse and I didn't want to insert two separate usb receivers for both keyboard and mouse, this logitech combo serves that purpose perfectly.There are batteries provided in both of these but they are normal AA ones, I replaced them will Duracell AA cell immediately on unboxing.NOTE: I ALMOST RETURNED this product because I COULDN'T FIND the nano receiver initially. It was supposed to be inside the mouse, near the battery but it wasn't there, the receiver was inserted inside a corner piece of the cardboard outer box, there is no indication on the box where to find it, luckily I found it before I clicked on the final return button."
1,"I'm unable to write much about the product because I received it broken. Out of the box, One key on the keyboard was out. Clearly the packaging and handling was the issue.It wasn't packed in an Amazon package. The box was just wrapped with plastic wrap. I could see the impressions of keys on the plastic cover of keyboard. It must have been under other heavy stuff. I'm returning this!Giving 1 star because of the pathetic packaging and handling. Otherwise, the product gives a nice first impression. Quick word after 5mins usage- both keyboard and mouse look good and top-row multimedia keys work good for calculator, play/pause, volume etc. 1 con though- the mouse wheel doesn't give a nice feedback, bit greecy."
1,"I opened the package 3 days ago and initially for a few hours the keyboard and mouse worked erratically. The next day the performance became worse, to the extent that I cannot work on the keyboard or mouse at all. While typing on keyboard, the characters appear on the screen after a lag of a few seconds, and then too incomplete.Unfortunately for me, the return window is not open anymore even if I used the product for only 3 days.I used to consider Logitec a premium rand, but now I have lost faith in all Logitec products. Complete waste of money.Complete waste of money"
1,Worst keyboard ever used i thaught logitech is the best productbi can use as iam using a wired logitech mouse for more than 4years i baught it two month back on amazon sale after few days it stoped responding after some time same with the wireless mouse so i asked helpnin amazon so the help and refund returnable was for only 10days so last two days back i went to logitech service and respond is worst they replaced it with new but still am facing the same issue it stops responding after sometime even after changing the batteries
1,"DO NOT BUY this model. It was good initially, but as days progressed, keys have become hard. Only if you hit the keys hard, you will see the letter getting typed on the screen. Support? Warranty? Dont get fooled. Support phone number given in the website says ""Switched Off"". No Support or Warranty at all. Logitech fooled me big time. Ordered two for my office and both are giving me problems."
1,"I purchased this product based on amazon suggestion. Initial product delivery was in damaged condition, so I have requested replacement, they replaced the new one today on 2020-06-17, but all the keys are not functional. I have attached the keyboard test as well to show how many keys are defective.When I buy product on amazon, I trust that amazon delivers best, but this is very disappointing, I expect product should be top notch and in perfect working condition. Hope you will take care of it from the next time."
5,"Though I don't like the curvy design, but the product is working fine. No connectivity issue. Mouse is small for a big palm like me.. at first I purchased Amkette Wireless Keyboard and mouse combo which has all the functions like all the indicators and a big mouse, but the mouse had connectivity issue and I had to return that. This Logitech combo has only Caps lock indicator but is working fine. I'm satisfied with this purchase."
5,This is a very nice combo of wireless keyboard and mouse I ordered it from Amazon a few months ago and I am loving it.  Keyboard are nice and soft you will feel like that you are typing on a Laptop. The keys are very comfortable to use. The mouse is perfect with  Nice respond to the commandBoth On and off buttons are provided on both the keyboard and about and they work immediately after turning them on.There is no delay in the commands.  Go to keyboard and the mouse are active and fast to respond I love this product thanks Logitech for creating such an amazing  Logitech for creating such an amazing home comboü•∞
1,"It looks good, easy to carry and sturdy... But all that is worthless if the connection to the computer (or any other device) is bad....The dongle must be in line of sight for the mouse and the keyboard, else you experience a serious amount of lag. I ve tried changing the batteries to new ones and the problem still existsThis is what disappoints me..."
1,"Does not type Upper Case K, P, D, & many letters. To type P we have to first type lowercase p and then replace that with uppercase P. Strange errors. Even after updating the software it wont become better. Updating is very difficult. The update software does not recognize that it is connected, even though it is connected. Strange keyboard of low quality. Local firms produce keyboards at cheaper price & of better quality."
1,"After Missing the USB Chord on 1st order, when I replace, it is found that the arrow key of the keyboard is displaced to very far near 'A' button without unsealed the keyboard . Do you think it will ask for a rating ?"
5,- Soft keys press like butter- long battery backup 2 years for the keyboard and 8 months for mouse daily usage 8-9 hours except for sunday I'm using the same set of the keyboard since 2014 it's my next purchase.- No lag in connectivity also you can use when you connect your television operate from sofa :)- Robust build but bit cheap plastic compare to 2014 purchased model- If you want to use for office or home this one is perfect- The mouse is very handy medium size not too big or smallI'm rating this 8.5 out of 10
1,"Logitech mk270r wireless keyboard mouse comboBought with very high expectations.1. The packaging was damaged as gou can see in image i attached.2. package seems to be already opened, batteries were already installed. One extra AA Battery installed in the mouse (not mentioned in package)3. mouse was already in ON mode with Aa battery installed.4. LEFT CTRL key was in the package  instead of being on the KB.5. ENTER key on the number pad is placed in reverse as  seen in image6. one battery installed in KB with other one and KB battery Cover lying loose in the package.7. The indicators in KB (caps lock), and mouse does not seem to light up.8. The USB RECEIVER missing from its place inside the mouse. so couldn't check whether working or not.didn't expect this from amazon. could have got the same from reliance digital delivered at almost the same price from the nearest outlet.Anyways applied for a replacement (as the product seems to be non returnable. shall update my review after i get the replacement."
1,"Decided to return the product within few minutes of receiving it, for the following reasons.1. Both keyboard and mouse were very noisy..just can't bear the taka taka noise. Not only disturbs my concentration but I do a lot of Skype meetings in WFH mode and its extremely annoying for the paticipants on other side. 2. The pictures are bit deceptive, both mouse and keyboard are small. Keyboard width is ok, but the height is too small and I felt uncomfortable to use it. Prior to this I was using Dell KM 113, soft and no noise, working fine since Jan 2016, it has extra space at the bottom row of ky to rest hands comfortably, just that i needed extra USB slot for separate mouse, hence ordered this combo set.3. Mouse came defective ot of the box, light was not working.4. This feedback for Amazon seller, they sent me the item in a huge cartoon, which could easily fit a 32"" TV or 20-30 keyboard sets, see pic. Not sure what was the reason for such a huge cartoon, waste of resources and extra burden on ligistics."
2,Buy this wireless keyboard ONLY if you are just going to use it for basic use.NEVER for any sort of gaming. Keyboard and Mouse both lags on high CPU usage or game frame rates.there is no refund only useless replacement for this.I went back to my wired keyboard and mouse within one day. This is now packed back into the box...I will probably sell it for a loss on olx...
1,"After 4 months of infrequent use, the spring under some of the keys broke down. The product boasts of warranty of three years but it wont last even 6 months. The service centre at Gurgaon doesn't have the replacement ready. It takes nearly 10-15 days to get a new replacement. Till that time, sit tight and enjoy becuase you bought logitech product. Please avoid !!"
3,"Review after 5 months of usageThe Good:The keyboard is good, strongly built, easily goes for years.It has all the keys you need, keys for volume control are really handy for me same with home, end button which are missing in my laptop.Works with Mac - Im able to use windows button as command key for (apple) mac, the Alt key as option key.It has caps lock indicator (light) which is helpful while typing the passwords.Not so good:However the keys bit hard especially when you are trying to type fast, you need to make sure that the keys are fully pressed down, otherwise some of the key may not be registered. The hard keys issue specifically happens when your finger touches the edge of the key - the key get kind of stuck between the adjacent keys. Its difficult to ensure that the fingers touch exactly in the middle of the key, its really annoying. This is happening more with windows key which Im using as command keyIf you want to really soft keyboard this may not be the option."
1,"Sometimes mouse and keyboard does not work, not expected from a company like Logitech"
5,"Even though this is not meant for Gaming, I have ended up using it. I thought we use a wireless PS4 controller so why not this. I also have a ReadGear Gaming Keyboard + Mouse combo and its started giving me issue in a year of gaming. I had to replace my ReadGear set with LG G102 Gamin Mouse and HP Gaming Keyboard K500F.This in comparison is working really well. All the Keys work fine, there are no misfires.. Its excellent. O have noticed some signal issues, for this I just make sure that the radio is connected on either side of the laptop (Not on one of the back USB Connectors)."
5,"Being a combo pack, don't expect a high quality product especially mouse.Keyboard build looks sturdy and when we type, we get some typing sound which is satisfying (this is subjective).Caps lock indicator works fine. On/off button works fine.Once I received product, I checked online if my keys are working fyn or not :D and everything is fine.Coming to Mouse, it appears with decent build quality(saying this because I have used lenovo 300(this is of solid build) earlier, on comparing logitech's mouse with Lenovo's, I observed it.).Battery, on/off button works fine. Mouse's precision is accurate and there's no lag.(even though if there's any lag, we can tweak the mouse settings).It was mentioned that battery life for keyboard is 36months and of mouse is 18months.When u turn it off while u r not using, expected battery life can be attained.Main reason I purchased this one is, I used Logitech K120 earlier, referring to its build quality, I got this one. And I needed 3 yrs warranty and good battery life with on/off buttons on both.Point to be noted : this is not a compact product. This one is a standard keyboard with all keys. So don't expect to carry it everywhere. If u need a compact one, u can go with portronics."
1,"After a firtnightly usage, with a sluggish and lagging Logitech MK270R keyboard and Mouse combo, I have thrown the KB and mouse into the dustbin. Such a badly designed product. It just literally slows down a 8 GB PC with ample storage space. Wireless connectivity to internet is getting slowed down. If I disconnect the KB and mouse from the computer, the net works normal and the mouse and keyboard  typing actions is taking ages to show up on the screen. I updated all the drivers including Logitech SPOT app. But to my dismay it has tested my patience prompting me to use the old PS/2 KB  and Moouse which are wired and work without any issues. Please don't buy this product."
5,"Great product from Logitech. Always recommend.High-quality product and is very durable, great precision.The mouse is Invisible Optic.I do both coding and gaming using this and surprisingly has a long battery life.Haven't changed the battery since purchase (before 4 months).Good for daily usage.Amazon delivery was great and arrived before the expected date."
1,"The product I got seems to be defective. The keys a wobbly, once you are typing, there is a lag.The product when I received was in a damaged package, when asked to the delivery, told he cannotdo anything about it. While typing the keys are getting missed.Not a product that I was expecting to be so cheap."
1,The keyboard and mouse stop and start functioning on a random basis.When actively typing the keyboard just freezes up or the unifying receiver stop responding and the keystrokes are completely lost.  This is a major issue when typing passwords. The same happens with the mouse pointer. The mouse pointer is jumpy or completely unresponsive and one ends up clicking unwanted things which becomes a waste of time. Contacting the logitech service center is also a complete waste of time. Think 2ice before buying it even though there might be offers on it.
1,"Within a month of use, the keys become loose and sometimes presses down on its own. With limited Service Centres (Ensure Services) and ""Great Than Thou"" attitude of Service Centre staff and Amazon ""apologetically refusing"" to do any help, I have decided to make it run as long as it dones and then buy a new one. Seems like few others buyers are facing the same issue. Anyway travelling to a service centre will cost as much as buying a new one."
4,"I'm using this for 3 days only so its a quick review.Keyboard :Overall size is adequate for usage. Key sizes are a bit shorter than a regular wired keyboard of HP or Dell is what I felt bcos of which keys are going to next key than intended. Keys are noisy while typing, sounds like a less than 500 Rs unbranded keyboard which is not good for the brand.No comments on lag or range while typingMouse : I was using MK331 Silent mouse earlier, compared to that Smaller in size, and the feel is not good also click sounds are noisy. But this is not a silent mouse so accepted. I saw a bit of lag not sure whether this is bcos of something else.Overall this is budget pack.if you can extend a bit more go for MK345 combo, it claims quiet keyboard and the mouse looks like MK331 silent mouse but nowhere its is mentioned as M331 in the site."
4,"I was actually pleasantly surprised how sturdy, robust and convenient this keyboard and mouse combo turned out to be.Pros:1. The keys are remarkably silent compared to many other keyboards2. The keys size and shape is sturdy and even the print is good which makes it super easy to operate3. Mouse is handy, small enough, big enough which makes it very friendly and reduces the chances of getting RSI4. Both keyboard and mouse have on/off toggle switches which is saving battery a lot and they last longer5. Indicator for CAPS lock comes handyCONS1. There are no indicators for Num Lock and Scroll Lock2. There is no indicator for battery levelOverallGreat value for money, if above indicators are added and keys are made slightly more silent, it will earn 5 stars on any day"
1,I have has very bad experience with the warranty section of Logitech. I talked to the number given. First you to have to keep on trying. Secondly it when you reach them and explain to them the problem faced by you then they refer you to another number which they call it as Service Centre. If that is what they wanted to do then  why not give the Service Centre number then the other number. They just do not want to avoid servicing under warranty. I have been regularly been their customer for last more than 10 years. I am facing teh same prob lem of right c lic k being not working after ab t 8 to 9 months. This I faced it earlier but did not take it up. I am very diappointed.
3,"No complaint from product, it is designed to satisfy. Great build quality and trust of Logitech.2 stars reduced for packaging. Keyboard was in box it's ok, it was protected. But mouse was randomly laying in polybag pack of Amazon. Atleast a bubble wrap or some recyclable cardboard could have been used to protect it from shock.P.S. I am a environmentalist and I hate too much packing and wasting resources but certain things cannot be avoided."
5,"My first impressions are its a Fantastic product for the price. Can't expect better than this. Excellent packaging. Superfast delivery. Keys of keyboard are soft and layout is spacious enough. Mouse is sleek and cute. Had thought it was overpriced when ordering the item but now Delighted to be using it. If price is not an issue, Go for it without hesitation."
2,This is the worst keyboard I have used. There is a flex in keyboard whenever I type keys from the middle of keyboard and it causes springy noise. The springy noise is very irritating. I will buy another keyboard mouse combo from different brand.Review update: Adding one more star since I can avoid flex in the middle and springy noise by adding rubber stopper under the middle of the keyboard.
5,"excellent product, i should have ordered this in first attempt instead of ordering MK235. anyway i did good by ordering this product. I always trust Appario  and blindly orders anything from them.Pros:1. soft and quick responsive as wired keyboard I was using -keyboard& mouse2. ergonomic keyboard , but mouse you have to adjust if you were using bigger one previously.3. nice keyboard shortcuts if you really wanna use or having any habit using them.-for me i don't remember having them on my keyboard, but it takes some time to get habituated4. silent as per my requirement , don't compare with really silent ones.cons:mouse ergonomics are actually good, but me having bigger hand, really felling much pain at wrist base.I don't really suggest this for extensive gaming, may be okay with casual gaming.overall this is after 24 hrs use and will update if anything I see in future.Adios amigo."
1,"Purchased the Logitech MK270R Full Size Wireless combo Keyboard and Mouse a few days back.  My old Microsoft Keyboard stopped working, but, Mouse is still going strong.  It was the Microsoft 800.  Dont even remember when I purchased them - it was that long.This product has a design flaw.  The Wireless Dongle which we insert into the computer or USB Hub has a very very short range.  And it has to be in the line of sight of the keyboard and mouse.  The first one I got, developed the problem the first day itself.  Waited for two more days, and as the problem seem to get worse, ordered for a replacement, assuming the particular piece was defective.Replacement arrived just now.  Exact same problem in the replacement pieces too.  The Dongles seem to be the problem.  They mouse and keyboard are working fine for a few minutes and suddenly stop responding.  If I wave the keyboard or bring it like real close to the dongle, it starts to work.  Exact same problem with the mouse.  It works when it as a distance of only 1.5 feet from the dongle.  Thankfully, could request for a refund, which I hope to get by tomorrow, as per message received.Going back to a Microsoft Wireless Combo, even if it costs much more."
1,"When you press N, it shows bn on the screen.& when you press Shift+N it shows BNNNNNN on the screen.Very bad keyboard"
3,"I had to return this due to a confusing keyboard layout.Number line right below the function keys had the numbers and special characters printed differently.Semicolon key also had the same issue.If you press Shift key to get the upper lined characters, you would actually get the lower ones.Seller should have done a quality check before sending this."
5,"Wow , was the first thing that my heart and mind felt, the moment I held the keyboard in my hand. To be very honest , keeping in consideration the selling price the product s as they say "" the value of money"" . And when I started using it for the first time , Yes , Amazon s amazing... The customer service attitude in all aspects whether that s quality of the products Amazon sells is wonderfully flawless ... and in case we sometimes return products Amazon had always been honest ...Thank you"
5,"*Palm rest , laptop Like keys,great typing experience .*In this price bracket ,there are so many options available from well established brands ,like zebronics,iball,intex etc etc .So I was sceptical about this brand ,Zinq.But i choose this product because of two major reasons  :Keys layout looks almost like a laptop keyboard .The palm rest ,which is only available in the keyboards of price 10x higher than this .After the purchase :Keys are super tactile and smooth ,too sensitive for my liking ,it will take some time to get use to it .USB port and wire are of good quality .Overall it's a great product so far . Value for money ."
4,"Lightweight keyboard. Received a good fully working product, thank you Amazon.The keys have a bit rubbery & bouncy feeling, and I found it a little uncomfortable to do fast typing with this keyboard ... after some time I am getting a discomfort on the fingertips ,,, I am taking some time to get used to the new kind of key feeedback on my fingertips.But it is a value-for-money product, not meant for the pros. You cannot expect TVS Gold - type key feedback for this price."

4,"Purchased two of these keyboards , and found them useful. There is one thing which I did not like and wanted to provide you all an update is that the keys are little bit slow for fast typing . When I try to type fast , the realise that the key which was pressed earlier has not come back yet or does not have too much pressure for second time typing within a fraction of seconds. I still feel this is a very good keyboard in the given price range. What could be improved is the key response time , the key should come back faster after typing a character on the keyboard. So finally I would like to say that this keyboard is not for professional or gaming purpose , however it is very much useful for regular browsing , sure ring and online classes. The build quality is good and the keyboard does not slip while working."
1,This keyboard+mouse combo has not lasted even for a month. Mouse has lost its sensitivity and the scroll has become completely unpredictable. Keyboard is also poor but the mouse undoubtedly leads the competition.Keyboard has the unique ability to type a character multiple times while the key is pressed only once. So entering a password at any website is the most challenging task.I am fed up with this typing adventure so I just plugged my old keyboard & mouse back to the PC to share this critic.Please use your money wisely and buy some longer lasting & reliable product.
5,"I have bought this for working from home. Since it is just a keyboard, I didn't do much research, the only research I have done was to find an Indian made product. Unfortunately, Indian made keyboards are very rare, so ended up buying this Chinese made product. Anyways, I am happy. The keys are smooth. The font is stylish. Could have avoided labeling the brand name in the space-bar."
1,The keyboard is very hard and the keys don't work if you are used to pressing them the normal way. The only way to use the keyboard is if you can hit the keys hard like old type writers. Very uncomfortable and almost useless.The mouse is of very cheap quality. The scroll button the middle doesn't work half the time and sometimes scrolls in opposite direction. Mouse buttons are very hard too.
2,"Both keyboard and mouse are noisy. Both miss keystrokes and mouse move about 1 of 5 times. This makes it difficult at times to pin point and click with mouse as it needs few extra moves to adjust. I still do not know how to use the rupee symbol as it does not have ""Alt Gr"". Maybe it needs some settings."
1,"Some of the keys of the keyboard were not working and some of the keys were repeating automatically.I was pressing once and it was typing 4-5 times. Very annoying experience.Although it wasted my time and spoilt my mood, but thanks to Amazon that it refunded me in full."
2,"Keyboard is ultrasensitive. A single key depression results in multiple characters being typed out. Not for typing purpose at all. Speed typing not possible as for every character (forget word), one needs to keep a close eye and keep correcting with backspaces and Delete button"
5,"Combo is nice, only one thing missing in the keyboard is palm rest, but considering its price it's good enough for smooth and silent typing. Decent mouse. Really love using it."
1,"Useless product. I bought it on 10/01. But it is not working from yesterday, 10/19. Worked only for like 15 days. I want replacement. I dint even use it much."
2,The keyboard is actually veey good and light weight and good to use. But when I was using it I realised there was a hole to the edge of the keyboard and found it was actually broken. So I returned it asking for a replacement. I received my replacement in 2 days and I was astonished to first see that it was the same box that I sent as I remember a small tear in the box. When I opened it there was a keyboard inside that was further broken. I can't say if it was the same keyboard or another one but how can you send a highly damaged keyboard?
5,"Value for money product, this keyboard is lightweight, easy to type, but not suitable for gaming, 5 star for this keyboard"
3,Can‚Äôt expect more from a keyboard at this price .. solves the purpose and has been performing well after 3 months of usage..The drawback however is that the key layout is old style closely stacked without the gaps between the keys which sometimes results in typing errors
3,"ü§óü§™A Good Product with no defects or malfunctioning keys, all is wellü•∞ü§ëüòÄüòùLightweight & Textured finish hence helpful in being Dirt & Dust Repellent. ü§£üòÅüòéü§©Delivered on time by Amazon. Hats off to the seller Appario, Bangalore. ü§°ü§ì"
1,I purchase keyboad on 30/november/2020Not working date :  09/march/2021Today date  14/april/2021I using only 3 month now not working  waste of moneySome keys are automatically  visible with continuously.My advice do not buy this productThe keyboad through it on dustbinWaste of money
5,"Comfortable keyboard keys, Just as new design keys. Mouse also so comfortable within hands. Click & scrolling is better than any other same range mouses. Don't need to think twice... Just Buy it. ‚ù§Ô∏è I bought these combo item in ‚Çπ469 INR only in ( Deal of the Day sell ). Delivery is also superb. Also, Amazon always deliver his best.Thanks Amazon ‚óâ‚Äø‚óâ"
5,I had very low expectations at this price point but this keyboard blew me away. This is literally one of the best feeling membrane keyboard that i have ever used
3,"Product is good. Light weight, comfortable keys. But giving 3 stars because of seller. Seller has sent the damaged piece. This is not damaged during transportation as I couldn't find the broken pieces in the box. This product doesn't have return policy. It has only replace policy. I needed this urgently. So forced to use the damaged piece."
1,"Bought this keyboard two months ago. within one month it started to work wierdly. pressing 's' would bring 'cs', right arrow works as backspace, space getting stuck randomly. a lot of stuff. really bad choice. I regret it."
5,ZINQ is net level technology. Its accessories is top class . Keys are very comfortable  like TVS keyboards.
4,Does it job without any issue.Good for the price so go for it.
5,Probably best in this range.. smooth keys and lightweight.. good value for money product.. big in size though..
5,"The key are smooth.Very good for light gaming, and typing in this keyboard is very much satisfying.If the budget too low, go for it."
5,Thnx amazon.in for such nice product delivered within 24 hours of bookingMony worthüëåüèª‚úåüòä
1,Worst product. The new one received n later found the Function keys are not working. It was my bad the return timeline was over n need to deal with such defective product. Did not expect such miss from quality by Amazon.
5,"It's a wonderful Combo in this price range 469/- rs , keyboard keys are very comfortable, keyboard is light weight & thin, best for this price range, You can blindly purchase it.!!"
5,I loved those keys and mouse is buttery smooth...In old reviews it may be bad but now they all had changed themselves and now they are sending a quality product at low budget...It satisfied my budget...
5,"Keyboard is light.All keys work, including function keys. Been using for 3 weeks, no issuesThe only con is that It's a little noisyI paid 300 for it-worth the buy."
1,"I purchased in January 2021,in may2021 it's not working, no customer service in Hyderabad, worrest keyboard, friends don't purchase this keyboard"
5,Looks beautiful and stylish in an affordable price. Hope it will work a long
4,"I am writing this review after 2months of usage, Product is in Good condition.I will recommend to buy this product and with lower cost.Don't expect smart look, it will be looking like normal keyboard."
2,Keyboard Quality is above averagebut Mouse is not good
2,Quality wise nice..soft for operating. but better to buy costly branded keyboard. With in 30fays exactly now my keyboard not working.
4,"Keyboard is very nice, light weight and long press keys are impressive.But Num lock and caps lock lights are not visible clearly in day time.Finally value for money."
2,"I had to buy another keyboard, because in this one the backspace was constantly stuck if you didn't press it exactly in the middle, that made me crazy."
4,"Pros :1.Small in size , handy .2.Easy to carry , Overall quality(3.5/5)Cons :1.Buttons are tough ( Will become smooth after long usage hours ).2.Usb port is rough to use"
4,"It's very light weight keyboard and not for professional. The beginner can use this for their small work. The keys are not smooth. Wire length is sufficient for use.The seller send it with no packaging, it delivered with its original box. I get this ‚Çπ315."
5,Button pressed easily
1,"As I Unboxed This ZEB-KM2100, I Found That It Is Made of Plastic That Is Not Durable. A Small Force Applied At Its Ends  Tends It To Bend. Strong Force Is Sure To Break It.Okay, I Understand That I Should Not Expect Durability For The Price I Paid - ‚Çπ290.Its Keys Are Soft. It Is Light Weighted. It Worked Fine For 10 Days. 11 Day, Its 'Soft Keys' Became So Delicate That On Single Keypress, It Types Same Letter Twice (As Shown).Don't Buy It Seeing Its Price, You'll Be Disappointed. Go For Other Reputed Companies Like Dell.If You Doubt My Review (Including Screen Capture), Ignore And Go Ahead Buying It - Happy Buying :)"
1,The keys stop working and don't respond for few minutes. For 5-6 days the keyboard worked very well... But now i m facing such problems. Unsatisfied with this product üôÅüôÅüò†
5,"Review after 1.5 months, this keyboard is awesome, because you can use a new keyboard at such low price, although i bet it wouldn't last more than 6 months of rugged use, but it will run fine till 6-8 months of rugged use, mine came broken (just a little bit of corner), so did everyone else get a broken keyboard nonetheless it's great, it's a great substitute for those ‚Çπ600 dell keyboards which are sturdy(if you can't afford one like me). This keyboard will easily last more than one year on normal use. It's extremely lightweight, compact. Smells like all those other cheap Chinese toys and gadgets do from inside when it's new, the keys are flimsy and after few months of usage you would have to press extremely hard on the keys for it to work. The keys are of extremely cheap quality kept in a socket, but works great, no locking mechanism but keys won't fall off. Overall an excellent keyboard replacement. Works for me I don't know if it works for others or not, don't expect fast inputs from this keyboard, this keyboard even takes about few seconds to connect, so not for gaming obviously."
1,The worst product I have ever seen on amazon. Keyboard was broken at corner. Worst keyboard. I had never written a bad review like this any time before.
5,"I am a regular user and I loved it!Reasons:1. The major reason to love this product is it makes no noise! It's quiet. I do not like that 'khat-khat' noise when typing. I am an extremely fast typer and the noise would have become unbearble if it made any! Thank god for that! I was looking for exactly this kind of keyboard.2. The overall size is not too small, neither too big! It is just perfect for personal use.3. I am not a gamer but I hope to use the multimedia keys for watching movies etc. If you are buying this for regular use at uome or as a substitute for your laptop keypad, go for it!"
4,"Zebronics keyboard which has 12 multimedia keys, easy access to the music within the keyboard, volume up and down buttons are user friendly. It has a special Rupee key symbol which can be easily accessed, the USB cable is also pretty decent connects easily to any kind of computer and laptops."
3,Pros+Lowest price.+Full function wired keyboard for personal computer and laptops+ Zebranics brand produces good products at affordable prices.Cons15% smaller than a regular keyboard. Space between keys is less.So I face a little bit of discomfort while typing.Built quality is not up to the mark. Don't expect better quality at this price.The packaging is also not secured. In transportation high chances are there for damage.I can't excuse in proper packaging. Amzon must take care of packaging. Particularly in this product.
1,"Budget keyboard with iPhone 6 features.Offers more than expected.Backspace key works only on 'very hard' press, and other keys work only on 'hard press'.Soft Press is like child-lock. No matter which key you press, nothing happens. Tap the beats of your favorite song while staying assured that not a thing will get typed(except 'L'). You could record the sound of key-presses and play it to get a typewriter effect.The 'L' key has feather touch... You type one 'L' once and you get two extra 'L' printed, absolutely free.The spacebar key has a nice upward slope as you slide your finger from left to right end.Compact, budget friendly. The kind you would find in Cyber Cafe.Guess what, its the ""Zindagi ke sath bhi, Zindagi ke baad bhi"" kind... As you CAN NOT RETURN it.Got it 30mins ago, just realized it has a replace-only warranty.Ordered it for WFH, but it turned out to be utter crap.Keys are so densely packed, and they don't work unless you put in an extra effort.It would be a steal deal for people who do all the typing with one finger only.Rs. 350/- wasted.... Willing to sell it off on OLX in 100rs.@Seller: you may take it back for free and sell it again to someone who might need it.#Peace"
1,Received broken keyboard
2,"For me, when this item was delivered, the shipping box seemed all messed up. But that didn't alter my expectations at first.But, this keyboard actually seems like completely old stock inside out. As soon as I took it out of the cover, the left Alt key cap came out üòÇ. Also, the space bar stays pressed. Yes, it is light weight. I did give a replacement request in Amazon, but the keyboard seems to be released a long time ago too. The reason why I'm saying is mainly because of the logo on the Windows Start Key. Microsoft dropped this logo a long time ago with the release of Windows 8. Since then, most of the keyboards which came out feature the new Windows logo on their Start Keys. And all keyboards completely shifted to the new logo with the release of Windows 10. But this one still keeps the old logo. I did notice that the Month and year of import is October 2019 on the box. And I'm writing this review in October itself. That doesn't deter the fact that this might have been released long ago.I bought mine when Amazon was offering this item in a lightning deal of Rs. 209. Anyway, it's hard to expect something more from a keyboard worth Rs. 200. Might have been a good keyboard if the product was fine at least."
1,"Not worth for even a single star, Exactly after 2 weeks of buying it, just found that if we have to move the keyboard frequently then for  a while the keyboard stops working due to some wire problem, the connecting usb wire is too hard and it got cracked at the joint of usb and keyboard , i have done jugaad and applied m-seal at the joints to stop wire from cracking more but all in vain as the portion covered is now ok but after that it started cracking again, the design is such that you keep pressing multiple alphabets simultaneously untill you get used to it ."
1,The quality is very bad and its not even solid like usual keyboards. I tried for return but its been upgraded for replacement. I don't understand why this is happening? You must allow customers to return item and give them full refund.
1,"IF YOU ARE GAMING ,YOU KNOW  U NEED SHIFT AND CTRL KEYS ALWAYS PRESSED EXAMPLE FOR MINECRAFT AND ASSASSINS , BUT THIS KEYBOARD SIMPLY DOESNT SUPPORT IT , FIRST ORDER THOUGHT ITS MANUFACTURER FAULT AND REPLACED RECEIVED SAME TYPE AGAIN , ALSO INSTALLED DRIVER FROM ZEBRONICS SITE NO LUCK , FINALLY APPLIED REFUND AND ORDERED DIFFERENT KEYBOARD FROM DIFFERENT BRAND . ALSO THERE SOME OTHER ISSUE LIKE IF SPACEBAR PRESSED SOMETIMES IN WINDOWS NOTIFICATION BAR POPS AND MINIMIZES EVERYTHING NO MATTER WHAT YOU ARE DOING , SHIFT + W DOESNT STAYS CONTINUES , IF PLAYING ASSASSINS CREED YOUR PLAYER WILL STOP RUN STOP RUN IF SHIFT + W PRESSED , SAME FOR MINECRAFT WITH CTRL + W . DIDNT EXPECTED FROM ZEBRONICS FOR SUCH PATHETIC PRODUCT ."
5,Good working condition and received safe and perfect product on time. Keys are smooth and auto installation made easy to access. Would suggest anyone to buy it.
3,"Keyboard quality is not that great, but okay for this price range. The position of the keys are slightly different from other standard keyboards, for example ""backslash"",""home"", ""end"" and ""enter"" key are wrongly positioned. Keyboard is a bit smaller but it is okay for me as long as the keys are properly positioned. It doesn't have a good grip, so we may have to place something underneath the keyboard if you are using a glass table.Bottom line:This may not be suitable for heavy typing or gaming but should be good enough for normal/light work. This can serve as a replacement keyboard for kid's computer as they tend to break the keyboards on regular basis."
5,"I have been using this keyboard from more than 3 weeks.The keyboard came in a well mannered package.The best thing about the keyboard is, it is small in size and can be handles easily.All the buttons are working properly. The keyboard comes with a usb cable attached to the keyboard. The cable is neither too long nor too short.I have a lot of writing work to do, hence a lot of typing needs to be done and on these days of using the keyboard; I have not found any issues with the keysI had a lot of mixed emotions before buying this keyboard because the number of negative reviews here is more than positive.But the good this is:1) The delivery was on time.2) Keyboard came in a well packed condition.3) Keys are stable working.4) USB cable is working accurately."
2,"Pros-----> Cheap & expendablecons-----> Stiff keys and they get more stiff after usage of just 10 days.> Worse keyboard when it comes to ergonomics> Enter key is a flipped design which means the bigger portion of the Enter key is on the top portion due to this whenever i hit the enter key my pinky lands on the backward slash key which is very annoying> Key top wobbles a lot which means keys will live only for a short period> Last and the most hated thing about this keyboard is its placement of arrow keys, as shown in the image the arrow keys are not aligned properly so definitely you don't feel like using them a lot."
3,"Overall it is a good product if required for non-critical home use.However, It has been only couple of weeks after I purchased this keyboard, , and few  keys have caught moisture. because of which after pressing those keys, they get stuck inside and doesn't release on their own. So Now  I am having hard time while typing important emails.Pros:1. Cheap cost2. Keys are not NOISY at all.3. Matt finish on the surface saves the keys from fingerprints.4. Sleek design.Cons:1. Poor material as the cost is less, and hence may not have long life.2. Not reliable while using it for critical work."
5,"With the mark of Zebronics, purchasers need not have to worrry about a thing! The key board nicely fits to my working table, with its size is a little higher than the keyboard size of laptops. Any adult can easily lift and hold the entire keyboard and operate the keys using just the thumbs. If there is one thing that is highly interesting about this product is its chic design and its ideal size. Not to mention its functionality.  I can race my fingers across the keyboard with ease. If you are looking for a soft touch keying, you will be disappointed, but by using for a few days, you will get used to it. The one feature I dislike in this product is the ""home"" button is given below and the ""end"" button is given above. But, this is not an issue because the same keys can be operated in the rightmost portion of the key board, wherein the home button is above and the end button is below."
2,Keys are not at all good and cannot type fast as the keys are shaky. Took it attach it to my laptop for fast typing but didn't met the purpose.
2,"One of the most entry level keyboards. Extremely flimsy material, and should be handled with great care, else this may not last a month. First item delivered had a faulty 'R' key that needed lot more pressure, and an 'A' key which seemed to be somewhat tight in it's key well compared to most other keys, so in case of fast typing 'A' would be missed 4/10 times and 'R' would be missed 9/10 times. USB cable is very thin and flimsy, but not much worse than the keyboard itself. USB cable is about 1.5-2 feet long, so don't expect to be able type at a distance from the computer case. Ordered a replacement.Updated 13-Mar-2021: Some of the keys have become lot less responsive, i.e. I need to hit them several times or very hard for the entry to be recognized. Also at least 2 keys ('A' and 'R') are such that pressing them ones, leads to frequent multiple entries. Suggest staying away from this keyboard!Note that I bought that to use with few servers behind a KVM switch, which will run mostly headless, so the usage would be very very light. For anything more I'd never buy this keyboard, but spend a bit more money."
1,"I thought it will be a good cheap keyboard. It was cheap but not good. That's the problem it's just too cheap to be of any use. The keyboard is tok light to stay in place, the keys are very bad, typing experience is horrible. The keyboard is so flimsy that it flexes with a simple key press in the middle. Ultimately you get y what you pay for. Font buy this, you will struggle to use it. I couldn't even return the product, apparently I was only getting the option to replace it."
4,Great product at great price. Got within 2 days. Reduced one star because of the quality of usb cable. It's too thin. Else everything great. Go for it
5,"Don't go for high end brand when you have many benefits in this range. Keys are very easy to press. Lightweight ,compact design And have long cable to move easily and freely. Using for past few months. But as it is very light weight because of the body material so Use carefully.No gaming experience"
4,"I got this product for INR299. Price to Perform Ratio is decent.I haven't added any pictures but believe me it's a genuine review after 15days of usage.Pros -1 - The price if the keyboard is quite decent. (INR299)2 - Main pros about this keyboard is it's a Full Size Island keyboard.3 - It has big size Left Shift, Left Enter and Right Shift Button.4 - Button Order and placement is also decent.5 - Keystorke and Response is also decent. (At this price can't expect mechanical or semi mechanical like button response).6 - All Button Works wih Windows 10. All multimedia buttons also works.Cons -1 - Weight is not that high. (Don't get me wrong about the sturdyness of the Keyboard.)2 - Doesn't have Palm rest.3 - Cable quality is not that high. *Feels cheap to me.4 - Power consumption is also good on laptop.Let me tell you if you're a fast typer or if you have work which needs fast typing then this is not for you. This keyboard is for general usage and for general people. The price on which i got this keyboard is good. Can't expect much.I hope I answered your queries. :)"
5,"Had received a faulty product. The keys were so soft that one touch would result in multiple entries of fame alphabet. Requested for replacement and got a new piece the next morning itself. The new keyboard is working fine now. Five star for product, 1 star for quality check procedure of the seller, five star to seller for quick response and replacement action"
1,"I've been using computer peripherals keyboards since the year 2000 and this is the worst one I had the misfortune to buy.It has been only a month and the keys gave up. Ctrl, Alt and Num lock keys stopped working altogether. Rest of the keys needs to be wrestled with a million times before giving any sound character outpit."
1,"This is the worst keyboard ever. It sells so cheaply for a reason - quality comes at a price. You're better off using a Windows on-screen keyboard, and click away at it with a mouse. You'd still be faster and more accurate than this keyboard.Pros: It's cheapCons: It's cheaply sold, cheaply made and performs cheaply. The key positions are different, which is understandable as it's not full sized keyboard. But the worst quality of all is the hardness of the key press. For a fast typer, it's so hard to press common keys like Enter, Backspace or Delete that your fingers start cramping up.You're better off burning your 200rs than buying this keyboard. It's the absolute worst"
3,"This keyboard is very light weight with minimal material used for its making. The keys are soft, responsive and feels good for typing. A host of multimedia controls are available at the top which I must say this is the cheapest multimedia keyboard I brought to date. But if you are a person who type a lot then better pay extra & get yourself a high quality keyboard. This keyboard seems it won't last two months if you keep hitting hard on the keys. If you have a basic PC for which you need a keyboard for general use then its fine."
5,"I odrered this for my laptop. Came in a brand named cardboard box pacaking which we normally get when buying electronic items. But product is intact. Length of thr keyboard is 41 cm, breadth is 12.8cm and height is almost 2cm""(including key protrusion ).  Letters and symbols on the keys are coated well. I tried to scratch the letters on the keys with my nail and did not came off from the keys.ligh weight keyboard. Keys are soft touch too. Over all good product for normal usage"
2,"I bought this keyboard a few days ago. I find this keyboard very light, the good side is i like the special buttons for volume control, media player etc. The sad part is the keys are not very good or say very poor quality and some keys have already started to not work. I have press it hard to get the number or letter. The length of the usb cable is just 1mtr whereas other keyboards provide atleast 2 meters this really does make a difference in the long run.Overall i would say its only worth what you are paying it for. Okay for average use but for serious use not a good option."
1,"Do not buy this piece of garbage- very cheap quality- keys getting stuck within 1.5 months of use- shape of enter key is weird, different than normal- Not returnableI agree it is small and light but still cons outweigh these by landslide.Verdict: Don't Buy. Invest some more and have peace of mind."
1,"After 1 day of use, many of the keys are hard / getting stuck (important keys - TAB, CTRL, BACKSPACE, ARROW KEYS, and some letters as well)I had purchased this product from Amazon earlier and it was fine. This time the quality is very poor. Unfortunately I opened it after 7 days so it is outside the return window.ZEBRONICS' 'warranty' is a joke - they expect you to commute 40 kms and spend 100 rupees to 'show' them a Rs. 400 which they 'will inspect' and possibly decline replacement!Last time I buy such cheap products. Better to spend double the amount and go with trustworthy brands that have sensible service."
3,"I needed a basic keyboard to replace my old logitech one. The zebronics multimedia keyboard is good value for money and comes with added hot key controls such as sleep, wake up, volume up/down and system shutdown.Will highly recommend to anyone looking for a cheap and basic alternative to the more expensive keyboards in the market.Edit 3-Dec-2020 - I am cutting down 2 stars because I have had issues with the keys not responding or they tend to type multiple times for just one keypress which is a headache. Unplugging the USB connector and connecting it back seems to fix the problem, but only temporarily"
5,"I have been using this keyboard for quite some time. It is definitely a value deal. Although not sturdy, which is obvious considering the price, it is good for daily use. I cannot comment on gaming use but I don't think it can handle heavy gaming. In rare cases a few keys don't work on first press (not a major issue.)The product itself is very light weight, hence requiring careful usage. One bend/fall and it's over. Keys can be easily pulled out.It has additional buttons which facilitates volume, folder, media, sleep mode controls.I do not expect it to be the best but it certainly is a good product considering the price."
1,"This is the worst product I have used ever in my 20 years of experience. The price is very cheap and feedbacks looked ok. Looking into the same I ordered the same. It is absolutely useless, a very fragile one, not atall good . Makes to much sound and keys stroke are not precise. My typing productivity is reduced to s great extent. I absolutely hating this product. To add to my suffering there is no get my money back or return the product. This is absolutely crazy and wonderful way of selling crap products. Please don't buy this product. You are bound to have a dreadful exp. I am just wondering how somany good feedback. Home seller see this."
4,"Moreover the build quality, its made of poor plastic. However in this price u won't get more than this deal. Its even working with mobile also through OTG. If u are looking for a budget oriented keyboard as well as for home use only then this for u"
3,"Read it properly. This keyboard is a great stealth keyboard for typing and normal use but for gaming, it is not suitable. I have had the worst issue. One of the main features for a keyboard mainly for RPG games, the anti-ghost feature is not available here, which means you can not use 3 keys simultaneously while gaming i.e if you sprint using W + SHIFT key then you cannot jump using SPACEBAR or any other key. I have faced it in Assassins creed and PUBG where you have to jump heavily while running. So make proper research before you buy a normal keyboard for gaming. I had no idea about this feature earlier. And as per amazon policy, you can't get a refund, only a replacement. So you will be trapped. Apart from this, it's a good keyboard for typing and normal use."
5,"I bought it for Rs. 450. The printed price is Rs. 649.This is a soft keyboard.Pros-1. The build quality is excellent.2. The keyboard is a soft keyboard. It means that there is no space for the dust to go inside the keyboard. The space between the buttons is filled by the plastic cover. (as shown in the pics).3. It has all the required buttons.4. The number-pad is given at the right side which is an additional advantage.5. The buttons are extremely soft and easy to press.6. The cable is also very good and lengthy. It is around 1.5m long.7. There are two stands provided at the bottom (one at left and one at right). You can use these stands and thus make is somewhat inclined in order make its use more comfortable.8. The lights for Numlock, Capslock, Scroll lock are provided. These light in white color and are quite bright.9. Less chance for dust collection in the keyboard as there is not much space for the dust to go inside.Cons-1. The keyboard is way too soft. If you are a hard keyboard user then initially you'll face some difficulty using it. It may happen quite often that you press any key for on letter and the same letter may get printed more than 2 times. So if you are a traditional keyboard user (hard keyboard user) then you need a few days to get used to it.This is actually not a con because this is somewhat advanced design.2. Somewhat costly. You can get some cheap keyboard in local market but obviously the quality of those is nowhere close to this one.Final comment- If you want to purchase a keyboard for a laptop or PC and if you can afford it, it is the best available choice in the market. Go for it without thinking twice."
3,"This sleekly designed keyboard comes with chiclet styled keys (keys with low height, like on the iMacs or laptops). I went for this design because of the low key height, so that even if they get hard with dust later on, the low height will make it less stressful to press.. The narrow design of the keyboard is good for making it fit in small space. There are small, sleek indicator lights on num/cap/scroll locks.However, on the negative side, the keys double press for fast typists like me. I have to correct a lot of my typing once I am done using this keyboard. Another problem are the media keys that rely on ""function"" keys. You can activate them for the session permanently by pressing a combination of the FN and ESC, but that doesn't remain after restarts, and also makes the actual F9‚ÄìF12 keys secondary.For the cost spent, this is a decent keyboard, but not as great as other reviews make it out to be."
1,"I've been using this for a year. The keys were soft when it was new. Over the months, the keys slowly became hard. It was gradual so it was difficult to notice the change until my finger tips started paining and I realised that it's because of the hard keys. This product has around 4.5 rating. I am guessing all have reviewed after purchase and not updated after a year of use!"
1,"The keyboard is of cheap quality, the cheapness is to the extent of keys getting struck all the time. I am very disappointed for the value I am receiving. I am sure such a cheap quality can't be unnoticeable to users and even getting to think that if Amazon is manipulating user reviews to trick buyers go for products which are not worthy of buying. The review ratings are like a joke now."
2,"#Design:Noting to say here we can see what is in the picture it's almost same, although I expected little slimmer like my laptop, it is double the height of my laptop keys, (I had added an image for its real comparison)I went for this design because of the low key height, so that it will be less stressful to press.but here comes the twist after use of 2-3 month the ctrl button becomes very hard and it slows down my typing speed,to press the ctrl button, need to press on the centre of the button if you try to click on the corner it will not press even if you put all the pressure you have in your little finger.#Problems I face (issue)1. buttons not slim as expected2. some buttons get very hard which need extra attention while typing.#Openion / Summarydon't buy if you want something slim and soft button to work,No issue if you only want to play games or not a regular user."
5,"After using it for around half a month. I can write points in.Pros:1. Keys doesn‚Äôt make sound when pressed.2. The keyboard wire is long enough for CPU if it is under the desk.3. Have Caps Lock & Num Lock lights on keyboard.4. Dimension are compact and light in weight. Two legs below the keyboard are provided for inclining and adjusting the height.Cons:1. So far so haven‚Äôt come across anything bad except the price was 700‚Çπ. I guess, 500-600‚Çπ suffice the product."
1,i think it is used before delivered.its seems like second hand because keys are sounding and unstable properly
1,"Given the Brand's name I bought this keyboard blindly.But I found the keys pretty hard to press on the first day itself. I thought it maybe because it's new and would be easier with time. But to my horror, the keys went becoming hard and hard by the day.Now, after around 1 year of usage, the keys have become too hard to type anything smoothly. Every time I type I have to make sure all the letters are in place. Fingers also have started to pain.WORST EXPERIENCE.GENUINE REVIEW AFTER ALMOST 1 YEAR OF USAGE"
5,"It's a wonderful product, designed to suit anyone who operates it. The best part are the rubber stoppers at the base that prevent it from sliding over your table. It feels like one is operating a keyboard on a laptop.It's performing very well right now. Time will speak about it's durability. Expecting it to keep upto it's name - Dell."
5,A very good product. Durable. After using for past 1 year it's still working like the same way it is working at the time it was new . Didn't face any type of problem till now. Very nice product. The key is also good very comfortable during typing.
5,"The keyboard is very smooth comfortable to operate.Pros:1. Chiclet type keys like laptop.2. Good key layout.3. Very easy to clean with a brush.4. Less sound and feather touch.5. Easy to install, just plug n play.Cons:The keyboard is somewhat long than normal keyboard, some may find it difficult to put in a keyboard tray."
5,"One of the best keyboards I have ever used. Very good for heavy and extensive daily use. Being used to Macbook keyboard and other keyboards, the different position of CTRL Key, Command key in Mac, Option key and Alt keys....will take some time in getting used to it. Other than that, this is the best quality keyboard with no noise at all, cannot hear typing. Overall Keyboard is compact and small, the main Querty keyboard is the size of 15.6 inch Macbook keyboard, but again not a problem for me. I just hope that this should last longer, next time going to buy the same. A really Dell brand high class product."
5,"This is the best PC keyboard I have used so far. Quick type. Laptop feeling! This chiclet is just so lovely. I am sure this is one of the best keyboard for PC. However, there is one problem. I feel the gaps while typing and this mean keys are not where the keys is normally found. This means when tying R you may type T. Migrating from Laptop keys is the issue because in Laptop there is absolutely no gap. I feel one has imagine the keys a little left and it can be get used to. After two days I am 95% corrected the typing errors without looking at the keyboard. I want to take it to 99% in the next 5-6 days. Ihope my will help those who want to get into the technicalities and details. But yes, it does give ""that laptop feeling"" while pressing them. I think it will be last for more than 5 years even if it is used roughly. You can say ""manhandling"""
1,"I'm writing this review after using the keyboard for more than a year.Please do not buy this keyboard - I'm currently having a bad experience in gaming or even moderate typing. The keys stick to board and I have to tap hard to get them unstuck.I'm looking for alternatives now. My previous Keyboard was extremely good, lasted for almost 10 years and was of Logitech brand. Don't go for DELL keyboards. Not worth the money."
5,"Got this delivered, couple of days back, well withing time and neatly packed. Its a superb keyboard, have used it quite a lot, in the past 2/3 days and the typing experience has been sublime. The keys are well placed and the build quality is excellent, so should be able stand the test of time. My laptop's keyboard has been acting up a bit so couldn't have asked for a better substitute. Its efficient/comfortable and convenient.Thanks Dell/Amazon!!"
4,So far so good. Tactile buttons. Surdy looking. No squeaky sounds. Button placements seems good. Overall a nice keyboard. Watch out for lighting deals to save extra
5,"I used it to replace an 8 years old Dell KB 212 that came with my Dell Inspiron 620s. Some of it's keys recently stopped working. Could have been dust or water damage. Now if i wanted, i could get a mechanical keyboard, may be Redgear with brown switches but i really don't think they're worth it as the price difference is just too much. Also, i wanted a compact keyboard similar to my Dell KB 212 and there was no keyboard that was even close to Dell KB 216. So i hurriedly ordered it and to my surprise, it actually feels better and is even smaller than Dell KB 212. Though the biggest change i see is that it's silent which is good and 3 Extra buttons for volume. Highly recommended."
5,"I touch type and that at times results in genetic typing...my earlier keyboard, though not mechanical would make a considerable sound.It was bothering everyone around at office.Also the keyboard was reaching end of life.Also the earlier keyboard was wireless....It would lag at times for no reason and after pressing say 10 or so characters in rapid succession it would kind of hang or seem to ""buffer"" and then all characters would appear at once. The batteries were also depleting frequently...my heavy usage could've been one reason....but...they would deplete in 3 to 4 months...So decided to go for a USB keyboard..I did a lot of research before going for this.. Very happy with the keyboard...It's astonishing quiet, the keys feel good under the fingers...build quality is amazing....Very happy user here."
4,"I am a programmer who types a lot of code each day. Most of the keyboards I have used has faded the key prints.  This is a chiclet keys, easy to type if you are used to laptop keyboards.. Spacing is odd, and even prone to typos.. They keys started getting polished because of the heavy typing. also some keys which i use the most (ctrl, space, a, s, shift, backspace, arrow keys) have started wearing down to bottom. Still the most durable chiclet keyboard I have used. With audio controls, this is the best entry level keyboard.. Still the keys have become noisy..."
2,"It's noisy!Seems flimsy, cheap and plasticky.Not like the keyboard on my Dell laptop in terms of touchThe labelling of the letters is stuck over the plastic keys and it's so evident - feels like it will get worn out very soon - or can get scratched if you have very 'curious nails'.The size and layout seems fine.The look seems elegant and sleek.Overall I am not happy with the quality of this product when it comes to touch (which is important as that's how you use a keyboard!).There are some useful functions like volume keys and so on, but not useful to me personally as I don't use my PC for media at all.I had to buy this as I wasn't getting a DELL wireless keyboard without a mouse - as I had purchased a DELL mouse few months ago - weird restriction from DELL! I was let with no choice other than buying a non-DELL product or an extra mouse or this.Maybe my expectations were high from being a historical HP customer who is used to reasonably quality products? I don't know. So far I'm not pleased with the purchase."
4,Update:Thank you for the replacement exchange. The replacement keyboard works fine. Does the job well unlike the previously shipped one. All keys working and smooth. So increased the ‚≠ê rating to 4 from 1 as per my previous review as below.Review 2 days agoAt least 5 keys were not working so I have requested a return and replacement. There was no refund option so Awaiting a working product. I will update the review once I receive a replacement keyboard
4,Product quality is good. easy to use...
5,"This is a pretty descent for people who want to do occasional typing. Key travel is good and feedback is okay.But dont get this keyboard for gaming. Lacks anti ghost support meaning you cannot use 3-4 keys at a time which is important in many games.For programmers, look for a mechanical keyboard rather than this."
2,"I'm using this keyboard for the past 1 year. The keys started to stick on the bottom when pressing after 3 months itself. That makes the typing experience annoying all the time. Now also while typing this ""A"" letter stuck (Stay pressed) while pressing.On gaming the problem is really a headache most of the time I don't even know what happens on the game then I came to notice the ""Ctrl"" button is staying pressed. Very Annoying."
4,"The first time I ordered the keyboard, I received a defective one wherein the down arrow key wasn't working. I promptly applied for an exchange and got my replacement from Amazon without any hassles.It's a great keyboard considering I use it only for programming or writing code. It's not ergonomic but even after using it for 8-10 hours a day, I don't face any issues. I haven't used it for gaming at all.Overall, for plain typing or programming tasks, this is great value for money."
5,"I am using four keyboards.1. Cooler Master Masterkeys Pro L white LED Cherry MX Blue switches.2. TVS Gold Keyboard with Cherry MX Blue Switches.3. Asus Cerberus gaming keyboard.4. This very keyboard for which I am writing a review.I must say, if you want to do programming, just grab this keyboard with your eyes shut. Superb keyboard. Even if it gets damaged at any point of time, you can certainly buy a new one coz its cheap. Don't get me wrong, This is a durable keyboard. Got comfort for hands, even better than the cooler master's keyboard. I back-light is not a concern, buy this.you can get 11 dell keyboards in price of 1 cooler master masterkeys L pro white led keyboard. I am so happy with this keyboard. The chicklet keys are breeze for typing. I have typed more than 3000 words with this keyboard without fatigue. Just buy it. It's worth every penny."
2,"I'm writing this review within first two hours of  delivery.Its not that cool as I thought of a dell product.cons:1)The backspace key don't work as other normal key work .  you have to use two finger to press button with same force or press it hard as you press enter.2)The buttons are not at all smooth to press, you have to put some force.3)The wire quality is not good.4)Made in China"
1,I don't know whether the seller or Dell is doing bad here. The quality of the keyboard is very poor. The keys are supposed to soft press. But this remembers me of the old typewriter. Keys are very hard. Very poor keyboard. Programmers do not buy this at any cost. I'd be returning this if possible.Nope! no return for this item.
5,The ideal keyboard for PC.Easy USB connection.Keys are really smooth to press and well organised.You might find some extra function keys than the old keyboards.The only thing I feel missing is its palm rest which isn't available for separate purchase on Amazon.But haven't faced any significant problems without them though.Overall very good product!
1,The buttons are not bright white as seen in photo. The size of buttons is very small and  it is not silent type key press.. it does not look original product as I use the same dell keyboard in office. It Looks like a cheep Chinese product. But I got it for 560rs. I would not have paid more for this keyboard... after couple of months I will have to buy a better one...
3,"I am having problems with this keyboard since it is not standard size. Touch typing is difficult since the fingers land on the wrong key. The key size and key spacing is not standard. The product description did not mention this, although it uses the word ""compact"". I cannot return this also, which is disappointing."
1,"I wanted to replace my aging hp keyboard that came with my computer because keys were getting sticky. Just in a few months the keys of the new keyboard have started getting stuck in pressed position resulting in likeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. I have to go back often and delete extra text and unpress the stuck key. This is supposed to be a good basic dell keyboard, but looks like poor quality control"
1,"You will not be able to press any Alt+xx combination on the right side of the keyboard with one hand, as the right Alt Key is replaced by Alt Gr. A huge nuisance and the button cannot be easily remapped to plain Alt.Also, after an year or so, I am finding that a couple of buttons have started to stick and need to be thumped to be released after being pressed."
4,"Okay, so I think this is a very good keyboard from dell. But I was looking for a keyboard which looks and works like a laptop. With the keyboard having low-key travel I thought it would work great but it was nowhere close to a laptop's keyboard. very much higher key travel and softer keys instead of chicklet style keys which didn't give that satisfaction of typing for long durations. I would have kept it but the full-size feature of the keyboard worked as a curse for me having typing on the laptop for a long while, I just can't accept a keyboard that big. So unfortunately I have to return it. but the keyboard is great if you are a beginner and you are looking for a keyboard on your PC. I don't think so that any company other makes great keyboard with low key travel so I will probably order something from abroad as after looking in the Indian market, I don't think so that anything can satisfy my needs as of now for the budget I would like to spend on my keyboard.Well that's all for today folks so if any day you're thinking so buy this keyboard having laptop-like feel in mind then please consider something else, other than that you can go ahead and get this one!"
2,"I am writing this after using it for 4 months now. My Dell Latitude is a small sized laptop with which I used to have Logitech keyboard, which was very good but that belonged to the office. Just a week before the official lockdown announcement I started to work from home and that Logitech stayed back in the office. I always wanted to have a chiclet keyboard and ordered this. The Keyboard itself very solidly built, fill points to that. The problem I am facing is that it will stop working after 3-4 hours of use. First you will notice a lag in response and after that it just stops working. I have three other laptops and it behaves the same.  That's the reason for 2 stars."
5,"Pros:Compact keyboard, soft touch but there is enough pressure that prevents accidental & very delicate touches from registering a keystroke. Your wpm will really improve after switching to this keyboard from a fully mechanical keyboard.Cons:The space bar could have been a bit more wider and curvy in design. function keys' width could have been more, just like a mechanical keyboard."
2,"Keyboard is slim but quality is not good. The comon keys like space, ctrl, shift etc were start creating noice. Recommended for lighy usage but not heavy office usage. If you use 8 hrs a day for 7 days the it will give up in few months for sure due to its average quality.Amazon basics stopped selling single keyboard which is why I had to buy this."
1,"I'm using this keyboard for the past 6 months, unfortunately, I have to buy another brand because the Ctr key is not working. The keys are becoming super stiff in just a month, and it's hard to type on them. Not suitable for Programming and DTP works. Usually keyboards from Microsoft, Logitech etc works for me for more than 7 years but this one last only 6 months!"
4,"Soft keys __ even softer than my laptop keys,Numeric keypad__ separately providedkey height__ ~3mmThere is space between every key.Special symbols__ ‚Çπ(rupee) and ‚Ç¨(euro)wire length__ long enoughErgonomics__ gooddelivery____on timeYou will get a sticker inside your package by scratching it you will see a number which you can use to check whether product is genuine or not.Hit like if you find this helpful.üëç"
1,Don't take anybody this is the waste keyboard and mouse don't use this model please try another models
5,"Mouse is very comfortable and Size is really Big..(comparison pictures attached)Previously I was using Zebronics PRAXIS keyboard.. wanted to buy that, but was not available as it is discontinued by Company."
3,Nice and awsum product....
5,"Very good product does its job, cost effective also."
4,Product is good and very useful. Plastics also good quality. Mouse has trouble working on bright surface whether opaque or semi-opaque mouse pad. Had to buy a dark color mouse pad Rs. 40.Kids drop the mouse more 100 times from a height of 4 feet but every time it survives very nicely !!
5,The keyboard and mouse is very good for your everyday use. I bought it because my laptop's keyboard was not working and it does the job very well.
5,beautiful & awesome
5,Great product for value for money.Plastic quality can be improved for keyboard but mouse is pretty good.For daily use it can usable.
5,Got it as a back up to my wireless keyboard n mouse when system crashes. Coz it happened recently and wireless was useless till I got windows reinstalled at a vendor.Good finish and fell of plastic. Immediately connected which is nice.Using mouse for my laptop which is nice breather to the mouse pad.
5,"Normal, no negative impact... usefull for continues working"
5,Good product
5,"Excellent than expected üëç. Good quality.One thing like a suggestion is that, keyboard and Mouse wires are like very thin, consider a little thicker wire.Overall the product is superb."
5,Keyboard is to smooth and good for office use.

5,Good
5,Hi super

5,"It has been quite handy, and had an exquisite performance with my laptop."
5,Excellent product from zebronics. By seeing the price I thought that the material quality will be cheap. Felt wrong when I started using it. Keyboard has Soft keys interface. Go for it.
5,Good to use...
5,This is helpful we can use this in any laptops good for gaming means this the best product
5,Combo offer is best
5,Got this awesome keyboard at at a price of ‚Çπ299. Keyboard has good grip at bottom. Smooth keys. Good height adjustable stand. Recommending all to buy this keyboard.
4,"Product is good, exactly as shown in the images. But the only thing I am surprised with is Amazon is now selling items without a GST bill. So, neither have i received any GST invoice with the product nor it is available to download from the order page. This is weird being the fact is that the GST invoice is the warranty card for this. Amazon must look into this matter.Uodate:- The GST invoice was available for download after two days of delivery."
5,Good built. Smooth keys. Indian rupee key is made available. Good product in given price. I think it will long last. Though price is cheap but quality is better.
1,I made the mistake of buying 2 Keyboards believing in Brand HP! Huge mistake.It is the most TERRIBLE Product.The Keys get stuck. Some keys behave erratically on its own.My money is wasted. But do yourself a favour. And stay away.
3,"Bought it on 24 Feb 2020, and the keyboard overall is nice with addition of just the volume control and no unnecessary buttons. However within 2 months i have a malfunctioning key - the letter 'b' is typed only sometimes. My usage is not much, still it has malfunctioned so early. Return period was within 7 or 10 days - no i'm stuck with it now. Will need to buy some other new one soon."
5,"There's nothing to take away from this guy. I am using it with macos and the scroll lock, pause, home keys are automatically used for some mac shortcuts. F11 takes you to desktop. And the dedicated sound buttons are just life savers. The build at places is a little too glossy for me, but overall it's been an absolutely perfect purchase.P.S. Typing noob so can't compare with typing experience. Gaming noob so... You get it! Just an average keyer who liked what he got!"
4,"The product is very good for the price range but there are a few minor quirks that I would like to point out for a specific kind of buyer.1.  The typeface printed on the keys are quite thin. If you are moving from using other keyboards with a more visible letters on the keys than you will have some time adjusting to the new keyboard, especially under low light condition.2. The body has mild flex in the mid section, although it is much better than the one you would find in Logitech K120.3. The keys are quite soft and silent, easy on the fingers, but lacks that tactile feedback you would normally find in other keyboards from bran such as Lenovo."
4,Review after usage of 1 week:1.Simple minimalistic keyboard2.Good for typing3.I use this keyboard for coding and development works.No complaints till now.4.Connects to and disconnects from laptop within second.Smooth and fast connectivity.
5,"The typing experience is very nice. The tactile feedback is very good. At this price, This is an excellent choice and the keyboard has volume up/down and mute controls which is very convenient."
4,"If anyone thinks that it is the same keyboard as one gets with the HP PCs or AIOs then you are wrong. I typing this review with the above keyboard itself. The keys are nice and travel is as usual. But, when one compares with the keyboards provided with the HP PCs and AIOs, then it is not that sturdy and heavy. The keys are very soft and free as it is a new one and i am pretty sure it is not a heavy duty one. It is not heavy and strong. OK product. The quality wise it is giving me the same feeling which i have with frontech or intex cheap keyboard. For office uses it is a sure NO and for home [WFH] purpose it is ok. Will update more as the time goes with it using."
2,Better look for any other alternative brand since HP is neither offering options such as entry level priced keyboard and premium one nor willing to improve despite of many people giving feedback about hard keys.  Such arrogance is not permitted in today's time when there is no dearth of options.  NOT RECOMMENDED.
5,"I choose this keyboard and it was perfect for what I needed... Typing feels good and crisp, product quality is decent as well...It works great..highly recommended..*I don't play games on this keyboard,so I don't know if it would be good for gaming or not.."
3,"Cheap price and quality. This was only branded cheaper option for wired keyboards. Works perfectly fine. Keys dont get stuck while typing.Quality of plastic is average and the keyboard raiser at the back are extremely flimsy. One broke after 3 months.Most of the other wireless keyboards are way costlier than this, so this gets the job done."
5,"I was so tired while searching for keyboard for my 17‚Äùlaptop,  finally I went with simple thought to try this keyboard and surprisingly it is compact and well suited for my laptop.And I highly recommend as it is simple and cost effective."
5,"I ordered this for work from home, this is similar to the keyboard that I used at office. Works as expected, characters are clearly visible and decent click action. It has no back light and not recommended for gaming. Overall  it is worthy for work from home."
5,"I needed a keyboard for the purpose of typing so I picked this keyboard. The design and quality is delectable. It has got volume keys. Feels strong and sturdy, smooth to type. My papa made a blue cloth cover for the keyboard to avoid the dust issue."
3,"Bought it for my work desk setup.PROS:-The keyboard looks premium and build feels good.-Keys are soft to touch and the response is quick as well.-The key travel is also good.CONS:-The edges of the keys are too sharp and was a bit comfortable while we land our fingers on the edges.-For a mac user, the keys felt small, so we tend to press on wrong keysIf you are comfortable with keys being a bit small and want to have mechanical keyboard type feel with less or no noice then you can consider buying this."
4,"The keyboard is decent for its price. I had a Lenovo keyboard which was terrible to type with. The keys are very sticky and difficult to type with. However the HP keyboard is far better. For those who are looking for a keyboard for office kind of work, with low budget, I would recommend this.I cannot comment on the longevity of the product at this stage."
3,The product is good. I opened the box two days after receiving it as I did not have have time and was going out of town when it arrived. Once I opened it two days later I found the USB connecter in bad shape. It was pinched. I was tired after my trip and since it was already two days. I tried to correct the shape of that metal housing of the connector and still using it like that with usb hub. I don't want the post on my laptop to get damaged cause of it. I suggest check the product first for damages upon arrival
1,Don't do this mistake... After two months my mouse is stopped working no response from customer service of HP for warranty üò§üò§üò†üò†
5,It works smoothly. I haven't faced any problems with it so far. The keys are smooth and with the right pressure. They are neither hard nor soft. Only a light touch is needed to make it work.
2,"The product got delivered on 27th October 2020. The HP USB Keyboard does not get ""recognized"" by my laptop. I also bought an HP USB Mouse along with it and the mouse works perfectly fine. All my other USB cords, Pen drives also work well.I tried troubleshooting and other methods. It worked for one day, but the next day onwards the same problem reoccured and it still persists.I tried connecting the keyboard using all of USB ports on my laptop but it failed anyway.It would be great if I can exchange, if not return, the product.Thank you."
3,The keys are very clunky so not useful for gaming at all or even fast typing. Build quality is okay. Good enough for normal users.
3,The space key was defective (see pic) when I received.Have ordered replacement as there is no return.Also the height adjuster has only 2 settings. It cant go further which is drawback. I wanted to raise the keyboard higher.Keys are ok but a bit smaller than on my lenovo laptop. If you have big hands dont buy this please.
5,"After using many keyboards over the years, I found this most comfortable and best ergonomic keyboard. It is joy to type on this key board for long hours and long time. Good for programmers as well as those people who type all the times !"
1,It is China Product....Someone put comment that it is an Indian and I bought it
5,"The product is very light in weight. All keys are very smooth and makes typing easy.I am using it in both my desktop computer and laptop computer. When I received this keyboard I was surprised to see it's good material and nice looking.The keyboard has three hot keys and usb pin for connecting to pc.hot keys are volume up, volume down and mute volume. Keyboard also works with otg supported Android phone.I have tested it with yureka plus(Android 10)."
4,Yup Value for money good. Writing this review after 2 months of purchase .Some times i feel the keys are a but far like the H key is a bit hard to reach and i type g a lot not sure if my problem or the keyboards.. But overal the keyboards syill fine and kicking  .Go for it .
1,Purchased in June 2020 and and the space bar is not working (first week of Sep). Did not last even 3 months.  Tried to fix the membrane by opening the key. Did not help. VERY POOR QUALITY. HP website does not even recognize the product (tried with Product number and Serial number)
5,Brought this product and have been using it for a month now. Very happy with it. The keys and the ergonomics and the usability is really good and worth the money. The delivery was also super quick. I would say that this keyboard is perfectly suited for hard and soft typers alike. The wire length is also good and overall I am really happy with the product.
1,For this price range we can buy a non-branded keyboard which can compete the quality of this keyboard. Keys are not premium for this price range. Even though the grip is fine the keys are very wobbly. I'm a keyboard enthusiast and a fan of HP. My expectations for this keyboard is very minimal according to this price range but HP failed to give a quality product which deserved for this money! :( going to buy another keyboard now... what a waste of money!
4,I bought this for INR 616 since my old keyboard had stopped working. I am satisfied with it and seems to be ok. All keys are working and the keyboard has decent ergonomics
5,"This is very easy to type and properly spaces keyboard with good response from keys. Great to type on, great for office use. Good for gaming too"
1,"Very bad..hardly used to for two weeks and almost all the keys have become hard.  I want to return but return period is over . I would definitely suggest people not to buy this. Waste of money. Was using Logitech for 4 years, no issues.  This keyboard lasted hardly two weeks.. a big no if you ask me."
4,"Its a plastic so it's very light but the longevity is something that can be... low, for me, so far, it's been good.Yes it is mechanical keyboard, but don't expect the clicky noise to be what you want, it's plastic body so... it sounds okay.For it's price range, it's really good. Even though it's Plastic, it doesn't feel like it will break very soon.Its an okay product.Gaming-  sorry I don't game on pc so I don't know..."
1,Some keys are inoperative. Didn't expect this from hp brand. Very disappointed! There's no option for return. Only replacement.. have requested for replacement. Will update the review after receiving the new keyboard.
2,I bought this in Feb of 2021 and it worked erfectly (key not working) for a month or so and then started showing wear and tear. Many keys on the keyboard don't work anymore. This is the kind of roducts we are getting nowadays. They hardly last a few months.
3,"It's OK, but expected more better plastic quality. The keys are a bit bouncy and find it but difficult to type quickly. Ok for average use but for more professional daily use I would prefer mechanical than membrane keyboard."
1,Few keys like QWASZX were not working even after applying for Replacement no one comes to Pickup and no proper answer from Amazon .
5,I am writing this review after using the product for 2-3 days now. Super soft keys which helps in fast typing. Just need to get used to the layout of the keyboard as it's a little different from the one I have used before. But apart from that this is a good buy
5,The design of the keyboard is very stylish. It has soft keys for smooth and effortless typing. The small shortcut keys beside the keyboard makes it a complete keyboard in a budget range.
1,"this was my first and last amkette product.. very very poor quality. many keys stopped working after 10-15 days, now it is completely useless for me. and customer support is also very bad."
3,"Hardcore gamer here, the W key started fading after 2 months of use.2-3 big sized key(Num + and Tab) needs pressure for output.On the positive side, The design is good and stylish and weight properly distributed.Once it becomes adjusted you can type really fast if that's only your priority go for it."
5,"It is a very good keyboard in the ‚Çπ350-range. Keys are moderately soft, and is comfortable & quiet for normal typing. The multimedia keys are all working properly. Not much rugged design (but not that loose either) , but of course, in this price range, you can't expect much, but you are getting a decent one ! Also, packaging was decent. MUST BUY FOR NORMAL TO MODERATE USAGE. ALTHOUGH FOR HIGH INTENSIVE GAMING, THIS MAY NOT SUFFICE."
4,"It's been around 10 days now that I am using this keyboard. It's kinda okay for it's price, nothing great nor anything bad. Though it could have been better. The plastic that is used here feels kinda cheap and hard hitters can type twice the same letters that they are tryna type. Feels extremely light in weight so it doesn't give you a sense of great quality in this keyboard. Though design wise it looks good atleast from a distance. Keys are extra smooth so they don't feel forced on this keyboard which is a good thing but can be bad too if you are typing rapidly because you would end up typing the letter twice and then you would have to go back and delete it. Though it's a fair attempt to provide a fancy looking keyboard at this price, so it's alright not a bad keyboard. It serves the purpose and that's enough."
1,"The look attracted me ..So I took a chance and went a head to get this product.. but was disappointed with the build quality of the product, plastic is very delicate and can be easily broken... I'm not sure if it's leak proof as I take care of it very much also gaming i haven't tried ... So only build quality is the concerned point here.. Typing is really soft"
1,"I owned it for a while, never had much use till lockdown and wfh.. This is a very bad keyboard for working.. Has to edit each line to remove repeated letters after typing. There is a 10 percentage probably that one key press types it twice.. that means every line in an email will have 3 repeated letters.. So painful..  Also it's a flat keyboard. Nothing special in ergonomics regard."
4,"I ordered this keyboard as my long running logitech keyboard gave up. I have never been fan of Amkette products considering their cheap quality.However I was pleasantly surprised with this product. The keyboard has got separate multimedia buttons on the right side and quick access keys on the left. The WASD keys and arrow keys are marked in orange which gives it a gaming keyboard look. The keys are very soft to type and are precise to strokes.Overall a value for money product with good ergonomics, fast typing and casual gaming."
5,The keyboard is quiet sturdy at this low cost for just Rs279. Been using it for 6+ months and its still going great. Its keys are not hard nor too soft. No ghosting at all. Keyboard multi function button on both sides edge (orange) are working exactly shown.  its a full fledge keyboard in compact size.  Its just plug and play no cd or installation needed.Con I would say has a usb wire which is a bit short than normal keyboards if its for desktop.Honestly i was sceptical about this keyboard at that price but I went ahead and purchased it and now I am HAPPY that I made the right choice. You can go ahead too if you dont want to spend more for HP or dell keyboard which has less functions and those all the things which this keyboard does .
1,"I am not a gamer. I needed a Keyboard for software development, I bought this on 21st May 2020. Reviewig o : 07th July 2020.Pros:The keys are butter smooth. I liked it very much.Cons:10 days ago, the PageUp button stopped working.Now B and N keys are not working. Either I eed to press hard or it will get typed with multiple characters.So, If you wat a reliale keyboard. Thik wisely and get a etter oe.Puzzle: Add N or B in the unrecognizable words in this post. I typed this sentence from my laptop, hence it is readable. The rest are typed using the this Keyboard.While writig this review,  the Left Arrow key stopped fuctioig."
2,So I ordered this product under a lightning deal but due to my bad luck some keys were not working in the keyboardI asked amazon for a replacement and they replaced the keyboardAgain some weren‚Äôt workingI took refund of the keyboardStory endsNow from my experience you should definitely not invest in this cheap productYou can go for amazon choice keyboard or any other branded keyboard like HP or Dell
2,my experience was bad with this keyboard.Received the keyboard first time stopped working in few days.Then request for replacement second time got broken keyboard hence i returned the second time and finally got a refund.Mainly the keyboard size is short too.Go for Logitech or dell by paying extra 200 rs which actually worth
5,"Product is good, After recieving the product I felt it's little bit small.But the keys are smooth.Length is 18.5 inchBreadth is 6.5 inchUnwanted extension given below the space bar. Key texture and print are good.Cable quality is also above average.The media and special keys at the sides are super. At first they didn't work but after restart they are working fine for windows 10 OS. It has around 13 holes to remove dust dust and liquid spills from bottom. It has 17 screws to open the back cover.Completely plastic body"
3,"When I got the product, the escape key wasn't working, after some this it did work, but still stops in between. I wouldn't recommend the product if you are going to use it for typing since the enter key is weirdly shaped and I not reachable when you are touch typing.The only thing I liked about the product was the color. Overall I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,"Writing this review almost after a months of use.I must say it is a good purchase for me. In this price range this is a very good product. Not very much sturdy, but enough rigid as per price. Does not have premium look. Typing is good. Not issues with typing. I also tried gaming with this keyboard. I played pubg with it. It does not have sticky key issue. More than 3 key roll over is possible. But it feels that the key are harder in terms of gaming. You should not expect it as a gaming keyboard cause it's at least 1/10th of price compared to proper gaming keyboard. So I'll rate it a five star considering it's price."
5,"The buttons are very smooth and soft to touch and the multimedia buttons eases up our work.Only drawback i saw till now is that maybe the buttons are not very mch durable for a long use i guess.It's been 4 months i'm using this and didn't noticed any problem bt the keys durability.Some mostly used common keys FOR e.g :- M key for opening MAPS in games gives little different feel when pressed.So, ive removed the button and adjusted the material inside button to the centre and placed the key back in hoping to regain that old smoothness and surprisingly it got smooth again.That's it ....other than this key thing, which is also not a big deal and on the basis of that you can't judge this keyboard.In this price Range this Keyboard works like a CHARM****"
2,"I bought this keyboard for ergonomics, primarily, the functional and easy to reach multimedia buttons on the right and the left..I am a designer and I listen to music 90% of the time that I am working on my computer. The volume up and down, forward, backward, pause/play buttons on the right and the mute, calc, folder, home and email buttons on the left are extremely useful to me and very easy and quick to reach and use.The material and build quality of the keyboard however sucks. I think it's been a month since I bought it and several keys started popping out and falling off within a couple of weeks. I have to push them back in place every now and then. I am not sure but I think there have been a couple of instances of double key strikes/mis-trikes etc. I don't think this keyboard is gonna last very long.The design is beautiful however and I wonder from whom Amkette rippled it off...oh okay ..they ripped it off from Foxin, coz I have owned an identical keyboard from Foxin which was cheaper and better built though not excellent ..Foxin might have ripped the design off from some other brand as well ..who knows ..or they both purchase from cheap third parties ... I've attached pics of the Amkette and the Foxin side by side for reference...."
5,The keyboard is just awesome. The keys are smooth and doesn't make any noise. While gaming also it feels nice. Most keyboards at this price range starts getting stiff keys and all but even after rough and rash use its still smooth and noise free. The only demerit is the keys cannot be removed or cannot be interchanged. Apart from that everything is super.
1,Dont buy this keyboard ...its filmsy plastic ....keys are going to break in weeks ... my previous keyboard was iball ..it worked up to 6 years...  I have a amketee wirless keyboard which keys are fine ... ( security issue is there in wirless keyboards)  so i try to purchase this amkette keyboard ... I will buy iball keyboard from shop ...I lost my money anyway
4,"This key board is very good in a reasonable rate. Also it has media player controlling option and all most silent keyboard.It can  be improved more by placing some very small white LED bulbs along the four corners , two at tops and one near up/ down arrow sign, inbuilt.Then it could be operated in dark room , when students studying but his/ her parents are sleeping in same room, so it could have been a newest type of key board in the market."
5,"If you're looking for a good trustworthy keyboard at this price range, look no further. You can easily go with this option.Have been using this for around 3 months now and it's serving its purpose just fine. Plus the ergonomics are really good and the multimedia keys are a blessing. The multimedia keys are one the main reasons I bought this.However, if you're looking for hard-core gaming, I don't think this product is for the long haul. You'll be able to play comfortably but for me and some other users as well, one or two keys might get stuck at times; has already started happening with me with the Shift key so this is one of its disadvantages. Not an absolute deal breaker though cause you can't expect more than this at this price range.It feels like a premium product and I remember this company Amkette making floppy disks during my childhood so yeah another good point.A definite buy at this price range!"
3,"Specifically bought this one for gaming as dont want to ruin my laptop keyboard.The keyboard is decent in terms of build quality. Ive played COD,CS,FARCRY titles without any issues.The only problem i feel is, you have to press the keys hard while typing unlike other branded keyboards like dell,hp etc.The shorcut keys for volume, previous,next etc really help while watching videos. However plz be careful as they get accidentally pressed while you lift the keyboard for some reason while gaming or watching a video."
5,Really satisfied with the keyboard. It's best in the market. Way better than zebronics multimedia keyboard. Multimedia keys are very helpful and are placed better. Keys are soft and keyboard is strong. Everything seems good. Note:- And i'm never buying zebronics keyboard again. Stopped working in just one week and service is very bad.
4,"Writing this review 2 years after the purchase..Pros:Seems to work fine even after a period of 2 years. No problem with key functionality and super smooth as well as silent. Compact design . A big advantage, it has a separate key for controlling sound/music etc. More than worth the priceConsNote that I've been using the product for 2yearsKeyboard is not for hardcore gaming or games which includes multi keys to be pressed at the same time. Ghost key count is less. The print seems to fade if same keys have been used continuously..refer pics uploaded."
5,"I am basically practising Touch Typing for a long but this keyboard helped me score the top speed easily.The first Impression>>>Pros:>Keys are really soft and spacing between keys are low because of that it is easy to reach on every key easily.>Utility Keys on both sides of the keyboard is so helpful and accurate.>Light Weight (May be due to  plastic build but I didn't feel that as low quality)>Height of the keyboard is less (compared to previous keyboards I had used) because of that it is easy to reach numbers and function keys(F1, F2....).> SilentCons:> Utility keys on both sides are of Rubber finish and sometimes it feels little stiff(just a little). But it doesn't matter much because the response is really so accurate and fast.> Size of ""Enter"" key seems a little bit small compared to other keyboards because of that my pinky fingers need to be stretched a little more while touch typing.Overall worthy for this price range."
5,"Do not expect a very high quality keyboard at this price. However if you just looking for office purpose, mails , multimedia use. Its a very good option since it does have extra keys for multimedia too. Looks a bit flimsy but hey the price is cheap..comes with warranty of 1 year. For gamers I will say go with something more robust and strong.if you can buy a gaming laptop or desktop then definitely you can save more to get a high level keyboard too."
4,"This is the best keyboard for typing. Even though the materials look cheap and feel cheap its really comfortable for those people who type alot in the computer. I dont recommend this for hardcore gaming coz at sometimes the keyboard just stops working for a few seconds. If you are playing some causal games then its good. And again for typers this is the best keyboard, once you get used to it you can type really well."
4,"I wanted it for my laptop as working on keyboard is easy. Coming to quality, it feels flimsy, key strokes do not bring confidence of a good quality product, feels like they may come out in few months usage. This is definitely not made for heavy keyboard users (those writing long reports or work extensively on Excel sheets). The shortcut keys for volume, calculator, hard drive, email client, desktop, etc are very handy and useful"
5,"Liked the shortcut true the most.Opening the mail, calculator,browser, file manager has become very easy with it.Along with this the media playback controls are also awesome.Typing experience is very satisfying with noiseless keys .Keyboard has many holes at the backside that helps to drain water if some thing spills on it without damaging the keyboard.The rubber padding on the lower end of the keyboard isn't sufficient. Due to which it slightly slips on the table while typing. Although it is a good product"
5,"For a price of Rs. 400, Amkette Xcite Pro USB Keyboard is truly good to use. Keys feel comfortable to hit or to push down upon softly. I have no hesitation in recommending it. Recently, a new version of it having UV coating and splash proof design has been launched under the label Amkette Xcite Neo Wired USB Keyboard. It looks more sober and elegantly laid out now!"
4,"I have bought this for ‚Çπ300 when I wanted a super cheap keyboard for gaming on laptop.I used this everyday for 1 year 10 months until very recently when the cable at the keyboard joint broke and became unusable.It is very lightweight and ergonomic. It is often advertised as water-proof which I have tested but then again how often do you swim with a keyboard üòÇ. Keyboard still looks good despite such heavy gaming use and the added buttons on its sides were very useful. For gaming particularly, I didn't see any added advantage nor was I expecting any either. I just needed a cheap keyboard for gaming so that my laptop keyboard did not wear out early because of gaming.I am slightly disappointed now it has become non-functional but it was very cheap and I had zero long term expectations."
5,"Lets just rate the entire procedure.(Based on 3 day experience)1.Delivery-Like always ..way before the stipulated date.10/102.Packing - Excellent. On addition to the Carton coverage the keyboard was wrapped in bubble wraps. So 10/103. Product- Sleepy, Ergonomic, & perfect for any purpose. The product was exactly as per the specifications. Little bulky but still manageable. The 10 shortcut key on the sides are a blessing! It fits perfectly for my work needs with volume,track controls, Calculator, MailSo if you managed to read all this , I would say go for it before it runs outEdited (01-02-2021)Never expected to be writing this, but the item has stopped functioning. Literally Nada. Nothing works. Except for the occasional luck-based one timer when it works. Otherwise just an unproductive expense. Infact this worked only for like 3-4 weeks , enough time to relieve Amazon for refund or exchange liablities. So I guess the rating for me then comes down to a mere 3 /10"
5,"all good , all keys work proper;y expect 3 keys1st shift+2="" ( whenever in keyboard wrote that when you press shift +2 =@) this problem is solve by exchange that both keys but their is not hastage keywhen i press shift + 3 =¬£ this icon comes that was not good for my work and their is not any key which can replaced by '¬£' key.  all are very good infect write this comment with this keyboard .  i use this from 2 or 3 days and this very good. check keys 1st when you recive this thanks for your time .if anyone want to grow their instagram accounty ,youtube channel then contect me  on my IG ID @moonlight_promotions"
5,"This keyboard is good quality and looks reliable as i have been using it without any issue for the past year. But the paint on repetitively used keys may come off after 1 year of use.But in spite of the paint issue, i have ordered the same keyboard again for another computer. I like the smoothness of this and reliability."
3,"delivery before time but packaging was poor.in fact open.so i checked all the keys in itPro:1.multimedia keys2.spill water proof3.gamng look3.lightweightcons:1.plastic quality in little on downside,cheap type. no arms or lap rest proper space2.shut down button should also be included like multimedia keys.i have this feature in my previous foxin keyboard fkm 902."
4,The keyboard is good.The keys are soft to press.it has a big backspace.All the keys are working fine.The extra multimedia keya are really helpful for me.There are two cons of the product1.The side multimedia buttons are made of rubber which does not feel durable.2.The wire of keyboard is Really small.if u are going to use it for laptop then it is fine.if you are going to use it for desktop then the wire length could be a isseue.
5,The product works very beautifully. The extra keys are so useful. Every one who sees the keyboard wants to buy it.Cons: Keyboard cable is not so premium and looks cheap.Buy it. You wont get such a keyboard anywhere for the price.
4,lightweight keyboard with shortcut keys used for frequent functions usable for house work and not good for office typing work purpose just. faced connectivity issue while connecting first time due to drivers installation not happened
3,"Product :Amkette Xcite Pro USB Keyboard (Black) (Sold by: Appario Retail Private Ltd)1. We received this product for ‚Çπ369.00 and shipping charges of ‚Çπ0.00 with good conditions and package, within their time frame.2. We did not satisfy about this product, because of making some problems when pressing keys.Thanks."
5,"Not recommended for heavy gaming, but works fine for simple games and has a nice build. For this price, this keyboard is really nice and is very light weight. The functional keys in orange colour on both the sides of the keyboard are the USP. These keys make the work easy, and are really great. Go for it. Value for money!"
5,"No doubt, Its a 5 star product but it comes with its own set of minor issues which may affect certain set of users only.Rest its a wonderful product from Logitech. You get full functional keybaord in small comfortable to carry package with every required key on board. Typing is a breeze on this keybaord with soft responsive keys.UNBOXING1. Keyboard2. USB unifying receiver3. 2 AAA batteries pre installed (pull off white pullout from batteries, to power up keyboard)4. Two extra battery covers to choose your flavor (in all pink, blue, white)PROS:1. Full qwerty keyboard with numpad2. Keys are soft & responsive with proper feedback3. Full row of function keys with alternate shortcuts4. Light weight & overall small profile for easy carry on5. Comes with unifying receiver (look below for details)6. Nice looks, though not premium7. Good quality wrt soul porpose of keyboard ie typing8. Battery test: Working properly since 15th oct. Rest for how long it lasts, time will tell. Logitech claims 2 yr life, but i will update my review whenever battery replacement is required. Just for an idea, my mouse lasts for upto a year with single duracell, so we can expect good life from keyboard also.9. Upper arrow key is slightly projected, for easy identification in cramped layout of arrow keys. But you need to get used to it.10. Plug n play. Easy setup. Just connect & use.11. Works good with smartphone & smart tv also. Infact no setup required in case of android device, be it tv or mobile. Just plug in receiver & both keyboard & mouse will work without any issues.12. Price bracket. If you get to grab it on lightening deal, then its cherry on cake.CONS:1. Slightly thick profile especially in front zone, that too without a wrist rest, so may feel uncomfortable in long typing sessions.2. No caps, num, indicator, so you need to rely on software based on screen caps indicator. (in my case, my laptops own keyboard has caps led, so it indicates caps status)3. Would have preferred full size arrow keys. They could have reduced size of shifft key instead to accomodate. To cover all keys in small package, they have highly customized the layout. It will take time to get adjusted to it.4. Slight flex  in lower middle zone near space key due to improper height of mid zone rest pads. Theres 1-2 mm gap below them when keyboard rests on flat surface. So it can be fixed.5. Some basic fn shortcuts missing as per laptop perspective.-Theres this software named Setpoint by logitech available from product download page which you can use to customise FN + Function keys shortcuts. But you wont find setting to add brightness +/-, wifi toggle, touchpad toggle, projector etc. Its havving general shortcuts like my comp, copy paste, play pause, control panel, page up down etc.UNIFYING RECEIVER:It allows upto 6 compatible devices to connect to computer with just one receiver. Look for unifying symbol on device (orange square patch with clear asterisk mark) (pic attached)For easy setup,1. Install unifying software from logitech2. Start it and click on advanced3. Click on pair & follow on screen instructions4. All connected devices will be listed(Alternatively you can also follow direct steps on screen & click on next)Tested on Logitech B175 mouse & working properly. Both keyboard & mouse seamlessly connect to unifying receiver. B175 comes with normal reciever, but mouse is compatible with unifying technology.GENUINITY:Some users have commented on receiving fake or first copy product. I have received genuine product, successfully registered on Logitec site without any issue.Advice: Be carefull while choosing seller, to avvoid issues like this, check their ratings, amazon fulfilled tag etc. So far i had an awesome experience with Appario Retail.FINAL VERDICT:Its a perfect low cost, compact & effective device. You wont regret getting it. Its pros outweigh its cons. Havent faced any serious issue so far. Its all good & perfect company for may Dell XPS L502x."
4,"Its a nice keyboard and works great.PROS:1 light weight and compact2 unifying supported3 long lasting with batteries(24 months)CONS:1 has a bit flex when typing in center of the keyboard2 the stickers on keys are very reflective and not visible properly some time.3 has no indication leds for caps, num and locks4 up and down arrows are smallOverall a nice keyboard and would suggest if u can compromise few features for compactness and wireless."
1,"Do not buy this product. its fake.I got a duplicate item ,failed to register on logitech site.Logo  on the product differ from the original logitech logo even though the product in the picture given here has original logo ."
1,"Have purchased the product on 10 Aug 2017, On 25th aug  keys of O,I S,E & more keys has stopped working. on 29 Aug after talking to customer service they refused to replace the product..Very very bad product...please do not purchase...."
3,"Here is my review in 7 points1-Keyboard is compact. But not for gamers2-Good portability and lightweight3-Key press is normal. Neither soft not hard (see the video review)4-Since it is compact, one will need to get used to the keys. If you have big fingers, then this one is surely not for you5-The scroll keys are very small and as again, little hard to find. You somehow slip the tap and finger goes to adjacent key6- Unifying receiver works very smoothly with Logitech mouse7-Now comes the last and important point. There is flaw with the battery cover. It is not at all sturdy and pops out with a small pressure. Meaning that the locking is not that good. Even if you are carrying it for example, in the bag, it is surely going to fall offThanks for reading the review. Hope you find it useful"
1,This one is not working . What do I do now ? It never worked from the beginning . I was waiting for my computer person . And now I can't return it also . What do I do ? Will never buy electronics from Amazon
5,"Excellent keyboard specially for Laptop users.Pros:- Compact & Stylish design, looks nice.- Lightweight but sturdy build. Almost silent keys.- Matches 15"" Laptop keyboard layout, joy for Laptop users.- Unifying Receiver, 2 AAA Batteries, 2 extra Battery Compartment Panels provided.- Simple Plug-&-Play setup, fast link-up with receiver, single receiver caters to upto 6 Unifying supported devices.- On-Off Switch and prop-up legs at the bottom, slot on the side to carry Unifying Receiver.- 2 Years battery life as claimed by Logitech with Auto-Sleep function. Only time will tell the actual findings with about 8 hours per day usage.Cons:- Standard Desktop Keyboard users might take little time to getting used to this one because of its compact size.- As a Laptop Keyboard, back-lit keys would have been a great help while working late nights.- Caps Lock key could have been smaller and Enter key could have been bigger.Overall a great purchase. Value for money."
5,"I have been using this for few months now it works really smooth and fast, despite being wireless you don't feel any lag in sending inputs to machine or neither in connecting, you just slide the on/off switch and it works in milliseconds.. no hassle ..And batteries are like you just forget there are any.. never had to change them(yet).Key's are pretty well but a little small in case you have big fingers, also those multi colour side panels looks wonderful.. just buy it..!!!"
5,"Pros : Before i purchased it,  i used K220. This K230 is just an upgrade of the previous one. Very compact in size. We can use both Desktop and Laptop. We can hold it in our laptop bag during travelling. Those who are having the ability of speed typing, should purchase this product. Another one an important pros is they have made the SHIFT key as its original size. some immature keyboard manufacturer built the shift key as small size along with the nearest button of [ | \ ]. During speed typing, our finger may typed [ | \ ]button instead of shift key. But this key board built in correctly.  CONS: 1) There is no led light in Capslock key. 2) We need to hold FN button + printscreen, during capturing any screenshot instead of single print screen button."
1,"Initially the keyboard was good, now the keys are not functioning properly. I have to press really hard to make the keys work. It's not just one or two alphabets but most of the alphabets are having the same issue. This is not a durable product. I am forced to change my initial review."
1,worked fine only for a few days. post which either the shift key or the ctrl key would get stuck and cause issues with typing. Not at all expected from logitech
4,"i brought this keyboard for 650rs during a deal. and i still consider this as one of the best wireless keyboards under 1000rs but still it has some cons. now lets look at its  pros and coneslets starts with the pros‚óí it is one of the smallest full sized keyboard with a number pad, you can easily carry it around in your laptop bag‚óí i heard the battery life is awesome and it uses 2 regular AAA batterys which are cheaply available in the market‚óí it is from a trusted company and my previous experience with Logitech customer service is good‚óí you will get a slot to keep the dongle  in the keyboard itself and you will also get 3 interchangeable battery covers with the keyboard‚óí i didnt face any connection issues or lag while using the keyboardnow coming to the cons‚óì the frame of the keyboard is week and you may get irritated with it flex while typing especially with the stands on‚óì the navigation keys have an odd shape and its hard to use the up arrow properly‚óì overall the quality of the materials feels cheap and i don't think it can survive a drop or rough use, so you will have to use it carefully‚óì  if you intend to play games with it, just don't. then i will suggest to buy something wired or invest more to get something more rugged‚óì overall if you are looking for a wireless keyboard you can carry around in your bag you may go with this one. But as i said this is not intended for gaming or rough use if this review helped you please press that helpful buttonUpdate after 6 monthsEven after six months  of use the keyboard is working perfectly and i didnt have to change the batterys yet. That battery cover gets easly scratched though (images are included)"
1,"Those who r giving high rating have any idea of how a keyboard should be? Why we use a keyboard?If you are buying the keyboard for general browsing then this keyboard is ok but you if use the keyboard for writing blogs, journal or writing assignments then this keyboard is not for you.The keyboard is flexible like rubber. Not stable at all. Compactness and flexibility make sure that your typing is full of errors because you can't be sure which key you are pressing as the keyboard is flexed. I am surprised why can't they make a stable/hard base.If portability is the only requirement then you go for this else don't waste your money. Don't even buy this as a backup keyboard for an emergency, ‚Çπ100 local USB keyboard will work far better than this one."
4,"Logitech K230 is a wireless keyboard that comes with some interesting features. It is a compact keyboard which is  smaller as compared to the other keyboards. It is an affordable wireless keyboard and here, we take a look at its pros and cons:PROS.#.Good Wireless Connectivity.#.Security-128-bit AES Encryption#.Long Battery Life#.Travel Companion.#.Plug And Play.#.Value for money#Compact Design.CONS.#Some Fn Shortcut Keys Are Missing.Moreover it comes with 3 years warranty, which is quiet goods. Overall its good product to buy for daily use."
5,I liked below:Compact SizeNumber pad like normal keyboardSmooth and big buttonsUnifying receiver to connect 6 unifying wireless devices. (same unifying receiver of my keyboard paired with my old wireless logitech mouse without any hassle. Both the new kew board and the old wireless mouse working like a combo unit using single unifying receiver supplied with the unit)I did not like:There is no On/Off marking at the power switch at the back panel. I had to use external marker to note on/off of the unit.
1,I absolutely HATE it!I didn't return it right away as I waited to acclimatize to its HORRIBLE key placement - truth is even today after nearly 8 months of use I still have to look at the keyboard to hit the Delete & Backspace key.The reduced size is good to look at and also makes for a cute product shot but the buck stops there.
4,"It's not a deal maker or a deal breaker. It simply gets the work done, hands down. Numeric keypad is useful in such a compact size. Light weight makes it portable. You get two different coloured battery covers (on the left) as spare or to customize your needs.Logitech Unifying receiver is an added advantage as I am already using a Logitech wireless mouse. Just download the Logitech Unifying utility software and pair both devices to either of the receiver. Arrow keys are a bit small but I think you'll get accustomed to it. No Caps, Num, Scroll lights, but yeah there's FN key atleast. I think, you can't ask for much from Logitech at this price."
1,I am not sure how this is rated so high yet a poor choice compared to other keyboards.1. The size of the keyboard is smaller than typically expected. You have to squeeze your hands to type and it is inconvenient.2. The keys on the lower row can easily come off in few months as it is not covered.It falls short on ergonomics and nowhere good for anyone who wants to type for a long time / with ease.3. The key tap is neither soft nor quiet.4. The product description image looks nice but it is a cheap plastic.4 You can replace but you cannot return this itemI wanted to replace my Dell keyboard for a better one but after buying this I started to like Dell keyboard better.
5,"PRODUCT DESCRIPTION - Logitech's very sleek, compact yet spacious, smartly designed keyboard. Its black in colour with Logitech written in grey strip (also complimentary blue and pink Logitech strip offered) branding on left side of the keyboard under which you have batteries. Battery placement was quite impressive. No need to toss your keyboard for battery replacememt. So it's been 2 months plus and I have no complains whatsoever. Working smooth. The spacing between alphabets/numericals is good for easy typing. ""Ergonomically designed"" with raised buttons. The range keyboard covers is jaw-dropping (pretty huge distance between desktop on study table and keyboard on bed and still works wonderful during movie times). Keyboard can be kept at an angle for more height/ comfortable typing with the help of brackets given backside of the keyboard. Requires gentle pressing of keys. User-friendly, hassle-free, does not require any Installation of software to be done. Compatible with almost all laptops/desktops I believe. No flaws found.BRAND - One can blindly trust Logitech. True to its claims and functions and does the job.SELLER - Sold by ""Appario Retail Pvt Ltd"". Nicely bubble wrapped and delivered.PRICE - It's high but against quality given its totally worth every penny. Its a long time investment.DELIVERY - Was on time and as expected.PS - Keyboard is provided with set of batteries."
3,"The keyboard got problems within a month of purchase - a few keys started working on their own, without pressing them, making the keyboard useless. Fortunately the Logitech Service Center in my city replaced it with a new one on the same day.Pros:1. Small & compact.2. Comes with a Unifying Receiver and Unifying support. So can be used with other Logitech Unifying supported devices with only a single receiver plugged in. I use my mouse (Logitech M235) such.3. Has a Numeric keypad.4. Logitech service is good as they provide replacement asap. And there's a 3 year warranty.Cons:1. No Caps lock on/off indicator. Same with Num lock.2. Flex in middle part of keyboard.3. Placement of certain keys is not good."
4,"Keyboard is compact, takes very little desk space and looks sleek.The keys are soft and its Great for typing.Ignore the reviews posted that it's not good for gaming. I've played warzone, fortnite etc. And faced no issues.Although while gaming it has key ghosting if more that 6-7 keys are pressed at the same time. Not an issue for most games your left hand has only 5 fingers.Latency: No issues, Modern wireless keyboards have come far as to face not such delayed response times. I can say the same for this keyboard as well.It'll take a few days to get used to."
1,"It's a pathetic keyboard. Coming from Logitech such substandard quality is a surprise to me! I ordered one and post receipt I realised that no matter how close or far you are from the PC, the keypad is unable to transmit properly thereby resulting in half of the things not being typed properly. Post pressing a particular key, its takes about 2-3 seconds for it to appear on the screen. And sometimes it doesn't even appear and to top it, the same letter appears continuously on the screen despite releasing the key.I returned the item and ordered a new unit. The new unit behaved well for a week or so and thereafter it too started giving the same problem. I think there is some fundamental problem with the design of the keyboard. I tried the keyboard on both my laptop as well as my PC but the problem persisted. Now with the return window closed, I am stuck with this defective item which works as per its own whims and fancies, typing and churning out letters on its own once a particular key is pressed.Overall a bad piece of equipment coming from a renowned brand such as Logitech.Bottom line: Don't buy it. It's a complete waste of money and is useless since it cannot be used even for basic typing without getting frustrated."
5,"Product came with clean packing. The adapter and keyboard wqs well packed. Comes with 2 AAA batter fitted itself in keyboard one had to pull the paper tags to make it working.Now coming to the product. Product is working fine. Those who complaining about the product should visit logitech website and download the required software. You should also update the adapter firmware as it will smooth your experiences. And also download the software for keyboard which will help you to customise the shortcuts. Overall a great product. Buy without any doubt because according to price it good.Just one complain keys like shift , enter , arrow and , ptrscr , scroll etc is very very small . But if one need just the keyboatd for the sake of doing few stuffs its a good go.I am not a gamer so won't be able to say how it behaves in games. I don't switch off this device as it has auto sleep feature which i guess works great . Using since 15 days working great till now. Registered on logitech website product shown as genuine and got registered."
4,"Bought this keyboard as I wanted a keyboard which is unifying receiver ready.  Not only is the keyboard unifying receiver ready, it actually comes with a unifying receiver making it a bargain for Rs. 699/-I did not use the receiver that came with the keyboard; instead paired it with an existing receiver to which all my other keyboards and mice are paired.Keyboard has been working as expected and quality is good as you would expect from a Logitech product.The keyboard is great for cramped spaces and is also a good choice if you have to move around the keyboard or would travel with it.The issue with the compact dimension is that keys are space closer to each other and spacing is different from other keyboards including other Logitech keyboards.  The function keys, cursor keys and Home/End/Pg Up / Pg Down keys are also smaller and these together can introduce typos when you are touch typing, i.e., typing without looking at the keyboard.  I am hoping that the error rate will come down as I get used to the keyboard.  Will update the review based on usage."
3,"Cursor key is one of the most used key for gaming/ documents and it is the most badly placed key in this keyboard .. it almost impossible to hit upper arrow with pressing any additional button with it. its kind of frustrating. and as amazon do not have return facility, Its useless product for me. I even trust to sell it as low as 500 but the next person returned it just after use of 30 minutes due to the same problem.  That much annoying design it has. Dont look as the cheapest price tag for logitech keyboard. It is one of the worst of logitech. I have 7 keyboard mouse of logitech and they all works fantabulous but this one Sucks."
4,"This keyboard was perfect suit for my needs. I needed one that fits on my table and isn't stretched across the table. This kind of gives a feel of the 14"" laptop keypad. Its easy to type and occupies less space. Some of the pro's and con's after a month of use -Pro's:1. connects in a flash. the USB nano head comes with a small asterisk painted on top to indicate which side should be plugged into the PC. Does not fumble while plugging it in. Once plugged the connectivity is instant. Did not observe any lag in typing and keystrokes reflected on screen.2. Extremely compact. Got all the keys crammed in. Easy to type3. Convenient - easy to carry around and also occupies less space on the table topCon's:1. Certain utilitarian keys are missing. e.g. The right click key, backlight to indicate whether caps or num-lock is on2. the arrow keys usage needs some practice and skill3. Due to its compact nature some times your fingers might press the adjacent keys instead of the ones you want to hit. Takes a bit of practicing."
5,"Very soft keys. And stylish look. Three color battery cover, on/off switch. N software for battery indicar and media keys function. Full size keyboard with number pad. And unifying technology was a master point. Because I have brought m235 mouse separately and joined with single dongle.  And I have registered both products in Logitech website so I get three years warranty. Thanks Amazon n seller."
3,"The keyboard feels cheap in quality, little bent at the middle and squeaking when pressed the plastic areas at the sides, though the packaging is great with 2 extra battery covers. The size of the keyboard is nice but the right Ctrl key placement and volume keys in relation to Fn key is aweful. There is lag in video games as expected due to its wirelessness, especially in racing games the lag is very noticeable. Overall okay keyboard at this price."
4,"Product plastic is very average quality, not flimsy, but not strong. Key spacing is little congested, however after few days of use you can easily adjusted to it.  Up arrow key is little and placed little higher so we can easily recognize without seeing.Performance wise this keyboard is performing very nicely, range is good and no lag observed. Instantly connects when you plug the unifying receiver to it.I observed one issue in the product serial numbering which is also confirmed by Logitech. Box serial no is different and product serial no is different. As per Logitech, keyboard S/N no is important and that need to be registered at their website.Lets hope it last as it is expected. Will review again if any issue I encounter with this product."
1,very difficult to type usin this that keys are difficulty to press as we are accompstomed to regular keyboard thse keyboard are too small and keys are place at irregular distane .even pressing shift keys are difficulty and those keys .dissapointed and htat space bar keep on pressing when i sleep and use this keyboard .dissaponited .why they made is so small .zebronics companion was better did a mistake ordering this any way had it been bigger would have given 5 star .need to order another good qualitythis i shall use while on the go traveling time any way if i practice in this keyboard i may l oose that typing skills in that regular keyboard .
5,"This is our second Logitech keyboard, the first was the MK250 set. I gave that set to my cousins. This board comparitively is much smaller and easier to carry in a slim profile laptop bag. Love the Logitech Universal set point application. The keys do have a bounce but there is no ""clicky"" sound. It is a slimmer board so the plastics are not thick, there is a bending that will occur if you purposely try to bend it. All the hotkeys/function keys are present as well as the number pad. There are NO LIGHTS on this board, BUT if and when you engage Caps lock or Num lock it will show on screen and if your laptop has these lights it will be lit up as well. This is an exact setup and length as my 15"" Toshiba Satelite C55 board. Overall it's a nice unit to have if 1) your desk space is minimal and 2) if you take your laptop and keyboard in a laptop bookbag or satchel."
4,I have been using this from beginning of Feb 2021. It is good but here few issues I would like to bring up:1. The letters and symbols on the key are protected by some coating they are such a strain to eyes and many a times I have to move your head to get the clear letter. For those used to typing without looking at key board it is fine but nor for others like me.2. I have already changed the battery once on 8th March 21. So it has come only for a month. The Logitech key board I was using for last 20 years (Bought in Dec 2001) had a very good battery life almost one year.But for the above it is very good.
5,"Pros:This is the only reasonably priced keyboard I could find with Logitech unifying receiver, which could be useful for future mouse pairing with same receiver.The keys are reasonably quiet while being tactileVery compact form even with separate number pad.VFM at INR800Cons:There is no off switch. Need to check how long the battery lasts.The battery covers options doesn't include black (minor gripe)The piece I received had a very hard 's' key and I was about to return (replace) it. But with little bit of usage, it appears fine now. However this points to poor quality check by Logitech.Some may need time to get used to the placement of arrow keys, Home, End, Page up/down, but this is a necessary trade off for the compact size."

If you need a compact keyboard and want to carry a keyboard in travel bag, then go for it without second thought.I would definitely recommend this purchase."
4,"Its a good wireless keyboard just plug and play so easy to use and its usefull for just daily tasks like typing and etc, its a bit small in size than other keyboards but for gaming its not ideal at all, if you want this gaming dont go for this i reckon coz the keys are on stiffer side and the key travel is deep so 'No' for gaming. Finally its good bank for buck for normal usage but definitely not for gaming. Thanks :)"
4,"Keyboard is compact. Key placement is also good. I bought this for daily office use. And my most of the work involves in writing code. So being compact, my fingers can reach the keys without much of wrist movement and gives me a confident feedback while typing. Connects like a gem and never had any issues so far. Been using it for last 2 months. The only downside I see is the function keys are slightly hard to hit. But nevertheless recommended keyboard! specially for programmers."
4,"Portable and good connectivity. Built quality is reasonable for this price. Good for browsing and general work. Not suitable for high speed typing.No CAPs lock LED. Bought along with mouse.Note: you have to install LOGITECH Unified software to work with keyboard along with mouse. If you bought only mouse, it can be used with out installing any software.The Battery backup is very good. You need not to turn off the switch.Another con is the keyboard turn On switch doesn't have marking. The upper side is ON. As there is no LEDs, difficult to find ON/OFF condition."
4,Pros:1. This is a compact keyboard2. Looks nice and optional colours in side bar provide vibrancy3. Material quality is good4. Connectivity is seamless5.  Overall a solid feel of the product so looks durableCons:1. The top keys as well as the arrow keys are too small and thin to operate smoothly. This affects both speed and sometimes accuracy.2.  The board has keys spread all across right till the bottom to make it compact. This results in making it bit inconvenient to use the keys in the bottom line of the board.So consider Logitech K 345 or similar product for regular use and buy this one for occasional use (by kids/ others) only.
5,"I was a bit reluctant to buy a secondary HID for my Surface Pro 3, but when my type cover stopped working, I was left with no choice. I did a lot of research on Amazon and wanted an HID that was relatively inexpensive, but worked well with Windows 10. I decided to but this Logitech K230 keyboard, without knowing whether it will work properly. Sure, I went through all the Amazon reviews for this, but most of them were pretty useless, tbh!Well, the device arrived and I was pleasantly surprised at the build quality, look and feel of it. I simply inserted 2 AA batteries, plugged in the 2.4 Ghz wireless dongle in my USB hub and voila, I was up and running in no time.The keyboard is compact and lightweight, so very easy to carry around. The keys have a decent amount of travel and a pleasing clicking sound. The keys are also quite durable and I especially like the fact that there is a number pad as well.Overall, this is a very good device and highly recommend it as a portable HID."
5,"Logitech k230 wireless keyboard, obtained at rs 689, the price fluctuates but its always around rs 650 to 800.  As soon as I received the keyboard i unboxed it, the packaging is good at first the keyboard didn`t respond, turns out I didn't remove the directional paper attached over the battery terminal Works well with my laptop and android smartphone over USB otg.Pros :1. Works out of box, just connect the USB unifier to your laptop USB port.2. works in Linux too , just add the solaar package to get more functionality like pairing,wireles link and battery.3. works in android smartphone (I tested it in my oppo neo 7 and redmi 3s prime) both support usb otg.4. white color holder is really good.Cons :1. no place to keep usb unifier , so if I lose usb unifier I have to purchase  new usb unifier or the entire set.2. the wireless link breaks3. no manual and user warranty."
5,Got this awesome keyboard at at a price of ‚Çπ299. Keyboard has good grip at bottom. Smooth keys. Good height adjustable stand. Recommending all to buy this keyboard.
4,"Product is good, exactly as shown in the images. But the only thing I am surprised with is Amazon is now selling items without a GST bill. So, neither have i received any GST invoice with the product nor it is available to download from the order page. This is weird being the fact is that the GST invoice is the warranty card for this. Amazon must look into this matter.Uodate:- The GST invoice was available for download after two days of delivery."
5,Good built. Smooth keys. Indian rupee key is made available. Good product in given price. I think it will long last. Though price is cheap but quality is better.
1,I made the mistake of buying 2 Keyboards believing in Brand HP! Huge mistake.It is the most TERRIBLE Product.The Keys get stuck. Some keys behave erratically on its own.My money is wasted. But do yourself a favour. And stay away.
3,"Bought it on 24 Feb 2020, and the keyboard overall is nice with addition of just the volume control and no unnecessary buttons. However within 2 months i have a malfunctioning key - the letter 'b' is typed only sometimes. My usage is not much, still it has malfunctioned so early. Return period was within 7 or 10 days - no i'm stuck with it now. Will need to buy some other new one soon."
5,"There's nothing to take away from this guy. I am using it with macos and the scroll lock, pause, home keys are automatically used for some mac shortcuts. F11 takes you to desktop. And the dedicated sound buttons are just life savers. The build at places is a little too glossy for me, but overall it's been an absolutely perfect purchase.P.S. Typing noob so can't compare with typing experience. Gaming noob so... You get it! Just an average keyer who liked what he got!"
4,"The product is very good for the price range but there are a few minor quirks that I would like to point out for a specific kind of buyer.1.  The typeface printed on the keys are quite thin. If you are moving from using other keyboards with a more visible letters on the keys than you will have some time adjusting to the new keyboard, especially under low light condition.2. The body has mild flex in the mid section, although it is much better than the one you would find in Logitech K120.3. The keys are quite soft and silent, easy on the fingers, but lacks that tactile feedback you would normally find in other keyboards from bran such as Lenovo."
4,Review after usage of 1 week:1.Simple minimalistic keyboard2.Good for typing3.I use this keyboard for coding and development works.No complaints till now.4.Connects to and disconnects from laptop within second.Smooth and fast connectivity.
5,"The typing experience is very nice. The tactile feedback is very good. At this price, This is an excellent choice and the keyboard has volume up/down and mute controls which is very convenient."
4,"If anyone thinks that it is the same keyboard as one gets with the HP PCs or AIOs then you are wrong. I typing this review with the above keyboard itself. The keys are nice and travel is as usual. But, when one compares with the keyboards provided with the HP PCs and AIOs, then it is not that sturdy and heavy. The keys are very soft and free as it is a new one and i am pretty sure it is not a heavy duty one. It is not heavy and strong. OK product. The quality wise it is giving me the same feeling which i have with frontech or intex cheap keyboard. For office uses it is a sure NO and for home [WFH] purpose it is ok. Will update more as the time goes with it using."
2,Better look for any other alternative brand since HP is neither offering options such as entry level priced keyboard and premium one nor willing to improve despite of many people giving feedback about hard keys.  Such arrogance is not permitted in today's time when there is no dearth of options.  NOT RECOMMENDED.
5,"I choose this keyboard and it was perfect for what I needed... Typing feels good and crisp, product quality is decent as well...It works great..highly recommended..*I don't play games on this keyboard,so I don't know if it would be good for gaming or not.."
3,"Cheap price and quality. This was only branded cheaper option for wired keyboards. Works perfectly fine. Keys dont get stuck while typing.Quality of plastic is average and the keyboard raiser at the back are extremely flimsy. One broke after 3 months.Most of the other wireless keyboards are way costlier than this, so this gets the job done."
5,"I was so tired while searching for keyboard for my 17‚Äùlaptop,  finally I went with simple thought to try this keyboard and surprisingly it is compact and well suited for my laptop.And I highly recommend as it is simple and cost effective."
5,"I ordered this for work from home, this is similar to the keyboard that I used at office. Works as expected, characters are clearly visible and decent click action. It has no back light and not recommended for gaming. Overall  it is worthy for work from home."
5,"I needed a keyboard for the purpose of typing so I picked this keyboard. The design and quality is delectable. It has got volume keys. Feels strong and sturdy, smooth to type. My papa made a blue cloth cover for the keyboard to avoid the dust issue."
3,"Bought it for my work desk setup.PROS:-The keyboard looks premium and build feels good.-Keys are soft to touch and the response is quick as well.-The key travel is also good.CONS:-The edges of the keys are too sharp and was a bit comfortable while we land our fingers on the edges.-For a mac user, the keys felt small, so we tend to press on wrong keysIf you are comfortable with keys being a bit small and want to have mechanical keyboard type feel with less or no noice then you can consider buying this."
4,"The keyboard is decent for its price. I had a Lenovo keyboard which was terrible to type with. The keys are very sticky and difficult to type with. However the HP keyboard is far better. For those who are looking for a keyboard for office kind of work, with low budget, I would recommend this.I cannot comment on the longevity of the product at this stage."
3,The product is good. I opened the box two days after receiving it as I did not have have time and was going out of town when it arrived. Once I opened it two days later I found the USB connecter in bad shape. It was pinched. I was tired after my trip and since it was already two days. I tried to correct the shape of that metal housing of the connector and still using it like that with usb hub. I don't want the post on my laptop to get damaged cause of it. I suggest check the product first for damages upon arrival
1,Don't do this mistake... After two months my mouse is stopped working no response from customer service of HP for warranty üò§üò§üò†üò†
5,It works smoothly. I haven't faced any problems with it so far. The keys are smooth and with the right pressure. They are neither hard nor soft. Only a light touch is needed to make it work.
2,"The product got delivered on 27th October 2020. The HP USB Keyboard does not get ""recognized"" by my laptop. I also bought an HP USB Mouse along with it and the mouse works perfectly fine. All my other USB cords, Pen drives also work well.I tried troubleshooting and other methods. It worked for one day, but the next day onwards the same problem reoccured and it still persists.I tried connecting the keyboard using all of USB ports on my laptop but it failed anyway.It would be great if I can exchange, if not return, the product.Thank you."
3,The keys are very clunky so not useful for gaming at all or even fast typing. Build quality is okay. Good enough for normal users.
3,The space key was defective (see pic) when I received.Have ordered replacement as there is no return.Also the height adjuster has only 2 settings. It cant go further which is drawback. I wanted to raise the keyboard higher.Keys are ok but a bit smaller than on my lenovo laptop. If you have big hands dont buy this please.
5,"After using many keyboards over the years, I found this most comfortable and best ergonomic keyboard. It is joy to type on this key board for long hours and long time. Good for programmers as well as those people who type all the times !"
1,It is China Product....Someone put comment that it is an Indian and I bought it
5,"The product is very light in weight. All keys are very smooth and makes typing easy.I am using it in both my desktop computer and laptop computer. When I received this keyboard I was surprised to see it's good material and nice looking.The keyboard has three hot keys and usb pin for connecting to pc.hot keys are volume up, volume down and mute volume. Keyboard also works with otg supported Android phone.I have tested it with yureka plus(Android 10)."
4,Yup Value for money good. Writing this review after 2 months of purchase .Some times i feel the keys are a but far like the H key is a bit hard to reach and i type g a lot not sure if my problem or the keyboards.. But overal the keyboards syill fine and kicking  .Go for it .
1,Purchased in June 2020 and and the space bar is not working (first week of Sep). Did not last even 3 months.  Tried to fix the membrane by opening the key. Did not help. VERY POOR QUALITY. HP website does not even recognize the product (tried with Product number and Serial number)
5,Brought this product and have been using it for a month now. Very happy with it. The keys and the ergonomics and the usability is really good and worth the money. The delivery was also super quick. I would say that this keyboard is perfectly suited for hard and soft typers alike. The wire length is also good and overall I am really happy with the product.
1,For this price range we can buy a non-branded keyboard which can compete the quality of this keyboard. Keys are not premium for this price range. Even though the grip is fine the keys are very wobbly. I'm a keyboard enthusiast and a fan of HP. My expectations for this keyboard is very minimal according to this price range but HP failed to give a quality product which deserved for this money! :( going to buy another keyboard now... what a waste of money!
4,I bought this for INR 616 since my old keyboard had stopped working. I am satisfied with it and seems to be ok. All keys are working and the keyboard has decent ergonomics
5,"This is very easy to type and properly spaces keyboard with good response from keys. Great to type on, great for office use. Good for gaming too"
1,"Very bad..hardly used to for two weeks and almost all the keys have become hard.  I want to return but return period is over . I would definitely suggest people not to buy this. Waste of money. Was using Logitech for 4 years, no issues.  This keyboard lasted hardly two weeks.. a big no if you ask me."
4,"Its a plastic so it's very light but the longevity is something that can be... low, for me, so far, it's been good.Yes it is mechanical keyboard, but don't expect the clicky noise to be what you want, it's plastic body so... it sounds okay.For it's price range, it's really good. Even though it's Plastic, it doesn't feel like it will break very soon.Its an okay product.Gaming-  sorry I don't game on pc so I don't know..."
1,Some keys are inoperative. Didn't expect this from hp brand. Very disappointed! There's no option for return. Only replacement.. have requested for replacement. Will update the review after receiving the new keyboard.
2,I bought this in Feb of 2021 and it worked erfectly (key not working) for a month or so and then started showing wear and tear. Many keys on the keyboard don't work anymore. This is the kind of roducts we are getting nowadays. They hardly last a few months.
3,"It's OK, but expected more better plastic quality. The keys are a bit bouncy and find it but difficult to type quickly. Ok for average use but for more professional daily use I would prefer mechanical than membrane keyboard."
1,Few keys like QWASZX were not working even after applying for Replacement no one comes to Pickup and no proper answer from Amazon .
5,I am writing this review after using the product for 2-3 days now. Super soft keys which helps in fast typing. Just need to get used to the layout of the keyboard as it's a little different from the one I have used before. But apart from that this is a good buy
5,Cheap but feels solid and works well. Been using this for a few months now and its a solid product. The build feels solid and of good quality. The keys are easy to press and provides sufficient feedback for use as a portable keyboard for my work
5,It's nice 300 rs only came with good packaging worth it thanks Amazon üòä

1,"Worst product, worst keyboard, quality is just 3rd class. The keys are so loose and some keys are even interconnected. The right shift key is interconnected with the backspace and so is the space bar. I lost a good share of written work because of this keyboard. Do not buy, utter waste."
4,Nyc product low price
4,Good product. Satisfied.
4,Good

5,Very nice product
5,Very good
1,My windows system started shpwing trouble after I added this keyboard which was quite strange. I wondered almost for a week that what could be wrong with the system. Then realized that troubles started after I added the new keyboard. Reverted to older keyboard. Windows started properly working again.
4,Good
4,Decent keyboard for home use. Very good for children as their fingers are small and keys of this keyboard are perfect for them.Recommended for kids for online classes.
1,"The product will work nicely for the initial one week or so but eventually the keys would start to not work by smoothly pressing them. Some of the random keys would start acting up and need like a hard press. Rest if you want to go for cheaper stuff to do the job maybe temporarily, then it‚Äôs good to go"
2,"KEYBOARDPros----1. Metal top and thick plastic base makes it very strong and minimum deck flex.2. Raised keycaps and tactile membrane keys. IT'S NOT A MECHANICAL KEYBOARD.3. Long braided cable with strong USB connector.4. Decent rubber pads to stop slipping on the desk.5. Windows lock and RGB light brightness control buttons.6. Interchangeable WASD and Arrow Keys.Cons----1. Input gets stuck sometimes even if the keys are not stuck. Happens about 4 times in 24 hours on average.2. Sometimes input is not registered.3. Keys are not equally tactile. Space bar takes a lot of effort.4. Only 3 light colour combination, no effects. Forget about software synchronisation.5. It's NOT TRULY BACKLIT, key labels are not visible by the light, only the key gaps are lit.6. Packaging is bad.MOUSEPros----1. Ergonomic and grippy design, easy to hold for medium and large hands.2. Metal base allows smooth movement and weight to the mouse.3. 6 buttons - Left/Right/Scroll/DPI/Forward/Backward4. 4 DPI settings 1000/1600/2400/3200 through cycling.5. Long braided cable with stroNg USB connector.Cons----1. Sometimes input is not registered.2. Metal base is not removable if you prefer light mouse.3. Only RGB breathing effect, nothing else.4. Forget about any other features at this price with RGB.I bought this about a month ago and it's running good. The build quality is very strong, you can kill a person with the keyboard. The packaging is very bad, resulting in a lot of people getting damaged products.Even though there's issues with inputs for both the mouse and keyboard, it never happened during my daily 4 hour gaming binge. However, I don't recommend this for intense FPS gaming as it can be difficult to hold the mouse for very fast movements for a long time.The RGB is okay but the money could have been used for adding other features or making the existing ones better, or at least they could've made the key-labels visible by the light. I do not recommend buying this at Rs.1600 as there are other better alternatives available at that price or a little more, like the Cooler Master keyboard-mouse combo. Buy this if you get a sale where the price is closer to Rs.1000.Edit: As of 02/02/2020, the '1' and 'Z' keys from the alpha-numeric set have stopped working. I have reduced the ratings as the problems mentioned above have increased and new problem has come up. The mouse works fine, but if clicked too hard, next click won't register. I DO NOT RECOMMEND buying at more than half the price, save more money and buy other better options."
5,"Okay, so I got this combo today. The packaging was a bit bad. The box was deformed at some point, but the keyboard and mouse were in excellent condition.Talking about the product, the build quality is awesome. The breathing LEDs are a charm. The mouse is way too smooth. The keyboard keys don't wobble and give somewhat a mechanical feel.In short, the headline is 100% right. Just go for it !"
5,"I was a bit skeptic at first when this was on offer for 1200rs, as i don't usually trust reviews here. but must say this one blew my expectations and i have a new found respect for reviewers too.The quality of the keyboard and the mouse is very good better than good i must say.The LED features could have been more elaborate well any ways u can turn them off on both the devices.(On the mouse long press the Dpi button to turn off the LED). ps-found it the hard way.STURDY, BEAUTIFUL AND VALUE FOR UR EVERY PENNY."
4,"This really a worth deal for 1150 which I got this pair of keyboard and mouse for . So now first of all I received this package 1 day after the estimated day the packaging was really bad and was making some noises then I found that there were two screws which were unscrewed in the process of shipping or something . The ergonomics of mouse is really good it just fits perfectly in my hands the buttons on the mouse pretty good but two side buttons are really clumsy to click I have accidentally the button I don't want to click like 1/5 times the keyboard also doesn't have that clicky feeling it has a soft feeling the wires are really good they are braided and have gold plating on the male usb end ....overall a good deal but don't get your hopes so high ,the quality is good for the price you are paying you don't get to customise the RGB of individual key but you can try few zone lighting or u can turn the lights off but you cannot turn off the mouse lights"
2,"While using in a room full of light this keyboard is value for money;However when you use it in a dark room, you cannot see what you are typing unless you are pretty used to typing without seeing.The keys are not backlit, the RGB lights are there but you still cannot see anything on the keyboard in a dark room."
4,The product is very good ..... Elite keyboard under fair price .....But the MRP isn't 2599... But it is 1599 (as shown behind the box).
5,Amazing build qualityAluminum build qualitySwitches are tactile and nice and solid feelMouse dpi is amazing very fast response rate for games like csgo and fortnite
5,"If your in a budget, you will really appreciate this combo.. This is one of the best that you can get.. If you can find it around or less than 1200, buy it in local shop. Bcuz, amazon ships this product is an extremely bad shape. Ive bought 3 of these in the past 2 to 3 years. 1 from local which was good. And 2 from amazon which was damaged a bit. Since there was a local service center I was able to get it replaced. If u dnt get a damaged one, then you'll definitely love this. Some pros and cons after using for 2 years.Pros:Stylish metallic lookKeys and mouse buttons are really durableAlthough it's membrane, key press is really smooth and silent.Mouse bottons are smooth and thumb buttons are easy to reach and would be grt while gaming.Sensors are very decent and will be perfectly fine unless you are a professional gamer.Keyboard has 3 adjustable height.If you feel the mouse to be heavy, you can remove the side and bottom plates but it'll void warranty.Cons:Scroll wheel will definitely fail at one point but this was not an issue for me as this can be fixed easily. Checkout YouTube for this.The rgb lights are pointless. Lights are behind the keys and keys doesn't allow light through them so you can't see the keys in a dark room.The package always arrives in a damaged state. So you gotta be lucky to get an undamaged piece.There's no software so mouse will always have a breathing light effect and keyboard has 2 to 3 modes which can't be modified. But this can't be considered a con for a product at this price and I always keep the lights off.Apart from these minor cons, the functionality and performance of this product is outstanding."
1,Ofcourse it looks well lit but the performance is poor. I got this product and after 2 weeks the scroll key in mouse started malfunctioning. After a month the keyboard started malfunctioning. If you consider budget wise you can buy this... But if you want to use it for a prolonged period of time then this product is not suited for you. Just after a month buying this product now I'm gonna have to buy a new keyboard and mouse.Not Satisfied with this product!
3,"I was wondering that it will be good thing to work during dark or night without disturbing others but it doesn't show up the keys, during dark and make difficult to identify the keys, lights glow below the keys and keys not made transparent so that it also glow. I later purchased other keyboard to solve my issue, I didn't return this because my son liked it due to changing light patterns and he use the desktop to play games or drawing."
5,This product is really worth it... Its the best budget combo of rgb if u r a gamerIf u r on a strict budget just purchase itBtw if u want to see video on this go to kadyrocks gaming in youtube
5,"Love this mouse. And I‚Äôve been using it every day since I got it. The ergonomics makes it easy to hold for long hours, and the dpi setting works well based on the kind of work you‚Äôre doing. There is a button on the side to make web navigation easier (backward/forward actions on web pages can be done from the mouse itself) The wheel has a certain play to it while scrolling which is so satisfying; the led can be turned off or on according to your preference. It kind of has become the rockstar of my desk..lol"
1,Got in two days after ordering.. packaging was worst ever.. keyboard was damaged from outside.. slight 4 bends on body and a lot of scratches on back.. came in wet condition.. didn‚Äôt applied for replacement because it was working fine and also think that i was waste of time as it takes week to exchange.. be carefull although the product is goof..Edit: after giving one star.. it stops taking image in review..
5,Keyboard d is responsive and comfortable. The stands gives a comfortable angle to type. Mouse is good for all kinds of hands and feels responsive. The cables are braided and strong.These are the best periferals for 1000 RS . It is perfect for gaming and extremely durable.
5,"Delivered in one day with good package.Got deal around 1129/-Keyboard:Keyboard is having brushed metal aluminum with sturdy build. 3 hight adjustment. Lighting with 4 different modes, 3 steady color modes with different combinations of RGB which you can see in attached images. And 4th mode is breathing lights on keyboard. Keys are not antighosting means no through illumination of keys. Keys are offcourse not Mechanical but feels good touch though. Reason it's called Gaming Keyboard is its having lights and sturdy build and Windows key lock option.Mouse:Mouse is not so heavy with ergonomicaly good fit in hand. Breathing lights looks good and can be switch Off. DPI function usefull as per requirement.Two extra thumb buttons help while browsing and gaming.So all good combo deal at this price."
5,"Whatever expectations i had with this keyboard and mouse are fulfilled and i really like it. I ordered this for gaming and typing because i am a blogger, so i need to type a lot and till now its working perfectly fine. But the only issue i saw was that the backspace key was wobbling a little bit when it arrived, and after the use obviously it will increase but that is just normal and will happen with any keyboard whose key travel is high, but surprisingly wobbling doesn't makes any noise. The sound when i type is not mechanical sound but still gives a mechanical keyboard feel. RGB colours of the mouse are very cool and are kind of very unique colours which you don't see very often in daily life and RGB of keyboard is not extraordinary, infact i would say that if RGB of keyboard is turned off then it looks more nice because the colour combination of black keys aluminum's colour makes it a very decent and classy looking keyboard. Build quality of keyboard and mouse is very nice and i accidentally drooped keyboard from about a height of 5 feet and it had no damage at all. I also had a doubt that the print on the keycaps would fade after use and since in gaming W,S,A,D keys are used the most, so i thought that those key's print would fade but it didn't not happen and they are as clear as if its new. The price this product offers is also decent and product is awesome. So much recommended"
5,"It's an awesome mouse I just love it I programmed the buttons to play NFS where I drive only with my mouse and the response is immediate , and the DPI is also very perfect. And for those who were wondering how to program the side buttons Download Xmouse button control on your computer available on google further instructions will be there in the app"
5,"It is a strong, sturdy, beautiful keyboard. Go through the manual after purchase.Edit: Mouse has a loose contact problem. At first I thought it was my laptop problem. But actually I bought the laptop after buying this. Laptop is fine. So, I'm concluding that it's the mouse problem. Still, it works fine in other slots. And that one problematic slot has no issues with any other devices too.. Also, WASD key's text has started fading by now. I don't think the paint will last long. Anyway, it's a good buy."
1,"Pathetic product, it's just a fancy product who want there keyboard to glow. No functionality what so ever for those RGB. Keys are not backlit. Also when light is low and you turn on the RGB lights of keyboard . Visibility of keys further decreases because of the lights coming from keyboard. Better avoid such product and go for its higher priced model or chose keyboard of some other brand. There are many keyboard at this price far better then this like circle and nighthawk. Don't buy this crap."
5,"The mouse some times doesn't connect for 1 sec but is fine later (happens rarely but it does) isn't a big problem. Also, the mouse is really good cause my last mouse scratched my laptop's surface and the second I put it on my laptop it slid so smoothly. I recommend you buy this for a Laptop or a PC. The cable is long enough so that if my laptop is connected with HDMI to my TV I could still put my back by the bed and play normally(really helpful).The Keyboard has good lights too and is comfortable even when put on laps. It took some days but I got used to typing on this keyboard (as am a fast typer that was awfully quick for me. though it could have been better though that would increase the price a lot."
5,"I purchased this for 1100. Yeah was a steal at the price! Coming to the product, the build quality is top notch and this certainly doesn't feels like a super budget set. Just hold it on your hands and you'll know what I'm trying to say. Aluminium used and it looks so freaking good!The mouse does the job well too and the extra buttons can be easily maped. I use this in competitive FPS like Apex Legends, CS GO, PUBG etc and this comes in real handy. However note it'll take time for you to get used to it. It's a bit heavy to use but once you're used to it, there's no issue.A few things I didn't like were that LEDs weren't lit in the keys but just the gaps. I mean it still looks great but if you wanna use it in the dark, you wouldn't be able to see. Also the space bar takes a lil effort. The mouse is perfect and there's nothing to crib about there.However the packaging was just ""BAD"". Please look after it AMAZON.  I don't know why they did it but I just got the keyboard box without any wrapping or protection. ( It was a bit damaged from the the sideS too, Thank God the components were safe xD ).Nonetheless, it's a steal for 1100 or even 1200-1300. Full 5 stars from my side considering the price."
5,"I have been using this for couple of months now i guess.Trust me the built quality is really good and i bet you won't get this kind of products at this price.Pros : built quality  RGB lights  Mouse with two keys  Braided cablesCons: Keyboard lights are not illuminating through letters, numbers so you can't use it in dark condition.If you can forget this only con in this combo just go for it. You will love it."
5,Damm It's Just Amazing.The quality Of the Product is Great in That price.Pro's ->Metal BoddyMechanical feelPremium LooksRGB / 4-5 ModsMouse feels Solid & HaveyWires Are Fully BridgetGold Plated USB2 Mod StandsMouse Works Very Good Even in Gaming time2 Extra Function key on MouseCons->Keys Not RemovableI would say For 1300/INRThis is What You should buyJust Buy it With Out wasting Any timeIt's better then even 2500/inr keyboards
5,At first I was a bit apprehensive about this keyboard and mouse. After receiving the product I was amazed by the quality they are providing at this price range. The chasis of the keyboard is aluminum. Packaging could have been better. I got it for 1200. The best you can get in this price range. Received it today will check and review it after using for some more days.
4,"People who just started gaming i think this will suit you the best,the keys are very good you will get a good typing experience.Only thing that expected for more rgb light modes it has just 3 multicolored still modes and a breathing effect it would be best if it has rainbow and ripple effect.update after 1 year and few months: keyboard has stopped working , i notice some connection issues with the cable. mouse is fine."
5,THIS IS THE BEST KEYBOARD AND MOUSE I HAVE EVER SEEN PLAESE GO FOR IT AS IT IS THE BEST YOU CAN HAVE IN SO MUCH LESS PRICE IF IT WERE OF EVEN 5000 RUPEES THEN TOO I WONT BE SHOCKEDP.S - YOU DONT GET TO KNOW ABOUT THE ACTUAL KEYBOARD AND MOUSE QUALITY EVEN IN THE PHOTOS GIVEN BY AMAZON  OR ON THE REVIEWS IN THE YOUTUBE. WHEN YOU GET THE MOUSE AND KEYBOARD THEN YOU GET TO KNOW THAT THE QUALITY IS TOP NOTCH PLEASE CONSIDER TO BUY
5,"Pros.That RGB light üòçIt was well known keyboard and mouse set. It was wonderful addition to your setup.Mouse buttons are clicky with satisfying sound. Keyboard keys are well spaced and easy to type fast.Cons.Keyboard buttons should have been backlit, it would be wonderful if it has. But this is what given.Overall best purchase and add a little spice up to my WFH setup."
5,"My kid specifically asked for this for gaming after seeing it at his friends' place. But given more school work/studies going online, it is a good full size keyboard for kid to minimize wrist fatigue. It is really good and in kid's words -- ""satisfying"" especially from mechanical type of feeling. Mouse is very cool too.  The smile on kid's face makes is a must buy for parents. Moreover it is an Indian brand so very proud of it too. It looks futuristic too from ""transformers theme"" styling perspective and subtle LED lighting. Quick delivery by Amazon despite lockdown etc. Big thank you and hi-five to Amazon and Zebronics."
5,"To be honest, the pics didn't satisfy me before purchase. I was not planning on buying this one, but the reviews changed my mind. I ordered it on Friday and got it on Sunday of the same week. The quality is just mind blowing, It has a grey aluminium like finish and works perfectly on Mac's. The RGB on the mouse and keyboard is just beautiful. The RGBin the keyboard has 3 modes. Both the keyboard and mouse have gold plated usbs and braided cables, so u don't have to worry about them tangling. The mouse has the same finish as the keyboard, and feels premium on hand. I don't know much about keyboard keys, but these feel way better than those 800Rs mechanical keyboards you get locally. The brightness and dpi have there own buttons on the devices. The keyboard even has a '‚Çπ' key. I will be honest with you, it looks better than the pics. There just isn't a better combo than this at this price."
5,"This is perfectly a premium gaming mouse. Very comfortable and sturdy build. If you play games for a long time you will absolutely have no complain, very comfortable to hold. The breathing LED lights make it more attractive and the two side buttons allows you a more powerful gaming.Thanks Amazon and Zebronics"
5,"I am not a gamer and haven't taken this for gaming purpose, I was looking for a top quality Keyboard Mouse Combo where I think Zebronics did a near perfect Job.I wasn't looking for anything else apart from a performance. This Keyboard does a decent job than ther Dell wireless & Logitech does. Keys are very well placed and ideal spacing of letters. Top notch quality of cables and length too which is very much required in wired devices.Mouse is also excellent and does a pretty good job. It certainly adds value to your Home Office. The back and forward button on the mouse is a very very useful feature.Rest all is gimick of that lights but it's not well crafted.. Truly Value for money."
1,"Why people are giving positive reviews to this mouse. Durability is good but problem is with the comfort and sensor. Normal mouse is better than this.This is not for gaming, It has a high lift off distance which is very much annoying while gaming. After 30mins of gaming my wrist hurts, so comfort is very bad.It is a very bad choice for gamers.I bought g402 instead of this."
5,About keyboardBest for gamingBest for typingWhile playing games you've to decrease your brightness otherwise you'll get RGB light's rays that will distract you too much...Increasing and decreasing brightness option i like it too muchThis is very affordable keyboard you can go for itAnd one more thing the keyboard body is that much powerful you can defend yourself while alien invasion..About mouseMouse has 2 LED lights inside its body and one of them is too annoying it's very eye catchy and annoyingYou can't increase and decrease the lights of the mouseThey should have given that option in mouse too but yeah don't worry about that too much because every person has different perspective i said mine but i believe me you can go for it..Apart from that mouse buttons are so cool while playing it's like you're in ufo and you're controlling it by the mouse.. actually it's button the quality itself is very different like matte finish and because of RGB lights you'll feel about that ufo stuff which I've said...Very good mouse and keyboardGo for it blindlyDon't waste your money in high price keyboard and mouseIt all work the sameAnd this one is very cool.
5,GAMING:- If you want gaming/Basic use/Heavy use Keyboard & Mouse .Just go for it. It has RGB colors. DURABALITY:-And much tough quality.Aluminium body. Dpi settings for mouse. For more info refer zebronics website. DISADVANTAGE:- You cannot see Alphabets & number on buttons in the night even if you on rgb lights. FEEDBACK:- Your selling product in india so recommend you guys to add rupee symbol
5,"Its one of the best things i have purchased from amazon, build quality is nice, price is good, remember that its a milti light setting that means three diffrent color of light will be there on the keyboard at any particular time which is not that nice, in place of that if they would have gone with one color at a time thatw ould be nice other wise go for it"
1,The product is supposed to work for at least 12 months. but stopped working after 4 months. Amazon told me to contact the manufacturer and the manufacturer wanted to to visit their service center which is about 30 kilometers away on the other side of the city. It will cost me time and probably more money  than the product's price. overall appalling service from both.
1,"A super cheap keyboard mouse combo.Mouse:Pros:1. Main buttons are good. Tactile feel is okayish.2. Pretty responsive mouse.Cons:1. Light as a feather. Needs to have some weight, some minimum weight.2. Airy Side buttons though they work have no feel. People who experienced these kind of buttons can tell, they don't last more than a few days and also you can't physically feel any click, absolutely zero tactile feel except for a very faint click sound. So these are not really useful in gaming. You don't normally see these buttons anywhere, I saw these only once before on a very cheap Chinese made FM radio set as a on/off button.3. Metal back plate will scratch your table.Mouse Rating: 3/5 for this price.Keyboard:Pros:Feel is somewhat mechanical.Cons:1. Very elevated: The metal plate lies flat on table and keys are very elevated. It's insanely difficult to type keeping your wrist straight. While gaming there is zero wrist support. Wrist starts to pain in a few minutes. Carpel tunnel is guaranteed. See pics attached.2. The keyboard came very dusty and seems like used, see close up images attached.3. The RGB is only RGB not key backlight. What do I mean, light comes from the gaps but not from the letters on the keyboard. Meaning you cannot see illuminated ABC etc, only light from all around the keys but actual keys don't glow. See pics attached.4. There is no shread of ergonomics in the keyboard.Keyboard Rating: 0/5Okay mouse. Keyboard only good to hang as an RGB decoration."
5,"So as I told you that there is one secret function that no-one knows but before I tell you,this keyboard and mouse combo is best for work and some what good for gaming if you want to add RGB look to your setup so now I  revel that function that I also discovered it accidentally if you want to turn off the led of mouse there's no key for that only you can change DPI but along that if you press and hold that DPI key for 4-5 sec RGB led goes off this is not mentioned in manual also hope you liked this review"
5,Got this for ~‚Çπ1500. Great value for money. Pros: Very good. Strong metal body that can take punishment. Keycaps also feel durable.Has good travel. Don't feel like you have have to hit hard to register keysMouse is also decent with good sensitivity switchLighting is pleasantKeycaps can be replaced easilyAcceptable response timesCons:Membrane keyboard (Acceptable for given price point)Lights are not programmableKeycaps do not let light pass so keys are almost invisibleNo mousepad or palm rest(acceptable for price point)
5,"I was a bit confused and not so confident before purchasing, especially regarding the size and comfort of the devices. However they turned out great ! Been using them now for more than 3 months and did not face any issue.- The keyboard buttons are really great and have good suspension- The metal base makes it very easy to clean the keyboard with just a dry cloth- The lights are perfect and i have multiple options of color combo (including turning the lights off) all by tapping a single button on the keyboard- I have been able to use more than 3 keys at the same time and the input is detected ( Useful when playing emulated games like Ps4 or Xbox)- The bottom grip of keyboard is perfect and does not move on normal forces the mouse on the other hand is very smooth (has metal base)- The mouse buttons are nice as well as the right and left click are long and curved, allows me to rest my hand on them at ease (something we don't get in our normal KIT )X The only difficulty I have been having is with the mouse side buttons. It has two buttons on the left side and they are used to shuffle forward and backward (while browsing web/ music / etc). However its close to the left click and I sometimes end up taping it and its annoying while browsing the web, as the webpage goes back and forward. Not a big deal as I might get used to using it properly.Over all really great equipment for the DEAL. Most of my friends have been impressed with the set . So its a really cool show off too ;)Definitely RecommendThank you"
4,As usual quality of the logitech keyboard is awesome. But the keyboard is having begnali alphabets printed along with english. For me its not at all needed and making some discomfort. Never mentioned this fact in the product description. Otherwise I will give it 5 stars.
4,"First of all, I bought this keyboard for home use because i use the same keyboard in my office, and this keyboard is really nice for this price.But the issue is, seller sent me a keyboard with Bengali letters printed on the keys (see the pictures) which looks very cluttered, which i didn't want, so be aware of that and ask the seller which keyboard they have.One more thing,May be i am wrong,  but i noticed that key stroke of this keyboard is little bit less quality of the one which i use at office."
3,"Not even 2 months yet and facing issue with keys.. letter f behaves erratically , sometimes not responding on key-press and sometimes keeps on typing (sending command for) f continuously automatically by itself.In short : either i received a duplicate product or a faulty product.[Update] : on complaining to Logitech, keyboard was replaced in warranty by them free of cost. Replaced one is working fine."
5,"It is very comfortable ,keys are good n if you want to learn typing it very nice n comfortable to learn typing...no problem for dat n the design is nice,cable lenght also no problem it's long enough ... supporting for windows 7 which am using ,em reviewing after 3-4 months of use no problem of connectivity,no loose connection problem of the cable... everything is fine guys ,finally one thing for learning typing better to take dis one it's comfortable n won't feel to come back when you start typing by using typing master....this msg is according to my opinion hope may be useful for anyone tq u"
4,"I purchased this keyboard as a temporary replacement for my gaming keyboard, the Microsoft Sidewinder X6, which after serving me well for 4 years, is nearing the end of its life. This keyboard is a very basic one with no bells and whistles. For its price, it offers a very good build quality, standard key layover, and a seperate numeric keypad. There are no media control or internet-related controls, nor or are there any USB ports. It connects to the computer via a USB 2.0 port, but you can also use a USB 3.0 port. This is a good value-for-money product, which, for occasional users, should be a good performer. I am a heavy gamer, and with my usage pattern, this keyboard will not last more than 2 years. By that time, I am hoping to have saved enough to be able to purchase a mechanical gaming keyboard. The only negatives in the keyboard are:1. Its keys have sharp edges. Having rounded edges would've delivered a better typing experience.2. Typing fast results in a minor lag between pressing of a key and the related result appearing on the screen. I guess it is to be expected in low-end hardware.VERDICT: Good value-for-money product, but only for occasional typists and price-conscious consumers."
5,Logitech is a premium and trustworthy brand so don't give a 2nd thought and go for it.It is a full size keyboard with elevated and smooth buttons.It can be used for gaming too because keys are like mechanical keyboard.Wire length is well enough.Quality is best.It has No backlit so can be a problem if you are typing in dark.Hit helpful !
2,Two stars overall for poor quality controlPros :1) This keyboard stays firm unlike the older keyboards which is a good thing. Soft key typing2) Design wise The Escape key is in a weird position compare to my older  K200 keyboard which takes a while to get use to. Not a major problemCons: Failed in 6 months. + key is not working and sometimes works automatically. Bad quality control. Keys are a bit wobbly. Swiss quality?
5,"Good quality keyboard, feels comfortable to type on. The Enter key is ANSI layout, that is, it is placed below the backslash ('\') instead of backspace like in most keyboards which follow the ISO layout. It is also smaller and occupies less space which might end up being problematic.Other than that, it's probably the best keyboard in its price range (unless you prefer laptop-style keycaps). The keycap markings haven't been a least bit damaged and all the regularly used keys still function like new.Delivery was very good with a properly packaged package. No damages whatsoever."
4,"If u are reading this review, if u thinking to buy keyboard for daily use, offical or Non gaming. So please ga ahead and buy it, before you are going that rabbit hole to buy that expensive keyboard.  This works boss, no fuss. I got this along with wireless mouse to attach to my laptop to work from home. Simple living. Keyboard is very good. Does not get struck or make liund noise. I want to thank a amazon review from Australia. He helped me understand that all I needed was this keyboard. Thanks for reading till here. And I hope you must me tired if u are like me. Go ahead and order this and sleep peacefully. Cheers."
5,"I bought this in 2017 December for Rs. 595, and today is 2020 November. Literally 3 whole years and this keyboard is still working absolutely fine with no issue!I'm an everyday PC user, on average about 4 hours daily is must for me. Yet not even a single key has stopped working.Don't hesitate if you're getting this anywhere around Rs. 595 because you won't regret!"
1,The product description says it is spill resistant but it actually  it is not. i spilled coffee on it and it was at room temperature . i let t drain over night but it stopped  working one key by one next morning. also it is not smooth to type ever
5,I'm using phone 9 hours a day and I can peacefully tell you blindly by this keyboard and you will just love it.Please note Logitech is the OEM supplier four major brands like HP Dell extra so even if you buy a HP keyboard it is going to be manufactured by Logitech and name is printed as HP.ProsLightweight keyboardUSB connectorKeystroke is not too long or too shortOverall plastic quality seems goodProper full-size keyboard from a branded companyConsThere is no inbuilt form support that is the only drawback
2,"After reading lot of reviews and and doing good amount of research i bought this keyboad, as many were suggesting this is the best budget keyboard. But it did disappoint me for the below reasons:1. Too noisy  If you are someone who prefer the click sound for every keypress then its not a problem for you. I prefer working in silent environment and the keypress sounds were very distracting for me while writing the code / thinking.2. Long key travel  For laptop users who are used to short key travel, this is big NO as the touch and feel of the keyboard is fully different and you may not like it.3. Feel of the keyboard  For the price we paid we cannot expect a premium keyboard but this one feels very cheap and rough while typing on it, not even worth 500Rs.Pros:1. If you like the traditional keyboard / mechanical keyboard with long keytravel and big keys and want to have them covered in your budget then this keyboard is for you.2. Easy to identify the keys as the print on them is big and bold and clean.As i have been using laptop keyboard for last 4 years, i found Dell kb216 keyboard a much better option as a secondary keyboard than the logitech one."
5,"I purchased this keyboard mainly for gaming. Though it is made of plastic the quality is very good at this price. I was going to by a Rs. 1200 gaming keyboard, but somewhere in my mind I was hesitating to do that. As at that price you don't get mechanical keyboard. But then thought to buy this simple keyboard as the review was very great. And I am glad that I bought this.By the way this keyboard works great for gaming."
5,"The keyboard is really good, the keys are really easy to type in. Overall the experience is very good, and there is a smoothness of the use of the keyboard. I am so happy with this, product. Typing was never my kind of thing, but this has reaffirmed my love for typing back again. Thanks to Logitech, for this wonderful ergonomic product and thanks to AMAZON India for delivering this in a less amount of time. My suggestion is to introduce this keyboard in Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, etc, and other Indian vernacular languages."
3,"Initially I received a defective piece, the CTRL & RETURN key was not working properly.I request for a replacement which was done promptly.The replacement Item worked well for first 52 days. On the 53rd day suddenly it started giving issuesThe keys at the bottom are not working. Return window is already gone.Looking for getting it replaced from service centre. Any help is appreciated"
3,"This is not a great keyboard by any standards. But for a lil more than 500 you really can't ask for much. It's quite flimsy. When I got it first, the num-lock and scroll-lock keys weren't working. I got it exchanged. On the exchanged one I figured scroll-lock is not working. I didn't bother exchanging it again cuz other than when I use MS Excel, I wouldn't need to use scroll-lock much."
1,This is possibly the worst item that I've ever purchased on amazon. The keys hardened so much in a month even with little to no use because of my university exams that it's impossible to type now. I didn't expect this from amazon.
5,"I bought this keyboard to use during my summer internship as a programmer. For the next 3 months, the keyboard went through all sorts of stress-tests and boy did it come out victoriously! The keyboard exceeded my expectations in almost all areas. The keys are big, the presses are deep, the ergonomics are great and the sound of the keys is soft yet affirming. Logitech deserves several accolades for making even their cheapest keyboard a delight to use."
1,"Back to Logitech after using other junk brands for some time.Edit : After 2 years, many buttons stopped working. Opened it up to see the circuit traces almost missing in many places. Seems like the traces just vanish after a while, rendering many keys useless. Very poor reliability."
5,"This is good for normal typing, in fact I used it for a few weeks before I decided to buy a mechanical keyboard. I had once typed 20000 words in a day using this keyboard, and it didn't give me any problem.It is suitable for normal use, the keyboard feels good - if you type 5k words a day or less, then it is a good choice, but for heavy duty use, consider using a cherry mx blue switch keyboard. For its price range, it is the best value for the money."
1,"after using it for few hours, randomly some keys doesn't work properly. When pressed once, it types 8 to 10 times and sometimes doesn't type even once. Had to return it."
4,"UpdateReturned it and got a new one, this one works like a charm. It makes noise but tactile feedback is great. Now I can recommend this to all. But since this is not as good as my old Logitech keyboard from 2006 reducing one star.*****************************************************************************************************************Hi AllThe keys of this keyboard and especially 'space-bar' takes forever to work, you need to press very hard, it feels like you may end up breaking this. Not at all worth it, I have another keyboard from HP and that is simply miles ahead of it.My first desktop purchased in 2006 had Logitech keyboard and that was simply wonderful, worked for6-7 years. While this one isn't worth of Logitech brand, please check my video for details."
4,"Been using Logitech peripherals for over a decade, but when my old keyboard gave up, decided to be a cheapskate and ordered a random keyboard off Amazon. Keyboard gave up within 2 weeks, learned my lesson and came to Logitech. Wisest decision I've made!Been using this keyboard everyday for 7 months and have no complains. For me, SPACEBAR is the first key to break, once it starts wobbling, I know the days of the keyboard are numbered. But the Logitech K120 keys are still as firm as they were when I got them. All keys are uniform and have a nice heft to them. Gives a lot of confidence while typing. Would definitely recommend.Purchased for Rs. 795Would purchase again"
5,"This ergonomically designed full size keyboard is perfect for my heavy duty typing needs.The product more than meets expectations as it comes with a good quality wired logitech mouse.Much better than my Amkette mouse bought from Nehru Place.The lead cables with the keyboard as well as the mouse are adequate in length.Only con, not for me though, is that some users may find it noisy.I bought it despite not so rave reviews and am pretty satisfied with Logitech quality.I can now confidently buy Logitech K400 keyboard for my Ipad."
3,"Keyboard is not bad and though it is little noisy while typing, it is comfortable and able to type fast. However one problem I have noticed which is, when u hold the shift key on both side (left and right shift) and type the underscore key or few other symbols on the number (example - closing bracket on the 0 key) is not working. when you release one of the shift key it is working fine. I am not sure its the issue only with my keyboard. If it is general then Logitech has to look into this. I have never seen this issue on lenovo or Dell keyboard.Example: I wanted to type ORACLE_SID. for typing the first caps word ORACLE  I have to hold the shift key and I generally hold the left shift key. For the underscore, I always use right shift key with the underscore key which is near to 0. while typing underscore, right shift key I am not releasing as I have the second word which is SID in caps to be typed after the underscore. But in this keyboard I always miss underscore as I am holding both the shift keys."
5,"This is an amazing product at this price range. Got a keyboard & mouse combo for 599 and am totally surprised at the quality and feel. Is in no way less than a Dell or HP (I have used  them all) and the price is simply unbelievable. I have 4 keyboards (1 iBall, 2 HP, 1 Dell ) and none of them can beat this. The mouse works great too. If you are looking to buy a keyboard mouse combo, look no further."
4,It's a decent combo for the price range. The mouse is very average and I wouldn't recommend it as it has a poor build. The wheel is delicate and will eventually wear off. It has a high dpi by default which cannot be adjusted so definitely not for gaming as well. The keyboard is great with decent sturdiness back supports and soft keys. Overall a decent combo product by Logitech
5,"Keyboard is great. Nice for daily usage and typing work. 3 years warranty is awesome. It's spill proof, membrane keyboard.It is even better than those membrane keyboards with RGB and price tag of ‚âà 1000 Rs.It is better than any keyboard in range upto 1000.Choose this keyboard if you are looking for budget keyboard.If you want better than this, go for mechanical not less.Final words. Don't lose gold for glitter."
5,"The keyboard delivered was as per desription mentioned.I wanted the standard keyboard (With out multimedia and other keys)  for work from home and looking for  same keyboard as in office and it served the purpose.Recommend Logitech over other cheaper products even though price  is slightly on higher note, one can easily feel the diffrence in smoothness of key stroke."
4,"The small foldable plastic underneath the keyboard of bad design. They broke within a month of purchase. Not talking about the quality of those, but the design is bad. But the keyboard is value for money. Feels great. I use it everyday for 9 hours at work. But I'd not go for this keyboard for gaming. It's great for workstations."
3,"This is a first day review.Working fine.Cable length is short as compare to my earlier Dell keyboard and its very thin also.worst thing is, There is no packaging on keyboard when arrived, only minor bubble rapping, bt still no breakage.price is high i think bcz of branding i think. frm my point of view it should b in between 400 to 500rs."
4,"A very good no frills keyboard for the price. Although a bit noisy (actually I like this) the keys are well spaced and there is no danger of hitting two keys at a time. And no, I have not yet had occasion to  test the spill-proof quality of the keyboard!"
4,"Decent all-purpose keyboard. This one, however, started giving me a problem within just a week. The left-Control key sometimes doesn't get pressed, and I have to change the angle as I press it. I bought another piece of the same model just a couple of months ago, and that's fine. My first Logitech complaint ever! :-("
1,"When I plugged the keyboards usb into my computer and then getting a message : USB Device Not Recognized, and also I have tried on other Laptop and Computers but getting same problem."
1,Nothing great about it. Multiple keys have started to give issues after 1 year of use. They are hard to press. In comparision I have Dell keyboard for past 8 years at work and it is extremely smooth and silent.
5,"One of the best keyboards from Logitech, keys are buttery smooth, writers delight typing day and night, you won't feel the stress, the buttons register perfectly when pressed without any pressure. The K120 is better in terms of the other expensive versions out there. Go for it with no second thoughts."
4,"i have used mechanical keyboard they are 10x costly , if you are not into gaming this is the best keyboard i can suggest which is rugged and economical and gives a good feed back if you are looking for a gaming one better go for a mechanical ones"
5,Excellent Keyboard. I am using Linux Machine and the keyboard started working without any installation of drivers. Keyboard typing feels like typing a mechanical keyboard rather than soft keyboard which is why I liked it a lot.
5,"If you are looking for a keyboard on which you have to type for extended hours, then stop searching any further and buy this one. An ideal keyboard for office work should help you type effortlessly and this thing serves the purpose."
1,The keyboard cane broken from the side. I fixed it with the tape. Didn‚Äôt went for replacement as I require it for my office work as replacement takes a lot of time.The packaging was pathetic üò°
5,"It‚Äôs bit slow. definitely not for gaming. For normal usage(browsing, emails, videos) best value for money. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs spill proof. And made of very normal plastic. Back space key is small (normal key size of alphabets) which is a minus I feel."
5,Excellent keyboard. Full value for money. And what better than to know that it made in India. The keys are soft and tactile. It doesnt make a lot of sound while typing. Very smooth key travel. Excellent fit typing fast.  I am very satisfied with the product and highly recommend all to buy this one. Go for it guys.
5,I received the product today...the packaging wa excellently done and delivered on time....talking of the product....there were no defects in any respect...the quality is quite good....and the keys are comfortably pressed......the only thing it lacks are the rubber pads which could have made the object less slippery when typed upon. . . . Overall a very good product with an excellent price range. . .
1,"please please please do not buy any product from this seller or this company, product does not even last for 6 months and when you call customer care to claim warranty they say that the warranty is valid from manufacturing date regardless of even if it is billed 3 months after the manufacturing date to end user, amazon billed me for a keyboard for 23rd june and i purchased on 22nd june but the company refused to give warranty on faulty keyboard saying its company regulations that we give warranty from manufacturing date regardless when you have brought it. And the company is not willing to listen for any kind of reason and just washed their hands off and refuse to give warranty."
5,I have been using this keyboard for a while now (few months) and at this price range ooh man it impressed me .the keys are well built all and every thing is functional the cable is durable the body is sturdy and solid . I literally trash the keyboard while Playing games but it's still giving it's best performance.there is no significant delay as such.I would say go for it
5,"Letters in other branded keyboards fade away after 6 months or so of use. But in this best-quality kb letters are a sort of  ""carved"" land they do not fade at all even safter years of use. That is why I prefer ProDot."
3,Review after 25 days of use.Overall good. Working fast. The only problem I am facing is the 'k' key need hard press its not smooth as rest of the keys.Will recommend in this price. If you have budget then go for branded one.
1,"When I have received the parcel, and opened the package, the packaging was too poor and the box of the keyboard is quite shred and It seemed like previously opened and used. After connecting with pc it was not working properly, keys were not responding. So I claimed to return the product. And fortunately I received the refund."
4,After using 15 days i can say that 1 sometimes key get get struck so sometime it hard to press2. Backspace key is small so while typing if there is a mistake in text than you have to see key firstBut overall quality is quite good usb cable with it is made of good quality
5,"Best keyboard in this price range you also want to purchase this iem if you want to buy a keyboard via online thi is aweaome keyboard for daily use and i am type this review by this keyborad which keyboard you see above your screen,................THANKS [MR SHOBHIT PAL]"
4,I like this product...perfectly all keys are works.... Nice packaging  and early deliverd......
5,"I use this product for my laptop, overall good product the only thing is that it has a new Rupee symbol but don't know how to type it. I have tried everything but couldnt type it out on screen."
5,"best keyboard i found packaging A1 and build quality is comparable to high end keyboards and best part is that i got it in only Rs 310 , but you can get it cheaper in Offline shops , may be in Rs 150/- and Last but not least ITS MADE IN INDIA ."
5,Super keyboard in market in this price... It cost me 305 rupees... Built quality is average.. And fresh product.. You also smell  plastic as new bornüòÇüòÇ. Nice made in India productüëåüëåüëå go for it...
5,For me most important is made in India.This is not great like TVS keyboard but in this price range it's best. You can go with this  keyboard
1,"The quality is hell pathetic. Not worth it. If you cannot provide a good product at this price, why the hell you are selling it at this price."
1,I bought this keyboard in this month and realize that this is faulty. Keys not working and  wire is broken. Amazon policy of return is also not there
5,"Very good keyboard, very less sound while typing, and soft keys. USB keyboard best in this cost."
5,This product have an issue that is if we press enter button from left side it never come up.Reason I bought it was it is made in india.And not returning it ..I will manage but look on this issue for your products improvement
3,It's overall pretty decent according to the rate. But the left shift has become faulty after 2 months of use. It has collapsed and i have to press it hard. Rest the keys are smooth and it's recommended for low budget.
1,"Quality is Very Bad, few key while pressing near key also will press, few key will stuck"
5,"Keyboard built quality is good ans made of ABS plastic.Feels sturdy and  comes near to Logitech's built quality and smooth keys, and far better than zebronics.Cable quality is goodmade in India üáÆüá≥"
5,"I found the item functions well inspite of it being quite compact and smaller in size, compared to other keyboards."
5,Nice and good for daily usage of keyboard.
5,This is amazing...perfec product in this price..The value of this product is low on this price.. perfect packing..#loveamazon # loveproDotkeyboard
5,The packaging was quite goodThe keyboard works really well and its very smooth. For first timers it will take couple of days to get used to it as it very sensitive
5,Made in india awesome durable product
4,This product is damaged.but it's work is good.it is working in android phone with the support of OTG cable.Replacement product is good.
4,It's stands are breaking.
4,Soft keys very convenient to use.
4,The keys are ultra ultra soft and the quality is good
1,Procust is of low quality and vry delicate to use ..If u press a button 1 time it will write that word 2-3 times !Poor quality meterial used
5,This is1. indian product.2. Very low price3. Best for normal daily uses4. Light weight.
5,This keyboard comes with very low price and good quality not best qualityDurability not so very good but is good for do some workYou can do also gaming with this keyboard.
3,"Very soft keys afraid of whether it may broke when used it bit hard, spacing between keys are less (when compare to HP) keyboard."
5,Works well after 6 months of use
4,Started using the product. So far working fine as expected. Good packaging & short delivery time. Happy Customer üôÇ
4,"I think it is good for gaming,not sure about the durability though as I have only used it for a month. The price is an issue as the box has a lower price printed than what I bought it for"
4,Good
5,"This is such a nice product. I was skeptical choosing the green colour, but it turned out to be even better than the pictures. I am using it with my Macbook Pro and connecting it was seamless. Mac will ask your help to setup this keyboard and once done, you can use it like a normal keyboard. The Windows button on this keyboard will be mapped to the Command key of the mac.In terms of design & aesthetics, it's just stunning. The keystrokes are lovely, there is good enough sound (not too loud) and the overall experience is very good. I type a lot and it doesn't hurt my hands after long typing sessions. You can remove the keys and clean them. It's a beautiful mech keyboard. If you want something different which will not be primarily for gaming, this is your thing. The mouse is good as well, nothing special though.Overall, highly recommend."
5,"I ordered this keyboard because I was in great need of one. It‚Äôs pretty cute and the colours fit perfectly with each other. The green colour scheme coupled with a few white ones make the mechanical key caps pop! It‚Äôs very satisfying to type on and if you‚Äôre looking for a mechanical keyboard with a spunky colour scheme as well as an aesthetic piece of hardware for your computer, go for it. This is the cheapest keyboard (of great quality) available on the market today and I loved this product so much that I simply had to write a review. It‚Äôs a one time investment that‚Äôll last seemingly forever if you look after it and works on batteries which are replaceable.GO FOR IT!!"
5,"I've wanted a fancy mechanical keyboard for so long. This one works just fine. The keys sound amazing. The colors are so pretty in real. The photos couldn't do justice. I actually wanted blue & green versions of this keyboard too but settled on this one cuz they look like yummy candies. Enough about the looks, this actually works pretty well. The mouse is perfectly sized and snug in your hands. It was a bit fast in the start but then I adjusted the settings in my laptop now it works just like how I wanted it to. The keys are a bit closely set together but you'll eventually get used to it. I mean this is my third day and (I write a hell lot of essays) I'm already used to it. I play a decent amount of RPG games too and I love using this keyboard for light gaming. One suggestion I have for the manufacturers is about the indicator lights.  They are placed on the slope of the rounded edge of the keyboard and I can't really sometimes see if the caps lock is on or not. But that's just a minor issue. Really love this product and highly recommend it. If i find anything I don't like about it in the future I will update the review.p.s forgive my lq grainy pics."
5,Satisfied is an understatement for this keyboard. It hits the mechanical type satisfaction to a 100%
1,"Hi,Here I will try to type my feedback with this keyboard, with my regular typing speed. You may guess how busy the keys are in the keyboard.Very cluttered, here is the typing without correcting them:I was impress witgh the desigbn abd thought it could be a very good kjeytboard for mne, but aftewr getting it, I am trying to type with my regular spoeed anbd you can judge ghow vbad the key arrangements are in this keyboiard.The same pareagraph if I type with my old keytbopard, I will not have these many mistakes for suyre. as the keys are well arranfged there.overall, not happy with the keyboard. also overpriced.Thanks,"
1,"Ohh..my...godd.. looking at the previous reviews and all, I thought it'd be great to own this keyboard, but in all honesty, it looks like something an 11 yr old kid would own. It's just not suited to anything I can imagine owning.Secondly, it doesn't fit the Mac environment. The keys for volume controls don't work, and the brightness settings are set on num lock and the next key.I could recommend this to people who like owning candy themed accessories, that they hardly use. For everyone else, I'd strongly recommend against this purchase."
5,"I love the keyboard! The quality is great and looks very aesthetic. The sound of the keys is veryy satisfying and I definately recomment buying it! Was delivered within 2 days which was really quick! And it is worth the cost. By looking at the photos I thought that the keyboard and mouse would be a little smaller in size but its perfect! And also I faced this problem so here is a little tip - There will be a Protective film on all the batteries so remove that and there will also be a film on the mouse on the white part (Look in the photo) remove that film its very thin so might be hard to remove. It might prevent you from smoothly run the cursor so removing that helps. And yes, Batteries ARE included!"
4,"If you're planning to buy this considering it has mechanical keys type , then it's strict no no . Otherwise the product looks good in terms of appearance. The letters are printed without proper alignment. It's a little bulky-feel keyboard with thick round edges. Overall It does justice to the retro keyboard style."
5,Excellent colours and amazing typing experience
4,"It's a nice looking keyboard with good build quality. One issue is since it has round keys as compared to square that we are generally accustomed of, it takes time to adjust and very often it leads to mistypes.Mouse is also quite ergonomic and respond nicely on any surface"
4,"I have been using them 2-3 dats max and believe me i am impressed with their looks , functionality. Operating with this keyboard/mouse combo is not problematic. It is very easy to get them setup ising the nano receiver within the mouse . All in all nice product but yes price can be a little less ."
4,Look wise it's a beauty. It's truly a novelty item. You will take some time to operate it as comfortable as your old keyboard. Function wise there is a room for improvement. Missing the mechanical sound experience. Mouse is bit big in size which makes it less convenient.
5,~Its produces sound which is relaxing and looks exactly as shown in the picture...connects to usb port dongle given in the mouse's battery section~using it for a month now no issues faced!~nice alternative for those very costly typewriter keyboards and is aesthetic looking!
5,"We all remember the old school key boards and mouse. This feels exactly the same. Both the keyboard and mouse are good. No lags detected so far. I use it for office purpose. If you're looking for gaming , this isn't for you."
5,"I was very skeptical about buying this product but it‚Äôs one of my best purchases. I was very confused between the pink and the green, n I‚Äôm glad I choose the green. It‚Äôs very soothing on the eye compared to the to pink one. It‚Äôs worth buying if u want to feel the nostalgia of typewriters."
1,"Contrary to the positive reviews which led me to try this out, keyboard is not comfortable to type on. I spend > 8hrs a day typing/coding. The fingers don't rest comfortably and it's difficult to type fast. I'm using a Thinkpad T460s and I'm back to it's keyboard."
5,"On time delivery, key board is same as expected,colour is also same as display in picture, use keyboard sice 1 months,no problem till the date,keys are very smooth and typing noise is osum. Mouse also looks good,works smooth and hold in Pam perfectly... overall happy with performance ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
4,"Nice, feels like type writer.Work efficiently.Mouse is super cute.Sounds like a normal keyboard typewriter type.But overall super cute.Not for gaming"
5,I bought this Product for personal use and office use for my huawei t5 tab and the quality plus delivery service and packaging was great. As the product got delivered today so this is my review for now. After 1month of usage I'll share my experience too
1,few keys are not working. please help to get it replace. i bought it on 2 may 2021 from amazon.
4,Cute design..works well!!
2,"The keys are placed very close to each other, found this extremely difficult to type on"
5,Both keyboard and mouse are great. The look is also great.
4,Good quality. Exactly same as shown in pictures.
4,Aesthetic looks..works fine but my upper most keywords are not working...
5,Very very good. Working as expected.
4,Good built in awesome colour really love it üòä
5,If you haven't used it than you hane seen nothing
4,Good Quality product. Easy to use
4,"Pretty cute! Love the light build, doesn't give too much of a plasticy feel, even the mouse is really nice to hold and the clacky sounds are just gorgeous! Like ASMR while working, it's so satisfying to work on! Only problem is it'll take a while to adjust to. The keys are closer together so I end up pressing the wrong ones or two at once. It's gonna take a while, but it'll be good practice. Overall it's worth it!"

I play a decent amount of RPG games too and I love using this keyboard for light gaming. One suggestion I have for the manufacturers is about the indicator lights.  They are placed on the slope of the rounded edge of the keyboard and I can't really sometimes see if the caps lock is on or not. But that's just a minor issue. Really love this product and highly recommend it. If i find anything I don't like about it in the future I will update the review.p.s forgive my lq grainy pics."
5,Satisfied is an understatement for this keyboard. It hits the mechanical type satisfaction to a 100%
1,"Hi,Here I will try to type my feedback with this keyboard, with my regular typing speed. You may guess how busy the keys are in the keyboard.Very cluttered, here is the typing without correcting them:I was impress witgh the desigbn abd thought it could be a very good kjeytboard for mne, but aftewr getting it, I am trying to type with my regular spoeed anbd you can judge ghow vbad the key arrangements are in this keyboiard.The same pareagraph if I type with my old keytbopard, I will not have these many mistakes for suyre. as the keys are well arranfged there.overall, not happy with the keyboard. also overpriced.Thanks,"
1,"Ohh..my...godd.. looking at the previous reviews and all, I thought it'd be great to own this keyboard, but in all honesty, it looks like something an 11 yr old kid would own. It's just not suited to anything I can imagine owning.Secondly, it doesn't fit the Mac environment. The keys for volume controls don't work, and the brightness settings are set on num lock and the next key.I could recommend this to people who like owning candy themed accessories, that they hardly use. For everyone else, I'd strongly recommend against this purchase."
5,"I love the keyboard! The quality is great and looks very aesthetic. The sound of the keys is veryy satisfying and I definately recomment buying it! Was delivered within 2 days which was really quick! And it is worth the cost. By looking at the photos I thought that the keyboard and mouse would be a little smaller in size but its perfect! And also I faced this problem so here is a little tip - There will be a Protective film on all the batteries so remove that and there will also be a film on the mouse on the white part (Look in the photo) remove that film its very thin so might be hard to remove. It might prevent you from smoothly run the cursor so removing that helps. And yes, Batteries ARE included!"
4,"If you're planning to buy this considering it has mechanical keys type , then it's strict no no . Otherwise the product looks good in terms of appearance. The letters are printed without proper alignment. It's a little bulky-feel keyboard with thick round edges. Overall It does justice to the retro keyboard style."
5,Excellent colours and amazing typing experience
4,"It's a nice looking keyboard with good build quality. One issue is since it has round keys as compared to square that we are generally accustomed of, it takes time to adjust and very often it leads to mistypes.Mouse is also quite ergonomic and respond nicely on any surface"
4,"I have been using them 2-3 dats max and believe me i am impressed with their looks , functionality. Operating with this keyboard/mouse combo is not problematic. It is very easy to get them setup ising the nano receiver within the mouse . All in all nice product but yes price can be a little less ."
4,Look wise it's a beauty. It's truly a novelty item. You will take some time to operate it as comfortable as your old keyboard. Function wise there is a room for improvement. Missing the mechanical sound experience. Mouse is bit big in size which makes it less convenient.
5,~Its produces sound which is relaxing and looks exactly as shown in the picture...connects to usb port dongle given in the mouse's battery section~using it for a month now no issues faced!~nice alternative for those very costly typewriter keyboards and is aesthetic looking!
5,"We all remember the old school key boards and mouse. This feels exactly the same. Both the keyboard and mouse are good. No lags detected so far. I use it for office purpose. If you're looking for gaming , this isn't for you."
5,"I was very skeptical about buying this product but it‚Äôs one of my best purchases. I was very confused between the pink and the green, n I‚Äôm glad I choose the green. It‚Äôs very soothing on the eye compared to the to pink one. It‚Äôs worth buying if u want to feel the nostalgia of typewriters."
1,"Contrary to the positive reviews which led me to try this out, keyboard is not comfortable to type on. I spend > 8hrs a day typing/coding. The fingers don't rest comfortably and it's difficult to type fast. I'm using a Thinkpad T460s and I'm back to it's keyboard."
5,"On time delivery, key board is same as expected,colour is also same as display in picture, use keyboard sice 1 months,no problem till the date,keys are very smooth and typing noise is osum. Mouse also looks good,works smooth and hold in Pam perfectly... overall happy with performance ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
4,"Nice, feels like type writer.Work efficiently.Mouse is super cute.Sounds like a normal keyboard typewriter type.But overall super cute.Not for gaming"
5,I bought this Product for personal use and office use for my huawei t5 tab and the quality plus delivery service and packaging was great. As the product got delivered today so this is my review for now. After 1month of usage I'll share my experience too
1,few keys are not working. please help to get it replace. i bought it on 2 may 2021 from amazon.
4,Cute design..works well!!
2,"The keys are placed very close to each other, found this extremely difficult to type on"
5,Both keyboard and mouse are great. The look is also great.
4,Good quality. Exactly same as shown in pictures.
4,Aesthetic looks..works fine but my upper most keywords are not working...
5,Very very good. Working as expected.
4,Good built in awesome colour really love it üòä
5,If you haven't used it than you hane seen nothing
4,Good Quality product. Easy to use
4,"Pretty cute! Love the light build, doesn't give too much of a plasticy feel, even the mouse is really nice to hold and the clacky sounds are just gorgeous! Like ASMR while working, it's so satisfying to work on! Only problem is it'll take a while to adjust to. The keys are closer together so I end up pressing the wrong ones or two at once. It's gonna take a while, but it'll be good practice. Overall it's worth it!"
1,"When you press N, it shows bn on the screen.& when you press Shift+N it shows BNNNNNN on the screen.Very bad keyboard"
3,"I had to return this due to a confusing keyboard layout.Number line right below the function keys had the numbers and special characters printed differently.Semicolon key also had the same issue.If you press Shift key to get the upper lined characters, you would actually get the lower ones.Seller should have done a quality check before sending this."
5,"Wow , was the first thing that my heart and mind felt, the moment I held the keyboard in my hand. To be very honest , keeping in consideration the selling price the product s as they say "" the value of money"" . And when I started using it for the first time , Yes , Amazon s amazing... The customer service attitude in all aspects whether that s quality of the products Amazon sells is wonderfully flawless ... and in case we sometimes return products Amazon had always been honest ...Thank you"
5,"*Palm rest , laptop Like keys,great typing experience .*In this price bracket ,there are so many options available from well established brands ,like zebronics,iball,intex etc etc .So I was sceptical about this brand ,Zinq.But i choose this product because of two major reasons  :Keys layout looks almost like a laptop keyboard .The palm rest ,which is only available in the keyboards of price 10x higher than this .After the purchase :Keys are super tactile and smooth ,too sensitive for my liking ,it will take some time to get use to it .USB port and wire are of good quality .Overall it's a great product so far . Value for money ."
4,"Lightweight keyboard. Received a good fully working product, thank you Amazon.The keys have a bit rubbery & bouncy feeling, and I found it a little uncomfortable to do fast typing with this keyboard ... after some time I am getting a discomfort on the fingertips ,,, I am taking some time to get used to the new kind of key feeedback on my fingertips.But it is a value-for-money product, not meant for the pros. You cannot expect TVS Gold - type key feedback for this price."
5,"Steps to use ‚Çπ Rupee SymbolÔÇ∑ Download the Rupee Keyboard software to your computer from zinq website.ÔÇ∑ Unzip the ‚ÄúRupee_Keyboard.zip‚Äù file to any folder on your computerÔÇ∑ Double click the ‚ÄúRupee Installer.exe‚Äù‚Äù from the unzipped files and follow theonscreen instructionsÔÇ∑ This will install four new fonts to your computerÔÇ∑ Now, double click the ‚ÄúKeyboard Install.exe‚Äù from the unzipped files and wait till theinstallation isÔÇ∑ This will install a new keyboard layout in your computerÔÇ∑ Restart your computerÔÇ∑ Now you can click on the small keyboard icon on bottom right corner of the screenand enable the ‚ÄúRupee Foradian Keyboard Layout‚ÄùÔÇ∑ Double check that the ‚ÄúRupee Foradian Keyboard Layout‚Äù is activeÔÇ∑ Now you can use the key with Rupee symbol printed to type the rupee symbol byselecting the ‚ÄúRupee Foradian Standard font‚Äù in the application you are using. Forexample, Word, Excel etc."
4,"Purchased two of these keyboards , and found them useful. There is one thing which I did not like and wanted to provide you all an update is that the keys are little bit slow for fast typing . When I try to type fast , the realise that the key which was pressed earlier has not come back yet or does not have too much pressure for second time typing within a fraction of seconds. I still feel this is a very good keyboard in the given price range. What could be improved is the key response time , the key should come back faster after typing a character on the keyboard. So finally I would like to say that this keyboard is not for professional or gaming purpose , however it is very much useful for regular browsing , sure ring and online classes. The build quality is good and the keyboard does not slip while working."
1,This keyboard+mouse combo has not lasted even for a month. Mouse has lost its sensitivity and the scroll has become completely unpredictable. Keyboard is also poor but the mouse undoubtedly leads the competition.Keyboard has the unique ability to type a character multiple times while the key is pressed only once. So entering a password at any website is the most challenging task.I am fed up with this typing adventure so I just plugged my old keyboard & mouse back to the PC to share this critic.Please use your money wisely and buy some longer lasting & reliable product.
5,"I have bought this for working from home. Since it is just a keyboard, I didn't do much research, the only research I have done was to find an Indian made product. Unfortunately, Indian made keyboards are very rare, so ended up buying this Chinese made product. Anyways, I am happy. The keys are smooth. The font is stylish. Could have avoided labeling the brand name in the space-bar."
1,The keyboard is very hard and the keys don't work if you are used to pressing them the normal way. The only way to use the keyboard is if you can hit the keys hard like old type writers. Very uncomfortable and almost useless.The mouse is of very cheap quality. The scroll button the middle doesn't work half the time and sometimes scrolls in opposite direction. Mouse buttons are very hard too.
2,"Both keyboard and mouse are noisy. Both miss keystrokes and mouse move about 1 of 5 times. This makes it difficult at times to pin point and click with mouse as it needs few extra moves to adjust. I still do not know how to use the rupee symbol as it does not have ""Alt Gr"". Maybe it needs some settings."
1,"Some of the keys of the keyboard were not working and some of the keys were repeating automatically.I was pressing once and it was typing 4-5 times. Very annoying experience.Although it wasted my time and spoilt my mood, but thanks to Amazon that it refunded me in full."
2,"Keyboard is ultrasensitive. A single key depression results in multiple characters being typed out. Not for typing purpose at all. Speed typing not possible as for every character (forget word), one needs to keep a close eye and keep correcting with backspaces and Delete button"
5,"Combo is nice, only one thing missing in the keyboard is palm rest, but considering its price it's good enough for smooth and silent typing. Decent mouse. Really love using it."
1,"Useless product. I bought it on 10/01. But it is not working from yesterday, 10/19. Worked only for like 15 days. I want replacement. I dint even use it much."
2,The keyboard is actually veey good and light weight and good to use. But when I was using it I realised there was a hole to the edge of the keyboard and found it was actually broken. So I returned it asking for a replacement. I received my replacement in 2 days and I was astonished to first see that it was the same box that I sent as I remember a small tear in the box. When I opened it there was a keyboard inside that was further broken. I can't say if it was the same keyboard or another one but how can you send a highly damaged keyboard?
5,"Value for money product, this keyboard is lightweight, easy to type, but not suitable for gaming, 5 star for this keyboard"
3,Can‚Äôt expect more from a keyboard at this price .. solves the purpose and has been performing well after 3 months of usage..The drawback however is that the key layout is old style closely stacked without the gaps between the keys which sometimes results in typing errors
3,"ü§óü§™A Good Product with no defects or malfunctioning keys, all is wellü•∞ü§ëüòÄüòùLightweight & Textured finish hence helpful in being Dirt & Dust Repellent. ü§£üòÅüòéü§©Delivered on time by Amazon. Hats off to the seller Appario, Bangalore. ü§°ü§ì"
1,I purchase keyboad on 30/november/2020Not working date :  09/march/2021Today date  14/april/2021I using only 3 month now not working  waste of moneySome keys are automatically  visible with continuously.My advice do not buy this productThe keyboad through it on dustbinWaste of money
5,"Comfortable keyboard keys, Just as new design keys. Mouse also so comfortable within hands. Click & scrolling is better than any other same range mouses. Don't need to think twice... Just Buy it. ‚ù§Ô∏è I bought these combo item in ‚Çπ469 INR only in ( Deal of the Day sell ). Delivery is also superb. Also, Amazon always deliver his best.Thanks Amazon ‚óâ‚Äø‚óâ"
5,I had very low expectations at this price point but this keyboard blew me away. This is literally one of the best feeling membrane keyboard that i have ever used
3,"Product is good. Light weight, comfortable keys. But giving 3 stars because of seller. Seller has sent the damaged piece. This is not damaged during transportation as I couldn't find the broken pieces in the box. This product doesn't have return policy. It has only replace policy. I needed this urgently. So forced to use the damaged piece."
1,"Bought this keyboard two months ago. within one month it started to work wierdly. pressing 's' would bring 'cs', right arrow works as backspace, space getting stuck randomly. a lot of stuff. really bad choice. I regret it."
5,ZINQ is net level technology. Its accessories is top class . Keys are very comfortable  like TVS keyboards.
4,Does it job without any issue.Good for the price so go for it.
5,Probably best in this range.. smooth keys and lightweight.. good value for money product.. big in size though..
5,"The key are smooth.Very good for light gaming, and typing in this keyboard is very much satisfying.If the budget too low, go for it."
5,Thnx amazon.in for such nice product delivered within 24 hours of bookingMony worthüëåüèª‚úåüòä
1,Worst product. The new one received n later found the Function keys are not working. It was my bad the return timeline was over n need to deal with such defective product. Did not expect such miss from quality by Amazon.
5,"It's a wonderful Combo in this price range 469/- rs , keyboard keys are very comfortable, keyboard is light weight & thin, best for this price range, You can blindly purchase it.!!"
5,I loved those keys and mouse is buttery smooth...In old reviews it may be bad but now they all had changed themselves and now they are sending a quality product at low budget...It satisfied my budget...
5,"Keyboard is light.All keys work, including function keys. Been using for 3 weeks, no issuesThe only con is that It's a little noisyI paid 300 for it-worth the buy."
1,"I purchased in January 2021,in may2021 it's not working, no customer service in Hyderabad, worrest keyboard, friends don't purchase this keyboard"
5,Looks beautiful and stylish in an affordable price. Hope it will work a long
4,"I am writing this review after 2months of usage, Product is in Good condition.I will recommend to buy this product and with lower cost.Don't expect smart look, it will be looking like normal keyboard."
2,Keyboard Quality is above averagebut Mouse is not good
2,Quality wise nice..soft for operating. but better to buy costly branded keyboard. With in 30fays exactly now my keyboard not working.
4,"Keyboard is very nice, light weight and long press keys are impressive.But Num lock and caps lock lights are not visible clearly in day time.Finally value for money."
2,"I had to buy another keyboard, because in this one the backspace was constantly stuck if you didn't press it exactly in the middle, that made me crazy."
1,You can see well. How's the product.
1,After using ....keys are so hard while typing....every key is so strucking ....completely disappointed....have to buy another one ...Please don't sell these type of products in Amazon....Better don't sell cheap items....The brand I ball also got bad impress ion ....I lost hope on I ball...
3,Just okay. The keys are soft but the ENTER on the numpad doesn't always work properly. Works as a temporary replacement only.I will switch back to my TVS GOLD once it's repaired.
1,"I know seller rating is awsome but first time i was bad experienced from seller and this is waste products do not buy I ball keyboard I had bought in 26 December but i received in 2 january and the dot key is not working then According to seller rating I guess it mistake from seller but I think next time, it will deliver good product so, I decided to return this product on 2 january and it reached my place on 7 january and then main part the (A) alphabet is entered inside and doesn't work then so i decided to refund my money overall experience is bad for I ball keyboard. I had attached images and video and I don't recommend to buy this keyboard online and specially from seller Appario Retail Private Ltd."
1,"Poor quality. Press one number, double numbers are typed. Defective keys"
1,"I have used Keyboards right from Logitech, Microsoft, TVS, Dell, Quantum, Terrabytes and few unknown brand keyboards so far. Except one brand which had hard keys, all other were soft for typing.Coming to this iBall Keyboard...its peculiar as given below.1. Key ""M"" is very hard2. Key ""I"" is already well downside and not pushing up much.3. Keys ""O"", ""P"" and ""Backspace"" are slightly downside and not pushing up much.4. Some keys are slightly hard or slightly soft type5. Some keys (Function keys) are soft.I am not sure how anyone can type with this kind of keyboard. So, dont buy seeing the offer price and 3 years warranty provided."
1,This product is virtually unusable.  Several keys type double and one has to make endless corrections. The lettering on the keys is poor and hardly visible except in very very bright light. Go for another model.
1,"Pressing 'l' key does not register randomly, causing lots of distraction and subconscious fatigue.iBall's support is so pathetic. Just throw out the keyboard when you run into an issue."
5,"I have always been a fan of iBall keyboard. Unfortunately, 2 years ago my keyboard died and I had to buy a new one. At the time I bought an HP 160 combo. Something didn't feel right but had no choice so kept using it. Now I needed another keyboard and thought of the old love. By this time I had forgotten the iBall experience. The keyboard seemed smaller than the HP 160. But the keys are bigger. So started typing and by the time I completed a line, I realized why I was craving for the iball experience. This keyboard is butter smooth. I can feel the smoothness in every word I type. Won't ever buy any other brand's peripherals again. iBall for life!"
1,Earlier I don't know why I gave review as good product. but I think that's my early reaction. In last 20 years I used so many keyboards. I never thought I'll be writing complaint about any keyboard. Because it's rare thing to be stopped working. I'll never recommend this brands keyboard. First of all there is big issue with Control button and I think it's common because same issue my friend is also facing and now button Z is not working.  ‚òπÔ∏è
1,"The iball keyboards are used to be great, but not as expected now. This review I'm writing just after 5 minutes of use. Keys are soft but had lot of friction while typing. Give away lot of buzzing noise that irritates hell lot. Now stuck with it as there is only replacement and not returning. I have to throw it away (will send it to some school) and already purchased another one"
4,Been using for the last 2 months.  Very good product.
2,"Received the keyboard during corona. Didn't use it for some days. After the replacement period of 7 days, realized that some keys don't work. The period and the z key for example have to be pressed a few times before they actually work. Otherwise it looks to be a good product Regular size, light weight."
3,After using for 4 months i am writing this review.  Initially it was good but after 4 months back space not working.Planning to buy Logitech this time.
4,"I have been working from home since the past one year and thought of buying a cheap and durable keyboard. iBall was a no brainer since it is a known brand, I got this keyboard for Rs. 359 and have been using it for more than 6 months now. The numeric keypad is great for quick input of numbers and the keyboard is great to use. Just go for it if you are looking for a keyboard for general work and your budget is less than Rs. 500.The only flaw I found was that the number 6 key in the numeric keypad would come twice on the screen if I pressed it once - this was fixed by removing the key and placing the rubber under it correctly."
2,"The keyboard switches and panel are quite good. But the connecting wire curls up and ""memorizes"" it so that it automatically curls every time. You have to keep on uncurling it.If they change the wire/cord, its a great keyboard. But until then, I am afraid its useless. Sorry."
1,The Keyboard was defective within 20 working days. Had to run around to give the defective product at iBall service centre. Today we are almost 2 months in waiting but no response from the service centre or any final settlement of the defective product. Most pathetic service - iBall Should CLOSE its business rather than creating FRAUD.
1,The keyboard they supplied first was defective the [ was pressed down . I asked for a replacement and even that key board is defective. The 0 key is pressed down.not aligned properly. Not sure how many times I will have to ask for repolacement foir this Rs 349 keyboard. Killing my parience. For the first time I have received such a bad product from amazon.  once i request for a rupee keyboard it asks us the purchase RAR extractar file for Rs 349/- The free smart keys multilingual from akrutisoftware is not to be seen anywhere in the website.
3,"Really wonder why the Home/End, Page up/Page down, and Insert/Delete keys are interchanged from the usual place where they must have been....This led to a lot of typo for me.  Threw it out after just a week use, as the P and O keys lost their normal function; either I have to punch them hard or for a single press 2 or 3 P and O gets typed...."
3,"everything is perfect and all is very good ,but the no 1,2,3 keys have some issues  . they automatically pressed multiple times when u press only once , this is really very irritating ."
1,Worst performance after one week keys are operated automatically please dont buy this first operate correctly after don't compability with any os alla are same operated automatically
5,A very Good keyboard of nice size and good functionality. Best suited for desktops and other regular use with tabs and laptops. Built material satisfactory. Performance is very good
2,"This is not the keyboard for fast typers. The space is not working. One should press in the middle of the space bar in order to space. If you keep pressing corner side, it won't work. I don't like it."
4,Good design user friendly the keys are soft and yet firm special thing it is water reistant and works flawless
5,The first keyboard I got from the seller had got a defect. It's num-lock key was pressed. So asked for replacement and got a new one. This time the keyboard was good. And rating it after around a month of use.  Did not try it for gaming though.  But for day to day use it's good.
5,This is my second partnership with this laptop the earlier one is used for 5 years and bought one more last year.No complaints. You can rage on this laptop no matter how hard you use it none of the buttons get damaged.
5,"Bought this to maintain some distance from laptop as WFH is becoming new normal and had to maintain a proper posture. Overall, it's good quality and worthy!"
1,Please do not buy this. The key board stopped working in 15 days.... My return window also got closed. I won't recommended this product to anyone.
4,"The keyboard works fine. The paint used for marking the alphabets and numbers apparently has a ""glitter"" element. This makes it difficult to read the keyboard under artificial light."
1,"Not a good product, stopped working after a month and there is no help from iball service center regarding warranty"
5,giid
5,It's wow ! Light weight but very delicate ! Keys are soft .. not for rough uses !! ... worthy of discount price
3,"This item not for gaming, good product but expensive. If the price between rs250 to rs300, then it's a value for money product"
1,"Plastic quality is too bad, Very less weight. looks like the Alphabet print may fade after some time."
2,The keys are getting stuck while typing. Avoid. Backspace key works only if pressed hard otherwise doesn't.
2,"i got delivered with 2 of the keys not working. the numbers 2 & 3 in the number pad next to num lock, the letter z was not in level with other keys might be overweight placed over in shipping or handling... I have requested a replacement, hope it would work fine..."
4,"Average quality. Not soft key strokes. Good as alternative, but not for gaming. Timely delivery"
1,Num is not working very bad quality keyboardDon't bye key form online site
1,"12 keys are not working. I asked for replacement but no response yet. This is pure ""cheating"" They gave me a damaged piece."
1,Please don't buy this keyboard key's are very small build quality is poor f12 key not working packing was great my rating 1/5
5,"Feels comfortable to rest your wrists on it. Offers sufficient elevation as required by most thick keyboards.I had powder coat paint on the desk so it always slipped and didn't stay in place. So, I taped it with double-sided foam tape and that's okay. it's not a problem with the product but my desk surface.One more thing, I found it more suitable to use it inverted, as shown in the attached image, due to its shape."
3,"Comfortable but not for a long time use. Left side is wide enough for a proper rest, the middle is however very thin. (mentioning the width of the cushion, not height) usually you'd rest your right hand in the middle area when typing. It felt not so soft at first but after a few days of use it's decent and comfortable."
2,Durability not good as the rubber has started cracking in few weeks of usage.
3,Expensive
5,The design of the keyboard is very stylish. It has soft keys for smooth and effortless typing. The small shortcut keys beside the keyboard makes it a complete keyboard in a budget range.
1,"this was my first and last amkette product.. very very poor quality. many keys stopped working after 10-15 days, now it is completely useless for me. and customer support is also very bad."
3,"Hardcore gamer here, the W key started fading after 2 months of use.2-3 big sized key(Num + and Tab) needs pressure for output.On the positive side, The design is good and stylish and weight properly distributed.Once it becomes adjusted you can type really fast if that's only your priority go for it."
5,"It is a very good keyboard in the ‚Çπ350-range. Keys are moderately soft, and is comfortable & quiet for normal typing. The multimedia keys are all working properly. Not much rugged design (but not that loose either) , but of course, in this price range, you can't expect much, but you are getting a decent one ! Also, packaging was decent. MUST BUY FOR NORMAL TO MODERATE USAGE. ALTHOUGH FOR HIGH INTENSIVE GAMING, THIS MAY NOT SUFFICE."
4,"It's been around 10 days now that I am using this keyboard. It's kinda okay for it's price, nothing great nor anything bad. Though it could have been better. The plastic that is used here feels kinda cheap and hard hitters can type twice the same letters that they are tryna type. Feels extremely light in weight so it doesn't give you a sense of great quality in this keyboard. Though design wise it looks good atleast from a distance. Keys are extra smooth so they don't feel forced on this keyboard which is a good thing but can be bad too if you are typing rapidly because you would end up typing the letter twice and then you would have to go back and delete it. Though it's a fair attempt to provide a fancy looking keyboard at this price, so it's alright not a bad keyboard. It serves the purpose and that's enough."
1,"The look attracted me ..So I took a chance and went a head to get this product.. but was disappointed with the build quality of the product, plastic is very delicate and can be easily broken... I'm not sure if it's leak proof as I take care of it very much also gaming i haven't tried ... So only build quality is the concerned point here.. Typing is really soft"
1,"I owned it for a while, never had much use till lockdown and wfh.. This is a very bad keyboard for working.. Has to edit each line to remove repeated letters after typing. There is a 10 percentage probably that one key press types it twice.. that means every line in an email will have 3 repeated letters.. So painful..  Also it's a flat keyboard. Nothing special in ergonomics regard."
4,"I ordered this keyboard as my long running logitech keyboard gave up. I have never been fan of Amkette products considering their cheap quality.However I was pleasantly surprised with this product. The keyboard has got separate multimedia buttons on the right side and quick access keys on the left. The WASD keys and arrow keys are marked in orange which gives it a gaming keyboard look. The keys are very soft to type and are precise to strokes.Overall a value for money product with good ergonomics, fast typing and casual gaming."
5,The keyboard is quiet sturdy at this low cost for just Rs279. Been using it for 6+ months and its still going great. Its keys are not hard nor too soft. No ghosting at all. Keyboard multi function button on both sides edge (orange) are working exactly shown.  its a full fledge keyboard in compact size.  Its just plug and play no cd or installation needed.Con I would say has a usb wire which is a bit short than normal keyboards if its for desktop.Honestly i was sceptical about this keyboard at that price but I went ahead and purchased it and now I am HAPPY that I made the right choice. You can go ahead too if you dont want to spend more for HP or dell keyboard which has less functions and those all the things which this keyboard does .
1,"I am not a gamer. I needed a Keyboard for software development, I bought this on 21st May 2020. Reviewig o : 07th July 2020.Pros:The keys are butter smooth. I liked it very much.Cons:10 days ago, the PageUp button stopped working.Now B and N keys are not working. Either I eed to press hard or it will get typed with multiple characters.So, If you wat a reliale keyboard. Thik wisely and get a etter oe.Puzzle: Add N or B in the unrecognizable words in this post. I typed this sentence from my laptop, hence it is readable. The rest are typed using the this Keyboard.While writig this review,  the Left Arrow key stopped fuctioig."
2,So I ordered this product under a lightning deal but due to my bad luck some keys were not working in the keyboardI asked amazon for a replacement and they replaced the keyboardAgain some weren‚Äôt workingI took refund of the keyboardStory endsNow from my experience you should definitely not invest in this cheap productYou can go for amazon choice keyboard or any other branded keyboard like HP or Dell
2,my experience was bad with this keyboard.Received the keyboard first time stopped working in few days.Then request for replacement second time got broken keyboard hence i returned the second time and finally got a refund.Mainly the keyboard size is short too.Go for Logitech or dell by paying extra 200 rs which actually worth
5,"Product is good, After recieving the product I felt it's little bit small.But the keys are smooth.Length is 18.5 inchBreadth is 6.5 inchUnwanted extension given below the space bar. Key texture and print are good.Cable quality is also above average.The media and special keys at the sides are super. At first they didn't work but after restart they are working fine for windows 10 OS. It has around 13 holes to remove dust dust and liquid spills from bottom. It has 17 screws to open the back cover.Completely plastic body"
3,"When I got the product, the escape key wasn't working, after some this it did work, but still stops in between. I wouldn't recommend the product if you are going to use it for typing since the enter key is weirdly shaped and I not reachable when you are touch typing.The only thing I liked about the product was the color. Overall I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,"Writing this review almost after a months of use.I must say it is a good purchase for me. In this price range this is a very good product. Not very much sturdy, but enough rigid as per price. Does not have premium look. Typing is good. Not issues with typing. I also tried gaming with this keyboard. I played pubg with it. It does not have sticky key issue. More than 3 key roll over is possible. But it feels that the key are harder in terms of gaming. You should not expect it as a gaming keyboard cause it's at least 1/10th of price compared to proper gaming keyboard. So I'll rate it a five star considering it's price."
5,"The buttons are very smooth and soft to touch and the multimedia buttons eases up our work.Only drawback i saw till now is that maybe the buttons are not very mch durable for a long use i guess.It's been 4 months i'm using this and didn't noticed any problem bt the keys durability.Some mostly used common keys FOR e.g :- M key for opening MAPS in games gives little different feel when pressed.So, ive removed the button and adjusted the material inside button to the centre and placed the key back in hoping to regain that old smoothness and surprisingly it got smooth again.That's it ....other than this key thing, which is also not a big deal and on the basis of that you can't judge this keyboard.In this price Range this Keyboard works like a CHARM****"
2,"I bought this keyboard for ergonomics, primarily, the functional and easy to reach multimedia buttons on the right and the left..I am a designer and I listen to music 90% of the time that I am working on my computer. The volume up and down, forward, backward, pause/play buttons on the right and the mute, calc, folder, home and email buttons on the left are extremely useful to me and very easy and quick to reach and use.The material and build quality of the keyboard however sucks. I think it's been a month since I bought it and several keys started popping out and falling off within a couple of weeks. I have to push them back in place every now and then. I am not sure but I think there have been a couple of instances of double key strikes/mis-trikes etc. I don't think this keyboard is gonna last very long.The design is beautiful however and I wonder from whom Amkette rippled it off...oh okay ..they ripped it off from Foxin, coz I have owned an identical keyboard from Foxin which was cheaper and better built though not excellent ..Foxin might have ripped the design off from some other brand as well ..who knows ..or they both purchase from cheap third parties ... I've attached pics of the Amkette and the Foxin side by side for reference...."
5,The keyboard is just awesome. The keys are smooth and doesn't make any noise. While gaming also it feels nice. Most keyboards at this price range starts getting stiff keys and all but even after rough and rash use its still smooth and noise free. The only demerit is the keys cannot be removed or cannot be interchanged. Apart from that everything is super.
1,Dont buy this keyboard ...its filmsy plastic ....keys are going to break in weeks ... my previous keyboard was iball ..it worked up to 6 years...  I have a amketee wirless keyboard which keys are fine ... ( security issue is there in wirless keyboards)  so i try to purchase this amkette keyboard ... I will buy iball keyboard from shop ...I lost my money anyway
4,"This key board is very good in a reasonable rate. Also it has media player controlling option and all most silent keyboard.It can  be improved more by placing some very small white LED bulbs along the four corners , two at tops and one near up/ down arrow sign, inbuilt.Then it could be operated in dark room , when students studying but his/ her parents are sleeping in same room, so it could have been a newest type of key board in the market."
5,"If you're looking for a good trustworthy keyboard at this price range, look no further. You can easily go with this option.Have been using this for around 3 months now and it's serving its purpose just fine. Plus the ergonomics are really good and the multimedia keys are a blessing. The multimedia keys are one the main reasons I bought this.However, if you're looking for hard-core gaming, I don't think this product is for the long haul. You'll be able to play comfortably but for me and some other users as well, one or two keys might get stuck at times; has already started happening with me with the Shift key so this is one of its disadvantages. Not an absolute deal breaker though cause you can't expect more than this at this price range.It feels like a premium product and I remember this company Amkette making floppy disks during my childhood so yeah another good point.A definite buy at this price range!"
3,"Specifically bought this one for gaming as dont want to ruin my laptop keyboard.The keyboard is decent in terms of build quality. Ive played COD,CS,FARCRY titles without any issues.The only problem i feel is, you have to press the keys hard while typing unlike other branded keyboards like dell,hp etc.The shorcut keys for volume, previous,next etc really help while watching videos. However plz be careful as they get accidentally pressed while you lift the keyboard for some reason while gaming or watching a video."
5,Really satisfied with the keyboard. It's best in the market. Way better than zebronics multimedia keyboard. Multimedia keys are very helpful and are placed better. Keys are soft and keyboard is strong. Everything seems good. Note:- And i'm never buying zebronics keyboard again. Stopped working in just one week and service is very bad.
4,"Writing this review 2 years after the purchase..Pros:Seems to work fine even after a period of 2 years. No problem with key functionality and super smooth as well as silent. Compact design . A big advantage, it has a separate key for controlling sound/music etc. More than worth the priceConsNote that I've been using the product for 2yearsKeyboard is not for hardcore gaming or games which includes multi keys to be pressed at the same time. Ghost key count is less. The print seems to fade if same keys have been used continuously..refer pics uploaded."
5,"I am basically practising Touch Typing for a long but this keyboard helped me score the top speed easily.The first Impression>>>Pros:>Keys are really soft and spacing between keys are low because of that it is easy to reach on every key easily.>Utility Keys on both sides of the keyboard is so helpful and accurate.>Light Weight (May be due to  plastic build but I didn't feel that as low quality)>Height of the keyboard is less (compared to previous keyboards I had used) because of that it is easy to reach numbers and function keys(F1, F2....).> SilentCons:> Utility keys on both sides are of Rubber finish and sometimes it feels little stiff(just a little). But it doesn't matter much because the response is really so accurate and fast.> Size of ""Enter"" key seems a little bit small compared to other keyboards because of that my pinky fingers need to be stretched a little more while touch typing.Overall worthy for this price range."
5,"Do not expect a very high quality keyboard at this price. However if you just looking for office purpose, mails , multimedia use. Its a very good option since it does have extra keys for multimedia too. Looks a bit flimsy but hey the price is cheap..comes with warranty of 1 year. For gamers I will say go with something more robust and strong.if you can buy a gaming laptop or desktop then definitely you can save more to get a high level keyboard too."
4,"This is the best keyboard for typing. Even though the materials look cheap and feel cheap its really comfortable for those people who type alot in the computer. I dont recommend this for hardcore gaming coz at sometimes the keyboard just stops working for a few seconds. If you are playing some causal games then its good. And again for typers this is the best keyboard, once you get used to it you can type really well."
4,"I wanted it for my laptop as working on keyboard is easy. Coming to quality, it feels flimsy, key strokes do not bring confidence of a good quality product, feels like they may come out in few months usage. This is definitely not made for heavy keyboard users (those writing long reports or work extensively on Excel sheets). The shortcut keys for volume, calculator, hard drive, email client, desktop, etc are very handy and useful"
5,"Liked the shortcut true the most.Opening the mail, calculator,browser, file manager has become very easy with it.Along with this the media playback controls are also awesome.Typing experience is very satisfying with noiseless keys .Keyboard has many holes at the backside that helps to drain water if some thing spills on it without damaging the keyboard.The rubber padding on the lower end of the keyboard isn't sufficient. Due to which it slightly slips on the table while typing. Although it is a good product"
5,"For a price of Rs. 400, Amkette Xcite Pro USB Keyboard is truly good to use. Keys feel comfortable to hit or to push down upon softly. I have no hesitation in recommending it. Recently, a new version of it having UV coating and splash proof design has been launched under the label Amkette Xcite Neo Wired USB Keyboard. It looks more sober and elegantly laid out now!"
4,"I have bought this for ‚Çπ300 when I wanted a super cheap keyboard for gaming on laptop.I used this everyday for 1 year 10 months until very recently when the cable at the keyboard joint broke and became unusable.It is very lightweight and ergonomic. It is often advertised as water-proof which I have tested but then again how often do you swim with a keyboard üòÇ. Keyboard still looks good despite such heavy gaming use and the added buttons on its sides were very useful. For gaming particularly, I didn't see any added advantage nor was I expecting any either. I just needed a cheap keyboard for gaming so that my laptop keyboard did not wear out early because of gaming.I am slightly disappointed now it has become non-functional but it was very cheap and I had zero long term expectations."
5,"Lets just rate the entire procedure.(Based on 3 day experience)1.Delivery-Like always ..way before the stipulated date.10/102.Packing - Excellent. On addition to the Carton coverage the keyboard was wrapped in bubble wraps. So 10/103. Product- Sleepy, Ergonomic, & perfect for any purpose. The product was exactly as per the specifications. Little bulky but still manageable. The 10 shortcut key on the sides are a blessing! It fits perfectly for my work needs with volume,track controls, Calculator, MailSo if you managed to read all this , I would say go for it before it runs outEdited (01-02-2021)Never expected to be writing this, but the item has stopped functioning. Literally Nada. Nothing works. Except for the occasional luck-based one timer when it works. Otherwise just an unproductive expense. Infact this worked only for like 3-4 weeks , enough time to relieve Amazon for refund or exchange liablities. So I guess the rating for me then comes down to a mere 3 /10"
5,"all good , all keys work proper;y expect 3 keys1st shift+2="" ( whenever in keyboard wrote that when you press shift +2 =@) this problem is solve by exchange that both keys but their is not hastage keywhen i press shift + 3 =¬£ this icon comes that was not good for my work and their is not any key which can replaced by '¬£' key.  all are very good infect write this comment with this keyboard .  i use this from 2 or 3 days and this very good. check keys 1st when you recive this thanks for your time .if anyone want to grow their instagram accounty ,youtube channel then contect me  on my IG ID @moonlight_promotions"
5,"This keyboard is good quality and looks reliable as i have been using it without any issue for the past year. But the paint on repetitively used keys may come off after 1 year of use.But in spite of the paint issue, i have ordered the same keyboard again for another computer. I like the smoothness of this and reliability."
3,"delivery before time but packaging was poor.in fact open.so i checked all the keys in itPro:1.multimedia keys2.spill water proof3.gamng look3.lightweightcons:1.plastic quality in little on downside,cheap type. no arms or lap rest proper space2.shut down button should also be included like multimedia keys.i have this feature in my previous foxin keyboard fkm 902."
4,The keyboard is good.The keys are soft to press.it has a big backspace.All the keys are working fine.The extra multimedia keya are really helpful for me.There are two cons of the product1.The side multimedia buttons are made of rubber which does not feel durable.2.The wire of keyboard is Really small.if u are going to use it for laptop then it is fine.if you are going to use it for desktop then the wire length could be a isseue.
5,The product works very beautifully. The extra keys are so useful. Every one who sees the keyboard wants to buy it.Cons: Keyboard cable is not so premium and looks cheap.Buy it. You wont get such a keyboard anywhere for the price.
4,lightweight keyboard with shortcut keys used for frequent functions usable for house work and not good for office typing work purpose just. faced connectivity issue while connecting first time due to drivers installation not happened
3,"Product :Amkette Xcite Pro USB Keyboard (Black) (Sold by: Appario Retail Private Ltd)1. We received this product for ‚Çπ369.00 and shipping charges of ‚Çπ0.00 with good conditions and package, within their time frame.2. We did not satisfy about this product, because of making some problems when pressing keys.Thanks."
5,"Not recommended for heavy gaming, but works fine for simple games and has a nice build. For this price, this keyboard is really nice and is very light weight. The functional keys in orange colour on both the sides of the keyboard are the USP. These keys make the work easy, and are really great. Go for it. Value for money!"
2,"The  keyboard quality is great at this budget point. The lighting features  are also good. Keyboard feels  sturdy, though slightly heavy. For gaming,  this is perfect  as you wouldn't notice much the lettering on the keys. But there are  certain aspects that annoy me a lot.1. The printing on the numbers are too bad and you  won't be even able to read them without turning the backlight on.2. The lighting of the NUM, Caps and Windows  lock keys are way too bright that it hurts the eyes3. The  biggest concern till now is double spacing. While writing this review itself, I was able  to get 10+ errors for double  spacing, still  you cannot do anything  about it. That's very irritating. I am not even going to edit those spaces so that you can see the result yourself.I would recommend  to spend some extra bucks for  a better gaming keyboard. I'm stuck  with this for now.,"
5,"It's a decent keyboard with some good premium features. The build quality is quite good. considering it's low price, i was actually surprised seeing the build quality.Raised keys will give you mechanical keyboard like feeling.However it's a normal membrane keyboard.The LED's are very good ,it's bright but at the same time doesn't hurt your eyes. This keyboard can give  you a premium keyboard's look and feel.It doesn't look cheap at all like other competitors in the same price range.To be honest i didn't find any cons.However i would like to mention the following points if you considering to purchase it1) People are saying in the reviews that Printing on keys is not visible.Well it's true, but there's a reason behind it. Those letter inscriptions are actually transparent so that the backlit LED's can be easily visible. So keep in mind that you need to turn on the LED's all time in order to use this keyboard.Otherwise you'll face difficulties seeing the letters.But in my personal opinion nobody looks at the keyboard while typing as soon as they get used to with a particular keyboard.So, its not a con for me.2) Num Lock indicator ,Caps lock indicator and windows lock indicator LED's are too bright(blue color and you cannot change the LED color for these 3 LED indicators) and really hurts your eyes  because they  are pointing directly at your face. This can be very irritating at night time.3)Instead of violet ,they could go for Green LEDs for the 3rd color option.It would have been great.Now coming the the seller's service and delivery. I have no complain about the delivery time, but the packaging was worst.I purchased it from a seller named Appario Retail Private Ltd .They sent the product without any protection at all, no cardboard box ,no bubble wrap... nothing !! Not even a plastic wrap. They literally send the keyboard directly in it's product box without any packaging.Due to this horrible packaging (if you call it a packaging ) one corner of the keyboard got slightly damaged.The paint came off from the metal and also there were some minor scratches(See screenshot). Fortunately the internals of the keyboard didn't get damaged and working fine. I request the seller to please give importance to packaging.I know it's a very low budget keyboard,still protection should be given during shipping so that it doesn't get damaged.Apart from this packaging issue the product was genuine and the delivery time was quite good.I'm happy with amazons Service."
3,"While the keyboard quality is very good and sturdy, the printing on the keys is not very good. The print has already started peeling off on some keys."
1,at first while typing i was happybut when i tried typing without looking at keyboardmultiple keys get pressedex: hacve a nioce dasyalso while gaming if u play agro u will end up pressing multiple keysall keys are loose (see the video i attached)bad purchaseno memory to remember the lighting settingswhen ever u restart your pc it forgets your lighting settingcaps and nums lights are very bright and hurt your eyes
2,"I expected more from  this keyboard.. My biggest concern is the spacebar.. It is ok for gaming, but pathetic when used for typing.. Even though you press space, sometimes it is not registered.. You  have to press harder.. When you  press harder,  there will be double spaces.. My old Aula  Befire  which i bought from ebay.in(shut down now)  was way  way better.. It was Rs.1500 in 2014 and served me well  till now and even now, it has small spacebar problem.. But this new keyboard has  more spacebar problem than my 4.5 year old keyboard.. And the letters  look of  lower quality...And the packaging  from  the  seller Appario Retail  was  just awesome..  The keyboard was sent as is without  any protection.. Just amazon prime tape on it.. Not even some plastic wrapping...Overall I am dissatisfied with this keyboard..  I don't understand how this keyboard  has 4.5 star rating..Just look at this review.. So many double spaces because i have  to  press harder and if I press lighter, it does not register...Update: Double spaces do not show up on amazon reviews.. I have learned to live with the keyboard.. And after breaking in, the space bar has become better and double spaces are rare now.. However, it is still a problem.. So updating to 2 Star..."
1,"Ok so guys I am not gonna lie about anything if you want i can even give you proofs about what I am going to write.So when this keyboard came to me and I started using this keyboard i noticed that the force required to press the space key IS TREMENDOUS (in terms of comfort while gaming ) the rest of the keys were fine and the space key was JUST BAD,I still didnt got used to it and it has been like 2 months (which is enough to get accustomed to ANY keyboard) you literally have to hit the jump key and still its delayed and whatever is assigned to your space key while gaming(jump in my case)that move is delayed and if you dont properly press it the move doesnt happen at all.TTTTTHHHHHAAAAATTTTTSSSS  NNNNOOOOTTTTT  AAAALLLLLLAfter 2 months of struggled use i am facing a new problem which is greater than that of the last one , my keyboard connects and disconnects randomly (this happened while writing the review as well) So in game if you are pressing W to move forward and the keyboard disconnects and the windows makes the default saound that something got disconnected and you start running into the direction which you were until the keyboard connects againBEST KEYBOARD EVER THANK YOU REDGEAR VARY COOL  ,ok so now lets talk about getting my money back"
3,"Pros: 1. Looks good,2. Aluminium build,Cons: 1. Space key not working properly. Sometime it skips and most of the time if clicked double time.2. Font style of keys are not good.3. If you switch off the backlight, then unable to see letters printed on keys.4. Num lock light directly strikes at your face, makes uncomfortable."
5,"Whatever everyone says about this keyboard on the first day of review is true even after two years of using it. Till date I haven't faced any issues with this keyboard and it is as good as new and just to let you know how much I have used... I play pubg on emulators and my my pubg ID is off level 82... I bet none of you reading this has played that much of game..... All those game please have been played on this keyboard in last 2 years ,maybe a million on every button out there but none of them is even close to lose yet..... I just want to come up with the cons but they haven't left any page unturned..... Its durable beast...."
5,"Soon after receiving it, I plugged it in immediately and started playing.At this given price, I'm quite impressed with this keyboard.This does give a similar feeling to a mechanical keyboard.The aluminium metallic body feels sturdy, strong and stable, brings in more confidence to work our way with the keys.The back lights are bright but as I've read and felt, we do need to use it irrespective of the time of the day. The aplha numerics marked on the keys are not very clear without it, I also fear for them fading away soon.Overall I'd give it 4.5 / 5 at this give price as my very first and initial impression.It might change upon usage.I'd certainly recommend it for the beginners.Cheers!!!"
4,"Received the product within 24 hours of ordering. There was absolutely no protective packing other than the original carton box. I have received smaller unbreakable products with heavier packing, but this was the other extreme. The carton box did not have any original seal (probably had been broken), the box had been sealed with amazon BOPP tape, there was no manual or any other leaflet inside. The black painting on the external metal body had faint scratches at two places. I am convinced that the product was probably opened and resealed before delivery, though the product looked new. Docking a star for poor packing and handling.The product is good functionally. With three colours to toggle and brightness to control, it gives user options to choose. This review has been typed using this keyboard. It has a soft squishy touch feeling, noise levels are a little more than my earlier Logitech USB keyboard. All the keys have been raised from the body, my only worry is that dust can easily settle below the keyboards and cleaning its would be a big task.  Yet to see this, maybe after some usage. I did read in some of the other reviews that the space bar did pose some problem, I do not have any double spaces being recognised when I use the space bar. Functionally there are no problems. Hence retaining the product though I had initially thought of returning it looking at the poor (rather none) packing and open seal delivery.The keyboard is pretty heavy and sturdy, quite easy to type with the raised position. Overall its value for money."
4,"Bought on 14th Aug, 2018. Been using everyday ever since. Price is still justified for what it brings.Pros- Nice, braided cable.- Comfortable to use even in long sessions. Height adjustable.- Durable. Keeys seem mechanical but they are not.- Multiple LED color options. Backlit with 3 LEDs.- No key ghosting experienced so far.Cons- If LED is turned off, you can almost not see any key letters.- Gathers dust a lot compared to normal keyboard due to metal body and static due to LED lights. Keep it coveredafter use.- No hand rest.- Lacks multimedia keys, you will have to use the Function key combinations for them.- Keys become loose and make squeaking sounds after a while.- Heightened keys to make space for backlighting may feel awkward at first and may take some time to get used to.- More LED options would have been great. The Num lock and Caps buttons have fixed Blue LEDs.- Body is metallic, so improper earthing/cable could feel the keyboard have static feel. Dont use with wet hands."
1,"From the day first, I have been facing the issue of disconnection.I have tried on two different Windows Gaming PC and having same issue ongoing.I also investigated that it is not the issue from cable, or from the connector.its the issue from internal circuits, as when it disconnects it shows error in Windows Device Manager, mentioning that device descriptor request failed and windows could not recognise the USB device.But when again after removing the USB connector and connecting again it works again and disconnects randomly again.Also, the RedGear website has nothing related to the warranty. In fact there is no website of RedGear."
4,"Bought for multimedia works but not for gaming.Overall, this is a good product from the red gear brand for this price rangeRight now im satisfied but I‚Äôm ready to buy again if the redgear releases the next version of this keyboard by clearing all of the mentioned cons below.Pros- Solid build & Aluminium material- Premium looks- Clear letter visibility even the keys are not individually lit.- Works also with Apple Mac Pro workstation- Easy to change the colors and brightness - More colors in the blaze 7 version keyboardCons- Letters are not visible even in the room lightso always LED lights on the keyboard must be turned on to use this keyboard- No dedicated multimedia keys- Keystroke sounds are high- Need more height adjustment function- More led light is wasted under the keys bcoz of floating keys design(I think gamers won‚Äôt consider this point as a drawback)"
4,It my first gaming keyboard. Was skeptical about how the button would feel nevertheless thought of giving it a shot and it is good. The travel is good and the mechanical button like feel is there.The indicator lights for the scroll lock caps lock and number lock are a bit brighter than I would like.Three colour options on the backlight is nice would have liked it more if there was a way to adjust the brightness. Sometimes it feel that it‚Äôs too bright.Build quality is nice and feels solid. Cable is braided have good enough length. Packing was ok that it didn‚Äôt got damaged during transit.Definitely a good product for a beginner.
3,I liked mechanical keys aspect in this keyboard but the lighting is not perfect for instance... Some parts glow darker and some lighter.I'm also having issues with spacebar. It's making disrupted noises when pressing which is not a good sign for a 2days old keyboard.
3,"this keyboard is bad, high ghosting, cant play action adventure game, had to buy new keaboard to play Devil may cry 4, better spend more and buy another one.key print quality is bad, print quality makes it look like a cheap chinese product. also they backlight is brighter near spacebar and get dim as you move upwards, making funktion keys completly unreadable.Keys are raised so high that when i type i hit bottom line keys while trying to hit top line kys, like my palm hits ctrl when my fingers reaches out for backspace, probably using the keyboard's back stand will help you, but it was no good for me.The feedback and feel is good. It gives a complete mechanical feedback. its made out of aluminum alloy which makes it sturdy. the cable is also braided which is rare in low price products. Its plug and play, you dont need to install any extra software to use it.If you still want to buy it, it will take you some time to get used to it. I am still trying."
5,"I have had this keyboard for about 3 years now and I have been constantly using it (on several Linux based systems) for the duration. For most of the part, this keyboard is just plain amazing. I will try to give all the helpful details for you to make an informed decision.Typing Experience:First and most importantly, the typing experience. I have used this keyboard for typing a lot of articles and to do a lot of programming. Both of these things require a comfortable and fast keyboard. This product fit in that position very well. It is very smooth and has a decent amount of key travel. With a couple of weeks to get used to it, you can easily get really fast typing speeds. I have no complains or problems in this area whatsoever. This keyboard has served me well.Design and Layout:The keyboard has an aluminum base and plastic keycaps. It is very sturdy, with almost no flex at all. Most other membrane keyboards have keys that are uncovered at the base. Because of that, they accumulate dirt and the keys become sticky. This keyboard has keys that are covered with a white plastic at the base, which keeps the keyboard clean (performance viz) and provides a clean look.Now as for the design of this thing, it is beautiful. It has clean straight edges and well rounded corners. I really like the design aesthetic, but that is something that personal to everyone. The indication LEDs have an obnoxious gamer-y look, but it is not as noticeable in real life as it is seen in the pictures, so don't worry about it too much.Now we get to the first issue, that is the backlighting. No problem there, actually. The backlighting is great, you get three shades: red, blue and a pleasant purple. The lighting is uniform, sufficiently bright and looks really good. The issue comes up when you choose to turn the lighting off. The labels become almost invisible in that case. In most of the cases, keeping the backlight on at all times keeps the keys visible (especially the red color).The build quality for most of the keyboard is really well, which includes the cable. The cable is braided and will not get damaged easily. The only issue I faced was with the keyboard feet. I am someone who keeps the feet folded out, but after about 2 years, one of the feet gave in. The part of the foot that clicks into the keyboard broke, and now I have to use the keyboard flat on the surface. It is not much of an issue, but an area of improvement. The feet should be made sturdier.The key arrangement is pretty standard. Keys are well spaced, you can use it very comfortably. The enter  key at the center is huge, like it should be, the backspace is wide, like it should be. The right edge enter is very accessible, which makes it great to enter commands. The keyboard does make a a lot of noise, which is something that I honestly like. It is great to get that feedback, but again, that's something that is personal to everyone. The key depth is good, but it will take a while to get used to if you have only been using laptop keyboards.Conclusion:I don't have a gaming review, because I didn't do any gaming at all. But from the perspective of writing content and programming, this keyboard is amazing value for money. You will become very efficient after getting used to it a little bit. All in all, I definitely recommend this to everyone who has similar usage intentions. I hope this was helpful."
2,After the damaged one I received Amazon replaced me with another keyboard in a day but I didn't like the Key Board because of its usability. It is backlit but colours provided are not two vibrant to work with and the worst part is the readability of the keyboard even with backlit on especially the special characters on the Keyboard is bad as the transparency Levels are bad. You cannot work with it with backlit off even in broad daylight due to the poor readability of keys.Space between Keys is very less and often you press two keys together or the wrong key on the same account. Function Keys are also not performing as you might think again due to lack of readability and poor function assigned. I would say it is an expensive gimmick than a practical keyboard.
1,"I am using this Keyboard for about 5 months now. And after 5 months when I type, it types something else. When I press space it open up calculator. Looks like this keyboard has become faulty. Not sure if I can get a replacement.But giving a 1star now Becaue the Keyboard is not working well after 5 months, looks like monsoon moisture."
1,"I have bad experience with this product.First i got damaged product then after replacement i used product for 3-4 days then Tab key was jaming and other keys was also taking some time in input registration. If you're a fast typee then this product will not be best for you. It might be helpful for gamers but for coders, i won't recommend this product. Go with mechanical high range keyboards."
4,"The keyboard overall is good in the current price range. Although, I received the product 2 days back and just noticed that a few keys were wobbly. I checked one of them and noticed that it was damaged from one side (pics attached). I immediately applied for a replacement and the replacement product is on its way. Hopefully that one will be in a good state.Talking about the features, here are the pros and cons:Pros:- Nice feedback from the keys.- Keys make a little noise on press which is somewhat satisfying.- Lighting is good with 3 brightness levels and a breathing mode as well.- The keyboard looks good from all sides.- The connecting cable is braided and feels of good quality.Cons:- The Num Lock, Win Lock and Caps Lock indicaters are blue in color and cannot be changed.- Also, the indicaters are too bright and hurts the eye. (Seriously)- If you think the design would act as a palm rest for you, then let me be clear. It doesn't. It just looks good but is too small to act like a palm rest.- The elevation stands at the back are not too high and doesn't elevate the keyboard much.- The key printing is too light and is almost invisible without the back-light on.- Lastly, if you are adapted to your  laptop keyboard, then it may cause you a little trouble, as some keys like (Fn, Enter) are not exactly at the same place XD (not a major issue, you'll get used to it)I hope this will help you to make your mind. :)"
4,"This keyboard has good design and durable keys. The backlight can be changed between red, blue and pink/purple. You can also choose to alternate between these three colors. This keyboard is suitable for gaming but do not go for it if you plan to use it for purposes like typing or writing code. It sucks at typing and the keys are very loud. Even if you type at an average speed, the noise is too loud and unbearable. It is good if you're alone in a room while using it otherwise it's sound may annoy others around you.The print on the keys is of poor quality and it's hard to see some of the key labels. Especially the characters like *,&,# etc are not clearly visible even with the backlight on. The visibility becomes poorer if the backlight is off or blue. If you plan to use this to do a lot of typing, then do not go for this keyboard. If your requirement is solely gaming and typing rarely then it's a fair deal. A better print on the keys would certainly make this keyboard a lot better."
4,"Love the hardware quality, but I cannot believe that they key caps could have such bad printing of letters. Was about to ask for a replacement when I noticed how every single picture here has similar printing flaws.Still.. this is worth way more than the asking price. I was actually going to buy the TVS gold Mechanical one or the Zebronics Max Plus, but both of them lack build quality and aren't even  that superior to type with."
5,"I  am a SW Professional and wanted a backlit keyboard, I do play games as well sometimes. This product is simply amazing; the overall Mechanical feel when you type. There is one issue with spacebar key that i have encountered is sometimes it skips press and sometimes instead of 1 space it puts 2.. i had the keyboard replaced but same issue in the new keyboard as well(Dont know if they gave a new one or handed the same one in new packing). I do face this issue 1 out of 50(approx) keypress.Below are some Suggestion based on my use of the product and which I feel can increase User Experience:-1. Redgear can maybe launch another keyboar for non-Gamers keeping a small Enter key and shifting '|' key above it rather than beside the enter key. As for programmers evey key position matters.2. Volume control keys can be shifted to F9-F12 as it would be easy to control volume with single hand combined with FN key. As right now it is at F2-F4 and needs two hands esp to reduce the volume due to large gap between F2 and FN key.Overall it has proven to be a very good keyboard and one can consider it against Mechanical one if they are on budget."
5,"I am seriously telling this keyboard is just insane at this price.. they keys r just so good.. response is good. It's sturdy as well.. talking about the key prints as many people complaint, don't worry about it as it's transparent print so that LEDs light can come out brighter. And no one turns off the LEDs when it's already present right? Then y would u?And it also doesn't have any double spacing issue.. what else u want in this price then?Just go for it!P.S: keys r bright as u can see in the video above though my setup is next to the window.. it's still visible nice and clear."
5,"in the price range of this, I think it's the best keyboard for the gamer and also for a normal user the keys are gives mechanical feedback and also it has 3 different light with four different layouts. The main thing is that is has a good branded cable and the quality is superb."
4,"1. right off the bat its amazing value for money. a fully backlit keyboard which has surprising key travel with 3 different colors with varying degree of brightness. quite a mouthful2. i bought this keyboard because some of the keys on my laptop were not working properly. this is working perfectly for me.3. we get a durable braided cable with this keyboard. which is always a good thing.4. the body is aluminum which honestly surprised me. its got a certain amount of weight to it. which speaks about its quality.5. however, there are a couple of drawbacks. the bigger keys are very wobbly. like the space bar, the shift key, the enter key, even the tab key. they're all way more wobbly for comfort.6. the biggest drawback is the caps lock number lock and scroll lock indicator keys are BLINDING!they literally are blinding. they are very very very bright. i cover it up with painters tape and it still manages to grab my attention when they're on.7. the backlit is amazing tho. you get 3 colors. red, blue, and sort of like purple. red is the least distracting and works for me in its least brightness setting. when you turn off the backlight, the keyboard becomes stealthy as hell. your keys become ""invisible"". for the pros8. each color has 3 varying levels of brightness. which is always a welcome feature. people who looked at the keyboard were properly impressed. some brownie points thereoverall a very good product. would 100% recommend it for gaming non gaming computer using people."
4,"The product is really good as per the budget.Pros :1. Mainly the backlit is good with the keys.2. The build quality is much better than other simple keyboards.3. The mechanical feel gives a nice touch to it. (But it's not a mechanical keyboard and not even the sound)Cons :1. If the indicators light will be colour changeable with the backlit and the brightness balanced with the backlit, then it'ld be awesome.2. I don't know if it's about the product or just a manufacturing defect. But, the one I get, having a little standing issue. as it's not balanced on a flat surface like table. One corner is not touching the table properly... So, I have to use a cheap under a corner to balance it properly.That's all.If you wanna buy a sturdy, backlit, stylish keyboard for gaming and night time usage (in dark room) with a budget that suits your pocket. Then u must go for this.Thanks to Amazon for the product."
2,"It is so cheap doesn't even worth the money.I bought it on a lightning deal for Rs 949. Now I'm thinking just spend a little bit extra and get Antec MK3000 mechanical keyboard.Anyways I'm stuck with this one.After 5 days of using (3) on the numpad is just double spacing.When I press 3 once it register like 33 that's a major issue for me while gaming.Even though I bought it for gaming,I can't even switch the weapon while 3 is not working.Buy better or get something valuable for your money.Placed a Replacement order on march 2nd now its march 6th there is no response from amazon and seller! It is taking more time even though I just waited for 4 days to arrive.And now it is taking more time get it replaced.I recommend to don't buy this or just buy Antec MK3000 which is even alot better for budget gaming."
1,"I bought this keybaord for gaming purpose but after purchasing i connected it to pc and started typing to test. Every key when pressed once will give output three times. Example if i type ""a"" key one time i will get ""aaa"" as output. I got it replaced with another keyboard with the same model. Even that one has the same key problem.The gaming mouse is another story, The scroll will never work after a couple of days of moderate usage. Better to get a simple mouse than go with this brand.This brand is totally waste. Don't waste money."
4,"The packaging was great and it was also delivered on time. The keyboard seemed heavy and sturdy as the outer shell is made out of aluminum, the key caps feels a bit harsh on the fingers, some of the letters seemed illegible even when back lit. They are great for casual gaming and for games where u can take your time, will not recommend for PvP games or online multiplayer games as they are not mechanical keyboard."
1,"The seller has sent over a defective unit. The backspace key, The enter key & the shuft key appears to have fused together. If i clicked on either the backspace or shift key repeatedly, it would register the key log as ""Enter"".The packaging too appeared a little worn out. It ssemed to be a returned item which was sent to me cause when i requested a replacement, there was none available."
4,"One can tell by just an overview that this thing is durable.After using it for few months now I think I have found out the pros and cons of this keyboard,they are as follows:Pros:1) Very durable,metal design2) The keys feel great to type on3) It's great for gaming,the floating style keys make it more fun to use.4) The cable is made of high quality material  and it's braided as well.5) LED indicators for Capslock,numlock, windows key lock are present6) easy to change modes. Fn+scr lk to start breathing mode,scr lk to switch between the three lights,Fan+Windows key to lock the windows button so you don't press it accidentally.7) FN + function keys gives you the  option to control the volume,pause or play videos etc8) good anti ghosting for non-fighting gamesCONS:1) There are only 3 colours of lighting- Red,Blue,Pink/purple2)Its pretty heavy because of all the metal(could be a problem for some,but I prefer heavy keyboards)3)The anti ghosting on this keyboard is decent but it's not enough to play fighting games like Tekken where you have just frame inputs.I could not perform even a single PEWGF/OTGF/JFSR with this keyboard (using WASD and numpad) whereas,when I switched on pad I could do them consistently.You can't press 4 buttons together to ki charge either and..if u only use the alphabet keys then you won't be able to play at all. There is way too much ghosting while only using the alphabet keys for fighting games.Inputting a single punch  gives u an extra directional input for no reason.Its definitely playable when using numpad+ Alphabet keys,if your character does not have just frame commands.4) [This won't happen with everyone]The letters or digits  on the keys are not clear.I could have replaced it but I did not want to wait for one more week.Its just a minor problem because the lighting kinda makes up for it.5) You need to press the space bar near it's center to get a proper input,I think it is because this keyboard only uses 1 switch for the space bar in the center instead of 2 on each side from the middle.CONCLUSION: If you are a gamer on a tight budget who does not play fighting games on a keyboard then definitely this thing is a great choice üëå"
2,"THIS IS NOT A GAMING KEYBOARD ! You may use this for general purpose use. The keys are squeaky. The keyboard is really ugly. The lighting is horrible. The letters do not light up - because due to poor engineering design the internal key cap is flooded with light but that does not permeate to the actual transparent letters ! The worst part is it make your table setup look really cheap and gaudy ! The name ""Red Dragon"" should have raised the red-flag !"
5,"i'm in love with this product,it's exactly the same as promised. Aluminium body just looks perfect and simple. It might take sometime to get accustomed to floating keys, it's a good feel though. Keys work just fine. It's a bit heavier than expected , it is skid resistant and good for gamers. Backlight is pretty amazing, backlight on these floating keys is just perfect. It ain't a mechanical keyboard though. Dust doesn't accumulate on this aluminium body(easy to wipe off). Overall, it's a good membrane keyboard with floating keys for a price of rs.1060. Hope these keys last long as i'm a hard user, I play CS:go and Dota 2."
2,"I wonder how low-life one has to be to rate this keyboard as a 4.5 star. I mean how?1) The keyboard arrived with TERRIBLE packaging.2) For some strange reason the keyboard ""hot"" when I opened the package. Seems like something inside it might have short-circuited while in transit.3) I connected the keyboard, installation went fine and I noticed that the base of the keyboard wasn't level with the platform it was on. I Tried it on two tables. Still the same.4) Whenever I was typing the letter ""D"", the keyboard put my PC to sleep. LOL.Filed a returned within 17 minutes of delivery."
5,I have used this keyboard for playing PUBG Mobile and it works fantastic. Although it is not a mechanical keyboard but It gives nice mechanical feel. Backlit Colour looks great. Build quality is premium and looks long lasting.The only con i can see in this keyboard is special characters are not printed very well.But overall keyboard is good if you want to see detailed video review i have uploaded it on YouTube. You can see it just by searching LunaticApps Redgear Blaze 3 keyboard review.If this review is helpful for you please up vote this review.
5,"This is exactly what I was searching for. Everyting I was getting was backlit ones with opaque keys. This is perfect. I wish I had chosen the seven colours one.Anyway, on to the actual review. The keyboard works really well and I'm happy. It's not a completely silent one though. A staccato noise is definitely there when you are typing away. I got this keyboard because I needed to type at night when I couldn't have the lights on because my father was asleep in the same room. But it's okay. I can adjust with the noise. The keys are sturdy. The keypad is sturdy. Looks beautifully black.I was a little worried because the other reviews did mention the concerns about packging. I'm lucky that mine arrived without a single damage. However I really would recommend the use of bubble wrap to the seller. But I'm glad mine arrived unscathed. It's a great product. I'm happy."
3,"For gaming? It's usable. I mean, it works as a keyboard and for  Rs.999, that's basically all you get. A bling bling membrane keyboard that takes a dumbbell to push the keys. I miss my mechanical which broke, the reason why I bought this.Keystrokes are mushy, so far no ghosting issues, it's a usable keyboard.The caps/num/scrl keys are brighter than the sun. Distracting too. Build quality is good.For typing? OHH NO NO NO. Don't. Instant carpel tunnel. Trust me my hands are mush right now. If you believe this keyboard will make you a typing-god, wrong.Get mechanical if you're gonna type for long durations. It'll save your wrists."
1,"Pros:It has good backlit and keys are also feel like mechanical, USB cable and connector is also of good qualityCons:You cannot use it without switching on the backlit because keys become invisible as shown in photoIssue:I purchased this keyboard for work from home amid covid lockdown on 24th of May 2020. After 20-25 days of use I have started getting issue that if I press a key (once) it keeps typing same letter for 10-15 times. For an instance if I am typing ""I have an issue"" it become ""I have an isssssssssssssse"" frequency of this issue is approx once in 100 words but become more problematic when it happens with backspace keyIt has no support at all, amazon has provided an email address where I have been sending emails and reminders for last 10 days but not luck.So you can go for it, if you guys are lucky enough and do not need any customer support."
2,"A month after receiving the wireless keyboard, the switch on the keyboard has started malfunctioning. The keyboard now works very erratically.I am unable to carry it the very long distance to the Logitech service centre in Andheri-East as I have a spinal fracture. So, to me this product has been a write off of the money spent. Logitech should not incorporate the switch on the keyboard. It is a component that is most likely to malfunction on switching it on and off every day. Can Amazon help me with a replacement?"
1,"KEY BOARD PARTIALLY STOPPED WORKING IN 15 DAYS... MANY OF THE KEYS ARE NOT WORKING ONLY MOUSE IS WORKING , WORST EXPERIENCE FOR ME AS SERVICE CENTRE IS 40KMS FROM MY PLACE NERUL TO GOREGAON ... SO FOR ME ITS LIKE AFTER GOING WITH BEST AVAILABLE KEYBOARD COMBO IM LEFT WITH MOUSE ONLY CAUSE ITS NOT PRACTICALY POSSIBLE TO GO 40KMS IN MUMBAI JUST FOR KEYBOARD ..."
5,"Great product.Pros1. On off switch on keyboard and mouse2. Caps lock indicator3. Shortcut keys like calculator sound etc4. Nano receiver5. Compartment inside mouse to hold nano receiver.6. Spill resistant,  has pockets beneath so that water that enters can drain out easily.7.Keys need very soft touch.Cons ( Not a big issue though)1. No num lock indicator2. Mouse slightly small than averageGo for it.Nice product. I got for 1499 in lightning deal."
5,"This is actually a keyboard which one longs for. Smooth and silent typing, perfect in size. Spill proof feature and the extra key rows on top are the best part of it. The keays are placed in a flat tray which has few small wholes under it to drain out the liquid, if accidentally some falls on the keyboard. Top key rows idea includes some dedicated keys for shut down, calculator, media keys etc.The mouse clicks are also very smooth and silent with an on/off button just like the keyboard, though its a bit small in size as compared to other normal sized mice. But, I think, its not a big issue, as you will get accustomed to it in a day or two.Lagfree connection and steady performance will surely win you heart very soon.Overall, a great combo. Just go for it."
1,"Clearly, there was a clarification that this is a Logitech UNIFYING technology. The reality was that it was not. The biggest problem is that it does not allow me to return the product. Only an exchange. I do not want this product since it does not have the Unifying feature. I still do not know know to return this product and I am struggling, as of now. This is a highly overpriced product."
1,"The Ordered product is different from the received one. We ordered key board with mouse, along with battries. ""Logitech MK270r Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo for Windows, 2.4 GHz Wireless, Compact Wireles...."". And the amazon standard packaging is aslo not there. We received simply the logitech cartoon normal taped on the both the ends, resulted broken keys in this wrong product. suggestion to the seller and the amazon, Please try to improve these. I have returned to replace the same ordereded product. let me see what they are going to send."
4,"Before saying anything, here is the list of pros and cons:Pros:1. Build Quality, Looks sturdy, and premium.2. Keyboard's keys are soft to press, good for typing.3. The range is great (About 6-7 feet in my case).4. KB and Mouse both have On/Off Key.5. The keyboard has a Caps Lock Indicator.6. The mouse has an invisible optical sensor that means more battery life.Cons:1. The mouse is so small if you compare it with other brands like Dell, HP, Lenovo2. The price is a little high.3. Battery compartment cover on KB and mouse are a little bit loose.(But it's not like they will open by themself. Not a deal-breaker)So the overall package is good and you can definitely buy it. Just remember that the mouse size is a little smaller than the regular one. So if you have a big palm like me, you have to adjust to it but you will get used to of it."
4,"I wanted a full size keyboard to carry in my laptop bag. Most compact keyboards have the layout like laptops i.e. mini arrow keys and cornered page up/down keys, which is illogical because who would buy a separate keyboard which is EXACTLY the same as the laptop's keyboard?Hence I bought this Logitech one which was at a discount in a lightning deal. The keyboard buttons are super smooth, once you press a key gently there is no friction and the key will be pressed all the way down, typing is so much fun with it. Although it is a full size keyboard, it is still a little say 10% smaller than a normal PC keyboard, hence I can easily fit it in my laptop bag.Both the mouse and keyboard use a common nano receiver, earlier I had a wireless Dell mouse and I didn't want to insert two separate usb receivers for both keyboard and mouse, this logitech combo serves that purpose perfectly.There are batteries provided in both of these but they are normal AA ones, I replaced them will Duracell AA cell immediately on unboxing.NOTE: I ALMOST RETURNED this product because I COULDN'T FIND the nano receiver initially. It was supposed to be inside the mouse, near the battery but it wasn't there, the receiver was inserted inside a corner piece of the cardboard outer box, there is no indication on the box where to find it, luckily I found it before I clicked on the final return button."
1,"I'm unable to write much about the product because I received it broken. Out of the box, One key on the keyboard was out. Clearly the packaging and handling was the issue.It wasn't packed in an Amazon package. The box was just wrapped with plastic wrap. I could see the impressions of keys on the plastic cover of keyboard. It must have been under other heavy stuff. I'm returning this!Giving 1 star because of the pathetic packaging and handling. Otherwise, the product gives a nice first impression. Quick word after 5mins usage- both keyboard and mouse look good and top-row multimedia keys work good for calculator, play/pause, volume etc. 1 con though- the mouse wheel doesn't give a nice feedback, bit greecy."
1,"I opened the package 3 days ago and initially for a few hours the keyboard and mouse worked erratically. The next day the performance became worse, to the extent that I cannot work on the keyboard or mouse at all. While typing on keyboard, the characters appear on the screen after a lag of a few seconds, and then too incomplete.Unfortunately for me, the return window is not open anymore even if I used the product for only 3 days.I used to consider Logitec a premium rand, but now I have lost faith in all Logitec products. Complete waste of money.Complete waste of money"
1,Worst keyboard ever used i thaught logitech is the best productbi can use as iam using a wired logitech mouse for more than 4years i baught it two month back on amazon sale after few days it stoped responding after some time same with the wireless mouse so i asked helpnin amazon so the help and refund returnable was for only 10days so last two days back i went to logitech service and respond is worst they replaced it with new but still am facing the same issue it stops responding after sometime even after changing the batteries
1,"DO NOT BUY this model. It was good initially, but as days progressed, keys have become hard. Only if you hit the keys hard, you will see the letter getting typed on the screen. Support? Warranty? Dont get fooled. Support phone number given in the website says ""Switched Off"". No Support or Warranty at all. Logitech fooled me big time. Ordered two for my office and both are giving me problems."
1,"I purchased this product based on amazon suggestion. Initial product delivery was in damaged condition, so I have requested replacement, they replaced the new one today on 2020-06-17, but all the keys are not functional. I have attached the keyboard test as well to show how many keys are defective.When I buy product on amazon, I trust that amazon delivers best, but this is very disappointing, I expect product should be top notch and in perfect working condition. Hope you will take care of it from the next time."
5,"Though I don't like the curvy design, but the product is working fine. No connectivity issue. Mouse is small for a big palm like me.. at first I purchased Amkette Wireless Keyboard and mouse combo which has all the functions like all the indicators and a big mouse, but the mouse had connectivity issue and I had to return that. This Logitech combo has only Caps lock indicator but is working fine. I'm satisfied with this purchase."
5,This is a very nice combo of wireless keyboard and mouse I ordered it from Amazon a few months ago and I am loving it.  Keyboard are nice and soft you will feel like that you are typing on a Laptop. The keys are very comfortable to use. The mouse is perfect with  Nice respond to the commandBoth On and off buttons are provided on both the keyboard and about and they work immediately after turning them on.There is no delay in the commands.  Go to keyboard and the mouse are active and fast to respond I love this product thanks Logitech for creating such an amazing  Logitech for creating such an amazing home comboü•∞
1,"It looks good, easy to carry and sturdy... But all that is worthless if the connection to the computer (or any other device) is bad....The dongle must be in line of sight for the mouse and the keyboard, else you experience a serious amount of lag. I ve tried changing the batteries to new ones and the problem still existsThis is what disappoints me..."
1,"Does not type Upper Case K, P, D, & many letters. To type P we have to first type lowercase p and then replace that with uppercase P. Strange errors. Even after updating the software it wont become better. Updating is very difficult. The update software does not recognize that it is connected, even though it is connected. Strange keyboard of low quality. Local firms produce keyboards at cheaper price & of better quality."
1,"After Missing the USB Chord on 1st order, when I replace, it is found that the arrow key of the keyboard is displaced to very far near 'A' button without unsealed the keyboard . Do you think it will ask for a rating ?"
5,- Soft keys press like butter- long battery backup 2 years for the keyboard and 8 months for mouse daily usage 8-9 hours except for sunday I'm using the same set of the keyboard since 2014 it's my next purchase.- No lag in connectivity also you can use when you connect your television operate from sofa :)- Robust build but bit cheap plastic compare to 2014 purchased model- If you want to use for office or home this one is perfect- The mouse is very handy medium size not too big or smallI'm rating this 8.5 out of 10
1,"Logitech mk270r wireless keyboard mouse comboBought with very high expectations.1. The packaging was damaged as gou can see in image i attached.2. package seems to be already opened, batteries were already installed. One extra AA Battery installed in the mouse (not mentioned in package)3. mouse was already in ON mode with Aa battery installed.4. LEFT CTRL key was in the package  instead of being on the KB.5. ENTER key on the number pad is placed in reverse as  seen in image6. one battery installed in KB with other one and KB battery Cover lying loose in the package.7. The indicators in KB (caps lock), and mouse does not seem to light up.8. The USB RECEIVER missing from its place inside the mouse. so couldn't check whether working or not.didn't expect this from amazon. could have got the same from reliance digital delivered at almost the same price from the nearest outlet.Anyways applied for a replacement (as the product seems to be non returnable. shall update my review after i get the replacement."
1,"Decided to return the product within few minutes of receiving it, for the following reasons.1. Both keyboard and mouse were very noisy..just can't bear the taka taka noise. Not only disturbs my concentration but I do a lot of Skype meetings in WFH mode and its extremely annoying for the paticipants on other side. 2. The pictures are bit deceptive, both mouse and keyboard are small. Keyboard width is ok, but the height is too small and I felt uncomfortable to use it. Prior to this I was using Dell KM 113, soft and no noise, working fine since Jan 2016, it has extra space at the bottom row of ky to rest hands comfortably, just that i needed extra USB slot for separate mouse, hence ordered this combo set.3. Mouse came defective ot of the box, light was not working.4. This feedback for Amazon seller, they sent me the item in a huge cartoon, which could easily fit a 32"" TV or 20-30 keyboard sets, see pic. Not sure what was the reason for such a huge cartoon, waste of resources and extra burden on ligistics."
2,Buy this wireless keyboard ONLY if you are just going to use it for basic use.NEVER for any sort of gaming. Keyboard and Mouse both lags on high CPU usage or game frame rates.there is no refund only useless replacement for this.I went back to my wired keyboard and mouse within one day. This is now packed back into the box...I will probably sell it for a loss on olx...
1,"After 4 months of infrequent use, the spring under some of the keys broke down. The product boasts of warranty of three years but it wont last even 6 months. The service centre at Gurgaon doesn't have the replacement ready. It takes nearly 10-15 days to get a new replacement. Till that time, sit tight and enjoy becuase you bought logitech product. Please avoid !!"
3,"Review after 5 months of usageThe Good:The keyboard is good, strongly built, easily goes for years.It has all the keys you need, keys for volume control are really handy for me same with home, end button which are missing in my laptop.Works with Mac - Im able to use windows button as command key for (apple) mac, the Alt key as option key.It has caps lock indicator (light) which is helpful while typing the passwords.Not so good:However the keys bit hard especially when you are trying to type fast, you need to make sure that the keys are fully pressed down, otherwise some of the key may not be registered. The hard keys issue specifically happens when your finger touches the edge of the key - the key get kind of stuck between the adjacent keys. Its difficult to ensure that the fingers touch exactly in the middle of the key, its really annoying. This is happening more with windows key which Im using as command keyIf you want to really soft keyboard this may not be the option."
1,"Sometimes mouse and keyboard does not work, not expected from a company like Logitech"
5,"Even though this is not meant for Gaming, I have ended up using it. I thought we use a wireless PS4 controller so why not this. I also have a ReadGear Gaming Keyboard + Mouse combo and its started giving me issue in a year of gaming. I had to replace my ReadGear set with LG G102 Gamin Mouse and HP Gaming Keyboard K500F.This in comparison is working really well. All the Keys work fine, there are no misfires.. Its excellent. O have noticed some signal issues, for this I just make sure that the radio is connected on either side of the laptop (Not on one of the back USB Connectors)."
5,"Being a combo pack, don't expect a high quality product especially mouse.Keyboard build looks sturdy and when we type, we get some typing sound which is satisfying (this is subjective).Caps lock indicator works fine. On/off button works fine.Once I received product, I checked online if my keys are working fyn or not :D and everything is fine.Coming to Mouse, it appears with decent build quality(saying this because I have used lenovo 300(this is of solid build) earlier, on comparing logitech's mouse with Lenovo's, I observed it.).Battery, on/off button works fine. Mouse's precision is accurate and there's no lag.(even though if there's any lag, we can tweak the mouse settings).It was mentioned that battery life for keyboard is 36months and of mouse is 18months.When u turn it off while u r not using, expected battery life can be attained.Main reason I purchased this one is, I used Logitech K120 earlier, referring to its build quality, I got this one. And I needed 3 yrs warranty and good battery life with on/off buttons on both.Point to be noted : this is not a compact product. This one is a standard keyboard with all keys. So don't expect to carry it everywhere. If u need a compact one, u can go with portronics."
1,"After a firtnightly usage, with a sluggish and lagging Logitech MK270R keyboard and Mouse combo, I have thrown the KB and mouse into the dustbin. Such a badly designed product. It just literally slows down a 8 GB PC with ample storage space. Wireless connectivity to internet is getting slowed down. If I disconnect the KB and mouse from the computer, the net works normal and the mouse and keyboard  typing actions is taking ages to show up on the screen. I updated all the drivers including Logitech SPOT app. But to my dismay it has tested my patience prompting me to use the old PS/2 KB  and Moouse which are wired and work without any issues. Please don't buy this product."
5,"Great product from Logitech. Always recommend.High-quality product and is very durable, great precision.The mouse is Invisible Optic.I do both coding and gaming using this and surprisingly has a long battery life.Haven't changed the battery since purchase (before 4 months).Good for daily usage.Amazon delivery was great and arrived before the expected date."
1,"The product I got seems to be defective. The keys a wobbly, once you are typing, there is a lag.The product when I received was in a damaged package, when asked to the delivery, told he cannotdo anything about it. While typing the keys are getting missed.Not a product that I was expecting to be so cheap."
1,The keyboard and mouse stop and start functioning on a random basis.When actively typing the keyboard just freezes up or the unifying receiver stop responding and the keystrokes are completely lost.  This is a major issue when typing passwords. The same happens with the mouse pointer. The mouse pointer is jumpy or completely unresponsive and one ends up clicking unwanted things which becomes a waste of time. Contacting the logitech service center is also a complete waste of time. Think 2ice before buying it even though there might be offers on it.
1,"Within a month of use, the keys become loose and sometimes presses down on its own. With limited Service Centres (Ensure Services) and ""Great Than Thou"" attitude of Service Centre staff and Amazon ""apologetically refusing"" to do any help, I have decided to make it run as long as it dones and then buy a new one. Seems like few others buyers are facing the same issue. Anyway travelling to a service centre will cost as much as buying a new one."
4,"I'm using this for 3 days only so its a quick review.Keyboard :Overall size is adequate for usage. Key sizes are a bit shorter than a regular wired keyboard of HP or Dell is what I felt bcos of which keys are going to next key than intended. Keys are noisy while typing, sounds like a less than 500 Rs unbranded keyboard which is not good for the brand.No comments on lag or range while typingMouse : I was using MK331 Silent mouse earlier, compared to that Smaller in size, and the feel is not good also click sounds are noisy. But this is not a silent mouse so accepted. I saw a bit of lag not sure whether this is bcos of something else.Overall this is budget pack.if you can extend a bit more go for MK345 combo, it claims quiet keyboard and the mouse looks like MK331 silent mouse but nowhere its is mentioned as M331 in the site."
4,"I was actually pleasantly surprised how sturdy, robust and convenient this keyboard and mouse combo turned out to be.Pros:1. The keys are remarkably silent compared to many other keyboards2. The keys size and shape is sturdy and even the print is good which makes it super easy to operate3. Mouse is handy, small enough, big enough which makes it very friendly and reduces the chances of getting RSI4. Both keyboard and mouse have on/off toggle switches which is saving battery a lot and they last longer5. Indicator for CAPS lock comes handyCONS1. There are no indicators for Num Lock and Scroll Lock2. There is no indicator for battery levelOverallGreat value for money, if above indicators are added and keys are made slightly more silent, it will earn 5 stars on any day"
1,I have has very bad experience with the warranty section of Logitech. I talked to the number given. First you to have to keep on trying. Secondly it when you reach them and explain to them the problem faced by you then they refer you to another number which they call it as Service Centre. If that is what they wanted to do then  why not give the Service Centre number then the other number. They just do not want to avoid servicing under warranty. I have been regularly been their customer for last more than 10 years. I am facing teh same prob lem of right c lic k being not working after ab t 8 to 9 months. This I faced it earlier but did not take it up. I am very diappointed.
3,"No complaint from product, it is designed to satisfy. Great build quality and trust of Logitech.2 stars reduced for packaging. Keyboard was in box it's ok, it was protected. But mouse was randomly laying in polybag pack of Amazon. Atleast a bubble wrap or some recyclable cardboard could have been used to protect it from shock.P.S. I am a environmentalist and I hate too much packing and wasting resources but certain things cannot be avoided."
5,"My first impressions are its a Fantastic product for the price. Can't expect better than this. Excellent packaging. Superfast delivery. Keys of keyboard are soft and layout is spacious enough. Mouse is sleek and cute. Had thought it was overpriced when ordering the item but now Delighted to be using it. If price is not an issue, Go for it without hesitation."
2,This is the worst keyboard I have used. There is a flex in keyboard whenever I type keys from the middle of keyboard and it causes springy noise. The springy noise is very irritating. I will buy another keyboard mouse combo from different brand.Review update: Adding one more star since I can avoid flex in the middle and springy noise by adding rubber stopper under the middle of the keyboard.
5,"excellent product, i should have ordered this in first attempt instead of ordering MK235. anyway i did good by ordering this product. I always trust Appario  and blindly orders anything from them.Pros:1. soft and quick responsive as wired keyboard I was using -keyboard& mouse2. ergonomic keyboard , but mouse you have to adjust if you were using bigger one previously.3. nice keyboard shortcuts if you really wanna use or having any habit using them.-for me i don't remember having them on my keyboard, but it takes some time to get habituated4. silent as per my requirement , don't compare with really silent ones.cons:mouse ergonomics are actually good, but me having bigger hand, really felling much pain at wrist base.I don't really suggest this for extensive gaming, may be okay with casual gaming.overall this is after 24 hrs use and will update if anything I see in future.Adios amigo."
1,"Purchased the Logitech MK270R Full Size Wireless combo Keyboard and Mouse a few days back.  My old Microsoft Keyboard stopped working, but, Mouse is still going strong.  It was the Microsoft 800.  Dont even remember when I purchased them - it was that long.This product has a design flaw.  The Wireless Dongle which we insert into the computer or USB Hub has a very very short range.  And it has to be in the line of sight of the keyboard and mouse.  The first one I got, developed the problem the first day itself.  Waited for two more days, and as the problem seem to get worse, ordered for a replacement, assuming the particular piece was defective.Replacement arrived just now.  Exact same problem in the replacement pieces too.  The Dongles seem to be the problem.  They mouse and keyboard are working fine for a few minutes and suddenly stop responding.  If I wave the keyboard or bring it like real close to the dongle, it starts to work.  Exact same problem with the mouse.  It works when it as a distance of only 1.5 feet from the dongle.  Thankfully, could request for a refund, which I hope to get by tomorrow, as per message received.Going back to a Microsoft Wireless Combo, even if it costs much more."
3,"I received the keyboard in a beaten out package...with some keys popped off, but no keys were missing fixed it back and no issue.Build quality is cheap....but kind of looks OK with some matte texture ...at least until you pick it up. keyboard is very light weight , bendable you can break it with your bare hands. Mouse is fine , the dongle is stored at the bottom of the mouse ... it leaves a hole under the mouse when you take the dongle out (if you care :P)Keys have a fair travel..but the squishy/rubbery membrane feel is there !. Some people here says problem with mouse but mine is fine until now and its fairly responsive for the price .There is a serious difference between the  iball and cheapest Logitech ones in mostly every manner!. Always go with those if you are comparing!"
1,"Updated Review: Horrible purchase.You can't clean the keyboard easilyThe keys flick out while typingBattery life is super awful for both mouse and keyboardBought 3 sets, all 3 same issue. It isn't cheap because the experience and aftercosts are awfully excessive. Regret it with utmost frustration.Old review below isn't valid anymore but leaving it so you can see what really happened and how awful this set is.Old Review„ÄãOver the decades I have purchased many Wireless Keyboard-Mice set including big brand names like Logitech, Microsoft and Dell. While they are good quality but are often too expensive for most buyers or the lower range sets do not have the quality required. This keyboard and mice set by Zebronics is finally the answer to both the problems.Pros:1. Sturdy make and elevated keys are really super convenient to use.2. Very easy to clean and maintain without much hassle3. Battery lasts really long and best point - single battery each for both keyboard and mouse.4. Mouse is just the right size, neither too bulky, nor too small.5. Low Battery indication is super handy in the keyboard.Cons:1. Mouse does not have low battery indication but then again with only one battery requirement, its not a big one2. No Indicators for Num, Scroll, and Caps-Lock keys being active.If you look at the entire package, and pricing, it is great value for money. I was skeptical at first but after buying one set and seeing its performance over 6 months, I purchased yet another set and intend to replace all sets one by one with the Zebronics Companion 102 model specifically.My recommendation - GO FOR IT!"
5,"Have been looking a good range wireless keyboard for a very long time and now i can lit up my head that i have got a perfect wireless keyboard and mouse. I strongly recommed it to the office users as most of my presentation i bring up laptop and all the time i have to walk near the laptop to change the slides, now why worrie? when i got this wireless keyboard to change the slide from the place where is stand. I also use it for my personal home use where i can sit in the couch and watch my fav movie from lap and no need go near to the lap to change the movie just sit on my couch and use my fav keyboard...Zebronicz is always the best in the market and this item is far good.. I blindly recommend it.. I give my personal guarenntteee.."
5,"Guys this product is too good üëå in its range ... I bought it in 9‚Ç¨ price might be fluctuate as per demand ... Lets come on its review keyboard buttons are amazing , sensitive enough , design is well and good  , connectivity is at its best . Mouse design is ok , connectivity is super awesome ... I would recommend u guys to go for it üòÅ I am totally satisfied with it .... Go for it üëç"
3,"I ordered this combo pack and was promptly delivered the next day. Thanks Amazon for the experience.The keyboard required 1*AAA battery and the mouse needs 1*AA battery which fortunately comes along with the package. The keyboard has floating key design which has good tactile feel to it and so far has been crisp. However the same cannot be said for the mouse as it feels small in the palm and has very inaccurate pointing.Overall, when compared the price with other big brands this package it an essential VFM product.Edit: Reducing a star because of the poor performance of the mouse, it lacks precision and battery life awful"
5,This combo of keyboard and mouse is very useful for daily activities on laptop l. The precision is good and the in built design is good.The only issue is sometimes the keyboard is malfunctioning sometimes and goes on typing the same letter for so many times.
5,As a gamer i always love to use a wireless keys and mouse but not all are worthy until.i find this awesome keyboard trust me one of the best in Market and makes a best in Amazon store. Now i can take my place in my room and connect wirelessly and play my game anytime anyplace best for our generation ppl
5,Bhare!!Jordaar..
5,By far very good if anyone wants a budgeted keyboard and a mouse go for it.Just an issue the light in keyboard if at night or dark room you use not so effective bus looks great will suggest to buy it.
1,Disappointed by the product I received. This is the 2nd time I've ordered this product and I'm having the same issue. In previous order also the mouse was damaged and now in this order also the mouse is damaged.
5,"very user friendly , light weight, responsive keysthanks"
5,Mouse battery consumption is too high
5,"Everything is fine, except the absence of light indicator for. Caplock key. Battery for Mouse drain fast."
4,"This wireless keyboard is very good as expected. But with regards to the mouse, the build quality and the look should have been better. And both keyboard and mouse works really good. Good part is that have got batteries(Normal one, not a rechargeable) along with the packing that I received so no need of buying it again."
5,Vert nice and sleek product
5,It's a good keyboard & mousebattery life is longworks perfectly finedesign is new & nice
5,Very good product at reasonable price. Handy to use
5,Pretty good. Soomth for typing and comfortable to set. Easy installation. Auto sleep mode great feature in this. That feature seems great.
5,Keyboard and mouse are of very good quality. The range is also very good as i m using it for my cctv. Works fine. Looks good. Amazing quality.
1,"Cheee worst, this keyboard already stopped working and thanks to amazon for selling worst products at cheap price without maintaining any standard. No customer service from zeb as well wasted all my money"
5,if you don't give the battery it i okayBut low quality battery are loss u r reputation
5,Good product üëçüòπ
4,"For a office purpose it's great good product , if u are searching for a basic wireless keyboard and mouse u can go for it"
5,Very good product
5,As of now its working good but battery included with this worst. My battery stopped working in mouse.
5,"Recently I have purchased this product. One of the awesome part of this product is a single adapter can be used for connecting both the keyboard and mouse. I have using the keyboard and mouse for both coding and gaming purpose, it works good for me. And best of all is that it's price of 750rupees."
5,Always zeb good brand. It proves with this.
1,"I have used this product for 3 months and now I am suggesting you people not to buy this keyboard and mouse. Battery life is very less and build quality is also low. Please dont go with its cheap price. My mouse is not working properly. Sometimes it work. Sometimes doesnt. The light in its mouse is not optical means not invisible. For wireless mouse optical invisible light is must for more battery life. My keyboard is completly filled of dust which I cant clean. Finally I need to tell, please dont buy this."
5,This product has nano technology which is good and both keyboard and mouse need only one sensor
5,I am using this product from last 5 month.It's working good.Battery life also ok for my light use.Little issue in Keywords key it's remove easily.
4,Not comfortable to use as key rows are arranged on same plane.
5,Supr quality
5,Battery draining very soon
5,"It is working very good, lightweight, everything is good about it."
5,Awsm keyboard & mouse but not strong
5,awesome product for the price. auto connect in windows 10. no drivers needed. very fast.
5,Value for money
5,keyboard keys are going to smoothly
5,Good product
5,Good product
1,"The reason why I have to work more in this WFH, is this keyboard. every time when I type anything on this keyboard it misses many letters. and soon after writing the long comments, I realize many words are incomplete or type incompletely/incorrectly.My personal opinion is to look for some other better options or go with a wired keyboard. I can't comment in there exists such an issue with every wireless keyboard or specifically with my model.Other worst thing happened to me is that I contacted Amazon on the day when the replacement window got closed.But what can I do, on that day I realized it was something that is happening very frequently and I can't work like this. First they said they will help me get it replaced as I am a valuable customer and later on contacting them back they started explaining me their policies.I this time I can't even visit service center, and even if I do then no guarantee they will get it done asap.So better buy any other product based on my experience with it.Thanks...."
5,"Here's my detailed product review (also testing out the keyboard as I type this!).Delivery from Amazon took less than 24 hours. Although the product comes in a see through packaging from Amazon so the original Lenovo carton is visible when you receive the product. Nothing that one should be worried about though.The keyboard:The keyboard is adequately sized. The key spacing is perfect to my linking and typing on it feels very smooth with no clicking sound from the keys. It features three LED indicators for caps lock, num lock and what appears to be a low battery indicator. Keep in mind though that the indicators don't stay on - they go off after a few seconds so it is difficult to tell if the caps/num lock key is ON by looking at the indicators. They do however clearly indicate that the key was pressed or released. Not really a pain point. The keyboard uses a single AAA cell that comes in the box. The physical appearance of the keyboard is alright - nothing very fancy. The keys have a frosted ""top"" with white lettering and the key edges have a glossy black finish. Stand out feature- it has a volume control keys on the top row!!The mouse:I have been using the Logitech m235 wireless mouse for the last two years and have grown used to it so the one thing that I notice with this mouse is the speed. I have had to bump up the mouse pointer speed setting under windows  to the maximum with almost any mouse that I have used. For this one I feel I may have to lower that setting. Having said that the precision and accuracy is really good for my work (I don't do any graphic/CAD design though so I wouldn't know if this suits those requirements). It runs off a AA battery that comes in the box and has a recess underneath to house the USB receiver in whenever you're not using it. It is also provided with an ON/OFF slider switch. Compared to the keyboard I find that the appearance of the mouse is better than the keyboard's with a neat glossy black trim wrapping around the mouse with matt black finish on top with the Lenovo branding.Bottom line: If you're looking for a basic wireless keyboard and mouse, you should go for it . Even without being a full multimedia keyboard it has Volume control keys that is a real plus point. I got it from Cloudtail for 999 as a lightning deal."
4,"Value of Money, Good Product, if you use key board for any android device, first change settings under key board, and set remote key board then only your enter key word else while pressing enter key it reflect 'q'. overall nice deal, fast delivery from amazon got @ 850/- under lightning deal with 15% cash back."
1,"Actually i don't like to Write negative feedback for any  product unless the product was fault or not worthy,And this Product With name brand lenovo but i'm not sure its Original,5 months only used this - 12 batteries replaced, okay i adjust that and used,And now Mouse Scroll not Working, its going to trash hereafter,This is BIGSCAM in eCommerce, it has Serial Number Informations, i tried to check with Lenovo website but the device didn't recognised,Cheap Product, Only Buy If its come with 600-700rs. offer, Don't waste your money!!Believe me, You regret it! Definitely its not worth your 1400rs."
5,Awosme product. I m very happy to get this product
2,"I Purchased this product because reviews showed me that the product have light indicator when the caps lock key is turned on or off, but this is not complete reality when you press caps lock key, light is blinked only one time to indicate that caps lock is on, it is not turned on till you press the caps lock key again like other keyboard.Because of which it becomes difficult to use MS Word, Excel etc where it is commonly used."
1,"Product box was not sealed, also the box was broken as if it was used previously.Important point is, this product has only one year warranty as per warranty card but seller has mentioned 3 year warranty.Keyboard keys quality is not good, keys are very delicate looks like it can be easily broken. Num lock and caps lock light doesn't remains on when keys are active hence difficult to guess if keys are pressed.Mouse quality is good."
5,"After lot of research I ended up purchasing this combo. Both keyboard and mouse are working seamlessly. Keyboard typing is comfortable. The led indicators on keyboard is tiny though and does not stay lit always, i.e. once activated, it blinks for couple of time and goes away but that's fine, atleast you will get the indicators while most other brand does not have indicators for all options. No lag while typing. Mouse is super smooth. Clicks and scrolls are both very good."
2,"The mouse is working. There is a power problem with the keyboard. Sometimes it is working fine, sometimes not. When not working, I simply rotate the battery in connected position, then it works.Numlock indicator supposed to be lighted continously. When it is pressed, indicator blinks for about five seconds, then go off.Suggest me what to do."
1,"Product looks good,Fast delivery.Keyboard & Mouse paired very fast.Mouse work fine, but Keyboard is not working properly.In Keyboard CAPS & NUM lock LED indicator are not staying, when you press button, LED comes & goes off immediately, due this You cannot know whether CAPS & NUM lock ON/OFF.I returned & replaced the product, still the same issue continues.If this is expected functionality of the Product, then it's very bad product design."
1,"Do not purchase!This is the second set we have got, as in the first set, mouse was faulty. At start, the set worked fine. Next week there was major lag between the Keyboard, the mouse & the receiver. We thought it was the battery so we changed it. It ran fine then again the same problem persists. We thought the battery was bad so we changed it again. But then again the problem persists. I understand i'm out of return policy or refund & don't mind the cost, but the set is bad & shame o n Amazon & Appario to sell me this equipment. Do not purchase!"
3,"Writing a review after using the product for a week.Well, it is great to be honest. Does what it is intended for. The mouse is good. I am very particular about the grip and sensitivity of the mouse. I have used many wireless mouses and not all of them are good. This mouse may well be used for gaming as well (better than average but not exactly comparing with core gaming mouse)They keyboard is a bit of a let down. The range is weak. It loses connectivity if the adapter is not in sight.I am using it on my mac."
5,"The keys are not very plasticky and has a quite a bit of travel as one would prefer from a desk keyboard. The keys are soft and pretty responsive.The mouse on the other hand is a bit too light, which I am not very fond of, but is very responsive and smooth. The buttons provide a good feel and overall the build quality is satisfactory.Coming to the battery life, it‚Äôs running for over two months now, without any problems and the claims by Lenovo  on battery are yet to be justified.The keyboard cannot be turned off, there is no switch for that, but the mouse has a switch to turn it off or on. I haven‚Äôt turned off any of the devices yet from the time I bought it, and I use it around 9/10 hours everyday with the new work from home norm. The battery is holding up pretty good till now."
5,This product is good and easy to use and lightweight. You can use this product for typing fast and also having a good feeling that we are using on PC. Nive and quality product.
1,"I was expecting a cheap keyboard but not so cheap. Keypads are stiff and typing a sentence can take ages even for experts. It will not last more than year I‚Äôm sure if used more than 5-6 hours a day.. keyboard and the keypad is very compact and has nice design .. but what‚Äôs the point when one has to struggle to type. I may end up throwing or donating it away to someone. I sincerely request people not to buy this model, spend some more money to save all the money on other product. If one does have too much of work then may think of buying. Quality is very cheap."
5,"I made this purchase 2 years back and only once I replaced battery for keyboard notfor the mouse, by the way I don't use that mouse as my primary mouse and one thing is noticable as I used this keyboard for gaming all the time."
4,Awesome keyboard. Right size. Best thing it has single usb connector for both wireless mouse and keyboard so saving another usb port for other usage.Keys are a litte hard and not very soft but i think it will get soft with usage.Happy with the product. I got it forRs 1190. Review on 1st day. But since it has warranty i m not much worried.
1,Keyboard is hard and stiff. Not at all easy to use. Unfortunately this happened a month after purchase I.e. after the window for returning the item has closed so basically there's nothing one can do but grin and bare or throw the keyboard out. Sucks!
1,"Everything was all good, worked well initially, layout, feel, etc. all suited me. BUT then, suddenly I started noticing missing key strokes. I thought it is battery problem, changed its battery to new Duracell Ultra but then also it didn't worked.This problem is making this key board unusable. It is in warranty but don't know whether they will accept this or not plus running to service center during this pandemic time is also not a good option. So, within 1 month my money is wasted and now nothing but an e-waste."
1,"Keyboard misses several signals. Cannot type fast. One has to be very slow. At times, it just hangs and one has to wait several seconds, before continue to type. Sent a message to Lenovo Customer Care, but no response.I have tried on 2 laptops, one being brand new.Laptop is placed just one feet away and receiver is plugged directly into laptop. Tried changing battery also."
2,"This keyboard results in erratic keystroke capture. It seems to be completely whimsical working perfectly sometimes and not at other times.I sit away from the laptop (about 8 feet away). Did not face this issues with my earlier keyboards.This can be quite irritating when you are typing more to only realise later that letters are missing.The other issue I see is that the Caps lock and num lock light dont stay on.So not sure how this feature helps, especially Caps lock. The light simply blinks and turns off.I started to type this review as the keyboard again gave me a problem with all keystrokes not being captured.Funnily, while I typed this review, it worked flawlessly."
4,"I bought this since i own a Lenovo all in one desktop PC. and the Keyboard and mouse that came with it was broken.1. The build quality is no where near the keyboard/mouse that I got in box (same lenovo brand) with the desktop PC. Having said that the build quality of this mouse/keyboard not that bad either. The keys are ergonomic and good. The mouse keys are good.2. Like many people mentioned in the reviews, the caps lock and num lock indication lights glow and turn OFF and do not stay ON as required. Probably an issue with the hardware.3. Overall its a decent buy."
2,"the keys are hard to use and put a lot of pressure on fingers. They are not made for long use.After a 2-3 months, the ctrl-key got stuck. Then a few more months down the line, i have a case of missing letters.The warranty is not at home and in NCR it is either in Ghaziabad or Delhi.the mouse also started having problems with right click after sometime.Would not recommend it to buy."
3,First delivery did not work properly with some keys on the keyboard not consistently working and erratic mouse movements. Suspect problem was with the Bluetooth dongle that was part of the k/b+mouse kit. Replacement (same make & model) was promptly delivered and works without a problem. Soft-touch keyboard (membrane) takes a short-while to get used to but is OK once familiar with it.
5,"A very good product (keyboard and mouse) in this price range. I found it user friendly. I now use it for my full day work. So far no problems.Suggestion- provide caps lock indicator light near or on the button itself, having it near Num pad does not help much...Escape and other function keys can be bit bigger but not that big dealGiving 4 stars on Ergonomic for Mouse size."
2,"The keys of it is nice. Ergonics is very good. But it is very bad for gaming, when I play video games, the keyboard just disconnects from the computer automatically and then I have to remove the battery and then again put it in the keyboard and then starts to work again. It is so annoying to do this again and again. For gaming very very poor, and for daily use, internet browsing and office, it is average."
5,"Excellent choice of keyboard and mouse for this price, can be used for office and gaming purpose . At first the mouse looks small but the premium feel makes it better, I would say the mouse isn‚Äôt the issue ( big palms user ).Used the keyboard for my thing as runs without delay and very smooth, used for gaming (FIFA and Valorant ) very good performance they‚Äôre too.Great prod at this price point."
5,Reviewing this after using my first Lenovo 100 for more than 2 years.Now I have purchased it for another laptop.Goodness of keyboard -Full size keyboard.Conventional lay-out with proper space.Smooth buttons.Goodness of mouse -Standard size mouseWith on/off switch.Buttons and roller working so smoothly till day.Long battery life.
2,"The product looks beautiful and sleek. The keys are large and needs a little bit to get used to. My main problem was that there were a lot of missed keystrokes. It's not just when you are typing fast, you have to type really slow to register all keystrokes. I have used a logitech wireless keyboard + mouse combo and faced no such problems. Disappointed in this product as lenovo is a trusted brand. The mouse works great though."
1,"After 6 months of use, 8 times out of 10 the keys are completely unresponsive, changed to new batteries but didn‚Äôt help, the keyboard is never more than 6 feet away from the receptor, be it gaming or watchin movies it‚Äôs frustrating at times, the left click on the mouse gives away too easily, had to change the settings n now using the right click, no durability or longevity."
4,"It's not for gamers, as it feels a little delicate for that but for someone who has to type a lot. It's not heavy at all, I can take it in my lap and type all day long. Quite easy to use. It's sleek, simple and smart just what I was looking for. A perfect no nonsense keyboard and mouse combo that means business. The only let down that I felt is build quality, it could have been a little stardy, keyboard feels a little fragile apart from that it's maska.... Thanks lenovo, thanks amazon..."
3,"Perhaps due to typing on another keyboard, I am having difficulty typing but I am trying to change my habit of hitting hard on keys. Backspace and enter keys give troubleOtherwise, with light strokes, it works fine. It is a minimalistic design and perhaps the cheapest keyboard mouse combo of Lenovo.I Will take time to comment correctly"
5,"Recommended. However be informed, that the power in the mouse doesn't switch off automatically, when the computer is switched off. Should be manually switched off. Even cheaper mouse, from Portronics, i- Bell switches off automatically if left unused , and starts automatically when booting. Keyboard might have the same defect, but I didn't check that out till now."
1,"Item was delivered on Delivered 31-Mar-2021, Return window closed on 07-Apr-2021. Worked great in two weeks, now keyboard is not responding when I press keys. I have to press it multiple time to get response. I can't even return this item, my money is wasted. This is really bad item, didn't expect this from brand like 'Lenovo'. I would recommend you to buy some other keyboard, even mouse performance is below satisfaction level. Buy it at your own risk."
3,"The quality of the product is really nice. The only issue with the product is that the keys have become hard to use and it becomes really annoying if you type fast. You have to keep going back to correct the words.Mouse is very smooth and doing a good job so far.Also, the keyboard is well covered while not in use.."
3,"Overall, the feel of the keyboard is nice. It is quite comfortable to use. However, I have a problem wherein I experience a lot of latency issue and lag when using the mouse. I have updated the firmware etc., but I still have this issue, and I don't know if it is just me or is there any real problem with the keyboard :( . Running of Win 10 - 64b."
1,"Edit: mouse scroll is not working now, reduced the rating to 1 starI have received this package just now and the packing was not of amazon standard. How could this be amazon fulfilled product ?Firstly the product seal was open and when I used the batteries which came along with the package, they were dead. Maybe they have opened the seal just to steal those batteries.The keyboard & mouse build quality is poor. I already have a lenovo n100 mouse and bought this combo expecting the same build quality, but the plastic looks cheap.Giving 3 stars for now, will update the review after using the keyboard and mouse for couple of days."
3,"I didn't like it.The membrane is very soft and keys are very mushy. There are lots of accidental key presses. Mouse is so tiny it hurts my handsMost importantly I tried to return and there was no return option the seller offered just replacement.It is a good combo for work, it's just I who didn't like it."

With no red light indicator you don‚Äôt know if the caps lock or num lock is on of off!! I have to type and find out if the lock is on or off. It‚Äôs irritating and frustrating. I even changed the battery that Lenovo had supplied but even that did not work!!!Obviously there is a hardware problem.Will Amazon and Lenovo help or am I stuck with this defective key pad, I wonder."
1,This is an utterly useless product. The mouse keeps skipping ahead making it impossible to keep your cursor pointed where you want it and then the keyboard. All keys in the keyboard have their own mood. When they are feeling good they will work else they won't. When A's mood is good M might not be in a mood to work. Then you have wait for M to start working. And god forbid if you need to use multiple keys like keyboard shortcuts. Just forget about them. These keys on the keyboard just don't love each other. Either they will work one at a time or nothing at all. No ctrl alt windows combination will ever work. May be the manufacturers should plan a outbound training on team building and teamwork before they put them on the keyboard. I am not even sure this is original Lenovo. Pay a little more and get a better product.
4,"Logitech makes great products, be it mice or speakers (and everything in between) and this K480 keyboard is no exception. Here's my review ~1. Looks wise this is pleasing. Black and lemon yellow combo is stunning. (10/10)2. Not much heavy and should be easy to carry around in your regular laptop bags. (8/10)3. Bluetooth pairing is as easy as it gets. (9.5/10)4. Very easy to type, button placement is good as compared to others. However, bear in mind the switches are NOT backlit and they make a little noise while typing, although not as much as some youtubers might make you think. (8/10)I use my iPad 2018 and my android mobile side by side with ease. So, this should be a good addition to your gadget list. Hope this helps."
3,"Update:- it weigh too much, I understand it is done to balance the device while holding but still its too heavy (850g). Was looking to return but unfortunately that is not available for this product. Reducing my review by 2 stars :(Was looking for a keyboard for my IPAD since long, my wish is to get something which i can carry while travelling and hence looking for ones coming as case but because of higer price point, i ended my search on K480.Great delivery experience by Amazon agent, booked yesterday night and got delivery today at 03:00 pm.Wrinting this review with the key board which explain easy to connect and use, within 1-2 minutes of opening the packet, i am ready to type.Looks is also strong so i think it will last longer.Will comeback later with detailed review however at the moment i can say at this price point this device will complete your requirement of not using laptop :)"
4,"It‚Äôs a nice keyboard to have specifically if you have an ipad. If you want to buy the keyboard for writing long emails or you really want to work really fast this one isn‚Äôt for you. You really have to press the key significantly to type effectively.  When I work fast I tend to lose few alphabets due to not pressing key significantly.  Typing experience is not very smooth, sound of typing might disturb people around you. Built quality looks fine, it connects easily.FYI- my friend really like this and had no problem whatsoever while typing at any speed, he said he likes it the way it is. He said he didn‚Äôt accidentally typed any extra alphabet when he used it unlike other keyboards that types with the feather touch,If you‚Äôre like my friend you really should go for it."
5,"The keyboard is simply great. Does everything that as advertised. The product quality is excellent and could not have been better. I have connected it to three devices including an android phone, linux labtop and a ipad and worked seamlessly on all three devices. I mainly bought it to work as a keyboard with my Ipad in case I needed to create documents on it and works great in that set up. However I was dissapointed by the  weight of the keyboard, it is quite heavy and not as portable as one might imagine. However , if you are not put off by the extra weight it can be used easily as an input keyboard for three devices at the same time. I was sceptical at first of the three devices claim, but after using it that has been put to rest as it switches seamlessly between the three devices. It works on batteries and bluetooth . I cannot fault the quality it is world class. IT is not very ergonomic as the keys are quite round and small if you have large hands, I can imagine that you would find this uncomfortable. It is not a keyboard that can be used for long and hefty typing sessions. The groove in the front can fit a Ipad and an 5.5 inch Android phone  vertically with ease. The only problem is that if you have a cover on your devices you need to take it out, as it will not fit in along with the cover. I am really impressed with the design of the keyboard as it really helps to type on portable devices such as Tablets and Phones.I have bought it recently and am yet to find out about the durability. At a hefty price tag of over 3k it is an investment that you need to think about especially the purpose. It is a good buy if you are a gadget crazy person like me who uses several gadgets and needs to communicate with all of them and do not mind the heavy weight of the keyboard. If you are looking for a ultra portable keyboard , that is ergonomic for hefty typing sessions and if you have extraordinary large hands, this is not ideal for you. I personally love it and am glad that I invested in this."
5,"UPDATE - connected this keyboard to my Moto G5 with the hope that I will minimise my wrist pain. Moto G5 running Android 7 detects this keyboard after a couple of refreshes. But typing with this keyboard in any app is a little weird. Some characters like ""y"" are repeated several scores of times. Same goes for the spacebar. There is a lag while the characters appear after you have typed fast at which point the keyboard becomes kind of un-responsive. I guess this must be specific to certain models or certain versions of Android or perhaps it is an app issue - I tried this on several chat apps, on social media websites using the mobile browser. So while I am not going to be using this with my cellphone (which is a shame really), I will still continue to use it with my MacBook. The rating still stands and my recommendation that this is a good buy still holds true.This is a brilliant product especially for the price point.The sound made is minimal, it reminds me of those electric typewriters my dad used thirty years ago, the same sound and feel. I think the sound is not nearly as bad as some reviews make it out to be. It is quite muffled. The keyboard is more like those desktop computer keyboards we are used to from ten years ago. That is about it. I cannot comment on the durability of the product since I have barely used for around 30 minutes. There is no backlight on this so that is a bit of a downer but there is another version that offers backlit keys but costs a bomb (relatively speaking). The keys are perfectly placed and I had no trouble blind-typing this review. The batteries are already installed and are prevented from discharging with an insulation tape (which needs to be removed - you just pull the end that sticks out from behind the battery panel)The packaging from the supplier was superb. Amazon's own packaging was brilliant too considering it is raining quite a bit in my neck-of-the-woods with decent plastic wrapping. Delivery was incredibly fast from time of dispatch to time of handover.At this time, I am toying with the idea of gifting one for my brother.If you are looking for a keyboard that relieves you of the tedium of stretching your back to use the laptop or desktop, you should clearly opt for this. I use a Mac and I had no trouble setting up the keyboard.As other reviews have pointed out, this is not as light as Apple's own keyboard but then that keyboard is at least five times the price of this product. This is only a blue-tooth keyboard and not necessarily a portable bluetooth keyboard.This is a recommended buy. I am glad I got this.EDIT 09.DEC.2018It has been a little over 4 months since I got this keyboard. I can tell you that this is one product I do not regret buying. In the interim I got myself an iPad Pro as well and this keyboard is what I use with the iPad. In addition, I also use it with my Windows 10 laptop and there has been no cause for complaint yet. The batteries are genuinely long lasting although I must on balance add that I have started using it intensively only in the past two months. The bluetooth connection to my Mac, Windows and iPad as well as my Android mobile phone is incredibly fast. The keyboard does not work very well with my Moto G5 since there is a lag and often the keys repeat themselves.This keyboard is quite heavy, tipping the scales at nearly a kilogram and that is a lot of weight if you intend to carry it  in your backpack while you board a flight or intend to travel light.Apart from these manageable issues, this is an excellent buy and is highly recommended."
5,"The product works as shown in the video description.-- Battery Life--Not sure regarding the same as it depends on your use there is nothing to do with the keyboard as external battery cells are used-- Durability --If you hold it from one side you may hear a voice of plastic friction noise as the keyboard is total made of plastic.However, the keys are very smooth and are made of good quality.--Easy to use ---Product is designed to perform multitask, which it does without any error, the typing feels good on this keyboard and the switching between devices takes around 1/2 second.---------The keyboard is good for programmers specially, mine was a used one in an opened box which i returned and ordered a new one.I don't know, why these sellers sometime give used products to their customers, knowing that they will return it and give negative reviews and feedback."
5,"After a few months of using , am giving the review.- using it for my iPad Pro- way better than apple's keyboard- u can connect to three device at a time and can toggle using the wheel- the keyboard is old school type, noisy, but it's compact and easy for typing flawlessly- compatible with android,ios,win,mac- switches are well placed- battery life is too good- white one looks too premium- u can keep ur ipad or mobile in the place given for itCons- it's heavier than other keyboards but that makes it stronger- noisy keys like old keyboards but I like the sound it keeps me awake all the time in night shiftsGo for it .. Money saver.. Good product and better better than any other bt keyboards"
5,"This device is absolute delight, haven‚Äôt given any case to think otherwise since I bought this on jan 19, i‚Äôe., after putting it through utterly rough and tough usage on gaming, photoshop, revit design and more than 20 days on typing thesis... hell im even typing this review on it!Pros:Durable bodyEasy pairingSeamless connection btw all three devices, just twist and switch!, even cross platform isn‚Äôt a big deal for this, working with win10, iOS 12 on iPhone and iPad all at same time, still bests my surprise!Keyboard is enough wide even adopts to my big handKeys are big and feels like stud, extra likes for that..Phone/ iPad  holder is awesome, angle of view point is well thought, can accommodate 1 iPhone and 1 iPad mini (docked mode) or iPad Air portrait mode and iPhone.For a rs 2000 keyboard this sure gives a posh feel.Lack of inbuilt li-ion battery is a winner for me, battery life depends on what battery you use, I‚Äôm still running on my first battery Duracell AAA.Cons:Heavy for its size and plastic built, need to loose some stuffs to compensate baggage allowance!.Lack of num pad is sick, but it‚Äôs not that big deal if you are used to small keyboardDoesn‚Äôt have elevate stand to raise the keyboard, it bothers me because I‚Äôm used to it.While on playing games sometimes the keys lags, while series of keys are pressed at a fast rate in a row it seems it puts some stress on connectivity, but this wasn‚Äôt the case with my onboard laptop keyboard on the same game.. need further study on this.Verdict: Overall this is an awesome keyboard that comes in handy in all occasions with some tolerance on playing games!, built in phone and tablet stand is a huge plus,"
5,Awesome keyboard.Purchased imeadietely after watching YouTube desktop tour from Prasad . I cannot comment onBattery life and durability not yet completed 1 month also.After 1 year of usage....ProsNice lookEase of shifting Bluetooth devicesShortcutsBonus:very helpfully for editing works(not of use for normal usage)Battery lasts 2-3 months for medium usage....Cons: looks beautiful but care should be taken for white colour....Go for black one if u can‚Äôt take that much care...No complaints till nowThis was truly value for moneyThis is genuine review.....
1,"This is a true martial artist's keyboard, and if you are not one, then you are far too weak to even consider this.The keys are designed specifically to help build fingers of steel, that can pierce through concrete after just a month of using it for daily work.Beware though, if you are not tough enough to withstand all the training that this piece of meticulously designed ""board"" has to offer, you will lose, and it will win, always! If you do master it though, the epitome of finger strength awaits you."
2,Recently purchased this Bluetooth keyboard. Haven't used it enough to review other aspects of the keyboard but my first impression was that it looks like a used keyboard.with Scratch marks on the backside of the keyboard and some to complement the front side too.. expected a fresh piece from the seller. Disappointed.
4,"The white variant of the K480 looks good.Connects seamlessly with multiple devices through bluetooth. Volume control is easy . The Fn button does not have to pressed for volume control. Range of keyboard is impressive. Keys are not silent , but make a pleasant clacking sound.Works well with a Windows 10 mini PC, an Android TV Box and an HDMI enabled Windows 10 Tab. No drops in connection.The groove is very well suited for holding tabs and  mobiles. It has a rubber lining for firmer grip.The keyboard weighs approximately 1 kg  to prevent tablets from tipping over when placed in the groove. The weight might be a drawback for some."
1,"First of all, many keys of this keyboard doesn‚Äôt work.  It‚Äôs really very heavy and I don‚Äôt like this at all. I got a defective keyboard  and then returned it and it got replaced by another defective keyboards whose many keys doesn‚Äôt work. I regret not buying the 600‚Çπ keyboard now that my 2000‚Çπ got wasted. I will probably never buy electronic goods from amazon. And when i tried to return the second defective keyboard it said they will take the keyboard but return me not a single rupee. So now what? Keep the defective keyboard"
1,This is for the first time i had a worse expereince shopping with amazon. After spending a sizable amount this is what you get - a torn package with a complete defective product. It does not connects to a pc or an android device because the connect button for the same does not works. When connected to an iOS device i found out that many keys dont work at all. Utterly disappointed with this level of service
3,"Glossy surface with abs plastic keys, surface is scratch magnet but keys are nice (visually) . Connectivity is also good. You can check for specs.I got it today only and it felt good, heavier but it has cradle to hold ipad or smartphone so it has to be on heavier side. No back-lit since it operates on AAA batteries.It was able to hold my phone in cradle but when it comes to ipad pro 11, it could hold it for 5 mins only. Because the ridge or cradle is curved from inside and ipad pro has flat Brick design, it couldn't stick. Slips and falls. What I did to make it work is just to apply some silicon glue through glue gun on it. It will not affect the plastic of keyboard. It helped increasing the angle of inclination and now the CM is right below the cradle. Hence, avoiding the slip and fall of ipad.I didn't return it because there are not many such products available and it really has nice response and swift keys. Now it is working just fine, thanks to glue gun. This keyboard will work with previous models of ipad and other tablets (without any guarantees since angle of inclination will remain same as in mine). But for ipad pro 11 (2018 & 2019) you have to apply some frugal engineering just like i did to hold the the product in cradle. Designers and engineers didn't work well to make it a stable product. It will hold smaller devices like 6 or 7 Inch pads or smartphones, 11 inch is a bit heavier for it but little ""Jugaad"" makes it possible.I'm happy with the response and quality given the price range but i would just rate it 3 since engineering hasn't been upto the mark.Now keyboard usability and workability: I think keys will not be able to hold harsh pressing and are not as tough as normal keyboards are, its a little sensitive in the sense of delicacy. Looks fragile on that front. I have uploaded the videos too. The quality of battery lid is fragile, I'm not sure of how long will it stay for but I will try not to push it too much since it can break easily.Why i bought it?I can connect ipad, mobile (definitely I'll not text using keyboard that much, i don't why i said mobile here!) and also TV. This is the. Only reason i bought it plus price. Else i would've love to go for apple official keyboard if it fails on ipad.This sums up my review. I know it is not technical review but i feel there is no need since you can always compare tech specs online any where. This is a layman user review from a professional product Designer who works on Ergonomics and usability of product.Thanks for taking time to read."
4,"- the keyboard is small and hence very comfortable for the wrists.- the holder is able to handle tablets up to 10 inches easily.- works with Android tablet, Android phone, iPhone, iPad, MacOS, Linux- I was worried about the round keys but they are no problem at all.## Cons- keypress feedback is really bad. When typing for a long time, I tend to miss some keys because they were not pressed completely.- the switch and indicator are at the bottom which can be tedious to operate. So many time, I forget to switch it off because of that.- the sticker at the top has bad glue. It should not be removed even though it looks ugly.- can feel slightly heavy sometimes. check the weight and get an estimate before buying"
4,"Bought it for my daughter who attends online classes using Tablet.There is no instruction booklet, but Logitech thinks a sticker affixed to the front panel is easy enough to guide through the process. However, pairing it had been tricky. When you search it in Tablet, it finds the keyboard and it asks to type the pairing key displayed. I was at first confused where to type, anyway this being a keyboard I typed it in the keypad and it didn't work first. Then repeated the whole pairing process, and you had to also press 'Enter' key.There is a battery compartment and a tiny power switch at the back panel. There is no mention of that switch anywhere.At the hindsight, it all looked a silly operation to pair, but if it doesn't pair you only end up guessing what next to do. A simple printed leaflet would go a long way.The keyboard is quite heavy like a brick, but there is a definitive reason I can find for it. If you place a 10 inch tablet into that slot, due to the weight of tablet it would have toppled over. But this one stays sturdy. So hardware design has been well thought.The sad part is today, when I look at the price of the black keyboard, it displays Rs. 500 less. I went for this white one because it was available sooner."
5,"The fact that this put off people because of the loud clacking sounds which uncannily mirrored a typewriter's is exactly the reason I absolutely love it. Not to mention the cradle that fits the tablet perfectly with just the right angle is a bonus. The dial to switch between the 3 devices is great.Just a few things though. The on switch is on the back which means that if you have already set your tablet up, you will have to take it off, turn the device and turn it on before replacing the tablet in the cradle. As I mentioned, the loud key sounds can put off people. It is also quite chunky and heavy, which it should be since it needs to keep the tablet from falling over.A perfect model for an old soul like me who misses the typewriter and yet wants something conventional and modern."
3,"This is suitable only to use with tablets where you may not do too much typing. Keys are too tall and hard to press. It is not good to be used with laptops where you may code, write docs or emails. I regret buying this. At the moment this keyboard only servers the purpose of a stand for my iPad.If you are looking for a wireless keyboard for your laptop/desktop, go for dell or hp. In case you need a wireless keyboard for your tablet/phone, there aren't much good options available online. I would recommend visiting an offline store to experience the keyboard and buy or check with anyone who knows about a good wireless keyboard with soft keys"
3,"If you are a developer or hard gamer, think twice before buying this keyboard.There is no page up and page down button in keyboard.By default F1 to F12 are function keys. When you press alt + f4, it will not close your current window. If you want to have that setting, you need to install Logitech options software separately.The connectivity is good buy when you try to fast type then it misses some of the characters. You need to press each key precisely in order to get it typed.The key sound is ok but it sometime annoys since you type in your rhythm and later you find character is missing.It has more weight so can not be handy.There is mobile/tablet holder but if your mobile has some thick cover, then it will be hard to place it on inbuilt holder."
5,"Second day with the product. Can review as belowPROS -1. Sturdy keys. Gives the feeling of old desktop keyboards. Can work very fast, especially when my usual typing skills are very poor.2. Can connect to iPad, Dell PC, Apple MacBook Air or iPhone (any three) at one time simultaneously, choosing through the dial to work with the preferred one through the keyboard.3. Very stable and ergonomic. I could work for hours on a stretch albeit with small breaks in between, while working on my thesis, and didn't feel soreness of fingers.4. A superb value for money (as titled too) .... great possession at this price indeedI am writing this review when I have extensively used other Logitech keyboards, Apple keyboard, HP and other integrated ones from almost all brands int he past two decades.CONS -1. Only CONS I can find is that no keyboard skin or cover is available at Amazon or other platforms and with a 7 yo kid at home, there is always a fear of water spillage etc. as in past.2. Some would review it as 'too heavy' but my request is to patiently use this one for few days, for continuous typing of 30m or so, and you shall certainly fall in love with this one, especially if your typing skills are like mine - poor to average.Planning to buy one more of this for my daughter to use with her iMAC 4K, for 3 to 4 hours long online classes in current COVID times as she is somehow not comfortable (strangely though) with her Apple magic keyboard.Shall again review/update after a month or so of use ....."
5,Today I have received this. By product quality I will rate 5/5. It is awesome to use and seems to be worth full to my money. It just converted to my apple tab 9.7‚Äù tab to a mini computer.I don‚Äôt know how will be battery usage and other technicality till now. I will describe on those things later on. But it seems very nice.I rarely give 5/5 to any product and this I gave.
1,"Its a nice product. But, the piece delivered to me was not the same. It makes crackling sound on just picking it up. I thought it would be due to the heavy weight. But after few days I removed the instruction sticker to find out dents and scratches. A damaged piece was deliverd to me.Highly dissapointed, will have to think 10 times before shopping from amazon again!!!!!!!!!!I want a replacement."
1,Broken used peice received orderd replacement.Hope amazon replaces. It had 2 order stickers on it it was still on when received. Its broken and it was repaced with tape original tape was open and had marks. It was in 2 peice a bug dent and all locks broken. Extreamly poor quality control before despatch. Product is very very heavy not portable at all buy only if u want to keep at desk not for travel. Not used it as broken unit received. Will update if repalcement is received.I did receive the replacement the typing experience is not good the keys feel mushy. Total wastage of money
1,"A defective opened keyboard was shipped by Appario Retail Private Ltd. When i connected the keyboard many keys were not working. I cant imagine a logitech keyboard to be defective on opening, so i suspect a returned/refurbished product was shipped to me. I have asked for a replacement, lets see if it works.., but this is not a great experience for me."
5,"I purchased this keyboard to type on my iPad and I‚Äôm simply blown away. The keys provide good amount of tactile feedback so you feel like typing rather than skimming like in other flat bluetooth keyboards. Battery life has been pretty good so far, yet to change batteries. The device switching works instantly with iOS, Android and Windows flawlessly. The shortcut keys work in all three OS as well. You have to pair this only once and forget the hassle of reconnecting every time. Only con is the weight but it‚Äôs required to balance the heavy iPads when you place it in the notch."
2,"Good keyboard if you have multiple devices. I need to keep switching laptops, an iPad, and a desktop. Pairs on the first attempt, no complaints. Some points to consider before buying this.- The keys are noisy. I like it, some may hate it. Creeps into your telephone conversations/meetings.- Function keys are swapped, I am not sure how to put them back. F1 to F12 have defaulted to shortcuts I don't need them. I require the one used by Windows. Now I am forced to use the mouse.- Home and End buttons are missing. if you are dependent on those, this keyboard won't help, you need to compensate with other methods.- Alt-Tab between windows/tasks is hard to operate.Edit: After months of usage.- The keys are harder to press, it gets stressful to type emails, documents, etc This keyboard is simply not suited for long hours of typing. It is best suited for short bursts.- Looks nice only on youtube videos.- Alt-Tabbing between windows is dead, you need to have fingers made of lead to press it.- Causes rage, you'll end up occasionally smashing it due to lag while typing or playing some basic games.- as its too late to return this keyboard, I ended up repurposing this to less intensive tasks."
2,"I had brought this keyboard almost 3 years back. And this is what I think:This keyboard is bad. Aesthetically the keyboard is pleasing for sure. Ergonomically, it's alright. But the basic keyboard design is the only thing that is not what it should be.Keyboard Design: The keys are very noisy and has no feedback. You won't even know if you have clicked the button but your fellow roommate will hear you typing. Keys do not press evenly. Some need more pressure. In Windows, the Alt and Windows key for some reason shared the function weekly. For 3 days Alt becomes Windows key and vise versa. Yes, you got it right. That happened. I tried claiming the warranty but that was hard. I don't have Logitech service center around here. They told me that is the only way the warranty can be claimed.It has good things: Good bluetooth connectivity, longer battery life, it lasted more than a year. Seemless device switching. But it doesn't matter to me when the basic keyboard functionality is garbage.Don't get me wrong though. Logitech stand-alone is a great company. I have used their products and my friends have. I'm giving a second chance to Logitech in keyboards and I have bought another model. MK275.In nutshell. I do not recommend this keyboard."
5,"This is not a toy, unlike other brands that look cool but don‚Äôt hold up to prolonged use. Very little fatigue on the hands from extended use. The heavy base is needed to ensure the iPad doesn‚Äôt tip over even when improperly seated. My only complaint is that I often forget to power off the unit after use since the switch is hidden on the other side. The automatic Bluetooth power saver does help but I think an improved power off design could be researched for the next generation.I don‚Äôt need my laptop nearly as much."
1,"We are a software company and we wanted to purchase a great keyboard for our programmers and in that direction we purchased this product considering Logitech's reputation and brandPros:1) Compact, handy, nice layout2) Multi device switching with a simple roller switch is a nice feature.Cons:1) Worst keyboard keys, they are heavier, sticky and your fingers ache after prolonged usage.2) We received a brand new packed product but the device switching roller is not working properly. This ideally confirms the quality of testing Logitech has in place for their products.3) You will definitely miss Home , End key in the keyboard while editing documents or during programming.Those who spend more time at typing, this product is definitely not recommended. In-fact stay away from Logitech when it comes to keyboards, specially if you are looking for buying a ""great"" keyboards."
5,"I purchased the white coloured one. The keyboard pairs instantly with windows and Macbooks, I haven't yet tried pairing with Android tab yet. The Built is quite sturdy and the finish of the product is nice. As to the quality of keys, the slight concave depression in the keys help in typing and the keypad is well spaced out.Typing fast will take some getting used to but I am already able to type without looking at the keyboard. Very easy to connect and if you are looking for a multi devise keyboard for your workstation then this is the best. I paired this with a white logitech pebble series mouse and both work excellently in tandem. Would definitely recommend this. However note that this is not a portable keyboard and if you need something on the go you need to choose the other logitech model. The recess well built into the keyboard can easily support the one plue 7 pro and Samsung S6 Lite tab"
1,"8-10 of Its keys stopped working within barely 3-4 days of usage in my 2 months of ownership due to someHardware failure.The mail response was a parroted one which asks to follow 5 step software troubleshoots for a hardware issue and once you‚Äôve done that and expectedly fail to resolve they‚Äôll tell you to walk in with the keyboard to one of the 7-8 pan India service Centers they have !They don‚Äôt have a pickup service, they will not allow to courier you.. and to top it all you won‚Äôt get response on twitter,fb,email and even the customer care number mentioned on their website is switched off all the time.When I checked the 1 Star reviews most others have reported the same problem which makes me wonder if this is a faulty lot which is being sold online to make sure people buying from small cities have not choice but to keep this without getting refunded.Was expecting peace of mind while buying this expensive hardware and got the opposite. This one‚Äôs going down the dustbin but I‚Äôll definitely pursue these guys with the aid of consumer protection helpline.Avoid as its costly went dead for no reason and after sales service is non existent."
3,"Have been using the Logitech K480 multidevice key board for the past couple of weeks. Here are my observations. There are some fundamental limitations with this keyboard but Logitech has priced the model which addresses these limitations way above‚Ä¶ the Logitech MK850 Multi-Device Wireless Keyboard is three times more expensive and that price is a serious turn off! Anyways here is review of the K480.Pros:‚Ä¢ It is an excellent ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù key board for multi device input. Basic being the operative/key word here.‚Ä¢ Seamlessly links with even legacy laptops with older versions of Bluetooth.‚Ä¢ The keys are tactile and though the rounded edges take a bit of time getting used to, they do a great job.‚Ä¢ There is no lag whatsoever between keystroke and onscreen response.‚Ä¢ Battery lasts if the user remembers to turn off the power button under the keyboard, and of course depends on the number of devices connected simultaneously.  The more the devices the faster the drain.‚Ä¢ Sturdy, heavy and does not slip or move when typing fast or for sudden wrist adjustments.‚Ä¢ Mobile device holder at the top is a good thought and is helpfulCons:‚Ä¢ Seriously, seriously, very seriously miss the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnd‚Äù keys.‚Ä¢ The dual command and opt keys on both sides of the space bar could have been optimized for other functions part of a standard keyboard layout.‚Ä¢ The  F6, F7 and F8 function keys could have much better uses rather than music player and the F12 and lock keyboard buttons could be configured to ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnd‚ÄùSummary:This is not a writer‚Äôs keyboard. it is for short quick use across devices. Definitely not recommend if you are planning to use it professionally. Save up your money and invest in the MK850 ‚Äì as can be seen from the number of reviews, the device is way too expensive for a normal user. Still if you are looking to use a single keyboard and you do have multiple devices that you have to use professionally, go ahead and invest In the higher version.Would recommend if you are tired of typing with your thumbs on your phone/tab. And need something to handle your multiple devices when they are docked."
1,"I haven't seen more idiotic product. The trouble with blootooth connectivity is its range and speed and also when your laptop/PC booting up you cannot use your keyboard because, well, its bluetooth. So you need to enter your passwords using laptops keyboard. Moreover even if your device has booted up the connection is not guaranteed. Its really painful to get it connected for the first time after the device boots up. This is unlike the seamless connectivity of wireless adapter based peripherals. Supporting multiple OS and multiple devices simultaneously has dented its usability by making the connection process complicated. It is way easier to connect my bluetooth speaker to the laptop than this piece of cr@p.  To add salt to the injury despite being inferior device both in terms of technology and ease of use, it is priced higher than regular wireless keyboard and mice."
5,Best Multi device quick connect Bluetooth Keyboard. Uses Alkaline batteries so no of charging.No backlighting would have been better for night time situation.Can keep smartphones and Tabs but if kept in portrait we can't connect usb cables to devices to charge.The long hollow rubberized slot to keps devices is gerat but it hides the navigating buttons of the smartphones mainly as few lower portion of devices get hidden and the blutooth devices can't help in full navigating of  smartphones.
5,"Probably the best bluetooth (separate) keyboard for tablets, phones etc.Pro's -1. Very Easy and Quick to configure and Pair (Easy to follow instructions are pasted on the top part of the keyboard so dont even need any manual)2. Can pair 3 devices at any time.3. Sturdy and good build quality.4. Slot on top of the keyboard to keep the phone or Tab in while typing.5. Duracell AAA battery included.6. Relatively compact dimensions.7. Device keyboard doesnt pop-up and thus you get to type while viewing the whole screen, unlike the partially covered screen when the device keyboard pop's-up. I use it for my 8 inch Tab and my phone (both Android). The best part is when you place your Tab in Landscape mode in the slot given on the keyboard it almost feels like you're using a small laptop.Con's -To be honest I couldn't find any specific problems, but if I had name a few then -1. Keyboard not backlit. (With this feature, it would have definitely been just perfect).2. I agree with other reviewer's that the weight is more than any other keyboard but that's mostly to do with balancing it when you place the tab or phone in the slot.I checked for better reference for others, the slot on the top can accommodate a Tab in landscape mode with the longer side measuring upto 10.5 inches.I almost bought a new laptop but kept going back to reading more about this keyboard and finally I'm so glad I bought this instead. Got it for a great price during an offer too."
3,Very costly. Quality is very good üëç.Also very heavy although the size is smaller. Has 3 device support for bluetooth. Don't buy if you are a gamer. Weight of it reduces the chance of portability. I bought it before 5 months but used only 2 times now. Overall an average keyboard. If you want it in a single place without traveling it will be great for you. The Bluetooth reduces the tension of loosing the wireless keyboard receiver. Buy if you really need it .
4,"Works fine. Connecting sometimes becomes an issue, but manageable.Great that it was switch between 3 devices.Keys aren't great, just normal.Compact. Works well if you don't wanna use up a lot of space.Cons:No Home / End / Pg Up / Pg Dn keys. Have to learn the keystrokes for each.It's heavy. Quite heavy. Not the kind you wanna carry in your backpack.Expensive, for the experience.Occupies the sole Bluetooth connection. You can't connect a Bluetooth speaker or a mouse to your laptop, tab or phone if they keyboard is connected."
1,"When I first received this keyboard, I was impressed with its look and ergonomic design. It is heavy but that is needed to offset the weight of your tablet/iPad when you dock it inclined. However, the first thing I didnt like was that the feel of the keys was tacky.. so it might look great but feels like a CHEAP keyboard, even worse than the tackiest, cheapo keypads you'll ever find sold along the roadsides. But most importantly, after just 2 weeks or so, some of the keys stopped working, not sure if it's due to the cheap quality of the keyboard membrane inside.. and by the end of the month, two whole rows of keys stopped working altogether! So beware.. for SUCH a price, this keyboard is NOT worth it, especially if it barely lasts a month!!"
4,"It is a very good build! Works perfect with all devices. It is very easy to use. Thanks a lot Logitech. Also, i expected to be somewhat smaller but it is perfect size and it really worked for me, it is as good as normal keyboard with more portability!"
5,"Best for beginnersPros:-Good pressure sensitivityLight weight penPen glides over tab surface but u won't get a pen on paper feelAndorid support &  no extra software neededPen stand with 8 extra nibsShortcut keysEasy to install driversConsNo Bluetooth supportNote :-For samsung users the cursor won't display in most phones,  in such case u can download huion sketch app which has cursor optionPlz don't go for xp pen deco its not good at allIf u want a much better experience with touch support then go for wacom Intuos pro models but it's price is high"
5,"I have intuos small, xp pen deco pro and an I pad air.  I use graphic tablet generally for animation and photoshop and sometimes on my Android smartphone.Build quality :Huion has overall good build quality it's not upto wacom standard but it's good it's certainly quite thin and stylish.Writting experience : Writting experience was great it wad better than my Wacom intuos small or xp pen. It was neither super smooth nor super rough it was just perfect.Comparison with wacom in similar price segment: At similar price segment Wacom has few products to compete, but still huion drawing impression was quite great overall it was a bit better than intuos. The only thing it's lacking is a universal driver like wacom.Comparison with XP Pen Deco series: Deco series is great not gonna lie but still for the similar price range I found huion to be great it has better surface feel, better drawing experience less wabble, almost no smoothing effect and more frequent driver updates.Short and simple answer :1) If you're a beginner or intermediate and are in learning stage than this is the perfect choice.2) If you're an advanced person using different pens and tablets at different times amd are making money from your work you might go for Wacom.3) If you're willing to buy an XP Pen then I would suggest not to because specially in country like India Huion providing the best drawing experience at minimal cost also Huion has only a few models in this prive range and they're genuinely getting frequent updates, unlike XP Pen that have thousands of models on same peice range and even a bit overpriced but still not giving frequent updates and bug fixes.So if you wanna start out this is the way to go."
4,"Huion tablet has an overall good build quality and is an excellent experience. The tablet is well designed and easy to use. I bought the coral red variant of the HS611 tablet. It's certainly stylish.It's best for beginners. Certainly a worthy purchase for under $100 ""best pen tablets"".Pros:Good pressure sensitivityLightweight and battery-free StylusThe pen glides over tab surfacePen stand with 8 extra nibsShortcut keys can be set according to one's own convenienceDot grid working area is supportiveEasy to install driversMultimedia and press keys are functional and effectiveUSB-C Data Socket is an advantage for Android usersHuion sketch app available for free download on phone to get you started"
5,"Does exactly what you intend to do. The drawing surface is proportionately mapped to the screen, where ever you take the pen it proportionately and aptly travels with it. There is a very very minor lag which is only noticable when you intend to find it, it may be a 100 or 200 millisecond. Which is completely normal and acceptable."
5,"Pros :-Good quality, Light weight, easy to use, nice packagingCons :-Less number or pressing keys than other models, which is not a problem for me but might be of use to someone.The the driver is okayish, not great."
4,I have been using huion pen tablet for past 5 years. i buyed new model because its pen is battery free and tablet is slim and has buttons for some fixed and customizable functions. Pen quality too improved a lot along with its holder.
5,"Easy to use, key binding is a bit edgy: unable to rewrite the bindings with necessary likes of key bonds; otherwise it's amazing..."
5,"Its very easy to setup just install driver, connect and work. It will take a while for you to adjust with the pad surface and pen after that you will love the outcome it is giving. It is definetly a right investment to boost my editing skills. i recommend this product"

5,buiild qualityu is really great and i perosnally loved the touch bar and the shortcut buttons can be easily customisable using the huion software.
1,I have ordered this product multiple times from different accounts. The description says 10 piece. but they deliver only 1 piece. Asking for refund is a painful process. I am forced to purchase different brands even tho amazon basics is the best. sad.
1,Amazon basic keyboard ordered was pack of 10.  It is mentioned in description but they delivered only one.
1,They expect you to pay >7000 INR for 1 basic keyboard mouse.So be prepared .Ask for these to be sold separately not as a 10 packDo not buy a 10 pack unless you want to be surprised and shocked at the same time.
1,Someone should be nuts or stinking rich to pay 8K INR for a otherwise less than 1K keyboard... and I dont see it laced with Gold.. LOL .. Comments say it it said to be for a 10-Pack.. but I dont see it mentioned as 10-pack. So it is basically 1-keyboard & mouse.
1,But cost they have changed before it's around 600 rupees only. But now dramatic change. It's true or any mistakes done by Amazon working people. They need to check
5,One of the good keyboard I have ever seen. Fantastic keyboard please buy it. Amazon is good product output company.
1,The keyboard is no doubt excellent with quality and usage but I had a very bad experience when I had ordered for a set of 10 keyboards and they sent only 1 single quantity. I had to go from a very painful process of self return as they didn't pickup service and I had to pay ‚Çπ250 from my pocket for return shipment.
5,"EVERYTHING SUPERB. BUT DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SALE 10 PIS, MUST SALE ONE PICS. AMAZON.THANK YOU. MUST BUY THIS ONE."
4,"Though not a gamer, I type a lot. I had a mechanical keyboard and because it was showing double-key entry problem so frequently in multiple keys, and cleaning didn't help, I decided to go for a new keyboard. However, a decent TKL mechanical keyboard in my budget wasn't available for purchase and hence decided to go with this mechanical-like membrane keyboard for the time being.The raised switches give it a look of a mechanical keyboard. However, the typing experience is not comparable to a mechanical keyboard. It does feel better than the usual membrane keyboard though. It does make some noise while typing, and it is not that pleasant like typing in a mechanical keyboard. So, if you want a silent keyboard, this is not the one for you. It does come with basic backlighting. RGB colors are available but without many options. Three brightness levels are there, and a dedicated key to toggle light state. Windows key lock function is also there. Though the product description says, 'Dedicated Software Application' is available, I couldn't find one in the Amkette website.Coming to the typing experience, the keys are comfortable and spacing is adequate. I could achieve an average typing speed of 54 WPM with 100% accuracy. It is reasonably good. The build quality is also good for a keyboard at this price, and it seems a well-built product to last. The braided cable (which is not detachable from the keyboard) is good, and the length is adequate.The rubber padding in the bottom is not good enough (and is not available for the top legs), and hence the keyboard tend to move around at times, especially with the top legs extended.The right arrow key in my keyboard wasn't working properly. It needed extra force, like press it down really hard, to get the key register. Anyways, I pulled the keycap and added a small piece of double side tape and it solved the problem. Though I contacted the seller, they replied to contact via WhatsApp and all. Since I could make it work, I didn't bother. It is too much hassle to return and get a new keyboard, and I needed the keyboard badly. Hopefully, it will last."
4,"Prior to buying, I have been using the Logitech G102 Prodigy Wired Mouse for my desktop uses, which costs about the same as this mouse. Therefore I can make some direct comparison between the two mice.Looks wise :- The mouse looks pretty great. I would argue, probably even better than my Logitech mouse. Although the mouse have only 4 LED options, for a budget mouse, I think it is fair. It doesn't get as bright as my Logitech mouse, which for me, I consider as a good thing, because while I am using the mouse in a dark room, I need just enough light to discern where the mouse is and not distract me (something that frequently happens with my Logitech mouse). It is a bit bigger than my Logitech G102 mouse. I don't mind it since they are still within the comfort range of my hands, but I can see how someone may not feel the same way about the size. The wire is braided and the braiding used is of fairly good quality. The USB plug is well built and very sturdy.Software and warranty :- As of writing this review, Amkette has not yet put up the software drivers for this mouse for programming the macros buttons, even though on their product box, it was mentioned that you can find them on their website links. One cannot not even register the mouse for warranty since they have not included the mouse as part of their product line up. I would urge Amkette to rectify this problem quickly. Such actions should have been completed long before shipping the product to the customer.Functionality :- Regarding the ""7 Programmable macro buttons"" as advertised, as mentioned above, without the software drivers from Amkette, the buttons cannot be programmed other than their already assigned functions.Left click, right click, forward and back works well enough. The scroll wheel feels a bit less sensitive in scrolling, almost as if a lag was programmed while scrolling. I am assuming the 2 center buttons are for increasing or decreasing DPI sensitivity, although I have not felt any change in the DPI.::::::::: Update after 15 days of use ::::::::::1. A day after posting my original review,  Software Drivers for the mouse were available for download. I checked whether the mouse can be registered for warranty. Sadly it wasn't.2. A week after posting my review, I was able to register the mouse for warranty as it was listed as their product line-up.3. Minor issue found after regular usage : Everytime I booted the PC / laptop, the mouse seemed to be defaulting to its 1st DPI level. Since I don't regularly change the DPI levels, usually I set the mouse on a comfortable DPI level and re-program the DPI button to do something else depending on the type of work I am doing. But once I am switching off my PC / laptop, the DPI level I have set is defaulting back to DPI Level 1. I have circumvented this by changing the DPI Level 1 to the DPI level I feel comfortable in the software driver itself. I realized later on, that this mouse does not have on-board memory like my Logitech mouse and therefore is reliable on driver setting for its default values."
5,Got it today itself..First impression: Got a very premium look.Nice quality RGB lightning and effect.Elevated keys.Braded cable and magnetic ring.
1,"Was disappointed by this product.1- Packaging was open inside box - there was no seal on box.2- Didn't like the quality of keyboard.3- The USB didn't work on any of the points in laptop.4- Tried contacting support team of Amkette, they were fast with their replies but easily gave up and didn't provide proper support.So I returned the keyboard and got from another company which was much better and worked smoothly plus got a high quality mouse along with keyboard.I would not recommend anyone to buy this Amkette keyboard. The quality testing team is not doing a good job."
5,"I received the item with a surprise gift from the seller which is a gaming mouse by the same brand. About the keyboard, I really can‚Äôt comment as this is my first mechanical keyboard, as I have been using controllers for a long while. I didn‚Äôt find anything to complain about. Other tenkeyless mechanical keyboards are way to expensive. It works with my PS4 for COD Warzone and Fortnite. Also with my laptop. Mouse is decent too. Thanks."
3,I've used it for close to a week. Please be careful while buying.Positives-Cheap in cost for a TKL(Ten key Less) Keyboard.Looks are decent and is a membrane KeyboardNegatives -1) The back lighting is not bright and not at all sufficient in dark.2) The key caps get flimsy and wobbles a lot. Specially the space-bar and other keys produce screechy noise during typing.3. Cable not long enough4. Height adjustment kickstand is not sufficient considering the height of the keys.5. RGB is fixed and only 3 functions on/off. breathing and brightness control.6. Not good for typing. I rather use by INR 600 Dell keyboard for fast typing.
1,Sensor straight up stopped working after 2 weeks of usage. The customer service number keeps you waiting while they connect you to a representative which never happens. no reply to e-mails and also 2 weeks is outside the return window. there goes money down the drain.this is the worst mouse I've used in over 15 years of gaming. it's better to spend a bit more to buy reliable mouse than this utter garbage piece of crap!
5,"1 week into using the keyboard. Bought for 999/-  key things i would like to point:‚Ä¢ not mechanical type but membrane. But a good feel to operate. Responsive keys. Nice touch and feel. Its all plastic but good quality. Will not be a setback at all.‚Ä¢ compact size. No numpad kind of like laptop keyboard so i suppose most the people should be ok with it, also bcz of this takes less space.‚Ä¢ nice sturdy usb connecting cable. Durable.‚Ä¢ keyboard lighting can be switched on and off. 3 levels of brightness. Colour combo only 1 type that is multi coloured. Lighting is good enough to figure out keys in the dark.‚Ä¢ top elevation supports provided at the back for apt angle.‚Ä¢ timely Amazon delivery and good packing overall.I have bought this keyboard to be used for gaming (as of now atleast). It has anti ghosting. I feel there is decent spacing between keys that is apt for gaming. Even while typing to search content on YouTube,etc it felt buttery smooth and super responsive.  I have connected this to my xbox one console and it works great. Playing warzone with it. I do feel that 999/- is a price little high, probably around 700 or 750 this would sell like hot cakes but then again if this product lasts long then its totally worth bcz inspite of being plastic quality is great. Overall i am happy with my purchase.My suggestion: under 1000 rupees this is a very good all purpose keyboard. Even if you are into gaming, casual or hardcore you can go for this keyboard no issues. Unless you fancy lighting which frankly speaking is just a visual aspect, i mean when you actually use a keyboard you don't look at it specially when gaming. Just my opinion."
1,"This keyboard literally sucks. When i press the combination of 2 and Shift inorder to get @ symbol it shows is quotes, and, vice versa in the case of shift and quotes combination. The brightness is OK but, the repeated clattering sounds produced by the keyboard is so loud that it is enough to wake up my neighbours. I actually bought this keyboard for a better gaming experience but, what i received was a trash coverd with RGB led lights and here i thought that my previous 10yr old keyboard was a joke. It took me a month to notice this malware btw the combinations of the keyboard so, i am requesting you guys to take this trash and replace it with another one, Regards."
4,"Delivery and PackagingI received the keyboard in a pretty limited packaging. It did not come with any cushioning to protect the product either. Moreover the product package had no seal of any sort which made it difficult to determine whether the product is a brand new one or a refurbished one.Typing ExperienceThe typing experience on the keyboard feels quite decent for the price that I got it for (899/-), and provides a decent feedback while typing. Admittedly, I haven't typed on mechanical keyboards before, but I guess this is as close as it gets to it at this price range. It feels like a marked improvement over the keyboard on my laptop which says a lot because my laptop has one of the best laptop keyboards in the market (Thinkpad keyboard). The back-light on the keyboard has three brightness levels and can have three effects (which is honestly useless to me). The colors of the backlight cannot be changed and only the breathing effects can be changed. So please keep that in mind. The backlight can be turned off if necessary, but the caveat is that the texts/numbers on the keys are hardly visible when the backlight is off. I'd have liked to have one color all over the keyboard rather than a gradient of colors, but that is kind of a personal preference. Something to keep in mind, and probably not a big deal for more experienced individuals. The keyboard wasn't difficult to get used to since it's compact and my fingers fall perfectly on the keys. The keys are spaced out quite well. It includes a couple of foldable stands underneath the keyboard that angles it for a better typing experience.Build QualityThe build of the keyboard leaves a lot to be desired. It does not seem durable. I'd be surprised if it lasts me for over a year. One of the screws on the keyboard was already loose and I had to manually screw it back in. A couple of the keys have their keycaps looser than the others. The quality checks on these keyboards don't seem to be too stringent.ConclusionThe price is where the keyboard is forgiven for most of the aforementioned shortcomings. Compared to most keyboards in the price range, it is one of the best and serves it purpose well. I'd recommend it as of the time of writing of the review."
5,Really steardy. Colors is goodNo individual lighting.The wire quality is superb.Dont know if it is relaible or notThe key strokes are goood for a membrane mechanical keyboardIts around 15inches length wise.
5,"I have bought a new laptop and started feeling that the in-built keyboard might start to malfunction if I use too much (majorly because of gaming and typing keystrokes). I shortlisted two keyboards for my needs.1. HP K500 Gaming Keyboard (which was priced a bit more above than Rs. 1000, but was quite affordable);2. The Amkette EvoFox FireBlade Gaming Keyboard.I decided to go with the Amkette EvoFox FireBlade as I had bad experiences with HP products in the past (I have a 2nd laptop which is from HP and has keyboard and GPU issues; I got a HP mice and it died within 6 months of usage; and then there are more HP products I've used in the past which had given me pain).I got this keyboard and have been using it for quite a while now, and it is excellent for me at the price I got it for. The keyboard would be an excellent choice for people of both the worlds i.e., for someone who needs it for typing or for someone who needs a gaming keyboard to get started with in the gaming world. For a gaming mice to begin with, you can go for the Logitech G102 Light Sync. Back to the keyboard - The keys are really sturdy. The USB port is very well built. The braided cable (alongwith a magnetic ring) is fantastic too. The keys give an excellent tactile feedback while typing and gaming (as I type and game a lot). It is a TKL keyboard which results in a compact form-factor. You can bring up and down the brightness of backlighting of the keyboard with the Fn + Page Up or Page Down keys. There are shortcuts for multimedia (which is the least used feature for me).I assume it would survive a nuclear disaster or a zombie apocalypse someday (LOL, the keyboard is really good, to be honest). I remember, I accidentally poured a full glass of water and it survived and still works as brand new (LOL, seriously).What could've been a bit better:1. The backlighting. Don't get me wrong, backlighting is bright enough and lights up every key (but don't expect LEDs under each key) but the keyboard has only one mode of backlighting (breathing mode) which is kinda boring and might feel a bit cheap. And then, the right arrow key's backlighting is a bit lower than all the keys' but I am fine with it because of the pricing of the keyboard.2. Now, I would be really nitpicking here considering the price is really cheap but, the keycap of the spacebar is removable and scares me a lot, i.e., I fear it would come off some day if I stress it too much by typing or doing gaming (but thankfully and luckily, still hasn't come off. LOL)Overall feeedback :For someone who is looking to buy a gaming keyboard under Rs. 1000, this is certainly a better buy.  The performance and features it offers surpasses over the things that are needed to be improved. For me, it is a 4.5-star rated keyboard out of 5-stars (0.5 star deducted for the improvements this product needs)."
1,"Let me tell you all the consFirstly if you are a mechanical keyboard user like meYou should not even look at this product as this product is membrane (feeling of going from a mechanical keyboard to membrane keyboard is noticable)Chances are you will feel like it's hard to press single keyI might say single keystroke requires 90+-5 grams of force to pressThey say it has anti gosting keys(let me tell you the buyers of this product)anti gosting works trash as I said 90+ grams of force to press (keys take time to register)Your hands will pain like hell if you are not used to such cheap keyboardI myself use zebronics max pro mechanical keyboard I switched because my w key brokeIF YOU ARE A GAMER DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT AT ALL""LONG SESSION OF GAMING MAY INJURE YOU"" I got the product (RETURN AND REFUNDED)"
4,Bought this 6months ago and writting honest reviewPros 1.Best membrane keyboard which has a bit mechanical feel. using this for 6months and its awsome for games and typing 2.Rgb has 2 modes and its sick in this price range(899) 3.Awsome design and compact there is no TKL keyboard in the market at this price range really boosts your setup look.Cons 1.Spacebar feels dumb but i get used to it and its fine now 2.I got a problem that this keyboard jams and pauses mid game when rgb is turned on think its a defect only for me but its  fine i turn it off during some games(problem may be in my usb port not being able to give power for rgb lighting) 3.To make rgb feel nice they used some transparent like color for printing letters which lightly makes it glare if you use it without rgb (with rgb it feels good) 4.Keys are nice to press until now (nearly 7 months) but i guess it may wear over (semi mechanical feel)Nice buy you can buy this if you fixed your budget under 1k otherwise go for cb mechanical @ 2.5k overall satisfied with this product.(Mark usefull if you found it usefull)
3,"This is a membrane keyboard and not a mechanical keyboard. This showed up in the search while I was looking for a mechanical one, so I fell for it. Really like how the keyboard is designed for rugged use, and certainly has a blue print of a mechanical keyboard.CONS - please dont expect the clicky sounds like the real mechanical ones. Any of the key in a real mechanical keyboard when gently pressed gives a clicky sound/ feedback, This one will sound little bit better or similar to a rs.400 keyboard. But yes it has a slight advantage due to the raised keys- Also the space bar is squeaky (applying oil with a flat trimmer brush underneath may solve the issue).- kinda little bit imperfect paint job, but hard to notice.- the ridges in the key F and J need to be more prominent just like my laptop, helps people who do touch typing.PROS:- Not a big RGB light fan, but this keyboard packs nice ones. Really like the breathing effect how transient it is.- I like the how i am able to use it in a rugged manner and feels very sturdy.- i am someone who does touch typing and yes WPM does improve after using it for a while. The Anti-Ghosting does come into play helping me to avoid accidental presses.- Good gaming experience, performance did improve when compared playing in a laptopConclusion if you are looking for a mechanical keyboard, this is not the one. This one is a membrane keyboard and the keys are permanently attached. (Not the cherry MX types). I simply just fell for it thinking that at least this membrane keyboard will sound like a mechanical one. üòÖ. You can buy this keyboard if any of the PROS mentioned above meets your need."
4,"I Got this beautiful keyboard in a single day delivery and a price of Rs. 1000.  I have been using a mechanical keyboard for some time and must accept that now am a fan of mechanical keyboards due to their smooth typing feel.Since mechanical keyboards have clicky switches, you cannot use them in the places, where you have some colleagues working with you. Due to this reason, I was looking for a keyboard which could provide mechanical feel with less or no noise.After a lot of searches, I zeroed for this one and after using it for a while, I thought of sharing my experience as a review of this keyboard.Starting with the pros, this keyboard provides the right mechanical feel and you do not feel any pain in the fingertips even when you type for longer periods. There is ample space between the keys hence you make fewer mistakes while typing. The keypress is deep and for people who are using mechanical keyboards for this particular reason, will find it satisfying.There is rainbow lighting provided in this keyboard which means every key has a fixed color LED behind it and you cannot change it. You cannot set a single color for the whole keyboard (which by the way is a feature of higher versions of the gaming keyboards). For people like me who are using this for typing and coding purposes lighting do not come to picture at all. I do not keep the lights open at all, even if they look beautiful and HI-FI but they may interfere in your concentration while typing. You can switch on/off the backlight using a dedicated key provided for that in the keyboard, also you can change the lighting modes using the Fn+ pg up/down buttons.For gamers, there is also a windows lock key, which means you can lock the windows key, which sometimes kill the gaming experience by popping up the start menu.Coming to the keystrokes, the keys are soft enough and not much clicky. It is somewhat near to the Cherry MX Brown/ red versions of the mechanical keys. It produces less noise but still, when you click the space bar there is some sound.The plastic used in the keyboard look decent (as per the price), the cable (around 4ft) is braided one which means it is entangling free. There is also a height raiser provided at the backside which helps you increase the height of the keyboard to provide a good typing experience.For the limitations part of this keyboard, as of now, I have not found anything which I could mention on the negative side. However in future, if I come across any cons, I will put them up here.Overall, it is a great buy for gamers as well as coders like me. Its a bang for the buck."
4,Using it with my MacBook works fine. The cPs lock light has gone off within few hrs of use. Caps lock is working though. I use it for regular work not gaming. Keys are smooth but noisy as compared to regular logitech keyboards. Lights look good.Previous logitech mk275 wireless stopped working in a year. So went with this product. So far so good.It's just my first day of using this for regular office work.Form factor is a great space saver.
5,"This product is really amazing in every aspect.I needed a backlit keyboard for my laptop, as it lacks one, and this keyboard is just perfect for me.Moreover, though its not mechanical, but it feels and sounds just like one.Cable - Nylon coated Braided cable. Very strong.The USB pin is also very well built and looks very sturdy.Lighting - 3 levels of brightness + you can on/off the rgb lights as per your need. This is already brilliant in this price range, don't expect ultra-premium features at this price.For an idea about the size of the laptop, it is about the same size (in length) as my 15.6 inch laptop's inbuilt keyboard.I got it for 750 Rs in amazon great indian festival with lightning deal at 900 rs + rs 150 off due to rupay debit card. I am really happy to get this epic deal.Trust me, its the best keyboard you will ever find in this price range."
4,Keyboard Looks like a Expensive Mechanical  keyboard. But actually it is a Membrane Keyboard. Keys are raised by Spring. Using it for 10 days. Its working good. Playing games.  There are only 2 light effects. Still and Breathing. And brightness can be changed. Adequate Bright not too much. Corners of the keyboard Are little less bright.  Its fully Plastic.  Not too light weght though. Good quality for 999 rupees.  Lets see how long it lasts.  Cable is breaded. Keyboard is small size looks good. I like it. Box pack was bad. No sealing.
4,"At this price, it is a fairly good mouse.PROS:Value for MoneyLooksRGB LightingBuild QualityCONS:Bit HeavyThis mouse carries some weight. Choose wisely.If you are person who loves light mouse, this is not for you.Plus, the Firefox Software is not available in Amkette store but the link is given on package.It's not an signed exe package. Don't know why!! Windows will show few security pop-ups, skip through those, its OK to install.Its has very basic UI but does the job."
1,"Writing review after 2 Months of use.Some buttons has become hard. I am into programming. I type a lot. When i try to press some buttons it doesn't press sometimes. It has become thay much hard.Some dust might get collected below keys and made it rough. But the real problem is non detectable keys.After keys get hard, i have to throw it away. There is no option to clean it. Even i had mailed to their support team . But they are busy only in selling products.Seems like TYPICAL CHINEESE PRODUCT.DON'T GO FOR IT. It's just a matter of time you will start to face problems and you have to throw it in dustbin."
5,"This is a really good gaming mouse and is really comfortable I use it for gaming and streaming  its high 4800 DPI helps me to switch the apps when I am streaming, also provides a really comfortable and nice grip when I game on 800-1000 DPI it has a really simple software (except the macro settings) and can be easily adjusted to . I didn't notice that it was a FULL SIZED mouse which was also not written in the details make sure to check the size before buying any product I mainly use it for playing VALORANT and I am really confident of its build quality over all its a very light and perfect budget gaming mouse to game on it only has 4set of rgb colors which are red , blue , pink , purple and cannot be changed to other colors like green and yellow (even thru the software)"
3,"Let's start with what's good: It compactthat's it.key size felt kind of ok for me as I'm habituated to larger key size and prefer them, it braided cable but the quality is low, the same goes for built quality and key pressing feedback.So to sum it up if the keyboard cost around 600(based on built (quality) I would be ok or if there was no better keyboard at 900(its price when I bought it)."
3,"I bought this back in June and have been using it for almost around 3 months now. So far, the keyboard still works fine but for its price I definitely think it could have been of better quality.The pictures are definitely somewhat deceiving as it doesn't look as premium when you get the actual product. The paint job seems very cheap and the RGB lighting is very subpar. Stand outs though, it is a TKL (no Numpad) so for gamers who have less desk space, this is definitely a great keyboard.It definitely is anti-ghosting - so that's a plus. Hope Amkette looks into making their products look and feel more premium for the price because I feel like this keyboard could have easily been sold for 500-600 rupees. If you're willing to increase your budget by an extra 200-300 rupees, go for another product is my final verdict. I'll try to wear this keyboard as much as I can before purchasing a new one."
5,"Review- I use this for playing Minecraft pep. With the provided software I am able to program the mouse properly. All 7 buttons work perfectly now. Very comfortable and Stylish Mouse and the delivery was quick too.All what I can say is, this is a must buy product for budget gamers."
3,"Not happy with keyboard, returned it an hour after I got itI was actually looking forward to using this keyboard because of its reviewsThe keys on the keyboard shake a lot and are very flimsy, they wobble too much and when they do so, it sounds like Lego blocks moved around in a boxIf I press the keys in the center of the keyboard the whole keyboard dips into the center and that shows its pathetic build qualityWhen I typed using it, my speed was better, meaning it could be used for gaming due to its low latency ,but gamers need sturdy keyboards tooThe paint job is super bad, you could make out errors on the many keysThe RGB lighting looks good, but can be better with more color optionsAlso when I click on the 'E' key, both the D and E key gets pressed, so a big no for typistsAlso when my brother was playing Valorant, during the game the keyboard started malfunctioning, like if you hold W, you're supposed to move forward, but in this keyboard if you hold W, the game registers it as if I'm spamming W a few times in a second, so the character doesn't move constantly but keeps stopping and moving forwardVerdict: Dont go for it dear gamers and typists, the redgear blaze manta is a better option in the same price rangeVerdict : don't go for it, won't last long"
1,"If you are looking for a good keyboard with good feedback and comfortable ergonomics, then look elsewhere.This is a keyboard which would not make you happy.First and foremost, the build quality is absolutely shambolic. The paint is of low quality. There no defined lines. The letter start vanishing within 6 months. The buttons are loose and tacky. Shake the keyboard a little and you will knowSecondly, the feedback on this keyboard is extremely poor. The buttons get stuck while typing often.The response time is very poor for gaming too.The lighting is just a set of 5 LED lights under the keyboard with fixed colour.I regret buying this.Just look elsewhere for a quality keyboard."
3,"Ohh boy I expected something great but for 1000rs I would say okThe keys lit up well and they do a great job showing the key character at night (some don't show it that well ..It's a sparay painted nad laser removed the outline so if you scrape off the plack stuff you might actually illuminate the damage aswellYou can do this cool thing just signed your name using a sharp tool now the signature illuminates (I said ""you can "" but don't do it if you want to loose your warrenty )(It's a 3 mothns warranty not 1year )The keys sound no where like mechanical and doesn't even feels mechanical they key travel is very impressive so I give props to that .If you have big Hands avoid this the key caps are a bit smallAnd the part where the wire attached to the keyboard is flimsy and I think might wear down quickly.Braided babel but it's for show it's early tearing apart at the junction .Over all for 1000rs -OKbetter buy this at 800-850rs"
4,"The mouse is good, it's fast and fancy, a bit heavy but makes gaming experience a lot better. My family have been using Amkette products for over two decades now, I still have their Floppy Disks (a square thing before everything), also my last amkette wireless keyboard-mouse combo lasted 8 years..the mouse still works. Coming back to this Evo Fox mouse, there are technically better gaming mouse available in market for the same budget but I'm not sure they'll last long as most of them have poor quality check and you'll endup wasting alot of time and money in just claiming warranty. My expectation is that Evo Fox devices will last longer than others in the segment."
5,"I needed an interim key now which I would have to use for games like Dota 2, Cyberpunk etc. Got this till I thought I would save up for a much better keyboard. I was coming from a Logitech 402 which had stopped working so the quality and downgrade response from the key switches (or all thereof) were immediately noticeable. However, over time, this keyboard grew on me and now I‚Äôll be keeping this one for a while.Would not recommend for people who type a lot but for gamers, sure. The lighting can either be off or have different levels of brightness but is not customisable. Don‚Äôt expect more at this price range.It‚Äôs fairly light but seems decently durable.If you‚Äôre on a tight budget and are primarily getting a keyboard for gaming, this one is recommended, hands down"
5,"This keyboard is really good, it doesn't strain my hands and it is good for long hours of gaming. The RGB is not customisable but it looks good anyway. The Windows lock key is a huge advantage as sometimes when you misclick the windows button while gameing you gameplay gets ruined. But windows lock solves that problem.The design of the keyboard is so good, the Evo Fox logo lightens up if you trigger capslock mode. It is a membrane keyboard but it has a mechanical feel when typing something, but during gaming you realise that you are gaming on a membrane keyboard.If you are on Budget and can't afford for a mechanical keyboard, this is the best membrane keyboards you'll get at this price point.Design 5/5Ergonomics 4/5RGB 4/5"
5,"Just received the keyboard today. Packaging was really good (took me a while to open it lol üòÜ). Delivery guy was awesome. Was really quick and accurate on the address. So great service üëç. The keyboard itself is sturdy. As a professional web designer myself, which involves a lot of typing this keyboard certainly serves the purpose. Typing is smooth. The backlit keys are good and has a nice breathing effect, although I generally don't care about LEDs but its a plus. Gaming on this keyboard feels great since it's a gaming keyboard. Those 19 anti-ghosting keys are really handy while playing any Assassin's Creed games or Saints Row IV while involves a lot of running and jumping at the same time. All in all I'm very happy with the product."
1,"The product when ordered came defective most of the keys not workingTried contacting the support (Amkette) no response from their side, better buy another keyboardthe build was also not good"
2,this keyboard is really good for its price. Its keys are really good and it is great for gaming.I am giving it 2 stars because after 2 months of normal use it has stopped working properly.When I plug it in all the lighting effects work but I cant type anything. The keys won't register on all the devices I've tried. Also I contacted amkette around 1 month ago and they still haven‚Äôt replied.
3,"See in this range you will get another option this mouse ia good for work purpose and for slow accuracy/DPI game like war thunder Snipe mode, But for game like PUBG it sucks at aiming and button are little hard. Downside rubber grip is not smooth as compair to other mouse. Its create grip on mat( I have razor Mat) which dont give smooth movement. My previous mouse is Razer Taipan, may for that i am disappointed."
5,It's motion detector aka the thing under the mouse sometimes is more working or sometimes is less... Sometimes it's senstivity is like 20 or at the same time it can be 100 BUT that isn't the good point. The good point is that me and all my friends praised this mouse unlike a mouse of zebronics I bought earlier. It is a bit like sticky so I have problems cleaning my mouse but ok. I use it for editing and playing games. So my suggestions are - You SHOULD buy it. It is total worth of your money. And the design is just so awesome to my eyes...
2,"keyboard doesn't sit still on surface, it rocks. left side up right side down...got replacement (cause refund wasn't provided) still same issue in new keyboard. its very annoying.keyboard letters if not backlighted hard to see from angles...I pressed 's+d+i' or 's+d+o' at the same time to check anti ghosting, doesn't take input of i or o,same with several keys...which even my 6 year old dell laptop keyboard does with ease.NOT RECOMMEND if you r concerned about above problems. otherwise its the only good tkl keyboard we have under 1000rs in India. I don't know why other companies don't make tkl keyboards...very few people need numpad i.e. full size keyboards other than banking & accountancy personals."
5,Best membrane keyboard in this price segmentKeys are clunky gives good typing feelReally comfortable and nice to improve typing speedThe built quality is premium no denying itThe RGB backlights are good very sturdyAlmost like mechanical keyboardMy typing speed went from 48WPM to 60WPM when I used this keyboardReally a must if you are using this for work or gaming
4,"Size is good, compact, good RGB, keys are ok, give a sort of mechanical feels, nice and clicky ni wobble. Construction is very cheap but it's very cheap compared to others so that's that. Typing experience is good, so is gaming although some key placements like the the left alt is slightly shifted so will have to get used to it.Braided wire is a nice touch. Overall 4/5 for price and product. Cheers!"
2,Even though this is a cheap mouse I don't recommend this mouse. The sensor stopped working in less than 2 days and the software that you have to download with the mouse was shady and is filled with bugs for example the software kept changing language to Chinese and removed all functions from the mouse at which point I have to re-plug the mouse for it to reset. The sensor is not that good either if you lift the mouse a little it will stop sensing whereas my previous mouse which was the same price handled the same situation much better. so overall there are many better alternatives at this price in the market.
4,Just value for moneyKeys stiffness could have become little more
2,Very poor plastic built....ok for normal typing...don't even think you can do gaming in this keyboard.Only go for this is you have a low budget other wise better add some more money and buy a better one.
4,product is good at this price for temporary use & after using this for a month as much as possible.i'm reviewing this so it can be help full.
3,"The shift key has been made smaller. You tend to press the shift key, you would get a backslash."
3,Keys look too fragile to type on.. looks like they would break away if typed faster. Honest advice don't take it. Invest a little more on a good one
4,The product is good... Only one thing I would like to say that the keys are very loose... But no problem for typing
1,Very poor quality product
4,Why does it have same buttons
1,Its total waste ......buttons are coming out in just 15 days.
5,Good for daily purposes
4,Valuable at this price
1,Not working
5,Nice
5,gdd product
5,Amazing performance  given by keyword.really such a good product at a small price. Overall jabardast product. Thanks  amazon for this.
5,Worth for money and nice keyboard cheapest keyboard User friendly every should buy this product one one three four five
5,Nice
5,I ordered this keyboard for special purpose. The keyboard which I was using before was of laptop which was getting dusty and so much ruff after use. Then I decided to go for external accessory keyboard to prevent from rust. This one is slip model and perfect for working. Value for money product and best for gaming application and office work.
5,"I wanted a white-colored keyboard to go with my monitor and mouse at home. There are very few options out there and I was looking for a wireless one which I couldn't find, instead, I had to settle for this wired one. Initially, I was a bit skeptical about buying this keyboard as there weren't too many reviews, although the ones that are there, are quite promising. Its been about 2 months since I got this keyboard and I am quite happy with it. The chicklet keys mimic the behavior of your laptop keyboard, so it makes it easier to type. The spacing between the keys are just right for you to hit the ones that you want.There is also a Rupee key which you need to install to get working. The installation process is provided on the box and is quite simple. For a budget keyboard, this one turned out to be really good and I am glad I took the risk."
5,"Using this Keyboard for my office work from the past 3 weeks... and I am very happy with this Keyboard. The keys are soft for typing.... since i am using it extensively.... very comfortable.Wondering why there are fewer orders for this product.... have used other good name brands.. but this keyboard is the best at this price. One can surely go for this without any second thoughts.Pros:1. Chiclet keys are very smooth for typing2. The Caps lock, Num lock led's r so bright.. very good to see them at night3. Good product at a very reasonable priceCons: I don't see any after 3 weeks of continuous usageOverall satisfaction: 5/5"
4,The key travel is not that good. The keys are flat keys which doesn't have any curving which make it a little problematic for me while typing faster. The space bar is a little loose. But for this price its a good one compared to the other products in this price range.
5,"At the first time I received the keyboard but the left control key didn't seem to be proper. Then I got it replaced. Now it works really well and it also feels premium. The replacement was also fast and hassle free. Overall, it is a great product !"
5,"Just started using it!This keyboard seems to be very promising. Sturdy built quality, elegant looks and soft tuch to the buttons."
5,"Bought this as I couldn't get the Dell 216 in white colour, but this alternative is totally worth it. It is a premium keyboard, and the multimedia keys are awesome eg. there is a key for opening explorer directly into 'This PC' tab, which I need a lot. The browser tab opens chrome, which is my default browser. Keys are awesome to type, and i wanted chicklet keys as i find it easy to type with my laptop keyboard which has chicklet keys. The finish is very good, with metallic edges and overall very good design. Awesome, that too at this low price. The white colour is not too bright, has a very slight beige-like tinge. I checked each key, and it is working very well, making lesser noise than my laptop keyboard keys. But i have just tried it for a few minutes, so will update the review after a month of use...but the quality of the keyboard and even the good packing, seems professional and doesn't seem like it will give problems anytime soon. Rupee key is a bonus, but it requires you to install some drives, and the lengthy process is given on the box; would have liked it out-of-the-box, but then, windows does not have that font. Another con is that the multimedia keys require you to press the 'Function' key, so one hand operation is not present. But on the other hand, 12 multimedia keys is a good thing anyway, though you may not use some keys like 'stop' and 'Favourites'. (I assume the last key is 'favourites' but it isn't doing anything, so not sure if it is really for browser 'favourites' or something else, or if it is just not functional! Overall, a very nice keyboard. The cheapest and best if you don't want to use a boring black keyboard! (P.S this review is the first thing I have typed with this keyboard!)"
5,you will love typing on this keyboard. Makes little noise like all other keyboard. But very smooth keyboard.
5,zebronics keyboard super nice keyboard..its like alaptop model chicklet keyboard...its very convenient to working...excellent keyboard...i love this keyboard..

5,Wasn't expecting the keyboard to be this good for the amount I paid. I am liking it.
4,"Using for couple of months now.Product is built with good condition and keys are stiff. Typing experience is not that great, its kind of okay considering the price point. You will get used to it. Overall good keyboard"
5,This keyboard really awesome for typing. There is no second thought. I purchased 1 month back and these keys are very soft and size also very comfortable. I really thanks for this product and loved it
5,"Good product, as expected!"
5,"Very nice build quality, does the job. Happy with my purchase. Buttons are smooth to operate. Very comfortable with typing."
4,"I think this is the cheapest keyboard with soft chiklet keysUsing it from last 10 days and no complaints till nowGood thing is it has all multimedia keysWill recommend for office work, software professionals but not for gaming"
5,Value for money.
5,"It is smooth, key travel is good, feels premium and a budget keyboard.Surely go for it. It's been 3 months since I bought this keyboard and haven't faced any kind of issues yet."
5,Feeling very happy with this product. Very smooth in typing üòâüëåüëå.
4,"Keypad are soft, very much ok for this price. Just to add it as retractable stand and sw installation process for using rupees font.Con - Made in China"
5,Guys... awesome keyboard with chiklet keys...light weight and slim...white colour is awesome...looks nice...
4,"good, but keys arent very soft"
4,Nice keyboard for daily office use.. My husband has a habit of using the keyboard like a typewriter.. And he loved it.

5,Very good product. Very smooth keys easy to access
5,Good product
4,"One of the best product in Computer accessories. Purchase this keyboard at this price is amazing. Light weight, and great performace. Thanks to amazon."
5,Nice
5,Best quality... Worth the money...
4,Product is nice. Works well with our desktop. Has responsive quick keys. Chiclet style keys do not stick in between while typing.
5,Excellent for the price.
5,"Very nice keyboard, easy to type, soft keys, will order another if required in future."
5,Good Product
5,"It's very comfortable.same as in pictures.it's worth,value for money."
5,"Under 300 rupees, this is best you can get.pros:full size keyboarddecently smooth keysless noise while typingrupee key presentinclined hinges for comfortable typingCons:wire length enough but less compared to other keyboardsno multimedia keys"
5,"Very good keyboard. Build quality is pretty good. Also has a good egronomical design and is sleek too. Keys are not too flat and at the same time not too bulky as well. Has a soft touch key press action that makes typing comfortable and smooth. Only drawback is that it does not have the LED light indicators for caps lock,  scroll lock and num lock and also no rubber bushes under the keyboard to prevent it from moving while typing. Otherwise this is a really good product for the price that it's being offered on amazon."
4,"Value for money product! Keys are not so soft, but good to work with it! As mentioned its splash proof but at the right top corner where 3 LED lights are placed for notifications of Alphabet lock, number lock and scroll lock there you can see a small gap in which there are more chances of water getting in and spoil the keyboard! However considering the price point it is the best in this segment! Go for it! Carbon fiber texture gives a extra premium look! Good to go!"
2,"The keyboard is very lightweight, however, it does not have the rubber grips at the base. So, the frictionless plastic bottom (raised 2cm¬≤ of it) against hard wood surface.. makes it a very annoying formula.It's flimsy, non-standard layout - minor issues that user could live with.. but this keyboard grip being skipped is horrendous choice at manufacturer's part. Then again, it's made in China and you can't explain any QA/QC at this price point."
5,The keyboard is soft and tactile like a very high quality keyboard. At the same time it completely justifies the quality it provides.Dont see much difference between this and the Dell keyboard I use at office.Great deal for the money you pay.
1,"Dont buy, even in 100 rupees it is costlier, cheap plastic material."
2,Did not work as expected. Repeat rate could not be set and it always prints too many characters for each key press. Hence could not type.Returned for exchange. Can confirm its quality after the replacement.
5,Very very light weight and it moves up m down when you when you start typing.  You will feel to exchange it however just within an hour or so of usage you will get accustomed to this keyboard and start appreciating it for the money it comes for. No problem whatsoever
2,"As soon as a month of usage, the keys started to become mushy and a single press triggers multiple entries and makes my typing experience very bad. literally, almost all the markings of the alphabets in the keys are gone for e now in just a month. don't buy if you can save extra 200 money to buy a keyboard. this is ok if you don't have more money to buy."
2,I am writing after using for 2 months.. keyboard is not working..it used to connect to pc but not it's not working with the same PC.. I used it for only one pc..
5,"Nice keyboard,,, but I suggest you to buy by watching the palm rest keyboard,, to which you can type much easier...This keyboard is less palm rest space while continuously typing your hand will tired.. I watched later after ordering this, else I'll also go for that keyboard which has much space for palm rest,,,,Overall very nice keyboard,, I typed by taking the rest of table for palm"
1,This is the most bad product in the world. üò†.Just waste my money. Now I have to buy a key board again. The key are totally not working properly. I have to press it again and again but sometimes it types more then one latter or something it types nothing I hate it. Do not buy it at all. üò†üò†. Amazon please review it and sell atleast that product which is working properly.
1,Received damaged at bottom right corner. Build Quality is visibly not good. Don't buy.
2,"Poor quality. Its been 2 months, 7 letters already lost their prints. Many others are loosing theirs. I dont know what happened to the UV coating they applied. After a while half of the keys lose their prints. You are left to wonder what letter is where..."
5,"Right Shift key stuck all of the time, I thought it is manufacturing defect so I replaced but I noticed the same problem in replaced keyboard too. I think with this series keyboard design Engineer did blunder mistake while designing. Poor Keyboard please don't waste your money."
3,I was just looking for a temporary cheap solution. So bought this one. Though the Cable was broken and had to put electric tape. But keyboard works and delivered before time so I give 3/5. Will keep it and won't return.
3,Don't know id this is the case of mine only or overall but mine sometimes just doesn't work or the pc cannot read it while booting up and i would have to re-plug several times indifferent ports on my Gigabyte B450M DS3H motherboard which is very much annoying and frustrating at the same time.Rest it is a good keyboard for normal usage no problem whatsoever to date from October 2020.
2,Product seems ok at the price range but packaging of product was not satisfactory. It arrived with tampered state and with no extra care to prevent damage. Package was also not wrapped in Amazon box. I feel seller takes order for granted.
5,"The keyboard has been functioning perfectly from the very beginning till now/ I am sorry to say the previous one was defective. that is the a thing of the past, so let it be. Thanks ."
1,"It's the worst  keyboard I have ever used .Just after few days of light use , the keys become very hard and it's not usable now.My advise :Don't buy this keyboard at all."
4,It is in working condition. The USB connection works fine. It did not take much effort to connect it and start using it.Reason for 4 stars: It looked a little old as if it has been used before.
1,Some of the keys do not work unless the device is plugged out and back in. it is a Chinese product. :(
4,"Very good keyboard, for basic use. Keys are spacious and soft touch. I am giving 4 stars since the packaging was not good and the corner of the keyboard is broken although it didn't affect the functionality"
1,The product stopped working after 3 days of minim use and it is neither value for money nor it has appropiate quality. I wish to return it as soon as possible!
1,Got spoiled within 2 weeks of purchase. and even after having warranty the vendor does not respond
3,"The keyboard looks and feels very flimsy. The design is also not super ergonomic. I went for a cheap one, should not have. Not very user friendly."
3,Good at this price of 300 .....but not good for tying as other keys got pressed while typing.....instead one should buy zebronic 500 rupees keyboard which has spaces between keys
3,"Product was lightweight and very thin, can't be used for long term, can be used as temporary, not value for money...üòíüòí...product packaging was good..and fast delivery.."
5,Works well and provides real value for money at only 300 bucks.
5,"Using for past 2 weeks. So far so good..Keys are bit hard. But when you compare the price, it's worth it..Overall, best USB keyboard in this price range.."
1,"the keyboard is malfunction  2, or more than 2 characters are coming on1 single keypress. some key need to press very hard, some key is showing multiple characters on a single keypress. I didn't check the keyboard on receiving the order, I bought it for the backup keyboard but when I try to use it it is not working"
1,Worst keyboard in the worldNo accuracy0% good lookingQuality is very very badI hate this keyboard
4,"It‚Äôs ok. Can‚Äôt say too good quality or compare to other brands, but it‚Äôs ok if you don‚Äôt want to spend more."
1,13th may delivered.. it was working fine for 10days..later started giving prob..if I press any key it is taking 2 times... If I press q it is taking qq.. not worth!Now 10days over and I cant return also.Go for Logitech.. expensive but worth!!!
1,Worst product.. The keys don't work properly after 10-15 days after the return policy ends.. So u can't even exchange..pls do not buy dis one..rs 300 is for 15 days..
1,Don't buy the product. Didn't even last for 25 days. Absolutely Garbage product. Very disappointed.
1,Light weight is fine but no grip for the keyboard...keeps moving while working .No return option. Only replacement.Not at all happyDo not buy if you are planning to work on the table .
5,Bought it by prime benefits for my employee as a temporary solution.Works great.Can't use in continous typing as it is membrane.
2,">Enters keys twice, even if u press very lightly.>Not suitable for typing>Keys are placed very close to each other.Not suitable.>Cannot return only replace.>U will have hard time typing passwords and it always gives invalid due to double typo."
5,"t...The keys are so soft and the difference between the key is very less so it helps to write fast...In conclusion, i want to say that if you are buying this product, you made a good decision.....and if you don't like it, you can return it as per amazon policy."
1,It doesn't even work for me no matter what I do üò°
5,"Very light weight, stable design, keys feel good while typing and the responses are very good.No noise while typing, which I don't prefer but would not complain about it.Real value for the money spent."
5,"Overall super and easy to use,"
3,"Product is good but certain keys are interchanged like @ and "" are interchanged.Kindly look into the matter as price is also quite high."
4,Nice product with wire
4,"Recently I brought the keyboard. Looks are good, light weight. Good to buy."
5,Excellent
5,"All in one best, in range amount"
5,"Slick and good design,light  keys feeling, but bit over priced"
5,Very smooth typing and very good in build quality.
5,"I had an older cheap keyboard which went out after 3 months of use. My main purpose of buying this is for its durability. I am a S/W developer, so needed a good quality keyboard within a budget.Pros:- Feels durable, the keyboard keys are a bit tight (when compared with a laptop), but I got used to it in a few days. The keyboard is near silent, doesn't make all the clickety noises like a chicklet keyboard.- Mouse size is just right. My palm rests exactly as I want it to while fingers are just in the right position (I have average sized hands so it may differ for others). I don't know why people complain of having a thumb support. It makes the mouse heavier and not easy to move. All the buttons have the correct feedback as a pro mouse should have. Its also light which makes it easy to operate. The accuracy is good.Cons:- The spacing between key groups has been reduced so when I come home from office, it takes some time to adjust. Example when I intend to hit delete, I was hitting end most times. But you get used to it.- The signs printed on the keys seems like some sort of sticker. I hope it doesn't come out.- Shallow key travel, so I have to put less force (less than a regular keyboard but more than on a laptop).For the price, I think this looks like a good and durable keyboard. I wanted a simple one without all the multimedia stuff and this fits my requirements."
3,"Product quality is good enough as par the cost price.This is a very classy, minimalist and attractive combo."
1,"Absolutely disappointed to receive ONLY keyboard... when we were waiting for a Keyboard and Mouse Combo!!!Positive part is, since it was COD order... The bill arrived was for Keyboard ONLY.But I am absolutely clueless, why my order is got altered without any prior update???"
2,"This is not original dell product, its copy of  Dell product. When i scan QR code on box its directing me to fake unsecured Chinese dell page and key board is also not looks premium..I purchased this product for ‚Çπ900 which is over priced for duplicate Chinese product"
5,"i bought this primarily for the keyboard and the mouse is a backup as my current ones are not doing very well. i repair the little copper spring after the clicking stops functioning normally but I never know when it will stop completely. anyway, this keyboard is great to type on. i'm an advertising copywriter and have to type a lot and this is very good, almost like the apple keyboard."
5,"-Keyboard is very sensitive and very soft keys-Doesn't produce sounds while pressing keys so thats a bonus for me as i have a lot of typingMouse is medium size , needed a little bigger as my palms are full size but can work with this too ."
4,"The keyboard quality is good. As you can see from the picture, it is quite small. If you have smaller fingers, this will be comfortable for you. Otherwise get a bigger keyboard."
1,"Not even single star.There is no office combo of keyboard and mouse by dell they are combining the individual product, but even though they charging more man MRP.(keyboard-449 and mouse-299 total is 748) but the amezon prize is 850 for combo."
5,This model keyboard and mouse is given to employees at work. So I had experienced its durability at work so bought for home PC. Very rough and tough. Very durable. Very reliable product by Dell.
5,Perfect for ‚Äúwork from home‚Äù people..I am using with my office laptop and it works flawlessly. The keys are very comfortable and spot on . Mouse works on my wooden table perfectly without any pad.
1,"Mouse edges are not properly finished, low quality plastic used, scroll wheel is also too hard, keyboard quality is goodMouse wheel not working after few months from purchase"
5,"Still using the same combo.It has stood the rigors of my professional work and personal use. And a whole lot of travel. And the occasional guests who check their emails.Excellent, highly recommended!"
2,"Tempered seal, lot of execuses in packaging damage, delivered opened product. Not sure how this is Amazon choice product. Dissatisfied with keyboard. But mice is good."
5,Great products from Dell. I have been using the same model for around one year and it is still working without any flaw. Good typing experience when compared to other Keyboards I had. 100% value for money. The independent key model will improve your typing skill as well. Also Mouse is so precise while working on editing software. Overall good experience.
3,Few keys stick in when pressed and this started happening just after couple of months.
5,Highly durable product from Dell. The products are erogonomicallyndesigned and perform well after continuous usage.
5,Loved it. Was fed up of buying keyboard every year due to issues.The same version of keyboard and mouse i had used in office and wanted to buy this for home use. Have been using for more than 2 years and absolutely no complaints. Would buy it again 10/10 times.
4,Smooth to handle but fully china made & seems like copy of the original. But comfortable to use...
5,"Ergonomic, value for money, comfortable. Ideal product for home and office use. Loved this product from Dell."
1,"PRODUCT AUTHECITY ISSUE , ITS OLD STOCK BRANDED KEYBOARD.Message for Buyers: Its not doubt this is Branded product , Brand is reputed .But its your luck as these are old Keyboard"
5,"I liked the keyboard, however the mouse was not as comfortable to hold when compared to my logi mouse."
3,The key travel of this keyboard is short if you are coming from a regular keyboard it can be very odd to adjust to this keyboard. Otherwise it is a good keyboard but it is made in China.
1,The keyboard stopped working within 2 months. Not worth the buy. I didn't expect such low quality from dell. It's outside the return window so now stuck with junk.
3,new key board with all keys making more noise and mainly they sent used mouse some one used mouse its not a new one so i returned it but corrier guy not ready to pic bcz that mouse is old one never buy plzzzz
4,"without any problems.Good purchase by me.Purchased the same product ""Intex Corona Slim USB Keyboard Water Spill proof  and Intex Optical Mouse Little Wonder Black USB with 1 year manufacturer warranty "" ---- did not work. All waste."
4,Very well designed and comfortable to use.only downside is the elevation support do not make any difference.
4,"Overall keyboard is good and smooth as I expected. but bumps in keyboard are very poor, it's very hard to recognise the bumps in keyboard."
4,"The Keyboard and Mouse are decent looking the price. However, personally I feel that The Amazon Basics combo is better and the price is also a little cheaper for Amazon one. Have to check on durability though."
4,The packing was good.. the product is perfectI am very happy with the same
4,As usual dell keyboards are the best for daily office use
4,"The keyboard is good even though it is on costlier side. But, one can rely on it. It looks like that it can handle some heavy use & handling. The mouse is good, little bigger than the miniatures available in market, comfortable in hand."
5,Good product. Been using it for a couple of weeks now. Comfortable and affordable
5,Nice product for laptop
5,Keys are very soft. and keyboard is very comfortable.
3,Good keyboard and mouse combination. Keys are soft and good for touch typists. The keyboard is durable but the right click on my mouse because hard after few months use.
5,No complaints. Bought for family. Everyone liked the combo.
5,"Nice keyboard. Have been using it for more than a month now. So far, no isues."
4,Keyboard is very nice but mouse is not handy (not very comfortable to use) and it doesn't look premium.
2,This is not made in usThis mouse and keybored made by chinaI'm not setisfied this product
4,Product is good. Country of origin is missing.It's china origin
1,The USB receiver is not working. It is under warranty. Dell refuses to service as they say warrranty is over as per their terms. I purchased it on 8th feb 2017 but dell says the warranty starts from date of manufacturing and not when the customer purchases the product.Can amazon please help me with this.
1,"Pros:1. Smooth surface2. Almost silent typing3. Ergonomic mouseCons: [Note, I got warranty replacement in 3 months and the replaced item has same issues as listed in the cons below, so they are standard lackings in the product]1. Battery Indicator never works - it is a mere gimmick2. Absence of the Indicators for Num Lock, Function Key Lock, Scroll Lock is more inconvenient than I thought. Makes case change typing really complicated. Very unpractical.3. Both original mouse and second mouse went nuts after few weeks of use. They become hard to click causing RSI condition for users.4. Keyboard batteries do not last beyond  2 months even on moderate use of 2-3 hours typing a day.5. Dell does not have straight forward customer service for peripherals which made customer service experience a nightmare during warranty replacements.Overall rating: Poor value for money"
5,"It was either this or the logitech keyboard and mouse combo. Good range, works fine upto 9 feet distance. The mouse is medium sized, feels good in the palm. Keyboard is full sized.Let's have an in-depth look at this product.Pros:1) Has chicklet keys which as far as I have seen none of the other keyboards in this price range has.2) Very comfortable while typing. The keys are well spaced and well built.3) The Bluetooth receiver,  which is plugged into the USB port is quite small and it works for both the mouse and keyboard.4) The keys when pressed are quite soft and has depth.5) Both keyboard and mouse are solidly built, good plastic and finishing6) Free Duracell alkaline batteries for both mouse and keyboard provided. (2 AAA + 1 AA)CONS:1) No Off switch for the keyboard.2) No caps lock led to indicate when caps is on.My verdict is definitely go for this if you want a keyboard and mouse combo. Best quality at this price range.Including pics for your advantage. Hope this review was helpful to you."
1,"This keyboard is BIG. And impacts my typing speed. I cant reach my speed of 85 WPM because of the extra big size of the keys and their alignment. The keys are not properly aligned.. they are stretched a few millimeters than the standard key board.Every time I use ALT function , i accidentally touch windows keys. This Keyboard is for HUGE people like Sir Gregor Clegane = The Mountain from Game of Thrones.Dont buy it if you are among the humans that can be classified under normal category.Very Disappointed. I doubt this is a original or Fake product. Is this actually from DELL, because other Dell keyboards are absolutely perfect for me :/"
3,"It is a great option, its Dell after all. The buts being the keys feel very mushy, they aren't as clicky as you would expect them to be. The placement of keys is a lil different, takes time getting used to; it is my second day with it and I still miss keys here and there. Specially cause there is a 'Fn' key on the left after 'Ctrl' which shifts 'Alt' key to the right more than anyone is used to; this makes me press windows key all the time. The keyboard has no indication for Caps Lock and Num Lock, makes sense they wanted to save battery; but it does get annoying while typing passwords!The mouse on the other hand is great! No complaints about it whatsoever. The mouse it self is very light, battery adds to its weight which is very adequate.You can't actually go wrong with this at this price point. But there is a lot of getting used to involved here!PS: I used an OTG with my phone and connected the dongle supplied, both mouse and keyboard worked just fine. So this is a super compatible device. There is no lag or latency in mouse or keyboard."
1,"There is NO CAPS Lock LED Indicator... It creates a problem entering Password , you cannot know if it small or capital letter...  I found it a big disadvantage.. Other than that it works perfect"
5,"Using it from last 2 months without turning off, almost happy with price I paid. Good battery life. Keyboard has a little lag when I type very fast. But the price is low, so cant expect more than this.Update: using it from past 8 months and the mouse is showing low battery for the first time. (Keyboard battery is still running) Really awesome product. I am 100% satisfied and recommend this to everyone. (Note: I never turned OFF the mouse during this period. It was always ON)"
1,"I bought this product during March-2020. I'm writing this review after 3 months of usage. Within 3 months keyboard started giving problems. Function keys are not working (F10 & F11). I'm a techie and use these Function keys as shortcuts for my development work. Also the mouse seems to be a power hungry device. within 3 months ""Duracell ultra alkaline battery"" got emptied. I donno when both will stop working. I trusted Dell brand and Amazon, but both ditched me."
2,"Suddenly my keyboard has stopped working without any reason. Changed the battery, but still keyboard is not responding, looks like receiver had a very poor life. Really frustrating."
1,It was damaged & not in working condition. I have observed multiple time that Appario Seller has sent defective & non working products. This combo was also one of them.The product box was totally damaged. Cells for Mouse & Keyboard were opened up & seems like used. Keyboard was in working condition but mouse was not in working condition. I feel that it was the used product which was sent to me.I totally hate Appario Seller's this poor strategy.Same thing I bought from local market which is 70 Rs costlier than Amazon and it is fresh & awesome product.If anyone from Appario Team is reading this review then I suggest improve your service instead of sending fake & used products.
5,"Delivery was fast. Received within a day even though estimate said later. Packaging was good. Contents were intact and there was no damage. Purchased it for Rs. 1281 from the amazon seller ""Appario Retail Private Ltd"". MRP on the box was Rs.1399. It was manufactured in China and imported for sale by Dell. Batteries are included in the box. I am happy to see Duracell batteries and not some local brand which might not last long. 2 AAA batteries for the keyboard. 1 AA battery for the mouse.My initial impressions are it does not give a premium look and feel. However its functional. Dimensions are little big for my taste. I would have liked them a bit smaller. Its a full keyboard with number pad and arrow keys. Function keys are also present with some additional multimedia keys. keyboard layout is in English. Mouse is little noisy when clicking and scrolling. Precision is good. I am used to Logitech mouse which is much quieter compared to Dell. At this price range it is a good deal. Tested all the keys to check for any manufacturing defects. Everything seems to be working fine. There is on-off button on the mouse but there is no such option for the keyboard. So I am not sure how long the batteries will last for the keyboard. Better to keep couple of AAA batteries handy just in case.Key press and travel is good. Distance between the keys is adequate. Keys are little hard to press at first but I am getting used to it. There is not much delay from key press to displaying text on the screen. Sometimes it is noticeable as I am used to wired keyboard.There are no LEDs on the keyboard for NUM lock and CAPS lock. There is one very small LED for indicating low battery.I did not check the wireless range yet. Box says it should work up to 10 meters. We get a single unified nano USB receiver for both keyboard and mouse in the box. Its small in size and will not protrude much outside the USB slot.  I did not face any issue with the connection on my Win10 laptop. No additional drivers needed. I was able to use both keyboard and mouse from the very instant the USB receiver was plugged-in.Verdict: I am happy with the performance of the Dell KM117 keyboard and mouse combo. I will definitely recommend it for people looking for good wireless keyboard and mouse combo with good performance within budget."
5,"For work purpose it's good and simply does the work. The USB connects to laptop and both mouse and keyboard works smoothly. You put one AA battery in mouse and two AAA batteries in keyboard. I tried to usethis wireless mousee with 5 feey distance, it was working fine. This is an affordable wireless keyboard and mouse combo.Found this review helpful? Hit helpful button."
1,"ConclusionThis is a good keyboard for people who generally use their computers for browsing and light typing. Not suitable for people who intend to type several pages a day as the ergonomics are not good. A mechanical keyboard is better in that case.ProsThe product seem well made and finishing is very good. The keys are fairly responsive and the mouse is very comfortable to useConsThis is not a mechanical keyboard and does not have the same level of responsiveness. Keys are close together, may cause errors. Keys require more pressure to ensure that the desired symbol is typed and causes more errors."
1,"If you are a serious typer, then this keyboard is not for you.I use mechanical keyboard all the time, I had to buy a keyboard immediately so I choose this one. It was a very bad decision. I'm a software developer, Keyboard is a big part of my day to day job. This keyboard is causing nothing but pain for me. a lot of keypresses is not getting register. key are ver hard. I'm making a lot of typos due to this keyboard.I have tried other rubber dom keyboards as well but this one is very very bad"
5,I am using this keyboard and mouse combo with my Macbook Air 10.13.6. i had to use an external keyboard as i extensively use Numeric pad for my work. and due to limited USB port i specifically wanted wireless keyboard and mouse. there is a single dongle for both keyboard and mouse. the pairing was a breeze and took me less than a minute. the mouse had reverse rolling on MacOs because of its inherent windows alignment. However it can be corrected in setting and its working without a problem. just two issues with Keyboard. it is not back lit and it has not light for Caps lock. other than these two issues i have no problem with this package. the key combination for MacOs will also get a day or two to get used to. After that its much simpler to use. would definitely recommend it.
1,Issues with the key. Many of the keys that you type don't get registered. So you have to be careful and see which letters in the word are missing. At times it's frustrating
4,"Keys are excellent. However, there are gaps through which dust can go in - which is NOT shown in the product images which show full keys that block dust or visibility to the insides. IF I cover with plastic, I cannot even feel the keys when typing - so a cover is useless. I am not sure if those silicon keyboard protection applies here or not - extra cost - have to seeThere is no Caps lock light or Num-Pad light. You'll have to figure out yourself. A minor nuisance especially if you are in a hurry to get work done. There is absolutely no lighting of any sort so IF you want to work in the dark - Impossible unless you're very used to the keyboard and even then it will be difficult.Wireless Is a Boon. Seeing the clutter of wires OFF my desk and the option to place the keyboard wherever I want to is a welcome addition after a long time. Typing especially is a delight. Love the Layout of the Product. Mouse is good - as expected, no major standouts there but it does its job and that is more than expected I guess. This is a purely office purpose keyboard, can be used for gaming sure but I would suggest get a proper gaming keyboard for that like Cosmic or any other that comes with customizable options and leave this one for office work alone, it will thrive.Finally - Amazon Product Page says the Keyboard was Made in India which is why I went for this product in the first but the product itself SHAMELESS advertises that its Made in China. I don't like Chinese products but if I can't help it, I'll buy it as they are imported by Indian Companies. But why falsely advertise? Yeah, I can return it, but I need it - hence the review, else wouldn't have bothered to do so."
5,keys are very soft and mouse is perfect fits in handi got is 1100 and its very niceall full size keyboard keys are availablematerial is amzingand smooth feel while typingi recommended for all laptop users this keyboard
5,"This is my second pair of the same wireless keyboard and mouse. I really like it!The mouse fits perfectly in my large hands! It's not tiny like some other wireless setsThe battery life is amazing! The keyboard battery lasted longer the 6 months with daily usage! Even the mouse battery life is pretty decent.They both look premium and good quality products.The range is sufficient for slightly better than average distance.You can always buy a usb extender for that if required!Now for the bad thingsThe keys are a little hard to press. It takes a little time to get used to it. But they are comfortable. Good travel speed and once you get used to it, it starts feeling fasterOverall great product. Would surely recommend to anyone wanting a good quality keyboard and mouse!"
1,"The key operations on the board are not properly given most important think we can't identify the caps lock option is in ON or OFF state most disadvantage and @option which is not on the key of button with 2 number. It's is present near "" option as @ which is the worst think. Remaining is OK."
2,"The name DELL sounded good enough to buy the product. Using it was never easy. I have lots of DELL products from USA but this is first time I am buying from DELL INDIA. Threw the keyboard out yesterday and got myself another one from logitech. The keys in DELL were not soft touch and when you are typing fast, at least 50% of the letters will not show up on the screen. I had to keep punching in (and not typing) so as to not miss any letter.Definitely not worth the price. If you are thinking to buy this, I wold say, think again. There are lot better products out there."
4,"the quality, ease of use, the feel everything is really good. ONly one negative is that there is function key in between the Ctrl and Alt key which is kind of unconventional and makes using Alt+Tab key a little difficult to switch between windows. If you are used to using a normal key board, you need to stretch your thumb a little bit. May be over a period of time I will get used to it. Other than that this is a very good wireless keyboard and mouse and at about Rs. 1300/- this is a good deal. I wanted to buy logitech which was a about 1,000 Rs, but the logitech keyboard did not have the front clips to raise the front side of the keyboard for comfortable hand placement. This one has the front clips."
4,"I was worried at first because there wasn't enough protection when I received this item and the Dell box was compressed when I received. Thankfully everything is fine and came in one piece.To be precise: The keyboard is smooth and precise. Wireless and it's got the basics right. You can't go wrong here. Came with the batteries too.However, two important things missing here is that:1. there's no off/on switch for the keyboard. In one sense, it's convenient cause it's like a direct plug & use. But this could affect the battery duration somehow. In case if watching a movie on the laptop, I don't have the option to switch off the keyboard during that one hour gap. The mouse has an on/off switch.2. The wireless USB adapter doesn't have any option to be stored somewhere within the keyboard or mouse. If you lose it, then this whole keyboard/mouse will become useless.I hope Dell can think further into integrating these two options into their keyboards as well.Apart from these two hiccups, this is good keyboard."
4,"IT has improved in leaps and bounds. Very easy to setup, just Plug & Play. I've used another brand keyboard and mouse (similar price range) and have struggled with response speed (not sure if that is a thing, i'm no IT professional), the keyboard had to be close to the CPU. I'm amazed as I type this review from ~3mtrs. away line of sight (even thought the dongle is connected to the back of my CPU).Ergonomically the mouse is nice and compact and easy to grip. The keyboard nicely laid out (though I now need to get used to typing on it as I'm used to a more compact keyboard, FYI - I'm already getting better at finding my way around it.)"
4,"I've ordered it during Amazon Great India sale for a little lesser price than the MRP Rs. 1399. It's working fine without a delay and I did not have to do anything to set it up, just works fine as soon as I plugged in the dongle. It comes with a single USB dongle for both mouse and keyboard. Mouse is in decent size and it will fit and palm size. It's not too small like some of the Logitech wireless mouse. Keyboard is so soft to type. I tend to press the windows key instead of Alt button may be because i'm used to my old keyboard. This comes with a Fn button to enable some additional control. Only negative point that i noticed is that, this does not have any indicator for Caps Lock, Scroll Lock or Num Lock. So we have to be little careful when typing passwords. It does not work with bluetooth to connect to your laptop."
1,"Made a mistake of relying on Amazon choice recommendation while buying this keyboard. Reason, this keyboard is badly designed one especially with function keys. A good design will be function keys F1 to F4 in group a little space and the F5 to F8 little space F9 to F12 to identify the keys easily. But this keyboard doesn't have that separation. Right above backspace key F12 key should come they messed this up by having function key. There should be a provision in mouse or keyboard to keep the usb adapter safe when not in use, like Logitech.Bought this on 15th aug, can't even return this product now, damn. Regret for not buying HP."
2,Pros:Compatible with both MAC and Windows PC.Seemless in the setup - Just plug and playMouse feels greatKey Board is adequate and weights lessComes with the required BatteriesSingle Receiver for both Keyboard and MouseThe mouse has an on / off buttonVery less noise on the Keyboard strokesCons:Keys seems very cheapThere is the visible spacing between keys and board which definitely will let in lots of dustNo Caps lock / Num lock indicator on the keyboardKeyboard not right for a person who types fast and has small handsOverall I'd just like to say it's Made in China. You make a call.
4,"Friends, this is a ready to use keyboard and mouse with a provided wireless adapter. I purchased it for use with my Samsung Tablet. Keyboard is fine and with well laid out. It has though only one LED indicator and that too for low battery. You DO NOT get any indication for Caps Lock or Num Lock and this might be an issue while typing passwords.  There is no physical key to switch off the keyboard and you might want to take out the batteries everytime for saving them.The mouse is a regular, lightweight mouse with two buttons and a scrollbar. Mouse has though an ON/OFF switch.I read somewhere that the batteries on normal usage last till 1 year. However i can't corroborate it.You get in the package two Duracell AAA batteries for keyboard and one AA size battery for mouse. In addition a wireless USB adapter is also provided. With an OTG adapter(normally provided with mobile phones, as i got with my Samsung phone) you can even connect it to your mobile also. The mouse also works great in mobile.Overall a good buy. Thx for reading.Jai Hind!!!"
4,This is completely useless mouse keybaord combo for following reasons:1. Its space bar key is away from the left most key. There are 2 keys additionally in between. This layout is not standard layout.2. Mouse is extremely noisy and drains battery even when not in use.My advice would be to go with Logitech branded combo.
3,Product is good...and works very well in initial days like for 3-4 months...But after 5-6 months key are dose not stay as smooth n soft as it works initial days (when it cam Fresh new one)In office have 2 unit of same model of Dell wireless keyboard and mouse which is almost 1 yr old but the keys become hard to press.. and it make stucking noise while typing.It dose not stay Smooth like it working in initial days...!!
3,"We cannot ask more from a wireless keyboard for a ~1100 INR.However, if you are a huge keyboard shortcut user then - beware, the apps key (for right click shortcut) is placed on top of the keyboard instead of beside the ctrl key.The spacebar is oddly placed, a littler far from left hand, making us press alt instead of space.No light indicator for num lock, caps, or scroll lock.Also, we cannot use to for long time, fingers seems to be tiring too fast on these.  Keys are a bit hard on press.Just typing this comment itself is tiring my fingers."
3,"The keyboard and mouse look great on your table, but that just about it. When it comes to ergonomics and performance it fails miserably.Let's talk about the keyboard first. It looks great with its flat keys and is extremely light weight, but once you start working on it you'd quickly notice that your fingers slip off the keys too often and you tend to make a lot of typos. The distance between the keys are also not ideal. Sometimes I also notice a bit of - albeit minor - lag during typing, which could be due to the latency introduced by the wireless link. So do not buy this keyboard if you plan on gaming - I don't.Now let us come to the mouse,  which is horrible. The mouse feet are too hard and they prevent smooth movement. I tried different surfaces including: ceramic tile, expensive mousepads, polished wood and plastic and the mouse tend to stick to all of them. In addition to this stickiness it is very laggy as well-  there is a noticeable rubber-banding. It is extremely annoying to use this mouse.I bought this for coding, and I had to switch back to a my old logitech USB keyboard. I have a mechanical keyboard but it is very heavy preventing me from taking it with my laptop."
4,"Keyboard and mouse quality are decent, but after 6-7 months of normal use, the mouse started dying all of sudden. I thought the AA battery died, so replaced with another new battery but after working for a few days it died again and then on happened frequently. Now after 9 months of use, the mouse is actually become useless, works for 5 mins and then you need to open the battery panel, remove and re-insert battery again to make it work.and there isn't a way i can claim the warranty. the product comes with 1 year warranty but thre is no way to claim it.@Amazon Please help"
3,"Well the keyboard is easy to connect and works seamlessly. I don't see a way to power off the keyboard like I can the mouse. I'm using this as a wfh device so I can keep my laptop screen propped higher. Some of the key keys I instantly miss are the mic mute button, projector shortcut button and screen brightness buttons. I see no other competing brand also providing these keys. So maybe I'm expecting too much. Now coming to what I hate, I think the keys are wobbly. They seem to be propped high on a stump and don't feel stable . They're noiser than those on my ThinkPad and far from the level of quality there. That's where this keyboard fails me. Is Chinese and sadly feels Chinese too."
3,"About usage experience - Just you would want in everyday usage, really god and keyboard is almost chiclet. Lovely.Product Quality - Really unfair!I have owned this combo for almost 2 years now but it just became faulty after 8 months of normal usage. By normal I'd say 2-6 hours a week.Initially mouse scroll became faulty but by the end of first year, some keys stopped working. By some I mean a complete diagnoal strip from Esc key down to A,S. (Esc, 1 Q,W,A,S,CapsLock,Tab). I guess this was some sudden circuit failure.NO I never mishandle my gadgets, I've been doing regular cleaning coverning when not in use etc. out of habit.Searching new combo again."
4,"Worth investment for regulars office and general use. have not tried gaming (don't play it actually). using for daily office work, normal tasks, browsing, etc., and don't see any issue. keyboard keys are silent (not pin drop but not problematic and is normal). The only thing I feel about mouse clicks are a bit noisy (yes they are not silent, if you want a silent one, go for Logitech or the other with almost double the cost). I was using the silent mouse earlier so initial this was a huge change for me but slowly got adjusted to it. can't ask for more at this price. keyboard keys are actually very good and are easy to touch (due to spaces between the keys)LED light indicator is only for the low battery I guess, Haven't seen it blinking so assuming as soon as the batteries are low, it will blink, can confirm only after seeing it.Been using this for more than a month now and satisfied."
3,"Overall OK keyboard. but if you are type very fast you may miss characters. The key hit needs to be little hard. Mouse works well. USB integrator is small enough so that you can leave it connected. Dell is US company but this product is manufactured in China. Using it for more than 2 weeks now and working well till date.---------------------Rewriting this after months of review.1. The mouse did not  stand to the standard after months of use. The mouse roller has become slippery in months and need lot of effort to slide . Logitech mouse are better in budget segment. I had no issues with logitech mouse. Given a chance I will not buy this set now. Mouse itself has visible redlight, while logitech moves with almost invisible light.Kind of ok with  keyboard but at times I miss some letters at but is ok if you get used to it. As you can figure out I will not buy Dell keyboard in future. It is not worth. Go with logitech.--------------------"
2,"Dell products seem to have lost their touch of quality as this is the second DELL product I have faced issues with within 3 to 4 months of purchase. The optical wireless mouse I'm writing about stopped working within 4 months of purchase. I'm still unable to search Amazon on how to apply for warranty claim. I did browse through Dell India website but the product is not found there upon searching. If someone has any idea on how to claim warranty for Dell products on Amazon, please help."
1,"Very bad experience. I spend most of my waking hrs in front of a computer. I purchased this almost a year back. I am writing this review now to help others planning to buy this for its ease in doing heavy duty coding. This keyboard is not the right choice for coders !!  The keys are hard to press and even after thorough cleaning, opening the casing , it simply is not smooth enough. The keys also gets stuck during coding , much to my annoyance. The mouse is also nothing to feel happy of. Overall a very disappointing deal. Since the last 6 months, I have packed it and kept it and using my earlier bought wired keyboard."
3,Pros:-Dell does a pretty good job by keeping the design clean and the chiclet keys give a great typing experience - also you get a premium feel just by the appearance!-The travel in the keys are good and the built is sturdy. Can't comment on the battery backup but there's just one indicator(battery) which probably glows only when the battery requires changingCons (some design flaws)-The letters printed on the keys are in low contrast - difficult to use the keyboard under low light.-The stands(pegs) behind which elevate the keyboard for better typing experience are rather short/small-The keys are spaced out and the arrangement of certain keys like the space bar can be positioned better. hence I won't say it's very ergonomic.-Does not give a compact feel(compare with Logitech mk215/220) and people with smaller hands might have difficulty to reach out for the keys and will need getting accustomed to.-No caps lock or num lock indicators-No multimedia keysNot too happy with the seller(Appario)- made me wait for 10days and delivered on the scheduled last date of delivery.
1,Lec light not working !!!!
1,"When you press N, it shows bn on the screen.& when you press Shift+N it shows BNNNNNN on the screen.Very bad keyboard"
3,"I had to return this due to a confusing keyboard layout.Number line right below the function keys had the numbers and special characters printed differently.Semicolon key also had the same issue.If you press Shift key to get the upper lined characters, you would actually get the lower ones.Seller should have done a quality check before sending this."
5,"Wow , was the first thing that my heart and mind felt, the moment I held the keyboard in my hand. To be very honest , keeping in consideration the selling price the product s as they say "" the value of money"" . And when I started using it for the first time , Yes , Amazon s amazing... The customer service attitude in all aspects whether that s quality of the products Amazon sells is wonderfully flawless ... and in case we sometimes return products Amazon had always been honest ...Thank you"
5,"*Palm rest , laptop Like keys,great typing experience .*In this price bracket ,there are so many options available from well established brands ,like zebronics,iball,intex etc etc .So I was sceptical about this brand ,Zinq.But i choose this product because of two major reasons  :Keys layout looks almost like a laptop keyboard .The palm rest ,which is only available in the keyboards of price 10x higher than this .After the purchase :Keys are super tactile and smooth ,too sensitive for my liking ,it will take some time to get use to it .USB port and wire are of good quality .Overall it's a great product so far . Value for money ."
4,"Lightweight keyboard. Received a good fully working product, thank you Amazon.The keys have a bit rubbery & bouncy feeling, and I found it a little uncomfortable to do fast typing with this keyboard ... after some time I am getting a discomfort on the fingertips ,,, I am taking some time to get used to the new kind of key feeedback on my fingertips.But it is a value-for-money product, not meant for the pros. You cannot expect TVS Gold - type key feedback for this price."

4,"Purchased two of these keyboards , and found them useful. There is one thing which I did not like and wanted to provide you all an update is that the keys are little bit slow for fast typing . When I try to type fast , the realise that the key which was pressed earlier has not come back yet or does not have too much pressure for second time typing within a fraction of seconds. I still feel this is a very good keyboard in the given price range. What could be improved is the key response time , the key should come back faster after typing a character on the keyboard. So finally I would like to say that this keyboard is not for professional or gaming purpose , however it is very much useful for regular browsing , sure ring and online classes. The build quality is good and the keyboard does not slip while working."
1,This keyboard+mouse combo has not lasted even for a month. Mouse has lost its sensitivity and the scroll has become completely unpredictable. Keyboard is also poor but the mouse undoubtedly leads the competition.Keyboard has the unique ability to type a character multiple times while the key is pressed only once. So entering a password at any website is the most challenging task.I am fed up with this typing adventure so I just plugged my old keyboard & mouse back to the PC to share this critic.Please use your money wisely and buy some longer lasting & reliable product.
5,"I have bought this for working from home. Since it is just a keyboard, I didn't do much research, the only research I have done was to find an Indian made product. Unfortunately, Indian made keyboards are very rare, so ended up buying this Chinese made product. Anyways, I am happy. The keys are smooth. The font is stylish. Could have avoided labeling the brand name in the space-bar."
1,The keyboard is very hard and the keys don't work if you are used to pressing them the normal way. The only way to use the keyboard is if you can hit the keys hard like old type writers. Very uncomfortable and almost useless.The mouse is of very cheap quality. The scroll button the middle doesn't work half the time and sometimes scrolls in opposite direction. Mouse buttons are very hard too.
2,"Both keyboard and mouse are noisy. Both miss keystrokes and mouse move about 1 of 5 times. This makes it difficult at times to pin point and click with mouse as it needs few extra moves to adjust. I still do not know how to use the rupee symbol as it does not have ""Alt Gr"". Maybe it needs some settings."
1,"Some of the keys of the keyboard were not working and some of the keys were repeating automatically.I was pressing once and it was typing 4-5 times. Very annoying experience.Although it wasted my time and spoilt my mood, but thanks to Amazon that it refunded me in full."
2,"Keyboard is ultrasensitive. A single key depression results in multiple characters being typed out. Not for typing purpose at all. Speed typing not possible as for every character (forget word), one needs to keep a close eye and keep correcting with backspaces and Delete button"
5,"Combo is nice, only one thing missing in the keyboard is palm rest, but considering its price it's good enough for smooth and silent typing. Decent mouse. Really love using it."
1,"Useless product. I bought it on 10/01. But it is not working from yesterday, 10/19. Worked only for like 15 days. I want replacement. I dint even use it much."
2,The keyboard is actually veey good and light weight and good to use. But when I was using it I realised there was a hole to the edge of the keyboard and found it was actually broken. So I returned it asking for a replacement. I received my replacement in 2 days and I was astonished to first see that it was the same box that I sent as I remember a small tear in the box. When I opened it there was a keyboard inside that was further broken. I can't say if it was the same keyboard or another one but how can you send a highly damaged keyboard?
5,"Value for money product, this keyboard is lightweight, easy to type, but not suitable for gaming, 5 star for this keyboard"
3,Can‚Äôt expect more from a keyboard at this price .. solves the purpose and has been performing well after 3 months of usage..The drawback however is that the key layout is old style closely stacked without the gaps between the keys which sometimes results in typing errors
3,"ü§óü§™A Good Product with no defects or malfunctioning keys, all is wellü•∞ü§ëüòÄüòùLightweight & Textured finish hence helpful in being Dirt & Dust Repellent. ü§£üòÅüòéü§©Delivered on time by Amazon. Hats off to the seller Appario, Bangalore. ü§°ü§ì"

Just Buy it. ‚ù§Ô∏è I bought these combo item in ‚Çπ469 INR only in ( Deal of the Day sell ). Delivery is also superb. Also, Amazon always deliver his best.Thanks Amazon ‚óâ‚Äø‚óâ"
5,I had very low expectations at this price point but this keyboard blew me away. This is literally one of the best feeling membrane keyboard that i have ever used
3,"Product is good. Light weight, comfortable keys. But giving 3 stars because of seller. Seller has sent the damaged piece. This is not damaged during transportation as I couldn't find the broken pieces in the box. This product doesn't have return policy. It has only replace policy. I needed this urgently. So forced to use the damaged piece."
1,"Bought this keyboard two months ago. within one month it started to work wierdly. pressing 's' would bring 'cs', right arrow works as backspace, space getting stuck randomly. a lot of stuff. really bad choice. I regret it."
5,ZINQ is net level technology. Its accessories is top class . Keys are very comfortable  like TVS keyboards.
4,Does it job without any issue.Good for the price so go for it.
5,Probably best in this range.. smooth keys and lightweight.. good value for money product.. big in size though..
5,"The key are smooth.Very good for light gaming, and typing in this keyboard is very much satisfying.If the budget too low, go for it."
5,Thnx amazon.in for such nice product delivered within 24 hours of bookingMony worthüëåüèª‚úåüòä
1,Worst product. The new one received n later found the Function keys are not working. It was my bad the return timeline was over n need to deal with such defective product. Did not expect such miss from quality by Amazon.
5,"It's a wonderful Combo in this price range 469/- rs , keyboard keys are very comfortable, keyboard is light weight & thin, best for this price range, You can blindly purchase it.!!"
5,I loved those keys and mouse is buttery smooth...In old reviews it may be bad but now they all had changed themselves and now they are sending a quality product at low budget...It satisfied my budget...
5,"Keyboard is light.All keys work, including function keys. Been using for 3 weeks, no issuesThe only con is that It's a little noisyI paid 300 for it-worth the buy."
1,"I purchased in January 2021,in may2021 it's not working, no customer service in Hyderabad, worrest keyboard, friends don't purchase this keyboard"
5,Looks beautiful and stylish in an affordable price. Hope it will work a long
4,"I am writing this review after 2months of usage, Product is in Good condition.I will recommend to buy this product and with lower cost.Don't expect smart look, it will be looking like normal keyboard."
2,Keyboard Quality is above averagebut Mouse is not good
2,Quality wise nice..soft for operating. but better to buy costly branded keyboard. With in 30fays exactly now my keyboard not working.
4,"Keyboard is very nice, light weight and long press keys are impressive.But Num lock and caps lock lights are not visible clearly in day time.Finally value for money."
2,"I had to buy another keyboard, because in this one the backspace was constantly stuck if you didn't press it exactly in the middle, that made me crazy."
4,"keyboard is good. nice typing experience. My only complain is about key placement. DELETE button is just above the arrow keys, Right SHIFT key is small, and there is no need for two ""\"" keys.  they made SHIFT key small to place ""\"" key. WHAT THE HECK? HOME and END keys are side by side and up above. Why? ZEBRONICS pls learn by seeing other keyboards. only thing i am happy about this keyboard is they did not make BACKSPACE small. if that button was also made small - i would seriously throw this keyboard to dustbin in frustration."
5,This keyboard and mouse is very comfortable forme and most importantly thing is it is supported in windows 10 pro and this thing I like too much.
3,"ok, keys r delicate n basic plastic china made product,thought zebronics was an indian co,they jst sell china products,no meant for heavy gaming, not meant 4 heavy gaming.."
1,"The mouse was defective,  scrolling was not working.Looks like some cheap Chinese product. Did Zebronics guys make this defective or the dealer sent a defective damaged piece to me purposely ? Dealer was from other state so he may not be worried of long term rapport."
2,Not Up to the mark as per the price. DISAPPOINTED after buying this. Not value for money. The MRP listed on the box is 399 but they are selling it at a higher price. Misguiding the buyer.
5,Smooth working keyboard smooth running  mouse is very sensitivity and wonderful packing packing by Amazon and thanks to Zebronic to sending a wonderful product

3,"Keystrokes are long and take a lot of effort. Typing with this keyboard is slow. You might miss a keystroke or a key maybe pressed twice. Passwords become very tricky to type without revealing them.It is not made for people who have to do a lot of typing. essentially it is for people who would like to bash their keyboard with each keystroke and then complain of pain in the fingers at the end of the day. Go for it if you desire inflamed finger joints.thankfully, it comes with a three year warranty (for the keyboard not for the fingers)"
1,Do not buy this product. The keys somehow stop working occasionally and we wont even notice because it is just a missing letter in a word. Imagine the embarrassment when we type the password and it says wrong password entered and once in a while even bank people will call us to confirm if we have tried to make a purchase. The keys have to be pressed hard to avoid any mishaps. And this is not expected from Targus. I wouldnot suggest this to anyone.
5,"This product is quite sleek and give a Laptop keyboard kind of an experience. Works well with Windows, iPad and Android devices. A Value for money product by Targus comes with 2 AAA Enegizer batteries and 3 years warranty as mentioned on box, so cheers!"
1,So I bought this keyboard as i was in hurry to have some keyboard for my iPad as well as monitor. This keyboard though has good connectivity and I have seen no issue so far with battery as well but the typing on this little thing is by far the hardest part. i know some people already complaint about this in their reviews but i thought i wont be using it alot anyways but i was wrong. I had good amount of typing requirement and this little thing huts alot. After 2-3 days of continuous usage my fingers were literally paining‚Äî part of the problem is it is not well spaced and you need to hit hard for every keystroke. I am really sad to put this review because the price is good and delivery happened really fast and well even packaging was great but this keyboard won‚Äôt get your work done.
1,"I got this keyboard after reading positive reviews. I have been using this keyboard for almost 20 days and sharing my experience. Key board is light and compact as shown in images. But keys are nasty esp the space key. I need to put pot of pressure for space key.. and if I use the same pressure on the other keys, it leads to typing multiple times. Overall, not a calibrated keyboard and if you are in IT, I won‚Äôt recommend this keyboard as you will make many typos and keep on correcting the typos, thereby bringing down your productivity."
1,"Terrible, terrible keyboard. Makes the famously bad MacBook Butterfly keyboard feel like a breeze.Sometimes, keys will not register, sometimes they will register twice or thrice. Space key is the worst. Have a complicated password? Good luck getting in on your first try.I did not trust the bad reviews and here I am repenting in less than 12 hours.1. Just don't buy this (you will thank me!)2. Mark this review as helpful so that others don't buy this."
2,"Been using it with my Macbook Pro for the last 4 months. It's super frustrating to use cause it keeps disconnecting now and then it's super randomly. Happens extremely frequently at times and it takes multiple attempts of switching the keyboard on and off to eventually get this to reconnect with my laptop. Apart from that, the spacebar isn't reliable. It gives two keystrokes with one press intermittently. Another major con would be that it uses AAA batteries and it's frustrating to always keep a stock of fresh batteries. I wouldn't buy/use this product again, just worth it to invest in a better keyboard (preferably with wired charging) and that's not this."
5,Wonderful little keyboard.The touch and feel of the keys is just perfect.Using it with my iPad and it works like a charm.
3,"So I have used this keyboard for a decent amount of time since we‚Äôre all working from home. And I needed one for work.Benefit:1. No silly dongle mess. This is a Bluetooth keyboard. Works without a hassle. You don‚Äôt really connect anything anywhere.2. Convenient. Keep your computer at a distance and use comfortably.3. Value for money. I couldn‚Äôt really find  another Bluetooth keyboard for Rs. 999.4. MacOS layout: Its layout is of a Mac, with the command button, and that‚Äôs also my work computer. So this is exactly what I wanted.Disadvantages:The keyboard is just not properly calibrated. Sometimes, you‚Äôd have pressed a button, and it wouldn‚Äôt have registered (no letter typed). Other times you‚Äôd realize that a single press registered twice (one letter typed repeatedly). Unexpected from a known brand like Targus.It works, but it annoys too. And I work in the software industry, so I type a lot."
4,"It's worth the price. I believe we should not compare this one with apple keyboard as  apple keyboard is very expensive.I have been using this since 4months now and i did not face any issues so far. I have tried many other brands but this one is comparatively good and I did not find any other better keyboards than this for mac other than apple keyboard (again it's very expensive). The main difference I found between this one and the other brands is the keyboard smoothness. If you type faster or a medium fast, this one make you feel quite comfortable.Keyboard is light weight and size is also compact. Overall its worth to buy and I hope you will like it unless you get a faulty product :P"
2,"If you are thinking of buying this keyboard for your ipad, as i had done, then please dont go for it.Yes, this keyboard might be a good one, but it was useless for me as i paired it with my ipad pro 11 inches.. Although it did get connected to my ipad via bluetooth. But the user experience with the ipad is not like using a folio keyboard. No matter what you type in your ipad, half the screen will be filled as the digital keyboard will pop up, even though you are typing with your bluetooth keyboard. So, i had to return the device, within one day.Apart from that the keys are very hard to type. Not atall a premium typing experience."
5,The keyboard layout is identical to the MacBook keyboard and quality is nice for the price you pay (offer price 999 INR). This looks perfect for a casual user and never found any issues while typing.
5,"Works perfectly fine! I love it. It is exctly the size of my Yoga travel laptop. Works perfectly fine with Windows and all keys are fucntional.Any new things needs getting used to and this is no different. The keys are fine and BT connection is stable.Observation: Since this uses BT 3.0, so the keyboard will connected to one device only and cannot switch between several devices - however, if thats not extremely important, then, this is a perfect compact keyboard. Was looking for something without the num pad.5 stars!However, the seller send me an item that was returned by another user and cleverly sealed the outer packet but it was obvious. Its sad that sellers are not true to sending brand new pieces although they charge full amount."
2,"A nice little BlueTooth keyboard. I bought it because of its nice little design and its compatibility with macOS. The only problem is that when you type, the keys don't respond as they should. If you don't type carefully, you get a double/triple keypress with one keypress, resulting in frequent typing errors, which is quite a hassle. This also causes shortcut keys to not work as they should and you are bound to make typos when typing passwords. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3,"Got this on August 23rd during the Amazon sale so pricing was great but with Targus brand I've always known that its a high quality brand. I agree with the other reviewers about not using this for long use or long emails/documents which was fine as I hooked this up to my iPad Pro but since about a week it doesn't respond too any of the letters except command + H or command + tab...deleted from Bluetooth & paired again after trying multiple things; it didn't work. Strangely it works fine on 2 other iPads but not on this iPad Pro ...and strangely my other Logitech keyboard works fine on this iPad Pro...not sure what it is exactly but cannot get it to work even with new batteries. Google Docs, Notes, Microsoft Word, Email all don't accept any text typed out of this keyboard...its just blank tho connected and paired ...allows to switch apps or go to home screen but not type...unfortunately I need it to work for this iPad itself for my son's school work !"
4,"The keyboard is lightweight making it very easy to carry around. It paired without any fuss with my phone and laptop. Also, it works on iOS devices. The range is decent for wireless use.Only thing I don't appreciate is the dough like feel of the keys; I have used Logitech keyboards before that offer a nice click on typing. This may be subjective opinion, but as I said, it doesn't suit me well.Probably for this reason, keys need to pressed firmly to register. Soft keystrokes may not get registered and thus pose as an annoyance.If you type with firm keystrokes and can live with the dough like typing feeling, this keyboard is excellent value for money product.Plus:LightPortableExtremely Easy to connect & configureGood rangeMinus:Not so satisfying tactile feedback!Hope this helps. TY"
5,"I was actually looking for a silver mac style keyboard, but all the silver ones had bad reviews so I kept checking for a few weeks. This one was the only one with good reviews, but it was around 1700. One day I checked, it was 1000. So I took it immediately. After I took it price went back up to 1700.  Is good to take time with  electronics from amazon because sellers change price often, sometimes 3000 rs difference.I m super happy with this keyboard. Works perfectly. Easy to type. I use rechargeable batteries, they last long. Sometimes a key did not work. Turned it off and on and everything is fine.Recommending it"
1,"Its the worst quality keyboard I have ever owned. Its better to spend slightly more, get another product that will last longer and wont give you so much grief.I tried to save some money and ended up spending more than I would have if I had just got a better quality one in the first place."
5,"Pair this with a wireless mouse and mount your laptop on an incline-stand or with a monitor, This keyboard is pretty good when it comes to typing. The keys press the right depth and you get a nice feedback to your fingers as well as a small sound when you are typing at speeds.Not everyone is a fan of the keyboards on the new Macbooks, and if you code/type a lot, this wireless keyboard with be a wonderful help.Just need to pair once and it will never ask you to pair it again, the on/off switch seems enough, plus it goes on standby when you don't use it for some time, so saved battery as well.Very Good Product"
5,"Well, to start with, I am amazed by the delivery speed. I ordered this at 2:15 PM and got it delivered at 4:45 PM. Can you imagine? Within 2.5 hrs!!! And, It is not a returned package, but a brand new one. Hats off!My observations:1. The keyboard is smooth and is exactly as per the description.2. Though it is not mentioned in the manual, 'Command' key does the job of the 'Windows' key.  So I don't miss out on the Windows key at all. I use it on my Windows 10 laptop, and it works like a charm.3. The only thing downside is, it works with one device at a time. However, it is mentioned in the manual. And what else can u expect from a Bluetooth keyboard worth 1,099/-?4. Targus standards are maintained.5. It just a matter of time, and you will get used to the size."
1,"Form factor is just right for use with a laptop or a desktop PC. The keys do make more noise than a regular keyboard from a big PC brand. However, the operation is smooth. For being used to and as I use Windows more often, I wanted a similar keyboard with Windows keys. This one has Mac keys, like the alt/option, command. It has the function and control key positions swapped, causing confusion for a Windows regular. I wish this same brand offered that as an option to choose at the time of buying. Also, its device entry in the list of Bluetooth devices on the PC shall show battery charge remaining as percentage. It doesn't show any, whereas the Bluetooth mouse I use does. I wish it had a second control key on the right, or the existing command key on the right could be re-configured as a control key.I had bought two units of this keyboard. The first one is working OK. The second one has following issues noticed prominently. The two units are manufactured in different months. Apparently the manufacturer is not having good enough quality checks to lead to such vagaries.After using the second unit for 3 days continuously, I found these issues:1) It can't keep up with my typing speed. Keys are skipped.2) When shift and some other key are pressed together, it misses to acknowledge the second key.3) The space key is not recognized when pressed towards its end. It has to be pressed exactly in the center.4) Key presses are not as smooth as the first unit. Keys do not travel all the way down easily, resulting in missed input while typing. Those have to be banged to get the desired output.Substandard product; Targus - you disappointed. As much as you disappointed me with the laptop bag that got torn where the shoulder strap is attached.Returned the second unit."
4,"Been using this keyboard for over a month now(I am software engineer and generally use this for coding).So far the experience has been okay. The keys have a good response, and typing isnt strenuous. They almost like a typical and good laptop keyboard. And since its not high, it has a overall satisfactory ergonomic experience.Few issues, though.Its really compact, smaller than my 14inch Thinkpad keyboard, hence gives a slightly cramped feeling at times. Dedicated Home and End keys are missed at times.And the key layout is Mac like.If you are not looking for a portable and compact keyboard, this is not for you."
4,"It is a good keyboard for the price.The feel and performance of the keys can be directly compared to a cheap 25K Dell laptop or something similar. The spacebar key does not work sometimes when pressed nearing the right/left edges, it works perfectly though when pressed from the centre.Considering the price range, I would expect this experience and would not complain much about it. If you expect a similar experience to what you get on an Apple keyboard, consider buying something better."
4,"very good product, no problem during pairing to my mac book pro 2019. all keys are recognized and works.  light weight, good feel when typing.consno back lightno caps lock indicatorprice is reduced after i purchased from 1600 to 1000 ( no way to req for moneyback)not all function keys are workingrequires two AAA batteries (enclosed in the product)"
5,"Nice robust keyboard - the Bluetooth takes couple of seconds to connect, but guess that happens for all Bluetooth devicesHowever, in terms of usage - the Alt key is in position of windows key as seen on normal windows laptop keyboard - so it takes some time for hand to set to the new configuration - additionally if you switch back to laptop keyboard then it again creates issues."
5,"I have written this review with the Targus keyboard itself to check my typing and handling with it. The keys feel nice and easy to touch, all over is a good keyboard and would rate it 5 stars.The Command key labeled on the keyboard is the 'Windows' or 'Start' key  mentioned on laptop. Alt key is the same as laptop.One thing I have noticed that the control and Function key positions are swapped on the Targus keyboard. It's not such a big change, but in some places like in google meet Ctrl+D was the button to unmute. So that might be a thing which I would get used to.Delete key works as it should. The F1 key or the Back icon I don't actually know what its function is, but on press loads up Microsoft help for keyboards on chrome.The volume keys like increase, decrease and mute work as intended.Also, the letters Q, W and E had  IOS, Android and Windows on it. Which, according to me just feels like the modes for different devices. I have also tested it out with a tablet and a phone (Both android). But don't worry, IOS should work fine too. In the end, I really love the keys and all the different functions it has. It also might my typing speed pretty fast as it takes less time to press the keys."
3,"After using with both IoS and AndroidPros1. No issue in connecting2. Very fast connecting and good range3. The product looks phenomenally good4. It automatically disconnect if not used for long duration5. All shortcuts work fineCons1. The deck starts bending right after 2 weeks2. Some keys feel like cottton, soft and non responsive3. Type errors...... Mutiple clicks, space bar is disappointment.Such issues are there. My suggestion is even if you need to spend more. Go for a Logitech. The experience is a mile ahead."
1,"I bought it to pair with my 13"" Mac, and it paired and thats when all the problems started.1. The keyboard felt a little cramped and i have to adjust my hands to get started. my hands have now started to pain after working on this cramped Keyboard.2. All keys is not working well all the time, you really have to press hard to get it work,compared to a mac.3. Frequent disconnections - not sure why they disconnect. the keyboard aftersome time. I have to wait for 30s to get the connection back. It would break, even if you are on a washroom break.4. Not all keys are mac compatible - apart from F10-F12, none of them work with FN key pressed.5. Typing lag - this product has some lag when the typing is being done. You can see the computer typing when you are actually done typing. Sometimes this can be really irritating.6. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT RETURNABLE - you can only replace this product and cannot return it. This is really the reason I am using this product, or forced to, otherwise I will have never used this keyboard.Please, DO NOT buy this keyboard if you want to have a good typing experience of you type for most of your day OR you are a programmer. You will have hard time working with it."
5,"Works fantastic with the iPad pro. No issues whatsoever. Sleek and functional. You can't get anything better for this price point. Gets the job done. The special function keys for iOS works well too. You can control volume, jump to home screen and some other features. A few functions keys don't work well, but it's the iPad and you're using this mainly to type. I'm ready to overlook the tiny drawbacks as this product is simply a winner."
5,"Bought this as a replacement to my iMac‚Äôs Magic Keyboard. I should say I was sceptical to buy anything other than the original one, but this one really changed my opinion about third party products. A great replacement indeed!Pros:1. It has the Mac layout with command, option and function keys.2. It‚Äôs too lightweight, feels premium as well.3. The connectivity is so good, the initial setup itself happened within minutes!4. The price need to be mentioned here, cuz the original one costs a bomb and this just works perfectly!Cons:1. There are no brightness or sound control buttons.2. The connection goes off when we don‚Äôt use the keyboard for a while (looks like they added this feature to save up battery), and this can be a problem for some people.3. The keys have a plastic feel to it which I‚Äôm not a fan of."
4,"I have been using this keyboard for the past 6 months. I must say this is a really good keyboard for the price. I brought it during the sale. so the cost was below 1000. If you have the budget go for Logitech.I brought this keyboard mainly for size. I have a full-sized keyboard but it takes most of my desk space. This is excellent for my desk space.I don't have much experience with other keyboards but this keyboard is okay for typing. not as good as full-sized keyboards.Now the problem I faced!!I misread multi-platform as multi-connection when I bought this device.  Even though on the Q,W,E keys it is written ios, android, windows, device switching is not possible. It even says that on the quick guide given in the box. So it was kind of misleading. I have to pair the device again to use it, which is inconvenient for people using multiple devices at the same time."
2,Though the overall product worked fine in last 10 months. The battery is still working fine since the time I installed the batteries.Typing on this keyboard is wonderful and will give you amazing key feedback. Keys are very smooth and you can type really fast. Atleast have a fair speed of 60-90 wpm and it works great.BUT but but..... My keyboard is not functioning properly now. Whenever I type a character it keeps typing the same character infinitely and never stops. I tried replacing the battery with Duracell but it is still the same. This is the issue I'm facing right now. I have contact the Targus customer support and they are responding quick to resolve the issue. Let's see if the replace my keyboard.I will edit the review again.
5,"I have been wanting to try using a keyboard for my MAC for some time but the Apple keyboard is too damn expensive. Bought this after a long search. Device works wonderfully. There are issues occasionally with regards to data appearing slowly on the screen, etc, but cant get everything for the price. We can buy a couple of these for the cost of buying the original one from apple."
2,"Since the day I bought the keyboard, it has a problem of repeating keys while typing. You can not type anything while this is happening. I could not return the product cause I made the mistake of throwing out the packing.The good thing about the product is that it's really lightweight and auto connects to the last connected device when powered on.The Bad thing is that the product is defective so my money is wasted.P.S: It took me almost 15 mins to type everything above, thanks to the repeating keys feature of this keyboard."
4,"Hi,I took this keyboard since its very sleek and based on reviews on Amazon. Its bluetooth enabled so no need to worry about wires and all. Its very thin and light weight, keypads are very smooth. I have been using this keyboard from more than 6 months for daily office work.The problem Im facing now is that if dust goes inside the letters, those keeps pressed. For this you might have to turn upside down and tap the keyboard.Now and then the keyboard stops responding to the laptop, then i have to remove the device and again add the device to my laptop.These are the 2 problems which I see"
1,"This review is typed with the Targus keyboard.This Targus keyboard delivers extremely poor. Keyboard. Accuracy. Don‚Äôt recommend this for anyone who types at reasonable speeds. The space bar presses twice with a single keystroke (and my iPad converts the double space into a full stop, check out the multiple instances in the sentences. Above). The same issue exists with some other keys as well.To add to the misery, I got a broken piece to begin with. I waited for the replacement for a week but got this experience."
1,my experience after buying this for my ipad mini 4 & for iphone xr.  it is not working. you have to press the keys very hard or the response of ipad and iphone is very slow. i purchased first and found this issue and replaced and again found the same issue. though it has very good reviews could be for windows or android.  ios people pls care. sometime it is onky replacement not return
4,"The travel of the key is satisfactory. It's very light and portable. I have been using it for a couple of months and the battery hasn't run out so that's good. They are a bit noisy but that's okay with me. Had a dedicated command key, so that's good for mac usersThe pairing needs to be more fine-tuned... It takes a couple of seconds after turning on to connect and work.Switching between devices is not as smooth.Lastly, long-pressing keys doesn't work. ( Eg: To delete a sentence, you have to rapid tap backspace and can't just hold it down )  but I'm not sure if it configurable..."
4,"This product is very good and useful. No need to separately connect the wireless receiver to the laptop, it just gets paired directly with the laptop. If u leave it idle for sometime and suddenly start type then the respose will be slightly delayed (not more than 2 to 3 secs). Typing comfort is good, I was mainly looking for a compact one, shouldn't occupy space, with no loud sounds while typing - This fulfilled my requirement. I am happy with this product."
2,"Though the size and placement of keys is exactly similar to that of a Macbook air 2018 model, the keys are hard to press. They require more effort to press and if you type a lot- your fingers will starr hurting after a while.Spent 18 hrs with this keyboard - I just wish it had softer keys.Edit: I bought Logitech k380 for Rs. 3000 and I am 100% satisfied with that keybaord for Mac, it is just awesome and I wish I hadn't brought this one"
5,"I have been looking for a portable keyboard that I could carry around with my ageing MiPad tablet so that I could type papers on the go at coffee shops or in the library without having to lug around the weight of a full sized laptop. My search began with many brands that I saw tech reviewers showcased most of which were way too expensive or not even available in India. I narrowed down to a few Logitech keyboards and I am of the opinion that Logitech makes some of the best PC accessories. The K480, K380, and the newer K375s were the ones I had my eyes on.Build Quality:It is build really well although it is made of plastic, there is nothing to worry about the build. If you have held the K480, it is pretty much the same build, and not very different from the K375s. It seems it can take some rough usage, in my opinion. (Disclaimer: This does not mean you don't take care of the device at all.) The construction of the keyboard is solid.Battery life:I haven't had the keyboard long enough to give my personal opinion on it, but the reviews online do say that it lasts for months and I don't see a reason to disagree. It takes two AAA batteries to be powered which is easily user replaceable when the batteries they come with are depleted. I'd like to see a micro-USB charger with built in batteries for the next iteration of this keyboard as this is my only gripe with it.Form Factor:The K380 is by far the smallest and the most portable of the lot. A more comparable one in terms of form factor would be the K810 which is priced substantially higher than the ones mentioned earlier. The K480 and K375s are decent alternatives to this keyboard if portability isn't your first priority. The K480 has a built-in cradle to hold your device which was tempting to me, but I preferred the portability of the K380. The K375s has a full num-pad too, so it is the least portable of the lot which is not to say that it is not portable. It is quite portable too. So choose what functionality you'd like and pick the one that suits you.Typing Experience:The keys of the K380 are round as can be seen from the pictures which may seem odd to some since most keyboards have square keys. This is probably an attempt by Lenovo to make it look retro which may be off-putting to some. Aesthetics is not something I am going to share my opinion on, but I can say that the keys are almost as comfortable as the ones on the MacBook Air which is saying a lot since MacBooks are like the gold standard when it comes to keyboards. The round keys do not in any way hinder the typing experience, it remains the same as on normal keyboards if not better. The key travel is also tactile and not shallow which provides for a better typing experience. All in all, the typing experience is as good as on the MacBook Air, maybe even better.Compatibility/Connectivity:The connectivity is really good. It is compatible across all devices in the mainstream market including Windows, Mac, Android and iOS. If you are worried about compatibility, don't. You'll be just fine. The pairing process is as simple as pressing on of the yellow buttons on the top left. You can pair upto 3 devices at a time and switch seamlessly between them (this is a feature that exists in the K480 and K375s as well). This is one of the USPs of the keyboard. In a scenario where you have to type on multiple devices, this is a blessing to have. Take for instance, I could type this review on my laptop while I have my paper open on the tablet which I have to type too, and moreover I could reply to my texts on the phone without having to move my hands away from the keyboard as long as I have all of them paired up. Switching to devices is as simple as pressing on the corresponding yellow button on the top left of the keyboard.Pricing:Having read the review, if you are convinced you want one. The pricing could be another factor that helps you decide. I got the laptop for ~1200 which is a steal and as low as I've seen the price drop, so if that's the price you are seeing right now, I'd ask you to go for it without any hesitation. But if the price is ~1500, you can take your time to deliberate upon your decision. If it is around ~2000, please wait for the prices to fall.For the price range of ~1500, this is the best portable keyboard, hands down.Please do hit the ""helpful"" button if this helped."
5,"It‚Äôs very good looks wise & also buttons are round shaped. Typing is not great but it‚Äôs good enough. You can connect 3 diff devices seamlessly with just the press of a button. Light weight. I‚Äôm using it for my mobile, IPad & laptop as well. Works smoothly with all the devices. Bit a pricey, but u can get it at low price in lighting deals or festive sales. Go for it & you won‚Äôt regret. Thank you. If you find this review helpful plz appreciate it by liking the review. -Sri Tech Guy."
3,Connects very easily and functions very well with very low power consumption. It is also remarkably quiet and can be used in crowded environments without disturbing others. However:1) It is remarkably heavy.2) The keys have very little play and so you tend to miss keys if you are not very careful.3) The four friction studs on the bottom are fixed with an adhesive that runs and oozes even at ambient temperatures of ~ 30 degrees. I have to soak up the runny glue with powder almost on a daily basis.4) Too small for comfortable and fast two-handed typing.
5,"Another amazing product from Logitech. A very good delivery by amazon too. It arrived 2 days earlier than the estimated date, which surely made me more excited to open the package. The package itself had nothing much. On unboxing the package you'd find the keyboard wrapped in plastic and a yellow instruction sheet. It comes with 2 AAA batteries pre-included. All that needs to be done is remove a small yellow paper between the battery and it's connector which was done for to preserve the battery life. Once removed it only needs to be switched on from the left side. The sides have no other button apart from the on/off switch.Pros:1. Compact layout.2. Portable3. Good tactile feel4. Multi-devices support (Upto 3  devices)5. 2 Years Battery6. 10 Shortcut keys7. Rubber soles keep the keyboard sturdy8. Good build though it is made of plastic.Cons:1. No Num Pad2. No Caps Lock led3. No back-lit keyboard4. Cannot raise it's height5. Logitech Flow does not support tabletsDetailed Review:Layout:Its a TKL Layout (Ten Keys Less). This means that it is not a full sized keyboard. The number pad on the right is not available. If you punch in a lot of numbers on a daily basis, you may want to re-think this keyboard. I feel that part missing too. In case that is important, you may want to look at the Logitech k780. Many sellers try to sell it way over MRP.There is no option to elevate the height. You will need to manage with the given height. Check pic 3 for a reference. The low height gives it more of a laptop feeling.It has some nice shortcut keys on top. Home, Open Applications, Menu, Return, Media Buttons (3), Volume Buttons (3) and a Del key. However, there are no keys for brightness. The shortcut panel comes very handy for me especially for the tablet and mobile connections. The Fn keys could be used by pressing the fn button along with the shortcut keys. Would be better with a fn lock mechanism for those who use fn keys often.On the top left are the 3 light blue buttons for switching to another device.The caps lock does not have an led which is a minus point. It certainly helps knowing that it is on while using it or if accidentally clicked.As it is compatible with Windows, Apple and android, you'll see some commands related to those OS in the same button which is quite convenient.It does not have a back-lit keyboard which makes it difficult to use in low light environments. If that is important try looking at the Logitech MX Keys. I have not been able to find it in India during the COVID-19 pandemic. Would love to upgrade to it once it is available though. Surely would match perfectly with my Logitech MX Master 2S mouse.The beautiful blue layout otherwise is very simple and elegant. Perfect for my taste.Keystrokes:One concern that many have is that each key is circular as opposed to the regular squared ones. However it does not really impact the typing experience. On the first day one may make a few typing mistakes but soon thereafter you'll be used to the circular shapes and it'll be a smooth experience. The arrow keys are smaller than what I am used to.The tactile feeling is very nice. Though it is tactile there is a decent amount of 'pressing' which gives it a good feel as per my taste. Navigating around the keyboard is very simple due to the fact that it is small in size.Price:Logitech's official website in India prices it at INR 3,195/-. Maybe the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the supply of these keyboards due to which I had to wait for a long time before it was even available. Once it was, it was being sold at 8k+. I waited everyday for weeks till Appario Retail Private Ltd. sold it at MRP without waiting for a discount. Right after I bought it, it became unavailable again. Glad I got it at the right time.While reading reviews I noticed many people saying they got it at INR 2k or even 1.6k. This was during the pre-COVID-19 times when supply-demand was on par. Now the supply is way lesser. I did check a few big stores in and around my area but they had no stock. They checked their city-wide supply, but no stock anywhere. I really needed it because I have been at home for months in 2020. Using a laptop, iPad and a phone. Every time I changed my device I had to use a different keyboard. The multi-device keyboard feature is the main reason I bought this. I was torn between the K380 (this) and K780 (K380 + Num Pad). I would prefer the K780 due to the Num Pad which I tend to use a lot and definitely miss on this one. K780 was being sold at 13k and I am not willing to overpay that much for it. I ultimately settled for the K380 when I saw it at MRP. If you are looking for one during this pandemic, do not wait for a discount. Getting it at MRP is a good deal. But if it is the post pandemic time and it is always available then one could wait for a good sale.Multi-device connectivity:The crux of the review. A feature that made me buy this. It has NOT disappointed! I am using a Dell laptop, iPad 7th gen and an Android phone. Switching from one device to the other is just one click and a second later, you are good to go. While some way consider me lazy for this, that is far from reality. Doing this is just very convenient. Even when I am far from the laptop, like on my bed, I can easily type from a distance without having to move. Okay, I maybe a little lazy!So far I have faced no issues with the connection with multiple devices. On my android phone I do face an issue when I connect the K380 and the Logitech MX Master 2S mouse. Maybe because android does not do well with switching multiple Bluetooth devices. Other platforms have no issues.Logitech Flow:K380 is one of the keyboards that support the Logitech flow. A brilliant feature! I have not had the opportunity to use it so far. Once I do, I will update it here.Caution: Flow  works only on Windows and MacOS. It does not work with tablets/iPads or mobiles. This is a big bummer for me. I did try to contact Logitech about this, they make no promises to look into it and just ask us to keep looking at their newsletters for any updates in the future. There are reddit pages on the same and many other forums including Logitech's Support pages where users have requested for this feature. Hope they are able to upgrade the Flow to include tablets in their next update.Including Flow for tablets would make this keyboard a solid 5-star!Battery:Logitech claims that the 2AAA batteries would last 2 years! That is long.. I obviously have not used it enough to comment on that. I haven't even used it for 2 whole days!! However there is no reason to doubt their claim. Even if it lasts 1.5 or 1 year, I don't mind that, unless it goes off mid flight, or if I am on an island with no battery shops close by. But what am I doing there with a keyboard right? So should be fine. The regular times just a quick battery replacement and we are good to go for another couple of years.Have I covered it all? I guess so. I usually do not write such lengthy reviews but this one is for a keyboard and I just wanted to see how it would feel through the long review.Verdict: A happy techie enjoyed writing this knowing he got a great keyboard. Though it misses out on the Num Pad, a back-lit keyboard and Flow for tablets, it still feels great for all the features it's got!"
5,"I waited for this particular keyboard for about 6 months to be available in Blue Colour. The price in which I got is 3054/-.. So, I'll judge it by this price (if you can get it in cheaper price, even better).So,,, coming to pros and cons:Pros:1. Very very soothing experience to type on a rounded key. First I thought that I won't even like it that much, but now I love it.2. The key sounds are really quiet. Won't bother your roommate while late night essay writing or when in a library. But the sound of the keys are unique - more like a chicklet sound.3. The support for iOS, MacOS, Windows and Android is great. The dedicated 3 buttons on top lets you switch between three devices instantly (time delay while  switching next is about 3-4 seconds.)4. iOS keys are working flawlessly. Home button, screenshot etc..Now, the CONS:1. The keys are a little bit on harder side, not for touch typing like macbooks.2. Caps lock has no lights. So, you never know when you accidentally pressed Caps lock.3. Problem in connecting with Linux OS - Lubuntu. Couldn't even fix it.4. The left and right arrow keys could have been full size as it has enough space. But they put smaller keys anyway.5. Warranty 1 year only. Logitech usually gives 2-3 years of warranty. But considering it a premium keyboard they should have given 2 years warranty at least.The Cons are not much of a deal breaker. So, if you want it for iPad/Laprop/any other device except Linux, then go fot it. No problems at all."
5,"This is an amazing keyboard. I had recently got a 4k Monitor for my Macbook Air 2015. It supports is quite well in the clamshell mode (when the native LCD screen of the macbook air is turned off and only 4k display is being driven via Displayport)... However to work in clamshell mode, we need an external mouse and keyboard. I tried the wired alternatives and the wireless ones with dongles and they take up all the available ports. I cannot connect my audio interface if all USB ports are occupied just for mouse and keyboard. So I decided to get this keyboard and Logotech M557 mouse.This is an amazingly well built mouse. It weighs a respectable 500grams (feels well built from the inside but the outer shell is plastic).Pros:1. The key travel is better than the keyboard on macbook air.2. The keys have stronger feedback and weight to them.3. Keys are almost the same size as the Macbook Air.4. You can wake Macbook Air with this keyboard or the mouse.5. All function shortcuts work perfectly, media buttons, volume, app expose etc.6. There's absolutely no lag in the keystrokes and my typing speed seems to have improved (Attached image). My average speed used to be 75 to 80. With this keyboard, it's gone up above 80. Loving this keyboard and the feedback on key strokes.7. Easy pairing.Cons:1. It could've been a little wider.2. Could've been made of metal (But that's just whishful thinking). For the price of 1600. I believe it's a very good investment in keyboard.3. The arrow keys could've been bigger (but we don't use those as often).4. Caps lock could've had led indicator.5. Missing Home, Pageup, Page down keys (But they're also missing on Macbook air's keyboard)Overall, it's an excellent purchase for 1600. I saw that this was being sold a year or 2 ago for around 1200, I could've bought it then, but even at 1600 I think it's worth the price.Perfect swiss quality from logitech.Update: 24/3/2018My highest achieved speed on this keyboard is 121 wpm. (refer to screenshot). I can't believe that this bluetooth keyboard can compete with some of the best wireless mechanical keyboards out there."
3,"Pros:1. Very easy pairing and switching between devices2. Compact, easy to carry and the pink colour looks better in person than in pictures.3. Matte finish.4. Least amount of noise while typing.Cons (According to my personal taste)1. Coming from the 2013 Macbook Air model, the keys are inferior:  a. The feeling of keys is not smooth but rough. Not made with the material which feels good to touch.  b. The Command, Option, Ctrl, Space and Arrow keys are of bumped up shape (concave but protruding outwards) rather than concave having depth like other keys.  c. You have to apply more weight and force to type. They are not soft like that of MacbookAir's.2. Ctrl and Fn keys have replaced positions. Fn (which is useless) is closer to the Option key instead of Ctrl3. NOT a backlit keyboard! (Biggest Con)Conclusion:Overall disappointed. The typing experience is average. Quite lower than the experience you get on older generation macs.Buy if: Looking for a portable, easy wireless keyboard for connecting with any devices.DO NOT Buy If: You are planning to increase the typing experience from your Macs while having the benefits of being wireless."
5,"This is one of the best wireless keyboard out there with the fabulous easy pairing and switching between Windows and Mac devices.This is light weight, small, compact and slim. Just the way i needed my keyboard to be.Its battery operated and hence works with 2 AA batteries which i have not changed in a month since i bought it. So i am assuming it will last for another atleast 4-5 months.It can pair with 3 different devices at the same time and the pairing is just so easy. In my opinion this one is better than K 480 which is heavy and bulky. Not the one for me. The body is made of plastic which is still sturdy and does not feel cheap and flimsy. Obviously you can‚Äôt compare it with Apple Keyboard as its aluminium made bu then if you are ready to shell out 10k for it, well go for it. I bought this Logi for 2895 which is a great price keeping in mind the build quality and usage of this keyboard."
5,"K380 is an older model from Logitech, but it still handily beats the newer models from this company or its competitors. Couple things that were important considerations for me:‚ÄîSize: As you know, this is ‚Äúcompact‚Äù which means the keyboard is designed to take up as little space as possible. For this reason, I was hesitant while ordering because I didn‚Äôt want to be cramped while typing. I have an ancient Logitech full size keyboard (wired), and I wanted the type-feel to be similar with any new wireless one I buy. But guess what, K380 is better: surprisingly, the dimensions of the actual alphabet key console is nearly identical to the full size one. Meaning, all parts of the full size that I almost never use‚Äîthe side num panel for example‚Äîare gone in this one. In other words, it‚Äôs ‚Äúcompact‚Äù not because they‚Äôve compromised on essential space, but because K380 gets rid of non-essential stuff (as I‚Äôm not an accountant or work in a bank, I really need only need a keyboard to write things‚Äîso every key I need and use is included: alphabets, top row of num keys & special symbols, no more, no less).‚ÄîColor: I‚Äôd have normally picked a darker shade, but the only color in stock was the rose. I thought twice about this, because the pictures show a somewhat louder shade of rose than I was willing to go for. But in actuality the shade is so subdued that I think I prefer this over the other options, in stock or out of stock.Bonus: the circular shape of the keys reminds me of a vintage typewriter, which I also liked."
5,"So I bought the Logitech k480 before getting this one.The device was great, rugged, but weighed more and was less portable.I already have a Logitech Pebble mouse so the only logical thing to do was return the device and get K380.I got it today, and so far I really like this keyboard.My purposes to solve are designing, programming, and basic gaming.This device solves all of them and with grace with the added advantage of being portable much.The only hiccup I have so far is getting used to the smol keys.To which I am certain I will get conscious soon.Thanks."
5,"One Hell of an experience using LOGITECH KEYBOARD & LOGITECH PEBBLE MOUSE.Turned my IPad 6th Gen 128 gb into a beast LAPTOP lite.Coupled with APPLE PENCIL,the productivity has gone up by a notch.Ideal for students,medicos,bloggers .Touch sensitivity of mouse is brilliant.The keyboard is one of the best I have ever seen or used.& the look and feel is brilliant.I recommend every IPad users to buy these two.10/10"
5,"My initial impressions were that the keys are too small (still getting used to it). But it's a great keyboard. As you keep using, you get used to the new size and shape of the keys. Doesn't take too long to get used to it.I really enjoy using it along with my MX Master mouse. Initially I didn't know there was the option to link a device with the Logitech Flow so I'd keep typing into the wrong screen and send by mistake send messages to random people because I'd be in a hurry to push enter before I realise what I'm doing. So beware if you have multiple computers in front of you. Though linked along with the flow feature of the mouse, it's beautiful. Almost always I know that if my mouse is on one screen, the keyboard is connected there as well.I just wish I could've bought it slightly cheaper and also if I could customise more of the function keys to mimic what the laptop has easily. eg: I haven't been able to find the brightness up/down customisation on Windows (weirdly it's available on the Mac).Despite whatever downsides, I really love my easily accessible and somewhat ergonomic desktop setup with this keyboard."
3,"The biggest strength of this model keyboard is its sturdy build and compactness. Sure you can appreciate it for the premium paid but it should serve the purpose of us built for. As a keyboard it is just average... I tend to miss a few key strokes while typing on it. Missing End,Home,PgUp/Down is a disappointment as I realised how important they are only when I started using this keyboard without those keys. Also the keys are a notch small and cramped... Well it's a compact keyboard, what else to expect.Connection to laptop, mobile on Bluetooth is really fast and doesn't miss a stroke.This keyboard is ideal for those who care too much about a good looking keyboard in their desk and have just few typing needs. Like... to type login, forms, search phrases while browsing etc.For those who got to get productive work done with lot of typing etc. Avoid this one. The design is not meant for heavy usage."
5,"This is a brilliant keyboard. The build quality, the design are top notch. The size is very comparable to the size of my Dell XPS 15 keyboard, which is a nice thing. The keyboard feels heavy which is again good because while typing the keyboard stays in place - the rubber feet are also soft and grippy which couple with the weight works very well.The typing experience on round keys is bit different. You need to get used to it. I took 2-3days to get comfortable. Once you get comfortable, its a breeze to use.It shifts connectivity to various devices from a tap of a button in under 3 seconds.I bought it for ‚Çπ 2499, otherwise its sold at a premium because its in huge demand. If you are eying for it and is within 3K range, just buy it.Otherwise I was looking at the Thinkpad trackpoint Keyboard II which is even more better, but currently not available in India."
5,"This replaced a 10 years old Apple Wireless Keyboard and the transition has been super smooth and lovely.The keyboard feels very well-weighted - neither too light and not at all heavy. The four non-slip thin bushes at the corners are gripping the table beautifully - the keyboard won‚Äôt slide around at all.Next - the typing feel - BEAUTIFUL and butter smooth. Keystrokes are super quiet, like they are damped or something. The key travel is pleasurable and very comfortable. There is enough feedback from the keys and they are not stubborn when pressed nor are they too light or too springy - great calibration. There is a comfortable slant built into the shape of the keyboard without the need for foldable legs.The circular keys are well-sized and spaced. The keys have a very slight inward dip which I believe is contributing heavily to the typing comfort and joy.The major reasons to pick K380 over K480 (older, slightly less expensive) were the smaller size, lesser weight and overall better design for my liking. And also the fact that even though the K480 has the dock/slot to keep tablets or phones, which is indeed a smart feature, most tablets will be used with protective covers which may not fit into that slot and also most covers or cases support magnetic or other ‚Äústanding‚Äù features anyways.Connectivity - easy, straightforward Bluetooth pairing. Can ‚Äúremember‚Äù 3 devices at any given time (can be ‚Äúconnected‚Äù to only 1 device at a time though) and can switch between them instantly with the press of the dedicated three coloured keys at the top. The switching is implemented beautifully - takes only 1 second and maybe a few milliseconds to switch between the paired devices. There are tiny indicator lights above the three bluetooth device switching keys which light up for a few seconds when connected to a device and as a nice touch, they go out with a fade-out/theatre dimming effect! Little details.Design - it‚Äôs sleek and beautiful. Perfect blend of playful and serious. Dark Grey colour looks very good.It‚Äôs almost the same size as the Apple Wireless Keyboard.1 thing to note - when connected to MacBook Pro, you don‚Äôt get to adjust screen brightness using the keyboard as those keys are marked for Bluetooth device switching. But you can adjust volume, music controls and mission control from the keyboard just like on Apple keyboard. This is not at all a major issue.The physical on off slide switch is good. Auto sleep/power off feature avoids the need to use the on off switch daily.Overall, thoroughly satisfied and even delighted with the keyboard. Grateful for Logitech to be making excellent products at great value price points.Using an external keyboard and mouse, along with a raised stand for the laptop can VASTLY improve the experience of regularly working on laptops without the need to think of desktops. Best of all worlds."
5,"PROS:1. Let size not fool you! It's a full fledged keyboard in a very compact layout. Perfect for ipad or android tablet users and people who type on the go.2. There's very little flex and the keyboard is well built.3. It's silent enough to be used inside a quiet library4. You can easily switch between 3 devices.5. The typing experience is satisfying. The round keys are ergonomic and have good travel.CON:1. The keyboard isn't backlit. And at this price point I wouldn't expect the same.MY TAKE: I had the option to choose between the k480 and k380. The k480 is heavier with a cradle to hold the device and it's not very portable. Since i use a foldable cover which can make the ipad stand in landscape mode, I wouldn't need one. So I went for the lighter and sleeker k380. No complaints so far, it's working as expected."
3,I've been using the product for my everyday work for the post 5-6 months and I consider it an average performer for the below reasons:1. Battery Drainer - There arises a need to replace the batteries every month as it is power heavy. (Use Duracell as it seems to last longer)2. Subject to frequent disconnections - Gets disconnected from pairing eveytime and I have to toggle the power switch everytime to get it paired it with my pc.3. Bad placement of power switch - At times I forget to switch off the keyboard after work (and it drains battery) as the switch is placed on the side and away from my angle of perception.
4,"For low to medium use, and if one of your priority is looks, than there is no better option than k380.I am going to use it as my companion for surface pro whose keyboard stopped working. I am barely going to use it as I don't use surface as primary device.Regarding keyboardBuild guality : 5/5Nice key travel, Matt finish, I hate glossy plastic cheap products so this is very likable.Weight and size: ideal if you are going to use it with Laptop or tablet. I don't like full size keyboard they are bulky and ugly. K380 is nice and small but have some heft so it doesn't wobble while typing.Looks: I had already decided I was going to buy this no matter what because this is one of the best looking keyboard in under 3k. So go for itPrice: I know people have grabbed this in less than 1500, but I couldn't wait for the deal. I purchased in full price of 2900, but still I am fine with that. It's worth the price tag.Verdict : Very nice keyboard for low to medium use. Not for programmes or documents creation regular work."
5,"Works as advertised, easy to use.pros:1. compact design.2. build quality is top-notch, its feels really sturdy.3. keypresses are satisfyingly tactile and key travel is very good.4. for a compact keyboard the ergonomics are surprisingly very good and I didn't have very little mistypes.5. great alternative for a mac keyboard.cons:1. I expected the keyboard to be a bit lighter for its size.2. Doesn't have backlight.3. doesn't have indicators for caps lock other buttons."
4,"Given the current scenario, I have started using my old desktop a lot more for WFH than I used to.The keyboard it had was an ageing K480 which was proving to be a little unergonomic and they keys had started to get a little bit sticky.Having heard a lot about how mechanical keyboard are suposed to the next best thing after sliced bread, i decided to get a HP mechanical with blue switches.As nice as the tactile feel of the mechanical was, I soon realized it was not for me as I would make one too many typos while using it.This keyboard was rated as one of the best picks by rtings and wirecutter - I took a gamble on it expecting it to be very similar to the K480.Was I wrong and how - this thing is a lot smaller and lighter.More importantly , the keys have a much nicer short throw and feel - and while it may not feel as nice to type on vs the HP mechanical, my typing speed and accuracy are far better on this..If you do not need a number pad and would prefer a small KB, don't look any further"
5,"This keyboard is super small and compact. This does not take up much space on your work desk and can be easily carried at anyplace you go.The Connectivity is super easy and quick. You just need to setup devices once and you are good to go. There is button to turn it ON/OFF making it easy to save battery.The color , buttons and aesthetics of the keyboard is very chic and gives a fresh look to the keyboard.It might not be suited for people looking for ergonomic comfort.Overall I am in love with this compact keyboard. It gives a good vibe to my current work from home setup."
5,"This keyboard is really great when it comes to portability and multi-device support. The keys are good and the build quality is also amazing. This is a great product for those looking to have a complete wireless setup. Battery life is also great as is the case with most logitech keyboards and mouse. You can literally leave it always on and still have lot of batery left. Comes with 2 AAA batteries which is good. The Rose gold colour is close to the color of the iPAD hence it matches my overall theme too.......Really happy with the product.......Nothing like this in this price range.PROS - Great connectivity for multiple devices - Connects like magic and switches between my iPAD and windows laptop - Able to connect keyboard mouse and headphone all together with my laptop or iPAD so this helps in having a complete wireless setup for eveything. (I also didnt' think it might work. but it worked) - Really slim and quite keypresses no tatcial sound. key travel is little less than average windows laptop but better than any macbook üòãCONS - not that great for ergonomics, specially it has no adjustable tilt. hence you only get one typing angle. tho you can easily make some adjusts on your own to get an angle of choice."
2,"I am not gonna right lengthy review but must say ,Well, keyboard is pretty Nice in terms of look and feel , portability and of-course compact. People who are gonna buy , they will know that know nums key are there so no negative review on it.The only Cons i see that with the spacebar which is that you gotta press almost in middle to put the space bar, which may quite annoying specially when you are programming are typing very fast.and yes Battery is no where gonna last for 2 years as I am using is since last 7days and its already 95 %. I do have  Logitech M590 having single aa battery but It is still at 100% though i am using sincelast 2 month which is awesome.P.S : I dont see no wireless/bluetooth keyboard in the world that has RGB back-light : D , so no negative review for the sameUpdate: This keyboard really has space issue, do not recommend for pragrammer or for heavy use."
5,"I bought this product a few weeks back. I was looking for a wireless keypad with dimensions similar to the laptop keypad and with keys as light and responsive as the ones you get on high-end laptops. I've absolutely satisfied with the product and it meeting my expectations. In terms of weight, it is slightly heavier as compared to the plastic keypads from other brands, but I don't mind it since I use it for home office purposes and not for travel. The build quality is absolutely top-class, key-travel is very less and the round-shaped keys are gorgeous to look at and easy to use. For anybody looking at wireless key-pad to unclutter the desk, I would highly recommend this product. This product is slightly expensive as compared to cheaper plastic ones available in the market, but the quality difference is immense and covers the differential cost."
5,"Value for moneyFound better than expectedBeautiful premium lookYou will not be disappointed.I use it with my laptop, ipad, iPhone, and android phone. Works well with all devices.3 devices at a time are connected and can switch between three with just one key press."
5,"Till now I was using Targus KB55. While that wasn't bad, off late the keys in Targus have been going a bit soft and sometimes unresponsive. Didn't want to shell out huge bucks for magic keyboard. Decided to give this one a shot and I must say I'm pleasantly surprised. The slim layout, key response/travel, connectivity, and customizations is amazing. If you're looking for a budget mac keyboard, this is it!"
5,"It appears like a vintage type writer with circular keys. The key stroke is also comparatively harder than laptop keyboards. It is really handy, small, fits into a small laptop bag. Coming to the function, the 3 device Bluetooth connection feature is awesome. A special mention, it has shortcut keys for android and apple, which includes, home button undo, screenshot, and many more. I am really enjoying this keyboard and hats-off to the Logitech's logical idea.However, I started using it yesterday only. I will update my review within an year with any cons if I find. Happy multi-tasking!!!"
5,"This is a great device. The feel, the key travel, the portability and ease to use and connect. its just an flawless experience. No doubt its bit pricy but that what you have to pay for an quality product. Its sleek small and fits in any where. It looks bigger in picture . but actually its too portable and comfortable to carry anywhere and use.I am writing this review using the same. I received it today. If any glitches I will update the post.But for now I am experiencing an awesome typing experience. If you are in market looking for an Bluetooth keyboard just go for it. Nothing can get better than this."
2,"I bought this product after being disappointed by the K840 which had connectivity issues with my Mac Book Air 2020 model.Initially, the product connected quickly and was working well. I used it along with the apple mouse and it still did not have issues.Issues started arising when I connected my laptop to another screen using the USB C Hub. The keyboard got disconnected and has never worked properly when I connect a secondary screen to my macbook air.As soon as I connected my airpods to the Mac, the keyboard went crazy and started typing things on its own and since then I haven't been able to use the keyboard. It doesn't pair with my mac unless I restart the mac.The return time window passed since i recently purchased a new set of airpods and now I am stuck with a keyboard that goes bonkers if connected to the laptop. Very disappointed with the purchase. I wish there can be any resolution to this.As of now, i am back to using a wired keyboard that works perfectly with the airpods connected and the secondary display. There are too many wires on my desk. :("
5,"While a bluetooth keyboard is primarily used for its wireless capabilities, which this works fine for. The weight is a little too much for portability.The keystone is superbly refined and silent. I love typing on this keyboard and now prefer it over the Mac original keyboard.Good for its price as well. Happy with the buy."
5,I have worked for 2 days on the keyboard and writing this review.I have connected with lenovo smart tab and apple ipad both. The switch between the two devices are smooth and faulent.Device is compact and can be placed parallel to laptop or other keyboard on the desk if you are working with multiple devices.Built quality is fantastic and the keys are big and easy to type. Basic functionality are provided with dedicated buttons for easy manhover.I would have been good if height adjustable functionality could have been incorporated.
5,"I've been waiting for the price of this keyboard to fall for over a year. Finally, it fell and bought it.This is a Bluetooth keyboard which is meant for people who use more than 1 device. I use a regular Windows Desktop & an iMac. Having 2 keyboards on my desk was really frustrating.The setup took barely 2 minutes on both my computers. Switching works as expected and is extremely fast.The build quality of the keyboard is far better than I thought. The key travel is nice and the different shape will take a little getting used to.Overall fantastic product and I highly recommend it."
3,"looks like a used keyboard as some keys are not working, but seller called after the return request and he accepted the return request after the feedback and hence the 3 star rating just for the sellers immediate response, so looks like something went wrong somewhere, but due to another 1 week or more of delay in re-shipping it again to my location, i am not going for replacement and returning it."
5,My typing speed increased and i can touch type with ease.It automatically shuts off when not used so it saves battery like that. To turn it back on you can just press any button. Saves your manual on/off button from wear and tear.  I liked that.Only once i had lag but it got fixed with a reboot.Though it seems small it has heft to it. I was surprised by how heavy it feels in the hand for the size it comes in. Feels premium.
5,Fantastic product from Logitech. Work as expected. Just go for it. This is my second purchase. I waited for so long to get this. I have researched almost all bluetooth keyboards in the market but none can beat this in the following critical pieces of use cases1. Form factor. It is so compact and light2. Battery life. Once you insert couple of AAA batteries you just simply forget it. Others in the market needs constant recharging of every now and then which is a deal breaker for me.The combination of its compactness and battery life is best in the industry. Just go for it.
5,"This is an excellent wireless multifunctional key board for all types of devices i.e. Android or IOS. I am using this key board for my Imac, Iphone - 7 plus and Samsung A - 30 mobile. I use WhatsApp through my Imac as it is very easy for m e to type my posts or send replies to posts I received. I find typing in the mobile is very difficult for me as  keys in the mobile phone are too small and I mix one key for another key therefore I am to do re-typing. This is avoided if one used this wireless key board. It is small and portable. One can carry anywhere and can easily use it to send SMSs through mobile phone. The price is very affordable. I find similar key board from Targus but it can be used for only one device.warm regards, Brig CS Vidyasagar (Retd)"
5,Logitech k380 is way better than k480.For those who are habituated to scissor key mechanism in mac k380 is the best option in this price range. There is no much sound while typing and also the key travel is also ver good. on the other hand k480 sounds huge and key travel is very bad . k380 keys feel more premium than k480
5,"This is by far one of the best Bluetooth device i have ever used. Its very ergonomic and portable. Multi device connectivity is super amazing and with a of the 3 yellow switchesh provided, you can jump across devices without any issues. There are Bluetooth keyboard under 1000INR but if you can shed 2k more this is the best you can get. I liked it more than the Apple keyboard. I use it with my Ipad Air 4 and my laptop and i never faced any connectivity issues."
4,It is a great keyboard and works perfectly fine and deserves 5 starts. The only reason for 4 starts is the price which is clearly overpriced. Made in china product.
5,"So practical and convenient! Ergonomics are top notch... Easy to use with Windows laptops and super convenient with Apple products as well... The 3 device connectivity is one amazing feature, easy to seamlessly switch as will! All windows and iOS shortcut are spot on. (A few like screen brightness may not work but hey 99%of the stuff gets done as good as the on-board keypad on any laptop)"
5,Good work
2,"Keyboard is decent but notice the euro key which makes the left shift key smaller. For me, it is hard to use it because of that."
2,"I m writing this review fter using the 'Quantum QHM7307 Mini Keyboard' for lmost three months. s you cn see for yourself, some lphbet keys hve stopped working in the lst three months. So tht speks for the qulity.The keybord mkes lot of noise while typing nd it is not smooth. The 'Print Screen' key is missing.  I will not recommend this product. Now  I hve to tke the keybord to the service centre for repir.Feb 13, 2020Update: After using it for three months, few keys were stopped working. When I contacted the seller, they asked me to get in touch with the company (Quantam) directly who in turn directed me to their service centre for repair. Since the product was under warranty, they replaced the keyboard. Thank you so much.Mar 11, 2020"
1,"I had ordered for a replacement and they sent me a surprise. :) Both times I received a opened unit.The Good :-  Small sizeThe Bad:- 1. Poor material, 2. Loose dancing like keys specially the spacebar, 3. Small Arrow keysLast but not the least I don't know why I made so many typing mistake using the keyboard, two keys are pressed together many a times. And this could be my issue as well."
4,"I'm using this product for quite a while, and it stands right.# small and portable.# full function key strip.#durable.# some what splash proof.There is not much to talk about it works and acts as the alternative keyboard.But there is no dedicated number pad on this.Overall the product is feel average and works well."
5,Every aspect is Good including it's size .It is a True Value for Money . Very comfortable to press keys.
5,The main purpose for buying this keyboard was to destory this through hardcore gaming. The reason for selecting this one is  it's small size and light weight which is quite suited for my gaming laptop and my workspace and also that i can carry it where i want.And also the package was not so good... it's worst!!ProS:1. It is cheal if the current one destoryed you can go for  another one with out worries.2. It's small when compared with other keyboards at this rate.3. The keys are quite clicky and recognisable.4. Weight is Light as feather.5. Nice and good key spacing.ConS:1. Build feels quite local and not so good.2. USB Cord is not braided and reasonably long.3. Should be handled with care.Conclusion: If you want an secondary keyboard so that you don't want to spoil your precious laptop keyboard sure you can go for it. And also it light and small and looks great. But it will not be durable however it's acceptable due to its low cost!!.
1,"Plz READ BEFORE BUYING!!!I tried to use it by plugging in and when I start typing, it starts to open pages, random tabs in chrome, downloading anything on any website. Jumping through the whole system without getting a single key out from the keyboard. Like u type ok = it will download chrome websites or open any kind of tabs.  After I unplugged the keyboard. My system got hangged, I had to restart and force stop the keyboard driver then it starts to work normally. It's such a troublemaker, I was nearly loosing my system. SO BEWARE FROM THIS PRODUCT!! IM BETTER OFF WITH OLD LOGITECH KEYBOARD! u were killing my system, the hell's up with that ???"
5,"This is a fantastic external keyboard. It's softer and smoother than my Vaio and HP laptop built-in keyboards, and as good as my Dell Inspiron keyboard. I've used Frontech external keyboard last 6 months and its keys are so hard & get stuck that I needed to type with such a force, which left me with extreme pain in shoulders and arms!But this one is a Godsent to me - it's just feather-touch!"
5,Really super compact keyboard. Buttons are smooth and comparably equal quality of Logitech.
4,"Its a good product, but a little bit smaller than what I expected. The key however, are more in height so one need to put some effort to press the key. This may be because in the laptop we use chick-let key board that has keys with lower height. However, after a while the fingers get used to it. I used it a few times. The keyboard is actually quite a value for money and easy going. Good product to be used in crucial times when your laptop or computer is kept at a distance and you want to type...............this keyboard really has a long lead.Thanks"
5,My laptop keyboard stopped working due to liquid spillage and replacement was not worth it. So I went in for a mini keyboard.  This one is the best.  It is compact as well as comfortable to use.  Does not have numeric keybad as in standard 101 key PC keyboard but that is not required and that would increase width. Good buy. Working fine since last few months.
3,"What I loved about this keyboard is the small size & the fact that I could carry it anywhere and everywhere. After a month or two of using it almost daily though, the wire connecting the keyboard to the laptop/ PC has come off and the keyboard isn't useable anymore. I don't know if it's a quality issue overall or with my particular piece but the keyboard is just useless now.I feel sad and sorry that it happened. Till the time it worked though, it worked flawlessly. It was comfortable to use for hours and was so easy to carry around. Sad that it's of no use anymore. üòî"
5,It's a good keyboard. Easy to type. It's a bit small so some people might find it uncomfortable. But i liked it ... Can keep it on any surface even on the bed. The wire is just the correct length for meJust another update ... I spilled paisam on the keybaord and it still works without any issues
4,"Compact design. Works fine but the keys are noisy. Cable length is fine, quality is okay according to price."
1,"why is quantum manufacturing such unbelievably sub standard product pls . pls live up to your equity  in the market folks, this is just not acceptable  Quantum & it doesnt allow me to write this review as well & starts typing all the special characters on its own. serious driver issues pls fix it asap , else pls dont sell  fool around consumers pls, my earnest submission to quantum"
4,"Bought this keyboard a month or so ago. I was a bit skeptical before buying. However the product is good.It is compact in size and the feel of the keys on the keyboard is also good. It's a bit bouncy and spongy, not very clicky kind of. If you like that kind of feel, you will like this keyboard.At this price point you cannot really complain. All in all a good budget product."
5,"This keyboard is really small and light weight...I'm using this for 2days and it's working fine... Although, it doesn't have backlight but the alphabet stickers are glossy so you can see in dark with the help of your monitor light by the reflection...I liked it"
2,"This is not a good product or not a bad product either. For the price, I could use a bit more quality plastic. There is a awful smell come from the keyboard plastic. The keys are not very good, they are mussy and not a very good tactile feedback .on the other hand what you could ask from a 415/- keyboard. For the price point my only issue is the plastic quality and the smell of the plastic. Otherwise it's a good keyboard for it's price point."
3,"Compact but not so friendly as it was for me. As it lacks some of the keys which I have experienced with my previous mini keyboard Technotech.I really don't like ""Fn"" Keys."
5,This is a compact keyboard that I have used almost for a year and is working fine. I am using an keyboard tray and you need a compact keyboard to fit both mouse and keyboard on the tray. It is good ergonomics!
1,"I bought this Keyboard 4 months back  it was light, compact, and easy carry & working fine. After my 4 months of very Moderate usage, keyboard started troubling me when i press 'A' Letter in the keyboard in display it is showing '$' Dollar symbol.I thought it Driver Issue and re installed drivers but there is no use., Again I had connected to another PC But the same issue repeated again.Please Don't go for this Low quality keyboard and waste your Valuable Money !!!!!!!!!"
3,"It is the perfect sized keyboard very similar to a Dell laptop keyboard size. However quality leaves a lot to be desired. Keys get stuck and keep repeating and as a result delays the typing experience. Also the keys themselves feel very light weight and flimsy. I am a touch typist and love my Dell / Lenovo laptop keyboards and was hoping for the same although at a lesser price. Unfortunately was disappointed. Also there is no ""return"" option , so have opted for a replacement. will update this review in case the replacement product is a better quality one."
1,"didn't even use it for a month when it started giving problems, the keys don't work properly, key traversal is horrible. I now have zero faith in quantum hi-tech products and I strongly recommend everyone not to buy their products and instead invest more wisely. Don't make the same mistake that I did."
1,Worstest purchase I ever did. It stopped working within 2 days and the customer care service of the brand is really bad they just randomly said a name of a service center and the service Center doesn't even repair keyboard. They just denied. The brand is keep me waiting for 2 weeks. Now also they don't have any answer just ask to wait will inform later....if you don't have good service facility stop sales through out India just focus on your street
1,"This product didn't meet my expectations, I placed the order and then i have to oreder for replacement but the product didn't work again and then i have to return the product. This is the first time i was not happy with the product. But replacement and return was so smooth Thumps up üëç for the service."
5,"As expected, go ahead and buy. Good one."
3,"I am writing this review after one day of usage. The keyboard is very good specially if you have a small desk but the packing in which it came was very poor, there was no protective foams at all. The keyboard‚Äôs packet was just wrapped in some ordinary thin plastic... I thought the keyboard would be broken on arrival but luckily its not, amazon should look carefully into this. I wanted to give it 5 stars but because of packing I am giving it 3 three stars. Overall the keyboard is good, go for it."
5,"Bought it on 24 January 2021 in Rs349. It is working fine and everything as per description. Mac does not recognise some of the keys in this keyboard though. It may be because, it is non standard sized small keyboard.Keys are smooth, non noisy."
1,"I am writing this feedback as to when I bought the keyboard on 12th April , today on 30th April the keyboard is typing 6 instead of O and 4 instead of U , not only that 0 key has gone deaf , the keyboard is so unresponsive, this keyboard doesn't even deserve to be sold for the scam it does, it is 350 rupees down the drain.DONT BUY THIS KEYBOARD EVEN THOUGH IT IS THE LAST OPTION YOU HAVE"
3,|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  I have no words because It is very impressive and I like it  |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
3,"for light use people or very tight on the budget, this is the best keyboard to buy at this price. But for all other people it is better to avoid this keyboard because the keys are very hard to type."
3,Writing a review after few months' usage. Some keys stopped working. One key is stuck. Average quality but does the job.Few keys stopped working after 6 months
4,I wanted a full length key board with numerical keys separately on the right  like a regular computer keyboard )What I received is a miniature keyboard.I not not comfortable using the item I received. I don‚Äôt mind paying extra for the courier charges. Please  give the quote for full length keyboard before shipping.Regards
4,"Buttons edges are bit sharp, can't type too fast. But it is good for price. My laptop keyboard is damaged, so using this as a backup external keyboard."
5,Good product...One of key is not working..But on emergency I cannot replacement now .. because of lock down issue.Seller will help me for replace after lockdown.. in his own decision.. because after 10 days amazone is not response for replacement..Conferm me
1,"certain keys repeats itself multiple times when pressed once.unplug/plugin it starts to work again.Worst product..Ittttttttttttttttttttttttttttttts like this . any key can have this issue. even if CTRL+V /Backspace  pressed, sometimes it keeps on pasting the same thing again and again, till the key board is plugged out. Bad quality."
1,"Within 15 days, the control key stopped functioning. The product doesn't seems to be good. Not recommend. This is where I have thrown it off. Contacted customer care for replacement. They told me that they would be sending me details of the nearest service center and they did not replied yet. Do not buy this product"
4,Little small but ok I guess for a laptop
5,"Nice product, in some reviews they saying that wrong keys are printing like pressing u, i, o, p etc.... We get  4,5,6,- for that  don't  worry just off num lock  you can see in image If any key print wrong letter just cheak once is num lock on or off by default it's  on  just off its and use normally  and about the product is so good,  small and cute......."
5,Another quality product from Quantum. Soft and large keys provides ease of typing and minimises typos.Make sure you disable the 'sticky keys' feature on first use.
4,I like it....it's comfortable to typing....not like other ghatia products...it's suitable to fit anywhere....bcoz it's Want a small space to work....it's key are so smooth....not hard....I recommend to buy it
1,"I bought this keyboard because it is the only mini keyboard I could find with:* Ctrl, Delete and Esc on the corners* Page Up/Down, Home, End on dedicated keys (not via an Fn key)As Farrah Macchiwalla already noted, the | and \ keys do not work normally (they generate < and >). Unfortunately I use them regularly so this defect is a show stopper.After two hours only the top bar of the Z key label was still there; the rest had rubbed off.  Hey, I hardly ever use that key!The keyboard has no adjustable feet and lies flatter than I like."
3,"I bought this to use with both my netbook and my tablet. Needed a compact keyboard but not too small for typing to be bad.In terms of form factor and durabilty this product is very good.Keys are firm and well spacedWire is decent length which is quite helpful if you need to work on desktopLooks are the only thing where the product is not that great but good functionality better okaying looksThere is no elevation option in this, so if that is a priority for you, then you wont get it here"
5,"Satisfies my main concerns, viz.1. Good key response2. Large backspace key3. Ctrl outside, Fn key inside4. Has dedicated Print Screen key5. Clearly separated Delete key (away from the arrow keys)6. Clearly separated arrow keys, although they're a bit small)7. Two Ctrl, Alt and Shift keys. Some keyboards only have one of one or more of them.One crib I have is that it doesn't have a right-click (context menu) key."
5,"Awesome üëçIn my first impression, great gadget to have. My purpose was to be able to keep mouse on the table on the small table I have instead of buying bigger table. It solved my problem 100%. Ease of typing is good and it just matches my laptop keyboard size. Has the front elevation for angle but it is fixed. Overall quality is good and sturdy.It is made in China, it‚Äôs ok to buy folks."
5,"This keyboard is a really helpful alternative for the default keyboard. Very useful for continuous typing and other purposes. The size is a bit smaller than the keyboard size of a 15"" laptop (as shown). Light weight and can be carried around easily. The key letterings and markings are printed real clear and stands out from the pitch black color of the product. Helpful for numpad users as it can be enabled by the click of a button that allows numbers to be typed just like the numpad (in the right side of the keyboard). There is no adjustable inclination adjustment, just a fixed inclination. For anyone who isn't looking for a costly one and an easily portable product, this is the real deal."
5,"Ppl who all thinks the Fn key is faulty (like I did and returned the product) pls be informed that there is a Number Lock button which toggles between default number keys or the letter keys. Use it. I only found after I purchase another keyboard and faced the same problem, but this time found my mistake. So I apologize for the faulty review..... Product is good."
3,"It is a good option to go for at this price. The keys are reasonably soft. It is very light weight and sometime you feel it is too light weight. The feel is not great but OK, but at this price point we do not expect premium feel either. I feel the edges should have been a bit curved. Overall, this product is a good value for money and should take you through the basic needs for some time. Comes with 1 yr warranty and by that time you should have got your ROI !"
5,"Been using this for a month now and i got to say no issues yet. i actually expected it to be a bit thinner but at this price range, i can't complain. There is decent key travel, certainly a bit more than standard laptop keyboards, which makes typing on this keyboard slightly more interesting than on a laptop keyboard. Very light weight, decent cable length, by default angled and no flipstand so not adjustable in that regard. Overall a very good product."
4,"Excellent product, compact size, very useful if u have a less wider space for key board n for WFH, easy to travel, worth its price, very smooth key strokes, average noise while typing, availability of all keys, ergonomic design, accurate response. Only need is to get used to it. Would love more if lapcare brings a wireleass variant of this model"
2,"Pros:1. Compact and sleek design.2. Some buttons work as number keys after pressing num lock key.3. Comes with nice packaging and a hologram sticker which shows the originality of product from Lapcare.Cons:1. Some keys were mushy, squishy and they don't give the tactile feedback while typing. They hamper fast typing and might increase error rate.2. All keys were very loose and made noise when you shake the keyboard or even while typing. Which is annoying sometimes.3. The price is way too much according to the quality. It isn't worth Rs. 420."
1,"It feels flimsy and loose. The keys are wobbly and makes noise when I just shake the keyboard. The print looked okay. The num,caps and scroll indicators are feeble. Worth a 200 maybe, not 500-Edit after a week, this is bad, its notbtue manufacturing, but the design. The keys are not sized and placed conveniently. Reducing from 3 to 1 star, wish I could get a refundEdit after 2 weeks- the shift key is getting stuck inside often."
5,"Light weight keyboard. Small form factor. Value for money. If your fingers are used to a macbook/macbook pro key layout, and you want something similar for the windows desktop to replicate the keystrokes muscle memory, this is an inexpensive alternative."
5,I have purchased this Keypad on 23-Aug-2020. I feel the keys are soft and excellent like original dell keyboard. I had used mini keyboards similar to this over more than 2+ years and this keyboard is excellent. Supports Windows 10 Pro and lower versions with USB 2.0 as well.
4,"The typing experience is certainly not that great of a mechanical keyboard but it's not that bad for the price. I actually needed a fill-in keyboard as I am looking for something that I can use for gaming as well but this little keyboard is doing way beyond my expectations and that's the reason I decided to write this review.Build quality is average, it's light weight, the connecting wire could have been a little longer but irrespective of all the cons, it's a nice little keyboard that doesn't take much space, does the job and all the keys are working just fine, what more can you ask for such a cheapy price! :P :)"
2,"Image shown here might not be high resolution, search the model on lapcare website to check the keyboard layout with a bigger image.Pros:1. light and portable, exactly as shown.2. Keys makes very slight clincky noise but it is mostly quiet.3. The USB wire is also long enough.Cons:1. The keys are a little hard to press and if you hit a corner, it just doesn't press.2. The misplaced ""Insert"" button. As a linux console user, I use the insert/delete button to scroll on elinks browser, which is somewhat annoying with the ""insert"" key at the bottom. Anyways, this is still the most standard layout among other mini keyboard of this range."
5,"My ThinkPad keyboard stopped working, I called local repair persons they changed keyboard and charged 2000 but after 7 months some keys stopped working I called them and replaced keyboard with 2100 again after 45 days new keyboard stopped working.Now i bought this keyboard it's good and working fine for me.Size is perfect what I was looking for."
4,Good for daily use. It is wired and no tension of batteries and bluetooth connection. The price is okay. I previously brought a white one. Now brought black. Actually I got a defective one but on replacement got another and is working good.
4,"Got the product today. Delivery is too late, it took 6 days to receive. Don't know the benefit of PRIME !Anyway product is fine, it comes with multimedia function.TUP--Number pad is with ""w,a,s,d,f..."" Keys. So turn of the ""NUMLOCK"" switch if u want to use alphabetical keyboard, otherwise it will show ""numbers"" instead of ""alphabet"""
5,The keyboard is exactly the size of my 15inch laptop's inbuilt keyboard. Keys are soft. Took me a day to get used to a new keyboard. Have been using it for more than a week now. I love it. Gives me more space for my mouse.
1,Worked so fine for exactly one month and now it stopped working. Not worth it. Pathetic experience. Have no backup keyboard working from home now!
4,"One of the keys is incorrectly programmed.  Fortunately it's not a key that's used often (PIPE | and BACK SLASH \).  Also, because of the placement of these keys, the left SHIFT key is smaller than usual so while typing, one tends to accidentally press that key rather than SHIFT."
5,"Pleasantly surprised at the quality. Keypress requires minimal effort and the movement is shallow (which I like). If you normally like the kind of ""chicklet keyboards"" you get on laptops, you will like this keyboard. If you like mechanical keyboards with a long keypress and tactile feedback, then this is not for you."
5,Very nice product. It fits in dedicated space on my work table. Keys are very smooth & really enjoying while typing. Also registered online for extended warranty. Really ment for WFH. Thanks to Amazon for speedy delivery.
5,The keyboard is exactly what I was looking for. Very compact so that I can keep my mouse along with the keyboard comfortably in the keyboard tray. The keyboard is of very good quality and typing is a breeze. The keys feel very good and I found it much better than the previous keyboard I had (Logitech K400R). The keys are raised and have good spacing in between. The tactile feel is also very nice. The keyboard does not have an adjustable rear feet for the right typing angle but instead has a fixed angle which I found to be quite useful.
1,Dont buy! Few keys on the keyboard stopped working and its of no use now! Waste of money.Better go with branded ones.
1,"The keyboard feels great but I ordered it twice and both have the same exact problem, when I press l or any other key it dosent registers l but numbers.Worst keyboard ever don't reccomend wasting your money"
5,"Buy this keyboard, handy, sleek, composed, strong material, mat finish. Almost a year, going great since.Increases the life of laptop by switching all typing to this sturdy keyboard"
4,I have smaller computer table where placing both keyboard and mouse getting difficult. So I order this. Quality seems reasonable but I feel it is too small for working long hours on it. It is slightly smaller than a 14 inch laptop keyboard.
1,ita function key isn't working. it is like its default ON. so the keys that are dependent on function key begin ON are working incorrectly.  For example button for 'p' prints '-'.please return this keyboard. its not usable
3,"I was very nice to use and worked well at first.. but after a month the keys started working differently.. for eg. if i press the key for ""p"" i got ""3' instead. so its kinds useless now."
4,"The form factor and durabilty of this product is very good. Keys are well spaced, soft &Wire is a decent length, lightweight. A very good option at this price. Overall, this product is a good value for money"
5,It is very nice small keyboard for laptop usage.its key light but fragile also.but believe me it's having nice typing experience.speed is ok.if you buy it for typing it's very nice just go for it.
4,"If you are looking for a soft keyboard, this is one among them. The space bar makes a little more noises than the rest of the keys. Still I would recommend this handy keyboard. I wish too, if the Lapecare also launch the wireless model of this keyboard."
4,Compact wired keyboard. Key response is really good. Overall a good buy at this price range.
1,"Keys are not working, Don't Buy.. Cheating Customers . I am from a remote area, they are cheating us, They are giving key switches are not working. I sent it back..."
4,"Needed some amount of back-lighting in the keys - as it is very difficult to type in the night time. Except this drawback, the quality and lightweight is amazing. Loved it!!"
4,"So for so good, Keyboard size is good, also the length of the USB cord is sufficient, Only downside is that it makes a lot of noise while typing..."
3,Earlier I bought 2 keyboards those are working perfectly! I bought another new one this is a defective piece.  I am trying to find the support number I did not find anywhere.Keys at time work and at time won't.  At times single key press results in multiple characters.
5,"The expected a lot of from it, turned out really good even after 6 months of usages."
1,"have to press the function key for typing letters ""uiojklm"" Such a tedious way to use it!!!!"
1,"I bought this keyboard because it is the only mini keyboard I could find with:* Ctrl, Delete and Esc on the corners* Page Up/Down, Home, End on dedicated keys (not via an Fn key)As Farrah Macchiwalla already noted, the | and \ keys do not work normally (they generate < and >). Unfortunately I use them regularly so this defect is a show stopper.After two hours only the top bar of the Z key label was still there; the rest had rubbed off.  Hey, I hardly ever use that key!The keyboard has no adjustable feet and lies flatter than I like."
3,"I bought this to use with both my netbook and my tablet. Needed a compact keyboard but not too small for typing to be bad.In terms of form factor and durabilty this product is very good.Keys are firm and well spacedWire is decent length which is quite helpful if you need to work on desktopLooks are the only thing where the product is not that great but good functionality better okaying looksThere is no elevation option in this, so if that is a priority for you, then you wont get it here"
5,"Satisfies my main concerns, viz.1. Good key response2. Large backspace key3. Ctrl outside, Fn key inside4. Has dedicated Print Screen key5. Clearly separated Delete key (away from the arrow keys)6. Clearly separated arrow keys, although they're a bit small)7. Two Ctrl, Alt and Shift keys. Some keyboards only have one of one or more of them.One crib I have is that it doesn't have a right-click (context menu) key."
5,"Awesome üëçIn my first impression, great gadget to have. My purpose was to be able to keep mouse on the table on the small table I have instead of buying bigger table. It solved my problem 100%. Ease of typing is good and it just matches my laptop keyboard size. Has the front elevation for angle but it is fixed. Overall quality is good and sturdy.It is made in China, it‚Äôs ok to buy folks."
5,"This keyboard is a really helpful alternative for the default keyboard. Very useful for continuous typing and other purposes. The size is a bit smaller than the keyboard size of a 15"" laptop (as shown). Light weight and can be carried around easily. The key letterings and markings are printed real clear and stands out from the pitch black color of the product. Helpful for numpad users as it can be enabled by the click of a button that allows numbers to be typed just like the numpad (in the right side of the keyboard). There is no adjustable inclination adjustment, just a fixed inclination. For anyone who isn't looking for a costly one and an easily portable product, this is the real deal."
5,"Ppl who all thinks the Fn key is faulty (like I did and returned the product) pls be informed that there is a Number Lock button which toggles between default number keys or the letter keys. Use it. I only found after I purchase another keyboard and faced the same problem, but this time found my mistake. So I apologize for the faulty review..... Product is good."
3,"It is a good option to go for at this price. The keys are reasonably soft. It is very light weight and sometime you feel it is too light weight. The feel is not great but OK, but at this price point we do not expect premium feel either. I feel the edges should have been a bit curved. Overall, this product is a good value for money and should take you through the basic needs for some time. Comes with 1 yr warranty and by that time you should have got your ROI !"
5,"Been using this for a month now and i got to say no issues yet. i actually expected it to be a bit thinner but at this price range, i can't complain. There is decent key travel, certainly a bit more than standard laptop keyboards, which makes typing on this keyboard slightly more interesting than on a laptop keyboard. Very light weight, decent cable length, by default angled and no flipstand so not adjustable in that regard. Overall a very good product."

1,Its key will start writing double (if you type q it will write q1 and w will be typed w2) after 1 month and Amazon will tell there is no warranty on this product and you have to check it before buying. So I request do not purchase product without warranty otherwise you will also loose your money like me and Amazon will also not tell this is without warranty.
1,Not good productMade in China
1,made in china
1,It's Chinese replica.. I have original TVS champ was better.. this with low quality plastik.. I will submit a return n refund and also case of fraud in consumer court
2,"I bought few days back , the inverted key was not functioning. Hence asked for replacement. Again the replacement key board also has same problem ie.,  inverted comma key is not functioning. Why reputed company like TVS Electronics doing like this. cant they check their product correctly. I do not know what to do"
4,"Purchased at 599/- from Tvs electronic, Hyderabad based co. Via amazon.This is the ""Made in China"" product.I do support Indian companies. But Indian companies supports Chinese companies.Little bit confused regarding this product. (3.5stars out of 5)."
4,"Keys are very very smooth. So far this is the best one I have used but unfortunately I had to return because of ""ctrl"" Key button which was not working properly. It was stuck everytime I used it, I had to restart the whole system for it to work."
5,TVs is best for keyboard
4,"This keyboard is good for general use. I am using it since a week. Till now i felt good. Keys are little bit hard. But that's ok because the response time is quick. Overall in this price, it's pretty decent"

5,Its cherry keystrokes always gives extra speef to do your works fast and very smooth.Nice product in this category but price little bit high and quality lower then tvse gold edition.
5,I used this on my recently purchased MacBook Air M1. I got a minor scratch on the lid and so started looking for cases. This one fit the bill. It was selling for 1300 and with few cash backs that was on offer by Amazon for I was able to get it for around 1100. I received it nicely packaged next day and it fit the MacBook Air M1 perfectly. I had to push a bit for the snap but nothing alarming. The golden colour is nicely visible through the clear case. They had also provided keyboard cover which is good if you are going to use it open in dusty environment. Also supplied was the trackpad protective layer and some plugs for the USB-C and headphone sockets. Nice touch. I mostly use my setup closed like Clamshell and this is very useful to keep the setup safe.
3,"Overall a decent product with a good build.Pros:1. Good build quality.2. The "" World Map"" pattern on the case is beautiful and gives the laptop a funky look.Cons:1. Once the screen and base cases are fixed, the screen can't be taken all the way back due to the thickness of the cases. This is especially a pain when keeping the laptop on your thighs while sitting on a sofa/bean bag and working as the screen doesn't have the mobility to go right back.2. The base case clips the body only on one side (either left of right) and not both sides.3. The keypad silicon is meant for the 2019 air book model, not for the 2020 model. Another problem with the keypad silicon is the back light can't be seen once the silicon is placed on the keypad."
4,"At the first glance I thought that this might ruin my MacBook but it turns out it fits well. I don't liked the keyboard cover to be honest as you can read from the title & apart from that lid cover makes it heavy so you will notice your screen sliding down backwards. This might damage device so use it at your own risk. Otherwise at Rs.1299 you can't go wrong with this as there is all sort of protection stuff provided like trackpad protector, keyboard cover, port protector, lids."
4,The keypad shown in the pics  resembles the colour of the case but I received a plain black colour keypad which was crushed between the two panels thus making it useless.Otherwise the colour and finish of the product is flawless. Fits fine but a bit more loose than it should be. I don't think it'll be durable for more than 6-8 months again depends upon the kind of a user you are.It is absolutely easy to remove. No hassles what so ever. Colour looks really good on the new MacBook Air.
5,"So when i ordered this, i didn't know that i'l also get free keypad, touch pad etc guards along with the macbook cover.I am a using these macbook pads n covers from last 7 years.. Compared to the previous one which i got at 999, this one is a better deal coz i got extra safety pads too, which will cost you extra Rs 1000 if you'l buy it separately.Definitely a 5 star."
2,"The product is made in China and its fitting is awful the sides doesnt fit at all with macbook air 2020, keypad skin is a film which falls while using. Design is not upto the mark at all.The left side hinge missing which causing the cover to come out. Keyboard skin blows away with slight air.Ended up damaging my Mac air while fitting this"
4,"Pros:1. Case fits the MacBook Air 2020 Intel Model A2179 perfectly. Compact case and offers good protection. I have noticed that the Space Grey A2179 model unlike previous models scratches pretty easily, so this case will definitely prevent further minor scratches.2. Also comes with the keyboard protector, trackpad protector and port plugs which is useful.Cons:1. Matt Black variant leaves many fingerprints which are difficult to remove.2. Trackpad protector doesn't come with instructions and leaves lot of bubbles if applied incorrectly.3. Packaging was bad, could've been better."
2,"Not worth it AT ALL and here‚Äôs why:1. I got this product a few hours ago and have barely used my Mac since I put it on and you can already see finger print marks2. The material is cheap plastic - was expecting some rubbery texture for grip but well. Failed.3. The bottom lid is flimsy - if you pick up your Mac aggressively, it‚Äôll come off slightly. It doesn‚Äôt fit well at all (I use the M1)4. Look at the keyboard guard - it‚Äôs a JOKE. The space key on the guard doesn‚Äôt consider that the actual space key on the M1 is HALF the size. So the space key on the guard covers the key adjacent to the space key as well.Won‚Äôt recommend you to burn 1300 bucks on this ridiculous product. Skip it."
5,"It fits amazingly and is a sturdy cover. The keypad and touchpad covers are superb, it doesn't feel that there's another layer on top of the original thing and it functions smoothly."
4,"Reduced two stars since the case is a fingerprint magnet, and the keyboard cover that came with it isn‚Äôt great quality - it stretched near frequently used keys within a few weeks.Otherwise, the case fits well for my 2018 MacBook Air and protects it well. Opening up the screen beyond a certain angle will face extra friction though."
5,"Price is on higher side.But No compromise on quality. An amazing purchase, but could have been better if range was kept b/w 800-1000 max.Rest keyboard guard, laptop plug covers and mouse guard excited the most as I didn't expected this in box.Thanks amazon"
2,"The product in the ""ADs"" looks very appealing, but isn't worth buying. The images uploaded are from the 2nd day of using my device. I am not a rigorous laptop freak. so imagine what happens with people who are on their laptop for 10-12 hours daily.Rather buy the transparent version, or laptop skins (dbrand, etc.) are recommended for anyone who doesn't like to see fingerprints at all."
5,"Lovely product , came with matt covers , mouse pad shield , rubber pligs for the opening and keyboard guard......its slim and nice!P.s- its for only 2019 / 2018 mac book air"
4,It is a perfect fit for A2179 model. However the trackpad skin was bent and so the sticker keeps coming off.  The thickness of the case is sleek and does not make the laptop heavier.
2,"Well quite disappointed with the product, Product was shown something else on the site, Apple logo was quite visible on the item shown, but when I got the product it's hard plastic material through which apple logo isn't visible at all.It's hard plastic so I guess durability will be there but not happy with what I got.As you can see in the picture, the fitment is also a problem. From the back side of laptop it is not get properly fitting the macbook main body."
4,"I have a Mac Book Air  A2337 (M1), the cover fits very well.I personally did not like the colour that I ordered which is 'Airy Blue'. The products representative image shows a bit of a translucent  sleeve, which I wanted, but this is a solid pastel shade -_-."
4,"Overall the product looks sturdy. But I received it in a bad condition, it was too dusty and the package was in a miserable condition. Including there were scratches on the top cover also with some mark on it but that‚Äôs not visible after application, Can manage tho but the keyboard skin is not worth your penny, it gives a weird look to the laptop and won‚Äôt stick properly. Looking for a replacement."
5,"It is an absolute stunner. My 7 yo daughter using her MacBook Air extensively for her online classes these days, has fallen in love with her Mac after putting up this cover. Looks quite safe too."
1,Pretty much useless. The back cover did not fit my mac a1932 Model 2019. Sheer waste of money. It is strange as to how Amazon has quoted the defective brand as 'bestseller'. Supremely misleading. Avoid wasting time and money on this.
3,"The case is good and durable and cools nice as well. But there are flaws as well. The keyboard cover provided with it doesn‚Äôt fit the macbook. Also the case doesn‚Äôt fit the macbook perfectly from the sides near the speakers, it fit perfectly only on one side and not both the sides at the same time."
2,Brought on september 2019Photo taken August 2020Defect: the Matt lamination on the case started ripping off after two months of use. A good scratch with your nail itself will rip the lamination.Material is good incase of protection.
5,"The packaging was good!the Cover is a beauty, looks stunning and feels so good. When you run your hand over it you can feel the engraving on it. Loving this... Gives an even classier and personalised feel to my MacBook Air.Loved it and it is very useful.the only demerit is, the keyboard cover which fits on the keyboard but some key are not corresponding to the actual keyboard keys.But overall it's all good."
5,"Extremely satisfied with the product. 1 day delivery with prime. you get a keyboard and trackpad protector with it. a good thought is to provide the USB C closing lid with it. minimal use of it but a good thought. overall, the cover is extremely hardy, easy to install (with the guide provided). 10* if I could."
2,The give keyboard silicon is for the older version of MacBook pro .so kindly i need a replacement . Ok the silicon
5,Excellent Product. Fits perfectly. Has rubber studs to fix on female Jack's of MacBook.Has a nice screen guard and mouse guard
5,Awesome perfect fit comes with keyboard cover and cover for all the ports I want to give it 100 stars. Just buy it
5,Fits Macbook perfectly. Good all round protection.Keyboard skin is good but You can't use backlighting of keyboard. Touch pad protector is good
3,The case for lid does not fit well. Bottom case fits perfect. Keyboard cover cuts are perfect but it spoils the aesthetics. The case came with a lot of scratches on it. Not very happy with the product and I am back in the market looking for a case that will protect my mac and not spoil the looks.
2,"Writing this review after 4 month of use. Product quality is not good as per price. Not worth for money it didn‚Äôt last for 2 month n started breaking from corners. No free movement, screen stop at 90degree angle. Once corner breaks you can move screen backward. Not worth more then 3-4 hundred."
5,Perfectly fits the Macbook air 13inch 2019 model. Upper case is too tight to fit though. Macbook becomes little heavy with shell case. Good product with few add ons. But it highly overpriced I feel. If you search in local market you might get it for a better deal
5,"I am happy with the product. Fits well to my Macbook Air 2019 version. Important to check you mac series number before ordering as it is very size specific. Came in good packaging. I have not added the keypad over, only the outer cover, and happy with the results."
3,"I bought this after heavy research and when it came, the top part fit perfectly (and quite beautifully) but the bottom part didn't fit at all. If it locked into place from one side, it wouldn't lock into place at the other side. I'm giving it three stars because if the bottom part had fit, it would have been perfect."
1,Worst case dont waste your money on it it doesn‚Äôt fit the 2020 MacBook properly even if it fits it wont come off i am not able to remove the top and it just looks bad and attracts fingers and the keypad protector also doesn‚Äôt fit properly
4,Fit and finish is okay. It MIGHT protect the MacBook in case you accidentally drop it but will definitely protects from scratch and stain. I haven‚Äôt received the trackpad cover.
4,"The product as such is very good. Value for money. The packaging, however,  was a little crumpled. Even though efforts were taken to ensure that the product stays intact, my cover had a little scratch on it. The silicon keyboard cover is not up to the mark. However, it does its job and does protect my laptop from harm beautifully."
5,"It is a perfect case for Macbook, where we can see the Macbook exterior and get good protection."
5,"Very happy with the product, comes with keyboard protector and touch pad protector too. Very good quality, since it is new I cannot comment on longevity but it looks neat and not too heavy as well"
4,durable product
1,product has factory effect as its one of the corner is going to fit properly by any mean. my product got cracked while doing so. bought it again but different brand
4,"Apart from keyboard cover rest everything was fine. The keyboard cover didn't rest properly, there was no adhesive and it kept moving"
5,"This is such a nice product. I was skeptical choosing the green colour, but it turned out to be even better than the pictures. I am using it with my Macbook Pro and connecting it was seamless. Mac will ask your help to setup this keyboard and once done, you can use it like a normal keyboard. The Windows button on this keyboard will be mapped to the Command key of the mac.In terms of design & aesthetics, it's just stunning. The keystrokes are lovely, there is good enough sound (not too loud) and the overall experience is very good. I type a lot and it doesn't hurt my hands after long typing sessions. You can remove the keys and clean them. It's a beautiful mech keyboard. If you want something different which will not be primarily for gaming, this is your thing. The mouse is good as well, nothing special though.Overall, highly recommend."
5,"I ordered this keyboard because I was in great need of one. It‚Äôs pretty cute and the colours fit perfectly with each other. The green colour scheme coupled with a few white ones make the mechanical key caps pop! It‚Äôs very satisfying to type on and if you‚Äôre looking for a mechanical keyboard with a spunky colour scheme as well as an aesthetic piece of hardware for your computer, go for it. This is the cheapest keyboard (of great quality) available on the market today and I loved this product so much that I simply had to write a review. It‚Äôs a one time investment that‚Äôll last seemingly forever if you look after it and works on batteries which are replaceable.GO FOR IT!!"
5,"I've wanted a fancy mechanical keyboard for so long. This one works just fine. The keys sound amazing. The colors are so pretty in real. The photos couldn't do justice. I actually wanted blue & green versions of this keyboard too but settled on this one cuz they look like yummy candies. Enough about the looks, this actually works pretty well. The mouse is perfectly sized and snug in your hands. It was a bit fast in the start but then I adjusted the settings in my laptop now it works just like how I wanted it to. The keys are a bit closely set together but you'll eventually get used to it. I mean this is my third day and (I write a hell lot of essays) I'm already used to it. I play a decent amount of RPG games too and I love using this keyboard for light gaming. One suggestion I have for the manufacturers is about the indicator lights.  They are placed on the slope of the rounded edge of the keyboard and I can't really sometimes see if the caps lock is on or not. But that's just a minor issue. Really love this product and highly recommend it. If i find anything I don't like about it in the future I will update the review.p.s forgive my lq grainy pics."
5,Satisfied is an understatement for this keyboard. It hits the mechanical type satisfaction to a 100%
1,"Hi,Here I will try to type my feedback with this keyboard, with my regular typing speed. You may guess how busy the keys are in the keyboard.Very cluttered, here is the typing without correcting them:I was impress witgh the desigbn abd thought it could be a very good kjeytboard for mne, but aftewr getting it, I am trying to type with my regular spoeed anbd you can judge ghow vbad the key arrangements are in this keyboiard.The same pareagraph if I type with my old keytbopard, I will not have these many mistakes for suyre. as the keys are well arranfged there.overall, not happy with the keyboard. also overpriced.Thanks,"
1,"Ohh..my...godd.. looking at the previous reviews and all, I thought it'd be great to own this keyboard, but in all honesty, it looks like something an 11 yr old kid would own. It's just not suited to anything I can imagine owning.Secondly, it doesn't fit the Mac environment. The keys for volume controls don't work, and the brightness settings are set on num lock and the next key.I could recommend this to people who like owning candy themed accessories, that they hardly use. For everyone else, I'd strongly recommend against this purchase."
5,"I love the keyboard! The quality is great and looks very aesthetic. The sound of the keys is veryy satisfying and I definately recomment buying it! Was delivered within 2 days which was really quick! And it is worth the cost. By looking at the photos I thought that the keyboard and mouse would be a little smaller in size but its perfect! And also I faced this problem so here is a little tip - There will be a Protective film on all the batteries so remove that and there will also be a film on the mouse on the white part (Look in the photo) remove that film its very thin so might be hard to remove. It might prevent you from smoothly run the cursor so removing that helps. And yes, Batteries ARE included!"
4,"If you're planning to buy this considering it has mechanical keys type , then it's strict no no . Otherwise the product looks good in terms of appearance. The letters are printed without proper alignment. It's a little bulky-feel keyboard with thick round edges. Overall It does justice to the retro keyboard style."
5,Excellent colours and amazing typing experience
4,"It's a nice looking keyboard with good build quality. One issue is since it has round keys as compared to square that we are generally accustomed of, it takes time to adjust and very often it leads to mistypes.Mouse is also quite ergonomic and respond nicely on any surface"
4,"I have been using them 2-3 dats max and believe me i am impressed with their looks , functionality. Operating with this keyboard/mouse combo is not problematic. It is very easy to get them setup ising the nano receiver within the mouse . All in all nice product but yes price can be a little less ."
4,Look wise it's a beauty. It's truly a novelty item. You will take some time to operate it as comfortable as your old keyboard. Function wise there is a room for improvement. Missing the mechanical sound experience. Mouse is bit big in size which makes it less convenient.
5,~Its produces sound which is relaxing and looks exactly as shown in the picture...connects to usb port dongle given in the mouse's battery section~using it for a month now no issues faced!~nice alternative for those very costly typewriter keyboards and is aesthetic looking!
5,"We all remember the old school key boards and mouse. This feels exactly the same. Both the keyboard and mouse are good. No lags detected so far. I use it for office purpose. If you're looking for gaming , this isn't for you."
5,"I was very skeptical about buying this product but it‚Äôs one of my best purchases. I was very confused between the pink and the green, n I‚Äôm glad I choose the green. It‚Äôs very soothing on the eye compared to the to pink one. It‚Äôs worth buying if u want to feel the nostalgia of typewriters."
1,"Contrary to the positive reviews which led me to try this out, keyboard is not comfortable to type on. I spend > 8hrs a day typing/coding. The fingers don't rest comfortably and it's difficult to type fast. I'm using a Thinkpad T460s and I'm back to it's keyboard."
5,"On time delivery, key board is same as expected,colour is also same as display in picture, use keyboard sice 1 months,no problem till the date,keys are very smooth and typing noise is osum. Mouse also looks good,works smooth and hold in Pam perfectly... overall happy with performance ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
4,"Nice, feels like type writer.Work efficiently.Mouse is super cute.Sounds like a normal keyboard typewriter type.But overall super cute.Not for gaming"
5,I bought this Product for personal use and office use for my huawei t5 tab and the quality plus delivery service and packaging was great. As the product got delivered today so this is my review for now. After 1month of usage I'll share my experience too
1,few keys are not working. please help to get it replace. i bought it on 2 may 2021 from amazon.
4,Cute design..works well!!
2,"The keys are placed very close to each other, found this extremely difficult to type on"
5,Both keyboard and mouse are great. The look is also great.
4,Good quality. Exactly same as shown in pictures.
4,Aesthetic looks..works fine but my upper most keywords are not working...
5,Very very good. Working as expected.
4,Good built in awesome colour really love it üòä
5,If you haven't used it than you hane seen nothing
4,Good Quality product. Easy to use
4,"Pretty cute! Love the light build, doesn't give too much of a plasticy feel, even the mouse is really nice to hold and the clacky sounds are just gorgeous! Like ASMR while working, it's so satisfying to work on! Only problem is it'll take a while to adjust to. The keys are closer together so I end up pressing the wrong ones or two at once. It's gonna take a while, but it'll be good practice. Overall it's worth it!"
5,I used this on my recently purchased MacBook Air M1. I got a minor scratch on the lid and so started looking for cases. This one fit the bill. It was selling for 1300 and with few cash backs that was on offer by Amazon for I was able to get it for around 1100. I received it nicely packaged next day and it fit the MacBook Air M1 perfectly. I had to push a bit for the snap but nothing alarming. The golden colour is nicely visible through the clear case. They had also provided keyboard cover which is good if you are going to use it open in dusty environment. Also supplied was the trackpad protective layer and some plugs for the USB-C and headphone sockets. Nice touch. I mostly use my setup closed like Clamshell and this is very useful to keep the setup safe.
3,"Overall a decent product with a good build.Pros:1. Good build quality.2. The "" World Map"" pattern on the case is beautiful and gives the laptop a funky look.Cons:1. Once the screen and base cases are fixed, the screen can't be taken all the way back due to the thickness of the cases. This is especially a pain when keeping the laptop on your thighs while sitting on a sofa/bean bag and working as the screen doesn't have the mobility to go right back.2. The base case clips the body only on one side (either left of right) and not both sides.3. The keypad silicon is meant for the 2019 air book model, not for the 2020 model. Another problem with the keypad silicon is the back light can't be seen once the silicon is placed on the keypad."
4,"At the first glance I thought that this might ruin my MacBook but it turns out it fits well. I don't liked the keyboard cover to be honest as you can read from the title & apart from that lid cover makes it heavy so you will notice your screen sliding down backwards. This might damage device so use it at your own risk. Otherwise at Rs.1299 you can't go wrong with this as there is all sort of protection stuff provided like trackpad protector, keyboard cover, port protector, lids."
4,The keypad shown in the pics  resembles the colour of the case but I received a plain black colour keypad which was crushed between the two panels thus making it useless.Otherwise the colour and finish of the product is flawless. Fits fine but a bit more loose than it should be. I don't think it'll be durable for more than 6-8 months again depends upon the kind of a user you are.It is absolutely easy to remove. No hassles what so ever. Colour looks really good on the new MacBook Air.
5,"So when i ordered this, i didn't know that i'l also get free keypad, touch pad etc guards along with the macbook cover.I am a using these macbook pads n covers from last 7 years.. Compared to the previous one which i got at 999, this one is a better deal coz i got extra safety pads too, which will cost you extra Rs 1000 if you'l buy it separately.Definitely a 5 star."
2,"The product is made in China and its fitting is awful the sides doesnt fit at all with macbook air 2020, keypad skin is a film which falls while using. Design is not upto the mark at all.The left side hinge missing which causing the cover to come out. Keyboard skin blows away with slight air.Ended up damaging my Mac air while fitting this"
4,"Pros:1. Case fits the MacBook Air 2020 Intel Model A2179 perfectly. Compact case and offers good protection. I have noticed that the Space Grey A2179 model unlike previous models scratches pretty easily, so this case will definitely prevent further minor scratches.2. Also comes with the keyboard protector, trackpad protector and port plugs which is useful.Cons:1. Matt Black variant leaves many fingerprints which are difficult to remove.2. Trackpad protector doesn't come with instructions and leaves lot of bubbles if applied incorrectly.3. Packaging was bad, could've been better."
2,"Not worth it AT ALL and here‚Äôs why:1. I got this product a few hours ago and have barely used my Mac since I put it on and you can already see finger print marks2. The material is cheap plastic - was expecting some rubbery texture for grip but well. Failed.3. The bottom lid is flimsy - if you pick up your Mac aggressively, it‚Äôll come off slightly. It doesn‚Äôt fit well at all (I use the M1)4. Look at the keyboard guard - it‚Äôs a JOKE. The space key on the guard doesn‚Äôt consider that the actual space key on the M1 is HALF the size. So the space key on the guard covers the key adjacent to the space key as well.Won‚Äôt recommend you to burn 1300 bucks on this ridiculous product. Skip it."
5,"It fits amazingly and is a sturdy cover. The keypad and touchpad covers are superb, it doesn't feel that there's another layer on top of the original thing and it functions smoothly."
4,"Reduced two stars since the case is a fingerprint magnet, and the keyboard cover that came with it isn‚Äôt great quality - it stretched near frequently used keys within a few weeks.Otherwise, the case fits well for my 2018 MacBook Air and protects it well. Opening up the screen beyond a certain angle will face extra friction though."
5,"Price is on higher side.But No compromise on quality. An amazing purchase, but could have been better if range was kept b/w 800-1000 max.Rest keyboard guard, laptop plug covers and mouse guard excited the most as I didn't expected this in box.Thanks amazon"
2,"The product in the ""ADs"" looks very appealing, but isn't worth buying. The images uploaded are from the 2nd day of using my device. I am not a rigorous laptop freak. so imagine what happens with people who are on their laptop for 10-12 hours daily.Rather buy the transparent version, or laptop skins (dbrand, etc.) are recommended for anyone who doesn't like to see fingerprints at all."
5,"Lovely product , came with matt covers , mouse pad shield , rubber pligs for the opening and keyboard guard......its slim and nice!P.s- its for only 2019 / 2018 mac book air"
4,It is a perfect fit for A2179 model. However the trackpad skin was bent and so the sticker keeps coming off.  The thickness of the case is sleek and does not make the laptop heavier.
2,"Well quite disappointed with the product, Product was shown something else on the site, Apple logo was quite visible on the item shown, but when I got the product it's hard plastic material through which apple logo isn't visible at all.It's hard plastic so I guess durability will be there but not happy with what I got.As you can see in the picture, the fitment is also a problem. From the back side of laptop it is not get properly fitting the macbook main body."
4,"I have a Mac Book Air  A2337 (M1), the cover fits very well.I personally did not like the colour that I ordered which is 'Airy Blue'. The products representative image shows a bit of a translucent  sleeve, which I wanted, but this is a solid pastel shade -_-."
4,"Overall the product looks sturdy. But I received it in a bad condition, it was too dusty and the package was in a miserable condition. Including there were scratches on the top cover also with some mark on it but that‚Äôs not visible after application, Can manage tho but the keyboard skin is not worth your penny, it gives a weird look to the laptop and won‚Äôt stick properly. Looking for a replacement."
5,"It is an absolute stunner. My 7 yo daughter using her MacBook Air extensively for her online classes these days, has fallen in love with her Mac after putting up this cover. Looks quite safe too."
1,Pretty much useless. The back cover did not fit my mac a1932 Model 2019. Sheer waste of money. It is strange as to how Amazon has quoted the defective brand as 'bestseller'. Supremely misleading. Avoid wasting time and money on this.
3,"The case is good and durable and cools nice as well. But there are flaws as well. The keyboard cover provided with it doesn‚Äôt fit the macbook. Also the case doesn‚Äôt fit the macbook perfectly from the sides near the speakers, it fit perfectly only on one side and not both the sides at the same time."

3,In this product we didn't get the mouse.Please give the mouse
5,"Got the pack of three products today and happy with it , because as pricing point of view it's quite cheap to buy...in comparison of buying separately... quality is also fine in this range..."
2,"I bought this when the keyboard+mouse+hub combo was 399‚Çπ.  And I'll talk about it assuming it costs something similar where you are.I got this because I wanted something cheap and cheerful for setting up my Raspberry Pi Zero W. While I've seen USB Hubs go for 116‚Çπ before, at the time of ordering they were all 200‚Çπ or more and the cheapest keyboard was 350‚Çπ. So this made sense. I had spare mice already, so it was a bonus here.Now the build of the keyboard itself is utter rubbish. The keyboard bends and flexes like nothing else. The first one I got was broken. The second one seems fine but only as long as I baby it and never let it leave my table. This isn't meant to be tossed around.The mouse is even worse. It's a miniature sized mouse (even smaller than those Logitech wireless mice), and has a glaring red light coming out of it. While the movements and clicks are all fine, the scroll wheel is defective. This was true on both my initial order and the replacement. But I bought this for a Raspberry Pi that runs in console mode, so I don't really need to bother getting this addressed.The USB Hub is the only thing here that's built decently. Good to connect a keyboard and a mouse, and maybe a microcontroller or two. But I'm not sure this has enough data bandwidth for a pendrive. Haven't checked but not too concerned.BTW since I only need the keyboard on the Pi, I actually use the hub on my desktop now.Don't buy this if it's your only keyboard. As the saying goes, you buy nice or you buy twice."
5,"Used it for connecting to phone. Works well. For rs  399, it has good value."
1,Sir good morningmy first order of key board mouse scroll not working so i replace the order.But second time mouse good working but key board damaged or broken.Paking not good and transporter handled not satisfy.I SHAME to again return.Thanking you.
1,"I had order 3 combo, keyboard,mouse,usb4portconnector,But i received keyboard only. dont have mouse and usb 4port connector, please send it me ok."
5,Mouse damaged.  Low quality
3,"while typing it feels like keys are gonna come out of it. Otherwise it's ok ok, not too good quality though... but surely not very long lasting thing. it can be just for the time being."
1,"Never buy this combo. When I received these products, the keyboard frame was already broken and tried using it. Later I found some of the keys were malfunctioning, automatically deleting without pressing any keys or adding letters.I applied for exchange the products, which I got it after 3 days and found the second keyboard was worst than the previous one. Got broken at the back of the keyboard. Now, the keys are not working, I don't want to change it as I am tired of these products."
2,I got damaged keyboard. The USB hub is also loosing connection after some time. I don't see this product is worth of money spent. Dissatisfied with overall product.
4,The keyboard and mouse working fine. But the usb hub has stopped working since couple of days after 2 and half months. It was bundled and addon and hence complain much. For sure key board and mouse excellent.
5,"Overall, the product is very good both in terms of built quality and performance. I using this product from more than 3 years I also play games in free time and now after 3 years keyboard is not responding, and I bought now same combo pack.And I'm happy to say that ""this is the best quality product"".Thanks for reading..."
3,I had read the reviews given below the product so I got confused so I give review that don't get confused this product is not upto the mark for keyboard only otherwise mouse n usb connector is good Overall the keyboard is in very bad quality only the main reason not to buy this product mouse is ok plusUsb connector is thin n light my main reason to return this product is only n only the keyboard
3,"I bought this as a replacement for my previous Artis keyboard. But even as a brand new keyboard, the sensitivity of the typing isn't that great. In fact, even as of writing this review it's still skipping letters and even spaces, because the typing doesn't register if I don't apply harder than average force. It can be fairly annoying.If you value typing, buy a better keyboard. For everything else, this is just fine.The mouse seems fine though. Nothing fancy. It just work."
3,The product is good but not that great but is definitely enough for the price you have to pay. The hub is really helpful. The keyboard and mouse are good but you may not get that feel as the keys r a little loose type of and the sensitivity of both mouse and keyboard is a little lagging sometimes. But overall a good product at the price.
1,"Combo items looks value for money. But the quality doesn't worth it.Keyboard buttons were out of the board when I received it. I fixed it & it was working fine. Keyboard is very fragile.Mouse doesn't work well. Windows doesn't recognise it for most of the times. I tried it in multiple laptops (lenovo, HP).USB HUB: NO COMMENTS. Still workingüòïüòïReview is after 20 days of use.... Nooo I can't return it. Don't waste your money... Go for better products."
3,"Because This Product gives you 3 Things A Keyboard , a Usb Port, A Mouse , You might say it's Value for money for 599/- But Don't Expect much in terms of Quality and Durability The so called Mouse is Not very sensitive and definitely Not for Long term use...I would say This As Not a Necessary Buy you can definitely Go for other Options it's just a Gimmick Stunt!!!!(3/5) i would say"
4,"Packaging must have been done badly, 1 corner edge of keybord was broken, otherwise everything working and good product"
3,"It's a value for money product, Plastic quality is cheap however it's acceptable as per the cost.I didn't even get a chance to use it as the product was damaged during shipping and I have only return option.Amazon service is real good, I suggest you to go for it only if you have really low budget. Anyways Amazon is always with you guys."
5,The perfect combo for all external hub needs. The keys are bigger than most regular keyboards which minimises typos.  The mouse with red lighting is a tad small but can be ideal for adults with smaller palms. The USB hub with four slots works well and requires no installation.Overall the perfect combo!!
5,"Value for money. Also received the mouse and multi usb port which is not included in the picture aa I have kept them aside since I don't require them now. The keyboard is a pertect one within this price range. About gaming, I'm not a gamer and I frankly don't know about it."
3,"Gets the job done. Nothing more than that. The keys feel a bit hard. Received a keyboard with a corner chipped off, but due to covid times did not return it. Mouse works ok. The 4-in-1 unit has never worked for me. Thats just a wasted product."
1,"Cheap quality. Mouse stopped working within the first few days (luckily) and I could return. However, keyboard was OK. But there is no way to get replaced just mouse alone.Better to spend little more and go for better brands to avoid disappointments and returns, which is even more important during the lock down period."
1,"The scroll button of mouse broke just after 10 days of usage. They say the product has a warranty of 1 year but no information about how and where to claim it.There is no help provided from Amazon, as warranty is not covered by them but by Quantum Hi-Tech company. And you can keep searching the internet till eternity to find how to avail this warranty but it will be of no use."
1,"Very worst product. could not last even 1 day, that too of very less usePlease do not buy this one.It is a learning for me not to purchase unbrand items like this. wastage of my hard earned money.Now i will have to buy a new one, since the replacement time has lapsed.In future if anyone buys an unbrand products please check as and when you receive, so that you could use the replacement windowFriends please avoid this keyboard"

5,"The keyboard, mouse and USB Extension work flawlessly. Absolute value for money.I am not posting pictures, as the products are as shown by the Seller."
1,"I got opened box, and it doesn't have any packing like Amazon usually provide. So i disappointed by packaging. And when i opened the box i got broken mouse in the box.Well i have applied for replace hop it will be replaced soon."
1,Low quality and not compatible and some keys not working totally waste of money

4,"The key board is a full keyboard, and it works well. The mouse is a bit small. More suitable for children or portable use with laptops."
1,I have ordered this product three times. Every time I got a defective product. Amazon should delivered their product with more care.
1,Sadly the keyboard stopped working only after a day. However the USB port is still working.Don't fall for the combo offer.
5,"Worth for the price. Packaging s vry simple n because of lite packaging it s damaged, product wud b damaged if delivery s happened one or two days later. This is to mention the quality of package n product. But the products satisfies at first impression. No problem with the devices as of now all are working fine."
5,"This is an awesome deal, you won't get much better than this at this price. In this price you are getting a good keyboard, a mouse and USB hub with 4 ports. All the products are of good quality. Don't think much more just go ahead and buy this product. You won't get much better than this."
4,"While receiving itself the key board is broken but still i feel the keyboard quality is bit low, even though the price is low i strongly suggest to get some good keyboard which will be of good quality. Other than keyboard mouse and USB Port are working good ."

4,"Logitech makes great products, be it mice or speakers (and everything in between) and this K480 keyboard is no exception. Here's my review ~1. Looks wise this is pleasing. Black and lemon yellow combo is stunning. (10/10)2. Not much heavy and should be easy to carry around in your regular laptop bags. (8/10)3. Bluetooth pairing is as easy as it gets. (9.5/10)4. Very easy to type, button placement is good as compared to others. However, bear in mind the switches are NOT backlit and they make a little noise while typing, although not as much as some youtubers might make you think. (8/10)I use my iPad 2018 and my android mobile side by side with ease. So, this should be a good addition to your gadget list. Hope this helps."
3,"Update:- it weigh too much, I understand it is done to balance the device while holding but still its too heavy (850g). Was looking to return but unfortunately that is not available for this product. Reducing my review by 2 stars :(Was looking for a keyboard for my IPAD since long, my wish is to get something which i can carry while travelling and hence looking for ones coming as case but because of higer price point, i ended my search on K480.Great delivery experience by Amazon agent, booked yesterday night and got delivery today at 03:00 pm.Wrinting this review with the key board which explain easy to connect and use, within 1-2 minutes of opening the packet, i am ready to type.Looks is also strong so i think it will last longer.Will comeback later with detailed review however at the moment i can say at this price point this device will complete your requirement of not using laptop :)"
4,"It‚Äôs a nice keyboard to have specifically if you have an ipad. If you want to buy the keyboard for writing long emails or you really want to work really fast this one isn‚Äôt for you. You really have to press the key significantly to type effectively.  When I work fast I tend to lose few alphabets due to not pressing key significantly.  Typing experience is not very smooth, sound of typing might disturb people around you. Built quality looks fine, it connects easily.FYI- my friend really like this and had no problem whatsoever while typing at any speed, he said he likes it the way it is. He said he didn‚Äôt accidentally typed any extra alphabet when he used it unlike other keyboards that types with the feather touch,If you‚Äôre like my friend you really should go for it."
5,"The keyboard is simply great. Does everything that as advertised. The product quality is excellent and could not have been better. I have connected it to three devices including an android phone, linux labtop and a ipad and worked seamlessly on all three devices. I mainly bought it to work as a keyboard with my Ipad in case I needed to create documents on it and works great in that set up. However I was dissapointed by the  weight of the keyboard, it is quite heavy and not as portable as one might imagine. However , if you are not put off by the extra weight it can be used easily as an input keyboard for three devices at the same time. I was sceptical at first of the three devices claim, but after using it that has been put to rest as it switches seamlessly between the three devices. It works on batteries and bluetooth . I cannot fault the quality it is world class. IT is not very ergonomic as the keys are quite round and small if you have large hands, I can imagine that you would find this uncomfortable. It is not a keyboard that can be used for long and hefty typing sessions. The groove in the front can fit a Ipad and an 5.5 inch Android phone  vertically with ease. The only problem is that if you have a cover on your devices you need to take it out, as it will not fit in along with the cover. I am really impressed with the design of the keyboard as it really helps to type on portable devices such as Tablets and Phones.I have bought it recently and am yet to find out about the durability. At a hefty price tag of over 3k it is an investment that you need to think about especially the purpose. It is a good buy if you are a gadget crazy person like me who uses several gadgets and needs to communicate with all of them and do not mind the heavy weight of the keyboard. If you are looking for a ultra portable keyboard , that is ergonomic for hefty typing sessions and if you have extraordinary large hands, this is not ideal for you. I personally love it and am glad that I invested in this."
5,"UPDATE - connected this keyboard to my Moto G5 with the hope that I will minimise my wrist pain. Moto G5 running Android 7 detects this keyboard after a couple of refreshes. But typing with this keyboard in any app is a little weird. Some characters like ""y"" are repeated several scores of times. Same goes for the spacebar. There is a lag while the characters appear after you have typed fast at which point the keyboard becomes kind of un-responsive. I guess this must be specific to certain models or certain versions of Android or perhaps it is an app issue - I tried this on several chat apps, on social media websites using the mobile browser. So while I am not going to be using this with my cellphone (which is a shame really), I will still continue to use it with my MacBook. The rating still stands and my recommendation that this is a good buy still holds true.This is a brilliant product especially for the price point.The sound made is minimal, it reminds me of those electric typewriters my dad used thirty years ago, the same sound and feel. I think the sound is not nearly as bad as some reviews make it out to be. It is quite muffled. The keyboard is more like those desktop computer keyboards we are used to from ten years ago. That is about it. I cannot comment on the durability of the product since I have barely used for around 30 minutes. There is no backlight on this so that is a bit of a downer but there is another version that offers backlit keys but costs a bomb (relatively speaking). The keys are perfectly placed and I had no trouble blind-typing this review. The batteries are already installed and are prevented from discharging with an insulation tape (which needs to be removed - you just pull the end that sticks out from behind the battery panel)The packaging from the supplier was superb. Amazon's own packaging was brilliant too considering it is raining quite a bit in my neck-of-the-woods with decent plastic wrapping. Delivery was incredibly fast from time of dispatch to time of handover.At this time, I am toying with the idea of gifting one for my brother.If you are looking for a keyboard that relieves you of the tedium of stretching your back to use the laptop or desktop, you should clearly opt for this. I use a Mac and I had no trouble setting up the keyboard.As other reviews have pointed out, this is not as light as Apple's own keyboard but then that keyboard is at least five times the price of this product. This is only a blue-tooth keyboard and not necessarily a portable bluetooth keyboard.This is a recommended buy. I am glad I got this.EDIT 09.DEC.2018It has been a little over 4 months since I got this keyboard. I can tell you that this is one product I do not regret buying. In the interim I got myself an iPad Pro as well and this keyboard is what I use with the iPad. In addition, I also use it with my Windows 10 laptop and there has been no cause for complaint yet. The batteries are genuinely long lasting although I must on balance add that I have started using it intensively only in the past two months. The bluetooth connection to my Mac, Windows and iPad as well as my Android mobile phone is incredibly fast. The keyboard does not work very well with my Moto G5 since there is a lag and often the keys repeat themselves.This keyboard is quite heavy, tipping the scales at nearly a kilogram and that is a lot of weight if you intend to carry it  in your backpack while you board a flight or intend to travel light.Apart from these manageable issues, this is an excellent buy and is highly recommended."
5,"The product works as shown in the video description.-- Battery Life--Not sure regarding the same as it depends on your use there is nothing to do with the keyboard as external battery cells are used-- Durability --If you hold it from one side you may hear a voice of plastic friction noise as the keyboard is total made of plastic.However, the keys are very smooth and are made of good quality.--Easy to use ---Product is designed to perform multitask, which it does without any error, the typing feels good on this keyboard and the switching between devices takes around 1/2 second.---------The keyboard is good for programmers specially, mine was a used one in an opened box which i returned and ordered a new one.I don't know, why these sellers sometime give used products to their customers, knowing that they will return it and give negative reviews and feedback."
5,"After a few months of using , am giving the review.- using it for my iPad Pro- way better than apple's keyboard- u can connect to three device at a time and can toggle using the wheel- the keyboard is old school type, noisy, but it's compact and easy for typing flawlessly- compatible with android,ios,win,mac- switches are well placed- battery life is too good- white one looks too premium- u can keep ur ipad or mobile in the place given for itCons- it's heavier than other keyboards but that makes it stronger- noisy keys like old keyboards but I like the sound it keeps me awake all the time in night shiftsGo for it .. Money saver.. Good product and better better than any other bt keyboards"
5,"This device is absolute delight, haven‚Äôt given any case to think otherwise since I bought this on jan 19, i‚Äôe., after putting it through utterly rough and tough usage on gaming, photoshop, revit design and more than 20 days on typing thesis... hell im even typing this review on it!Pros:Durable bodyEasy pairingSeamless connection btw all three devices, just twist and switch!, even cross platform isn‚Äôt a big deal for this, working with win10, iOS 12 on iPhone and iPad all at same time, still bests my surprise!Keyboard is enough wide even adopts to my big handKeys are big and feels like stud, extra likes for that..Phone/ iPad  holder is awesome, angle of view point is well thought, can accommodate 1 iPhone and 1 iPad mini (docked mode) or iPad Air portrait mode and iPhone.For a rs 2000 keyboard this sure gives a posh feel.Lack of inbuilt li-ion battery is a winner for me, battery life depends on what battery you use, I‚Äôm still running on my first battery Duracell AAA.Cons:Heavy for its size and plastic built, need to loose some stuffs to compensate baggage allowance!.Lack of num pad is sick, but it‚Äôs not that big deal if you are used to small keyboardDoesn‚Äôt have elevate stand to raise the keyboard, it bothers me because I‚Äôm used to it.While on playing games sometimes the keys lags, while series of keys are pressed at a fast rate in a row it seems it puts some stress on connectivity, but this wasn‚Äôt the case with my onboard laptop keyboard on the same game.. need further study on this.Verdict: Overall this is an awesome keyboard that comes in handy in all occasions with some tolerance on playing games!, built in phone and tablet stand is a huge plus,"
5,Awesome keyboard.Purchased imeadietely after watching YouTube desktop tour from Prasad . I cannot comment onBattery life and durability not yet completed 1 month also.After 1 year of usage....ProsNice lookEase of shifting Bluetooth devicesShortcutsBonus:very helpfully for editing works(not of use for normal usage)Battery lasts 2-3 months for medium usage....Cons: looks beautiful but care should be taken for white colour....Go for black one if u can‚Äôt take that much care...No complaints till nowThis was truly value for moneyThis is genuine review.....
1,"This is a true martial artist's keyboard, and if you are not one, then you are far too weak to even consider this.The keys are designed specifically to help build fingers of steel, that can pierce through concrete after just a month of using it for daily work.Beware though, if you are not tough enough to withstand all the training that this piece of meticulously designed ""board"" has to offer, you will lose, and it will win, always! If you do master it though, the epitome of finger strength awaits you."
2,Recently purchased this Bluetooth keyboard. Haven't used it enough to review other aspects of the keyboard but my first impression was that it looks like a used keyboard.with Scratch marks on the backside of the keyboard and some to complement the front side too.. expected a fresh piece from the seller. Disappointed.
4,"The white variant of the K480 looks good.Connects seamlessly with multiple devices through bluetooth. Volume control is easy . The Fn button does not have to pressed for volume control. Range of keyboard is impressive. Keys are not silent , but make a pleasant clacking sound.Works well with a Windows 10 mini PC, an Android TV Box and an HDMI enabled Windows 10 Tab. No drops in connection.The groove is very well suited for holding tabs and  mobiles. It has a rubber lining for firmer grip.The keyboard weighs approximately 1 kg  to prevent tablets from tipping over when placed in the groove. The weight might be a drawback for some."
1,"First of all, many keys of this keyboard doesn‚Äôt work.  It‚Äôs really very heavy and I don‚Äôt like this at all. I got a defective keyboard  and then returned it and it got replaced by another defective keyboards whose many keys doesn‚Äôt work. I regret not buying the 600‚Çπ keyboard now that my 2000‚Çπ got wasted. I will probably never buy electronic goods from amazon. And when i tried to return the second defective keyboard it said they will take the keyboard but return me not a single rupee. So now what? Keep the defective keyboard"
1,This is for the first time i had a worse expereince shopping with amazon. After spending a sizable amount this is what you get - a torn package with a complete defective product. It does not connects to a pc or an android device because the connect button for the same does not works. When connected to an iOS device i found out that many keys dont work at all. Utterly disappointed with this level of service
3,"Glossy surface with abs plastic keys, surface is scratch magnet but keys are nice (visually) . Connectivity is also good. You can check for specs.I got it today only and it felt good, heavier but it has cradle to hold ipad or smartphone so it has to be on heavier side. No back-lit since it operates on AAA batteries.It was able to hold my phone in cradle but when it comes to ipad pro 11, it could hold it for 5 mins only. Because the ridge or cradle is curved from inside and ipad pro has flat Brick design, it couldn't stick. Slips and falls. What I did to make it work is just to apply some silicon glue through glue gun on it. It will not affect the plastic of keyboard. It helped increasing the angle of inclination and now the CM is right below the cradle. Hence, avoiding the slip and fall of ipad.I didn't return it because there are not many such products available and it really has nice response and swift keys. Now it is working just fine, thanks to glue gun. This keyboard will work with previous models of ipad and other tablets (without any guarantees since angle of inclination will remain same as in mine). But for ipad pro 11 (2018 & 2019) you have to apply some frugal engineering just like i did to hold the the product in cradle. Designers and engineers didn't work well to make it a stable product. It will hold smaller devices like 6 or 7 Inch pads or smartphones, 11 inch is a bit heavier for it but little ""Jugaad"" makes it possible.I'm happy with the response and quality given the price range but i would just rate it 3 since engineering hasn't been upto the mark.Now keyboard usability and workability: I think keys will not be able to hold harsh pressing and are not as tough as normal keyboards are, its a little sensitive in the sense of delicacy. Looks fragile on that front. I have uploaded the videos too. The quality of battery lid is fragile, I'm not sure of how long will it stay for but I will try not to push it too much since it can break easily.Why i bought it?I can connect ipad, mobile (definitely I'll not text using keyboard that much, i don't why i said mobile here!) and also TV. This is the. Only reason i bought it plus price. Else i would've love to go for apple official keyboard if it fails on ipad.This sums up my review. I know it is not technical review but i feel there is no need since you can always compare tech specs online any where. This is a layman user review from a professional product Designer who works on Ergonomics and usability of product.Thanks for taking time to read."
4,"- the keyboard is small and hence very comfortable for the wrists.- the holder is able to handle tablets up to 10 inches easily.- works with Android tablet, Android phone, iPhone, iPad, MacOS, Linux- I was worried about the round keys but they are no problem at all.## Cons- keypress feedback is really bad. When typing for a long time, I tend to miss some keys because they were not pressed completely.- the switch and indicator are at the bottom which can be tedious to operate. So many time, I forget to switch it off because of that.- the sticker at the top has bad glue. It should not be removed even though it looks ugly.- can feel slightly heavy sometimes. check the weight and get an estimate before buying"
4,"Bought it for my daughter who attends online classes using Tablet.There is no instruction booklet, but Logitech thinks a sticker affixed to the front panel is easy enough to guide through the process. However, pairing it had been tricky. When you search it in Tablet, it finds the keyboard and it asks to type the pairing key displayed. I was at first confused where to type, anyway this being a keyboard I typed it in the keypad and it didn't work first. Then repeated the whole pairing process, and you had to also press 'Enter' key.There is a battery compartment and a tiny power switch at the back panel. There is no mention of that switch anywhere.At the hindsight, it all looked a silly operation to pair, but if it doesn't pair you only end up guessing what next to do. A simple printed leaflet would go a long way.The keyboard is quite heavy like a brick, but there is a definitive reason I can find for it. If you place a 10 inch tablet into that slot, due to the weight of tablet it would have toppled over. But this one stays sturdy. So hardware design has been well thought.The sad part is today, when I look at the price of the black keyboard, it displays Rs. 500 less. I went for this white one because it was available sooner."
5,"The fact that this put off people because of the loud clacking sounds which uncannily mirrored a typewriter's is exactly the reason I absolutely love it. Not to mention the cradle that fits the tablet perfectly with just the right angle is a bonus. The dial to switch between the 3 devices is great.Just a few things though. The on switch is on the back which means that if you have already set your tablet up, you will have to take it off, turn the device and turn it on before replacing the tablet in the cradle. As I mentioned, the loud key sounds can put off people. It is also quite chunky and heavy, which it should be since it needs to keep the tablet from falling over.A perfect model for an old soul like me who misses the typewriter and yet wants something conventional and modern."
3,"This is suitable only to use with tablets where you may not do too much typing. Keys are too tall and hard to press. It is not good to be used with laptops where you may code, write docs or emails. I regret buying this. At the moment this keyboard only servers the purpose of a stand for my iPad.If you are looking for a wireless keyboard for your laptop/desktop, go for dell or hp. In case you need a wireless keyboard for your tablet/phone, there aren't much good options available online. I would recommend visiting an offline store to experience the keyboard and buy or check with anyone who knows about a good wireless keyboard with soft keys"
3,"If you are a developer or hard gamer, think twice before buying this keyboard.There is no page up and page down button in keyboard.By default F1 to F12 are function keys. When you press alt + f4, it will not close your current window. If you want to have that setting, you need to install Logitech options software separately.The connectivity is good buy when you try to fast type then it misses some of the characters. You need to press each key precisely in order to get it typed.The key sound is ok but it sometime annoys since you type in your rhythm and later you find character is missing.It has more weight so can not be handy.There is mobile/tablet holder but if your mobile has some thick cover, then it will be hard to place it on inbuilt holder."
5,"Second day with the product. Can review as belowPROS -1. Sturdy keys. Gives the feeling of old desktop keyboards. Can work very fast, especially when my usual typing skills are very poor.2. Can connect to iPad, Dell PC, Apple MacBook Air or iPhone (any three) at one time simultaneously, choosing through the dial to work with the preferred one through the keyboard.3. Very stable and ergonomic. I could work for hours on a stretch albeit with small breaks in between, while working on my thesis, and didn't feel soreness of fingers.4. A superb value for money (as titled too) .... great possession at this price indeedI am writing this review when I have extensively used other Logitech keyboards, Apple keyboard, HP and other integrated ones from almost all brands int he past two decades.CONS -1. Only CONS I can find is that no keyboard skin or cover is available at Amazon or other platforms and with a 7 yo kid at home, there is always a fear of water spillage etc. as in past.2. Some would review it as 'too heavy' but my request is to patiently use this one for few days, for continuous typing of 30m or so, and you shall certainly fall in love with this one, especially if your typing skills are like mine - poor to average.Planning to buy one more of this for my daughter to use with her iMAC 4K, for 3 to 4 hours long online classes in current COVID times as she is somehow not comfortable (strangely though) with her Apple magic keyboard.Shall again review/update after a month or so of use ....."
5,Today I have received this. By product quality I will rate 5/5. It is awesome to use and seems to be worth full to my money. It just converted to my apple tab 9.7‚Äù tab to a mini computer.I don‚Äôt know how will be battery usage and other technicality till now. I will describe on those things later on. But it seems very nice.I rarely give 5/5 to any product and this I gave.
1,"Its a nice product. But, the piece delivered to me was not the same. It makes crackling sound on just picking it up. I thought it would be due to the heavy weight. But after few days I removed the instruction sticker to find out dents and scratches. A damaged piece was deliverd to me.Highly dissapointed, will have to think 10 times before shopping from amazon again!!!!!!!!!!I want a replacement."
1,Broken used peice received orderd replacement.Hope amazon replaces. It had 2 order stickers on it it was still on when received. Its broken and it was repaced with tape original tape was open and had marks. It was in 2 peice a bug dent and all locks broken. Extreamly poor quality control before despatch. Product is very very heavy not portable at all buy only if u want to keep at desk not for travel. Not used it as broken unit received. Will update if repalcement is received.I did receive the replacement the typing experience is not good the keys feel mushy. Total wastage of money
1,"A defective opened keyboard was shipped by Appario Retail Private Ltd. When i connected the keyboard many keys were not working. I cant imagine a logitech keyboard to be defective on opening, so i suspect a returned/refurbished product was shipped to me. I have asked for a replacement, lets see if it works.., but this is not a great experience for me."
5,"I purchased this keyboard to type on my iPad and I‚Äôm simply blown away. The keys provide good amount of tactile feedback so you feel like typing rather than skimming like in other flat bluetooth keyboards. Battery life has been pretty good so far, yet to change batteries. The device switching works instantly with iOS, Android and Windows flawlessly. The shortcut keys work in all three OS as well. You have to pair this only once and forget the hassle of reconnecting every time. Only con is the weight but it‚Äôs required to balance the heavy iPads when you place it in the notch."
2,"Good keyboard if you have multiple devices. I need to keep switching laptops, an iPad, and a desktop. Pairs on the first attempt, no complaints. Some points to consider before buying this.- The keys are noisy. I like it, some may hate it. Creeps into your telephone conversations/meetings.- Function keys are swapped, I am not sure how to put them back. F1 to F12 have defaulted to shortcuts I don't need them. I require the one used by Windows. Now I am forced to use the mouse.- Home and End buttons are missing. if you are dependent on those, this keyboard won't help, you need to compensate with other methods.- Alt-Tab between windows/tasks is hard to operate.Edit: After months of usage.- The keys are harder to press, it gets stressful to type emails, documents, etc This keyboard is simply not suited for long hours of typing. It is best suited for short bursts.- Looks nice only on youtube videos.- Alt-Tabbing between windows is dead, you need to have fingers made of lead to press it.- Causes rage, you'll end up occasionally smashing it due to lag while typing or playing some basic games.- as its too late to return this keyboard, I ended up repurposing this to less intensive tasks."
2,"I had brought this keyboard almost 3 years back. And this is what I think:This keyboard is bad. Aesthetically the keyboard is pleasing for sure. Ergonomically, it's alright. But the basic keyboard design is the only thing that is not what it should be.Keyboard Design: The keys are very noisy and has no feedback. You won't even know if you have clicked the button but your fellow roommate will hear you typing. Keys do not press evenly. Some need more pressure. In Windows, the Alt and Windows key for some reason shared the function weekly. For 3 days Alt becomes Windows key and vise versa. Yes, you got it right. That happened. I tried claiming the warranty but that was hard. I don't have Logitech service center around here. They told me that is the only way the warranty can be claimed.It has good things: Good bluetooth connectivity, longer battery life, it lasted more than a year. Seemless device switching. But it doesn't matter to me when the basic keyboard functionality is garbage.Don't get me wrong though. Logitech stand-alone is a great company. I have used their products and my friends have. I'm giving a second chance to Logitech in keyboards and I have bought another model. MK275.In nutshell. I do not recommend this keyboard."
5,"This is not a toy, unlike other brands that look cool but don‚Äôt hold up to prolonged use. Very little fatigue on the hands from extended use. The heavy base is needed to ensure the iPad doesn‚Äôt tip over even when improperly seated. My only complaint is that I often forget to power off the unit after use since the switch is hidden on the other side. The automatic Bluetooth power saver does help but I think an improved power off design could be researched for the next generation.I don‚Äôt need my laptop nearly as much."
1,"We are a software company and we wanted to purchase a great keyboard for our programmers and in that direction we purchased this product considering Logitech's reputation and brandPros:1) Compact, handy, nice layout2) Multi device switching with a simple roller switch is a nice feature.Cons:1) Worst keyboard keys, they are heavier, sticky and your fingers ache after prolonged usage.2) We received a brand new packed product but the device switching roller is not working properly. This ideally confirms the quality of testing Logitech has in place for their products.3) You will definitely miss Home , End key in the keyboard while editing documents or during programming.Those who spend more time at typing, this product is definitely not recommended. In-fact stay away from Logitech when it comes to keyboards, specially if you are looking for buying a ""great"" keyboards."
5,"I purchased the white coloured one. The keyboard pairs instantly with windows and Macbooks, I haven't yet tried pairing with Android tab yet. The Built is quite sturdy and the finish of the product is nice. As to the quality of keys, the slight concave depression in the keys help in typing and the keypad is well spaced out.Typing fast will take some getting used to but I am already able to type without looking at the keyboard. Very easy to connect and if you are looking for a multi devise keyboard for your workstation then this is the best. I paired this with a white logitech pebble series mouse and both work excellently in tandem. Would definitely recommend this. However note that this is not a portable keyboard and if you need something on the go you need to choose the other logitech model. The recess well built into the keyboard can easily support the one plue 7 pro and Samsung S6 Lite tab"
1,"8-10 of Its keys stopped working within barely 3-4 days of usage in my 2 months of ownership due to someHardware failure.The mail response was a parroted one which asks to follow 5 step software troubleshoots for a hardware issue and once you‚Äôve done that and expectedly fail to resolve they‚Äôll tell you to walk in with the keyboard to one of the 7-8 pan India service Centers they have !They don‚Äôt have a pickup service, they will not allow to courier you.. and to top it all you won‚Äôt get response on twitter,fb,email and even the customer care number mentioned on their website is switched off all the time.When I checked the 1 Star reviews most others have reported the same problem which makes me wonder if this is a faulty lot which is being sold online to make sure people buying from small cities have not choice but to keep this without getting refunded.Was expecting peace of mind while buying this expensive hardware and got the opposite. This one‚Äôs going down the dustbin but I‚Äôll definitely pursue these guys with the aid of consumer protection helpline.Avoid as its costly went dead for no reason and after sales service is non existent."
3,"Have been using the Logitech K480 multidevice key board for the past couple of weeks. Here are my observations. There are some fundamental limitations with this keyboard but Logitech has priced the model which addresses these limitations way above‚Ä¶ the Logitech MK850 Multi-Device Wireless Keyboard is three times more expensive and that price is a serious turn off! Anyways here is review of the K480.Pros:‚Ä¢ It is an excellent ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù key board for multi device input. Basic being the operative/key word here.‚Ä¢ Seamlessly links with even legacy laptops with older versions of Bluetooth.‚Ä¢ The keys are tactile and though the rounded edges take a bit of time getting used to, they do a great job.‚Ä¢ There is no lag whatsoever between keystroke and onscreen response.‚Ä¢ Battery lasts if the user remembers to turn off the power button under the keyboard, and of course depends on the number of devices connected simultaneously.  The more the devices the faster the drain.‚Ä¢ Sturdy, heavy and does not slip or move when typing fast or for sudden wrist adjustments.‚Ä¢ Mobile device holder at the top is a good thought and is helpfulCons:‚Ä¢ Seriously, seriously, very seriously miss the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnd‚Äù keys.‚Ä¢ The dual command and opt keys on both sides of the space bar could have been optimized for other functions part of a standard keyboard layout.‚Ä¢ The  F6, F7 and F8 function keys could have much better uses rather than music player and the F12 and lock keyboard buttons could be configured to ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnd‚ÄùSummary:This is not a writer‚Äôs keyboard. it is for short quick use across devices. Definitely not recommend if you are planning to use it professionally. Save up your money and invest in the MK850 ‚Äì as can be seen from the number of reviews, the device is way too expensive for a normal user. Still if you are looking to use a single keyboard and you do have multiple devices that you have to use professionally, go ahead and invest In the higher version.Would recommend if you are tired of typing with your thumbs on your phone/tab. And need something to handle your multiple devices when they are docked."
1,"I haven't seen more idiotic product. The trouble with blootooth connectivity is its range and speed and also when your laptop/PC booting up you cannot use your keyboard because, well, its bluetooth. So you need to enter your passwords using laptops keyboard. Moreover even if your device has booted up the connection is not guaranteed. Its really painful to get it connected for the first time after the device boots up. This is unlike the seamless connectivity of wireless adapter based peripherals. Supporting multiple OS and multiple devices simultaneously has dented its usability by making the connection process complicated. It is way easier to connect my bluetooth speaker to the laptop than this piece of cr@p.  To add salt to the injury despite being inferior device both in terms of technology and ease of use, it is priced higher than regular wireless keyboard and mice."
5,Best Multi device quick connect Bluetooth Keyboard. Uses Alkaline batteries so no of charging.No backlighting would have been better for night time situation.Can keep smartphones and Tabs but if kept in portrait we can't connect usb cables to devices to charge.The long hollow rubberized slot to keps devices is gerat but it hides the navigating buttons of the smartphones mainly as few lower portion of devices get hidden and the blutooth devices can't help in full navigating of  smartphones.
5,"Probably the best bluetooth (separate) keyboard for tablets, phones etc.Pro's -1. Very Easy and Quick to configure and Pair (Easy to follow instructions are pasted on the top part of the keyboard so dont even need any manual)2. Can pair 3 devices at any time.3. Sturdy and good build quality.4. Slot on top of the keyboard to keep the phone or Tab in while typing.5. Duracell AAA battery included.6. Relatively compact dimensions.7. Device keyboard doesnt pop-up and thus you get to type while viewing the whole screen, unlike the partially covered screen when the device keyboard pop's-up. I use it for my 8 inch Tab and my phone (both Android). The best part is when you place your Tab in Landscape mode in the slot given on the keyboard it almost feels like you're using a small laptop.Con's -To be honest I couldn't find any specific problems, but if I had name a few then -1. Keyboard not backlit. (With this feature, it would have definitely been just perfect).2. I agree with other reviewer's that the weight is more than any other keyboard but that's mostly to do with balancing it when you place the tab or phone in the slot.I checked for better reference for others, the slot on the top can accommodate a Tab in landscape mode with the longer side measuring upto 10.5 inches.I almost bought a new laptop but kept going back to reading more about this keyboard and finally I'm so glad I bought this instead. Got it for a great price during an offer too."
3,Very costly. Quality is very good üëç.Also very heavy although the size is smaller. Has 3 device support for bluetooth. Don't buy if you are a gamer. Weight of it reduces the chance of portability. I bought it before 5 months but used only 2 times now. Overall an average keyboard. If you want it in a single place without traveling it will be great for you. The Bluetooth reduces the tension of loosing the wireless keyboard receiver. Buy if you really need it .
4,"Works fine. Connecting sometimes becomes an issue, but manageable.Great that it was switch between 3 devices.Keys aren't great, just normal.Compact. Works well if you don't wanna use up a lot of space.Cons:No Home / End / Pg Up / Pg Dn keys. Have to learn the keystrokes for each.It's heavy. Quite heavy. Not the kind you wanna carry in your backpack.Expensive, for the experience.Occupies the sole Bluetooth connection. You can't connect a Bluetooth speaker or a mouse to your laptop, tab or phone if they keyboard is connected."
1,"When I first received this keyboard, I was impressed with its look and ergonomic design. It is heavy but that is needed to offset the weight of your tablet/iPad when you dock it inclined. However, the first thing I didnt like was that the feel of the keys was tacky.. so it might look great but feels like a CHEAP keyboard, even worse than the tackiest, cheapo keypads you'll ever find sold along the roadsides. But most importantly, after just 2 weeks or so, some of the keys stopped working, not sure if it's due to the cheap quality of the keyboard membrane inside.. and by the end of the month, two whole rows of keys stopped working altogether! So beware.. for SUCH a price, this keyboard is NOT worth it, especially if it barely lasts a month!!"
4,"It is a very good build! Works perfect with all devices. It is very easy to use. Thanks a lot Logitech. Also, i expected to be somewhat smaller but it is perfect size and it really worked for me, it is as good as normal keyboard with more portability!"
5,Nice keyboard .. surely better than Logitech one. Smooth keys  and mouse makes no click sound. worth buying it.
3,"Good keyboard, gives you laptop keyboard like feel. Good response if you keep the wireless received close to the keyboard , but if you move the receiver a bit far the response becomes immediately sluggish. As an example moving the wireless dongle from one side to other side of my mac changed the responsiveness of this keyboard drastically.Backspace key is too slow - and I mean too slow, keeping it pressed doesn't speed up the deletion. Trying to exploring system preference to improve it. I did get improvement with keyboard and mouse response times by adjusting system preferences, but backspace still is bad. (Update: Its working fine for windows after I adjusted the settings in windows, I have yet to see this for mac - which is where I noticed the issue in the first place)The size of the keyboard is slightly smaller than the size of the standard keyboard so it will take you some time to get used to it.  And if you are thinking of this as a drop in and compact replacement for your standard keyboard, you will be disappointed because it will not give you the same feel, and switching between the two keyboards will be hard as the minor differences in the positions of the key between this and the standard keyboard will mean you will do more typing errors initially. But once you get used to it, it will be just fine. It took me 10 mins to get used to it.  (I know its a mini, I am comparing it with the size of standard querty layout)"
5,Absolutely perfect.. i wanted a sleek keyboard for my office computer without the wires and yet wanted a stylish keyboard which will catch the eye of every customer entering the office...and yes...it did the job..1)..it's working is good.. instant connectivity to my laptop and keyboard is absolutely silent and the mouse is absolutely noiseless. The mouse movement is easy and efficient. Both the keyboard and mouse work effortlessly and noiseless.2). The keyboard and mouse..both look eye catching and gorgeous.3). Easy to carry in my laptop bag in front zipper without any hassle..due to small cute size.4)one small issue i facd is my hands are big and fingers are thick...so i had issues of double typing many times and extra keys typing...but i am now used to it and the errors are reducing but for small hands..this should not be a problem.It's good buy. I am satisfied.Jai Hind
1,"Plus1. The key board and mouse build quality is very good2. Button clicks are awesomely smooth both in keyboard and mouse3. White and blue colour looks ergonomically beautifulMinus1. The are no page up / down, home and end keys. If you have lot of typing work then this would become difficult for editing2. Space-bar, enter-key and back-space are little bit loose compared to other keys2. The product seal was open when I received my package. I see yellow colour stain under the keyboard. In short this is a very good product from a bad sellerI am writing this review before returning this product"
1,"The mouse cursor movement isn't as smooth as it should be on smooth/glossy surface, keeps hanging intermittently.  But it is not mentioned anywhere in website description. I have lenovo/hp mouse which works without any issue on same surface. Also there is no on/off switch in mouse.Keyboard is Ok, not much smooth. Very difficult to adjust if you are used to work on laptop or normal keyboard. Right shift key is not at the regular place, it is on the right end.  Also, the keyboard misses keystrokes sometimes. There is no page up /down /home/end button.It is overpriced."
3,"Mouse is pretty good but its gonna take while to grab the hang of the keyboard, Keyboard is a bit heavy.Overall its a decent combo.Returned : Keyboard isn't that great."
1,"Usually, I don't write reviews but for this product, I just want to share few things. Let me be straight forward, this is a TOY Keyboard. If you are looking for a reliable keyboard to get your thing's done, you'll make the worst mistake by opting this keyboard. Few points to consider - Design flawed, poor accuracy, and battery drained within 4-5 days of normal usage. For gamer's, it'll disappoint and rates for you'll be losing the game and for people trying to get your thing's done, it'll irritate and annoy for you'll waste all your time into corrections. Like I said, it's a toy keyboard to slap random on the keys. Go for branded like DELL or Logitech."
3,"Writing this review the very 1st day. My initial impressions are good1. When I opened the box, I was disappointed to see a detached key ( right arrow key had got detached). I fixed it and it was working fine.2. Absolutely zero typing noice. Typing is silent. Some might not like it.3. Keyboard is a bit laggy when you type, but not a deal breaker. All the keys are working fine as of now.4. Mouse is accurate and sharp5. Plasticky, but sturdy.Last but not leastI did not find any ""battery included"" as advertised. Greedy seller migh have thought not to include for this price.For 999, it is still a bit expensive especially if the seller does not provide batteries. For my existing rapoo keyboard, the company had provided free and hight quality batteries."
5,The best buy ever........Portronics is not a leading branch in computers pheripherals but if you compare this product with any branded product..you will definitely not regret this buy....Keyboard and Mouse in a single receiver....Compact and awesome....Mouse is almost zero click sound....its a silent mouse....Keybaord is equally good....Definitely  go for it without a second choice....While other at a higher price will provide you with only keyboard..this provides you keyboard and silent mouse...Only drawback is the key board has no LED to indicate Caps lock...Num lock..however this will not be as issue if you use laptop...
1,"The keyboard was pretty good in the first month ,it took some time for me to get adjusted with the small keyboard. Other than that I didn't find any issues. But now, the number keys are stopped working,I have to press heavily to input the numbers to my laptop. Sometimes even that doesn't work. I can't use this keyboard anymore without the number keys properly working. Please go for a good branded keyboard guys."
3,A good combo of portronics keyboard and mouse. The size of the keyboard is just the size of space occupied by the keys on a keyboard. The top portion has some extra area. A bit uncomfortable for those with long fingers who got accustomed to keyboards with space on sides too. Mouse doesn't have an option to turn on/off. I received the product without batteries and therefore -2 stars so that they might not continue this error again and look into this. Overall if you feel like you can get adopted with this size you can go for it as there are no more flaws in this combo.
1,"Just an initial feedback. Item was despatched on time and with good quality. Btmut the 2 AA batteries were missing;-( which is disappointing. I need to go out in this pandemic situation to use this key board and mouse that destroys the whole purpose of ordering online and when they dont deliver as per the item description.I will share the revised feedback after I start using it.Update of using it after 2 weeks (24Aug2020) :(1) the right shift key is actually available but much lesser in size and I just got used to it when compared to the normal key board.(2) there is a significant volume that comes with when working in the night time and I couldn't really turn it off on my Windows 10.(3) very important minus I feel is after a period of inactivity, the mouse loses its traction and connectivity which is good but I cant get it activated just by pressing any key. All I need to do is take off the  battery and reinsert it on the noise to make it work again.Kindly do suggest the best alternatives for the above points.Update - after using it for 3 weeks (06 Sep 2020)======================================Mouse is a gone case. Even during the active working duration now, for every click I need to take off the battery and insert it again. There is no switch to toggle it. Totally hopeless and I missed the return window in Amazon as well. I regret having purchased this product. Should have gone for a better one, even with a higher cost!!"
1,"Worst product I ever bought. Don't waste your money on this. Some of the keys are faulty. Both shift keys on my keyboard does not work properly with some other keys. I emailed to their website, since it is under warranty, but they didn't respond. I kindly request Amazon India not to sell this type of ordinary product which doesn't provide support to the customer. I should have bought something like a Logitech with some extra money. Anyway I have learned a lesson."
5,"Good for moderate amount of document  typing and coding. Being a membrane keyboard, this is does not give you a good response while typing but it has very smooth and light buttons. After 2-3 months of daily extensive use, I can confirm that this keyboard is excellent for normal use.Right bottom side is a bit cluttered with to many keys; after all this is a compact keyboard.Mouse is awesome. It does not have a power button but goes to sleep after some inactivity. It's silent easy to use, comfortable size and nice scroll wheel.The keyboard hard some scratches on top right which was disappointing."
5,"I totally love this keyboard and the mouse!Initially, I was sceptical about it but when I opened the package, I was like, ""This is the one!""This is so beautiful to look at. It is smooth and easy to use. The keyboard and mouse are light in weight and easy to use. The mouse clicks are literally silent. The keyboard keys are like the ones I wanted.  Chocolate keys as they call it and I like the clack and click sound when I use it. As per the description, it does have long-distance transmission. I just feel that the 'Prt Sc' button and the 'Shift' button were exchanged. [Maybe because I am used to the original keyboards. It might take some time, but I'd get used to this placement as well.] The size is also good. The height of the mouse and the keyboard too is good. It is comfortable to use for longer time periods.Overall, this is worth the money and is a good buy."
1,"The keyboard is small and compact. Same as the size of a laptop keyboard. Keys are soft and responsive. Looks are good. But, one huge mistake they did is misplacing the right shift key. There is a prnt screen key in place of shift and the right shift key is placed to the extreme end of the keyboard and is of small size which makes it difficult to reach and typing passwords becomes challenge. On/off switch on both keyboard and mouse would have been an added advantage.  How long this keyboard will last? Only time can tell us.  Another imp thing is this keyboard combo is available for 999rs on official portronics website. Here in amazon the price is 126rs higher. Amazon is cheating its customers in the name of prime membership. Which has become worst these days. Many of the items have etd of 5 to 7 days."
3,"Bought it 8 months ago for my MacBook Pro Dual screen WFH setup.Initially, I found great value for my money. Thought a much better alternative for expensive brands like Logitech, etc.  The mouse wasn't noisy but smooth enough. Keyboard gives you a nice feel while typing. Handy function keys.After a long use, I do not feel this is a reliable partner, especially if you are programmer or write long reports like documentations and proposals. Why?1. Constant missed keystrokes.2. Sometimes a single keystroke might print something twice.3. Although the keys are big enough, they are cramped very closely. Might not be a problem for all, but if you have broader finger tips, could be you constantly keep making mistakes unless you have an auto-correct or spell checker enabled.4. Perfect for Windows, but if you use an Macbook, the layout and functions could be very confusing remembering the combinations.5. The mouse stopped working very recently.6. The mouse too would not register the clicks sometimes and sometimes registers more than necessary. Although this behaviour is quiet common in such class of keyboards, this is way too often and noticeable breaking your flow and frustrating you enough.7. The keyboard is showing signs of deterioration with this fault behaviour being more pronounced these days.If you're using a Wireless Keyboard and Mouse as primary input devices - like in a dual screen setup as I do - and heavy on typing and use a lot of shortcuts in working, this product could be placeholder until you find a better one but honestly, its not meant for professional grade workload.And the same could apply for gaming, because delayed and unnecessary keystrokes can change your gameplay and hence the outcomes."
3,"This is a small keyboard apt for laptop but I am using it for desktop. Writing this review after 4 weeks of use.The WiFi plug is at the back of the mouse, take it out and plug it in to your usb port and insert batteries to the keyboard and mouse and you are good to go.It looks pretty and is noiseless but at times some keys get stuck and you have to manually push it up. Many functions of my old keyboard enter is now performed by the shift key of this key board. Mouse also gets stuck suddenly and can be very inconvenient when that happens.If you are used to the bigger keyboard, it might take some time for you to get used to this.When I tried to register warranty through QR code provided, it just wasn't happening.Ideal for laptop, but for desktop it is better to go for the bigger key board if you are used to that."
2,"I think i received an opened product. Batteries are fine, but no warranty card? Something suspicious. Also I can see that the QC sticker has been opened and placed again, i'm thinking someone has already done some repairs on this. Not to mention the product came all dusty with a fake seal.Let's see how it goes, if anything happens i'll return this asap. Feeling a bit worried if it will last long especially without the warranty card.Usage wise, mouse is good, but for keyboard, you need some time to adjust with the layout.Update 1: Mouse is good but keyboard is not that great especially if you are into programming. Also one key is not working. Thinking of returning this and buy Logitech. I bought this for the keyboard as i already have a Logitech wireless mouse.Update 2: Keyboard battery indicator is blinking. Its not even 1 week I started using this. Also mouse stops working intermittently. Very bad experience.Update 3: Battery died today. It has only been 1 week. Very bad experience. Hope amazon takes return."
5,"Have been using since 3 and a half month. The keyboard is more like a mechanical toy with more than needed travel space. The mouse is great, infact I would say that it is better than the keyboard. It makes no sound on left and right click, however, if the middle mouse button is pressed, there is a normal clicking sound.The keyboard is completely water-proof. I mean it. Once I left it near an open window and it rained heavily. When I got back, I could see that water had enter the keyboard and literally ""filled"" the entire keyboard. I removed water by inverting it and let it dry. It kept functioning as it was.I use it on a macbook, so I feel that the control and function should be switched. Even if you configure the settings in mac, the control key or any other key just cannot function as the function key. So this was an issue. However the function key could be configured to function as control key, but then in some cases, it will still perform the functions of the function key!The right shift key is very small and not reachable. Programmers will find this annoying. The control key, as I mentioned, is on the extreme - bottom left and barely reachable, which is another thing that will bother programmers.Battery Life - I need a new battery for mouse every month(I use the laptop for 12+ hours a day). Didn't need to replace the cell in keyboard yet.On/Off Switch- Contrary to what few reviews have mentioned, there IS a switch to turn the mouse off. Just remove the usb plug and then press any button or just glide the mouse a bit and the light at the bottom will turn off. Keyboard has a long battery life and will not need to be turned off.Also it is a china-made product. It doesnot come with a setup manual. Both these things hurt!"
4,"Update after 3 month heavy usage (7-8 hours daily) , it's still working but battery backup is a worry. Keyboard battery lasted 2 months but the mouse one lasts hardly over a month. Just changed the battery on the mouse for 3rd time.If you are a daily user, you might end up buying new battery every month.Using this for the last 3 days. Pretty good for the price. The mouse feels light and fast. Keyboards buttons are nice and soft though the chocolate keys have bit too much play for my liking .I took the white and cyan tone which kind of looks vintage (in a good way)Both keyboard and mouse doesn't have an off switch but the mouse seems to go on a sleep after roughly 5 mins of inactivity.If you want to try out a wireless keyboard on budget, just go for it."
4,"I already own the very same product in green and white color that I have been using for my office laptop since the last one year or so. Now I have ordered it for my personal laptop and it finally arrived today. I must say that I am very satisfied so far. It hooked up very nicely with the laptop (HP Pavilion) and is working smoothly so far. In fact, I had some issues with the earlier version where mouse lagged behind a bit when switching from keyboard to mouse, but although its a small irritation, I have overcome it by always clicking the mouse once, before using it. That action immediately brings the mouse back to life. That action has now become so natural to me, I hardly ever notice the lag. This new set that arrived today, however, does not even have that issue. Mouse is working perfectly fine. I even set up my previous combo (the green-white) one to my personal laptop and the mouse worked fine there as well. So, I have come to the conclusion that this combo may work perfectly on devices with a high RAM (>=8 GB). I love the ergonomics of the keyboard and the mouse, and the fact that they are so silent and smooth to work with. I have re-purchased the same product for this reason only. The only reason I am deducting a star is because they did not include the batteries with the product."
3,"This is not suitable if you type a lot. The keyboard is smaller than in the photo. The keys are wide and evenly placed. But to accomodate all keys on a small board, a few keys like the Shift key on the right is moved from its usual position, which can be confusing. Initially, you will probably end up mis typing a lot of words.  Mouse is ok. I don't think it's very durable for longer run. I wanted a smaller keyboard, I don't type a lot frequently, and I purchased it for 800 Rs. So, I guess it worked out for me. Consider your main needs before buying this."
2,"The sleep profile on the mouse is very aggressive. If you switch between typing for sometime and then use the mouse, then the mouse remain unresponsive for couple of seconds until it wakes up. I wish both keyboard andmouse had switches to turn them on/off instead.Keyboard will occasionally miss some keys and might require some force to register keys. Also the shift key is an awkward position located to the right of the arrow up key. Both of these issues could be resolved by using this same keyboard for sometime, but not if you're switching different keyboards all the time.I will not buy this product again only because of the pathetic mouse."
1,"I purchased it for my kid for his online school.  Firstly, product was delivered without the batteries. As per contents description it should have been included. Secondly, after few days of use, the mouse has problems connecting to the dongle. The mouse stops responding whereas the keyboard works fine. The return/ replacement policy is already over so cannot get it replaced. I am really unhappy with product. I recommend buy a Dell / HP wireless combos."
5,"Some Chinese brands still stick to India because of this kind of product. Even lowest price the combo is decent and outstanding.What I liked:Build quality: Feels niceThe size of the keyboard, (11 X 5.5 X 3/4 Inches)Light-weight (350 g)Easy to carry in a daily backpack, laptop bag, office bagSilent keypress (except Spacebar key)Mouse buttons and wheel is really smoothRequired only two AA sized batteryGood wireless range (up to 8 meters I tested and works fine)No visible LASER flash in mouseAuto sleep if being not used for few minutesWhat I didn't like:No button to switch off the mouse or keyboard, If the dongle is attached to my tablet, a slight movement cause wake up the screen.The thing to ignore:Chinese product (I didn't find an alternate)No numerical keyboard, this is a small keyboard that does not have all the keys that you found on a full-size keyboard.Overall Value for money, Compact, Lightweight, must have."
3,"Everything is good except the packaging because the outer carton was damaged & also the batteries were missing as there is a slot inside which means the sellers open the packed products & take out the batteries before they dispatch the product.1.The product feels a bit plasticy but still the manufacturer has used good plastic.2. Buttons are smooth & big in size so I didn't find any problem while typing.3. Mouse is good, no clicking sound which annoys me a lot also it's IR so no red light which is also annoying.4. It's made in China so people who are against Chinese products please don't waste your money but if you consider product & not the country of origin than its a best option you can go with."
4,"Product looks attractive. Also Keyboard is compact in shape. Has nice smoother keys. Only drawback I found was the right hand side Shift key which is very small in size. Hence when if you want to type any capital letter, then it will be little bit difficult since I am used to normal keyboard with large Shift key and hence I dont have to find out the shift key, my finger automatically goes to Shift key. But in this keyboard, due to small size Shift key, It becomes little bit difficult.Otherwise product is really Good. Mouse is extremely good and silent, buttery smooth.One thing I want to mention is that the nano receiver can be found on the backside of mouse, near the  battery compartment."
5,"it doesn't have on/off.  But it goes to sleep on 3 minutes of inactivity.  if you are a hard user of the keyboard, then it's not the right one.  This is a tiny & easily portable keyboard for very light use.  The mouse is perfect the color and precision are completely good.The seller should provide batteries.  which was missing in my case.  Amazon customer care asked for a replacement.  But the package cost for replacement is more than the 2 AA-sized batteries it depends on you to go for a replacement for missing items.It is worth at its cost & I got the blue one for 989/- (batteries missing)"
3,"I have been using this product for over week now. Overall its a OK product. Keys are soft touch but it has some big problems with the key setup on the right -THE RIGHT SHIFT KEY IS HALF SIZED as compared to enter key. For users typing with both hands and having habit of using right shift key, this is highly inconvenient. It is almost impossible to press right shift and middle characters like y, h, n etc.Printscreen is in second last row. They could have skipped some of the worthless keys like right click and made shift key the same size as enter key.Mouse is silent, but the scroll ball has started making some noise when scrolling from bottom to top."
5,The plastic isn't the greatest ...The battery cap on the keyboard looks like a Chinese toy ( well it's made in china).Keyboard and mouse are extremely soft ..And that's why not at all suitable for gamingCons.Very soft keys .The reciver looks fragile.Slow Out of the box dpi.Pros.Looks great üëçThe keys are nicely spacedMouse is very comfortable to hold .Warrenty seems legitVery portableJust require 2AA battery (one for mouse/one for keyboard)Seems durable ( will let you know if it breaks ...I use stuff rough )I would recommend going for Logitech ( costs 500-1000 rs more)But I don't see the point wasting your money ..Overall. .go for it
1,"The keyboard and mouse look great. It's great to have if you want something aesthetic. If you plan to work with the mouse, you may be in a bit of a pickle. As the title says, the mouse is not working anymore. You have to click several times to make the cursor visible. Even after that, it works for one click only.You know those games where you have a limited number of lives, and if you lose them all, you have to wait for a long time till you can play the game again. Using this mouse will give you those exact feelings.  With this mouse, it's all about strategy. Think of the most important application/file/folder you want to use. Once you've finalized your decision, click the mouse. If you're lucky, you'll be able to do what you wanted to do. Else wait for another 15-20 mins till the mouse decides (yes, the mouse is the boss now. It owns you.) whether you be given a chance to click again.I guess it's a matter of days till the keyboard also takes over and allows me to use only certain keys at certain points in time.Overall, I am unhappy with the purchase. I should have invested in something much more durable, even if it had cost a bit more.I would recommend you to buy a keyboard/mouse set from a more reliable brand."
5,"Color combination is great, and easy to hold and carry together anywhere. Mouse is very silent that even you don't feel the click sound. It is working even on glossy surface where Logitech mouse works with glitches.Update : after using it for a week, i notices that the mouse roller is little bit disoriented thought it is working fine, but just in look it is slightly on the right side, you can see in picture. And there are some scratches on mouse which i have seen only after checking it from every angle, though they are not much bigger but just to mention. Otherwise functionality wise it is working smooth and perfect."
4,"You get this combo at an affordable Price 999/-, This is my honest Review.Pros:1) You need only two batteries for keyboard and mouse.2) Portable Keyboard, fits in any laptop bag.3) Noiseless mouse, Bang on for this Price!4) Good looking combo and decent quality.Cons:1) Caps lock light should have been an added advantage.2) Few keys were not in regular places, might need time to get used.3) No Key to turn on/off the keyboard and mouseVerdict:Stylish, Portable and Affordable but it might take sometime to get used with the Keyboard!!!"
5,"If you are looking for a small wireless keyboard and mouse ,then go a head with this. Portronics has maintained a good quality, the key press is very soft and smooth. Gaming can be a bit compromised but day to day use is great. The colour combination is very attractive. Amazon delivery and packaging is awesome.  Definitely will recommend üëç"
4,Pros :- Product is awsome. Build quality is good both of mouse and keyboard. Mouse is very light with no red light blink and noiseless clicks.Keyborad design is same like apple keyboard and buttons are soft and not so noisy. Shortcut keys provided. Range is great. No connectivity issue on any device. I use it on my lappy n on my smart tv. Works like maska. 1 year warranty. Small n compact size.Cons :- No battery provided. 1 AA battery required in both mouse n keyboard. Else everything is good.
3,"Pros :-- Good looking even with budget plastic build-- Compact in size for carrying-- Works with any bluetooth device, can work with tablets as well-- Seamless connect & startCons:-- Keyboard is very small, slightly smaller than laptop keywords.-- Keyboard has some changes in key layout, e.g. right shift key is very  small. Becomes confusing at time."
5,"This keyboard mouse pair is highly ergonomic, and looks stunningly beautiful.Especially the mouse is very easy on my wrists.The best part about these two is the fact that they have a soundless operation!I had never before used a mouse that didn't make a 'click' sound.Thanks to this, I can use these in my bedroom without disturbing the sleep of others aorund me."
3,"The keyboard is having little ergonomic comfort since keys size is small and mind you shall make lot of typos while typing on this when compared to usual keyboard.No Home, End , Pgup, Pgdwn keys there. You should use autohotkey.exe to assign a key combination. Mouse is not ergonomic enough to use long periods. Buy a mouse pad.Final verdict : dissatisfied."
3,"Not everyone uses the right shift key, but for someone like me who types a lot, this is not the keyboard.  There is Printscreen button in place of right shift key and I ended up taking a screenshot of the screen quite often.Other than that, it is a very good keyboard+mouse combo both aesthetically pleasing and worth the money paid.But returning due to key misplacement, that too I have to courier it to Portronics. Really bad of Amazon for not picking up the return."
1,It was listed 'Countey of origin is INDIA' but actually it is made in CHINA.
2,Though typing is good it is made of a cheap plastic like a doll keyboard
1,again sent china product
1,Not working
5,"It's (near)perfect.Initial impressions(3 days of use) -Has enough travel and feedback on from the keys - they're far better than my laptop's keyboard.Works with UbuntuThe paint on the keys is solid matte black, doesn't scratch/pick fingerprints/get dirty easily, fonts are clear and legible.Has controls for brightness(3 levels) and dedicated Backlight on/off key(keys aren't evenly lit, but that's not a deal breaker for me)Learnt to 90% touch type in 2 days(Didn't touch type before, now I do!)I ordered it as I found this to be the cheapest non-RGB backlit option - the closest one was a Logitech costing 2.5k, which is way out of reach for me. This turned out to be a great purchase."
3,"I ordered this product few months back. But due to lockdown it's shipping stopped midway and my order got returned. After lockdown I placed the order again. After receiving the product, I got quite excited to see a backlit keyboard at just around Rs.800. But as I tried typing something the keyboard just wobbled like anything. I then realized that the bottom surface of the keyboard is uneven. All the four legs (I don't know what to call them) don't touch my table surface at the same time. Since it has been around 3 months that I have been trying to get this keyboard on my hand, I had no mood of returning it and waiting for another to arrive. I instead taped some thermocol under the shorter leg (shown in the pic).The typing feels decent enough. The backlit is good. It has 3 brightness levels. The KB doesn't feel premium at all. Also, there is no dedicated button for media controls. Simply to increase or decrease the volume (which is the highest used media controls) you would need two hands, as because, the distance between the FN key and the volume keys are far enough to comfortably control it with a single hand. It'd have been better if the FN key could have been toggled (ON/OFF). This feature can still be possible to provide through a software.Altogether the experience was bitter than sweet. But, getting used to it day by day. I hope Fingers take my points into consideration. I still appreciate them for providing a backlit KB at such a minimal price point."
5,"I went through the reviews before buying the product. Despite what some of the reviewers wrote, this keyboard makes very less noise, it was actually making less noise than my previous Lenovo keyboard. Since my hands are big< I didn't get issues on muting the volume on keyboard. Also, I just wanted a simple backlit keyboard as per my budget so a basic moonlight keyboard with a on/off switch worked well for me. It really is very sleek looking and polished. Worth a buy for those who don't want to spend more than a thousand."
5,"Ordered it as an external keyboard and it's quite big!Built quality is durable, posting this review after 2 month, working flawlessly.It was 3 brightness levels which can be toggled using Fn+Page up/Page down combination, also has a breathing light mode.Keys are working fine, but it's not designed for very fast typing, for casual to medium usage it's really awesome.Go for it, this is the best Non-RGB keyboard for ‚Çπ850. Satisfied üíØ"
3,"The build quality is great, the backlights are uneven but not a deal-breaker (I just mostly use it in the dark). The keyboard is slim and looks great for setups too. I don't use it much often only at night when everyone is asleep and I don't want to wake them up but using a loud mechanical keyboard so at night I switch to this keyboard.The key presses are little rough the key sometimes get suck pressed it. The typing experience is not great but it is justifiable by its price (with backlights). There aren't many backlit keyboards at this price at least not in India."
3,"Some keys get stuck while typing. Most irritating is the backspace key. Multiple deletion occurs and is annoying. The keys are also very wobbly.The lighting is faded as the paint job on the keys is very bad, it's splattered on the edges, which makes them more opaque than transparent.If non-RGB backlight is the ONLY requirement, go for it. Otherwise, go for a better keyboard from reputable brands."
1,"Look at the audacity of the seller(no returns allowed), the product gives a subpar typing experience keys get stuck some are loose some are tight no uniformity whatsoever. Keyboard itself is not stable wobbles with or without stand yet i am not entitled for a replacement or return"
4,"It;s a keyboard and it works. No drama. BUT it is a membrane keyboard and the keys are nowhere effortless. I use it with a Lenovo legion. No comparison. I also got a Cooler Master Masterkeys Pro L with white LEDs (another story there, please see my review). again no comparison.The upside is that it works. If you need a keyboard with backlighting. This is the cheapest. As far as typing feel goes, you'd be better off going with Logitech or the like."
5,This one has to be the best keyboard I have ever used. Lights are just perfect to work in a dark room. It has a premium look and feel. Keystrokes are smooth with a nice sound! Go for it!
4,"This review is after using it for almost 4 months.1.Made in China.2. Saw some of the review that keys don't make sound, but that's not true. Keys make noise while typing.3.Major drawback is some of the keys get stuck or the key stroke doesn't apply. In a nutshell the keys are not smooth for operation.4.Painting on the keys are coming off(photo attached)5.Backlit LED is is the only thing that I liked in this keyboard."
5,"USAGE:More than a Month while writing this review.LIKES:Only Backlit Keyboard for Rs. 800+.Three Levels of Brightness ( Need to use Function + Page Up / Down Keys )Quality is goodKey press is smoothLooks nice while backlight is on ( My 3 years old son often comes to my table and switches on the backlight and enjoys the display )DISLIKES:Space Bar Key is making sound while fast / continuous typing, but ok.Wire is not as strong as Logitech, but unless you don't frequently plug out and in the wire, it should be ok.Uneven Brightness."
2,"I am writing this review using the Magnifico. Fairly compact and lightweight. It is very silent (except for the space-bar), just like a laptop keyboard. The brightness of the back light is just right. There is some very minor unevenness in the back light and the brightness level is not adjustable. But these are non-issues for me.Update after 3 months of usage: The keyboard is not as silent as it was in the beginning. Some keys need to be pressed right in the center, otherwise they are very hard to press and don't work."
5,I work in dark room on videos for color Grading and was looking for a non-RGB backlit keyboard.This was the only one I found on Amazon.It has 3 brightness levels and a a dedicated button to turn off the lights. Works well with both my MacBook and Windows desktop.
2,"backlit is good. but the light keeps on turning off. typing delay sometimes. key-ppppppppppppppppppppress issue. you can see the 'p''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''thinking about  return.and most importantly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,the warranty is not approved because the invoice missing serial number"
4,Within a few minutes of using this keyboard I can say the keyboard itself feels very nice. It feels premium. The keys are quiet. There are 3 brightness levels adjustable with the fn+ page up/page down keys. You can also turn off the light using the brightness key next to fn. This is good when you are watching a movie and don't want any light on the keys.There are two negatives. The usb cable itself doesn't have a premium feel. The lighting is not perfectly uniform across all keys. This lack of uniformity doesn't look bad. It's not something that bothers you. In fact I like the slight unevennesses. Just thought I'd mention it.Overall I'd recommend it.
1,"""Esc"" key not working!""Alt"" + ""Tab"" that is used to switch between open applications in windows not working!If you want to keep it as a display piece, it'll look great! Very elegant. But can't use it for practical purposes for above mentioned reasons.Can't return the product since seller doesn't allow. Stuck with this thing now! :-("
3,Only issues i had with this product was it that :-1. Made a lot of noise specially the space bar. Couldn't bear it.2. Some of the button had to pressed right at its center to actually work else it would get some what get stuck and do not read the I/O (sort of mechanical board)Best part was its backlit. controlled and very good to work at night time. Also one can set the backlit levels. Kudos for this at such price.
3,Not a bad product. Lights are nice but misses something for me. Light are fractionally unevely lit & lighted portion lacks minor finishing that lies below blackened keys. Felt little above average to me but not awesome. Doesnt feel like a keyboard of a premium brand for me. Just personal preferences.
4,Good keyboard. The one i received does not look like images shown on amazon. So i misunderstood it as a normal keyboard. Then I got replaced it with same keyboard later on i figured it out that u have to press scroll button to light the keyboard. Keyboard is smooth and every thing is working well.
5,"Using Extensively from last 12 days1. White Backlit  : A great eye cooling effect  much more better than malty color rubbish costly ketboard2. Full size keyboard : No need for woory3. Backlit with 3 brightness label  Using the Fn+Page up/Down key combinations4. MOST ECONOMICAL - : UNDER 900 Rs. nobody expect this much quality5. Switch on off is very simple - in day time is can be off - in night time it can be turn ON6. I ALREADY REFER 6 FRIENDS to try this keyboard7. Yes, I remember the SONG of MD RAFI SAAB'S  '' CHAUDHVI KA CHAND '' -- WHICH IS PERFECT TO DESCRIBE THE VALUE AND PROS of this amazing father touch SILENT MEMBER of my FAMILY"
2,"I bought this backlit keyboard for smooth typing in the dark. The back lighting is good, however the keys are clunky and tend to get stuck or do not get pressed with normal typing pressure. This just kills your typing speed and many letters get missed leading to total chaos. I am throwing this keyboard out and replacing it with a good one that allows me to type smoothly."
5,"VERY CLEAR BACKLIT, earlier I used Cooler Master backlit keyboard, the backlit LEDs were blue and were less visible and that stopped working in a very short duration. But Fingers Magnifico Moonlit Backlit Wired USB Keyboardis working fine so far"
5,"Received the keyboard in good package and condition though delivery was 2days delayed.  Product is as expected after 2days of using the I am writing this review,  this is the perfect keyboard with very good glowing keys visible during night time without room lighting,  which is what I was looking for.  Keys are much better than laptop keyboard,  back light is awesome.  I have attached video recorded night time without room lighting,  its awesome.  I recommend this product to everyone looking for keyboard who can afford little more than normal keyboards without backlight,  go for it,  it is useful with/without room lighting. Price would seem little high before you but but once you see the product it is reasonable price compared to other type of backlit keyboards which have different color of lights but not really backlit."
5,"Best keyboard with backlit for this price. Made in China but Fingers is a new Indian company with some new innovative products. The backlit has 3 brightness level, which can be controlled via Fn+Pg Up/Down keys. Also it can be turned off using the lights (sun symbol next to Fn key) key. Overall very happy with this purchase."
4,"This is what I needed !!Simple moon bklit, minimal noise, key denounce/mechanical feel good. Coding during night time feels good with this keyboard ü§òImprovement: key bcklit does not feel even, that may be bcoz of during spray/brush painting over key light emitting area of key is also getting coloured/brushed bit.But this just improvement not bloker for thos who want to purchase.Definately go for it, worth every penny !"
4,Minor issues like paint quality etc do exist but frankly they don't matter. Can conveniently use this in a dark room without weird coloured back-lit - white is simply better than other colours. Good quick access keys etc. Keys press much like a laptop - which is better for those who're used to laptops vs typewriters (I prefer this). Could've been a little curved and could've had a right-click/context menu button - that's my only complaint.
5,"If you work in dark rooms, buy this. But, if you have no light issue, go for HP or Dell keyboard. I am live in a dark room. So, I bought this. And its quality is pretty good. The lighted keyboard was looking gorgeous. This keyboard is low-sounded. The keys were very smooth and did not get dirty easily. So, if you want to buy this for light purpose, just go and buy it."
5,"If you are looking for these features, just go ahead and buy this keyboard. Dell and other Chiclet keyboards are not only costly but stand nowhere compared to the tying experience of this keyboard. The backlit feature is what I was manily looking for, but I got a lot more than that. Beautiful keyboard this is."
5,- SUPERB KEYS- GREAT BACK-LIGHT WITH BRIGHTNESS ADJUSTMENT- GREAT KEYBOARD FOR TYPING FOR LONG HOURS AND FOR FAST TYPING AS WELL- EXCELLENT BUILD- I ALSO TESTED FOR TYPING EFFICACY USING A TYPING TEST AND MY TYPING SPEED WAS ALMOST AT PAR WITH A REGULAR KEYBOARD.
3,"I am a software developer and I need to work night shifts, so a keyboard with a backlight was a must for my use. I was using a laptop integrated keyboard, but I was not more comfortable doing typing for long hours due to its small size (14'' laptop). So after searching I found the only non-RGB backlit keyboard on the internet. I purchased it and after using it for around a month, the only con which I experience in this keyboard is that keys are hard to press compared to branded keyboards available. I have used Dell, HP and Logitech keyboards. they are far better at typing compared to this keyboard, but none of them offers white backlit. So, no option other than this. Else it's not a bad deal at this price."
5,Great product. Go for it. I use it for gaming and it works well. I got it at a price that seemed slightly higher but I have a good product that works to expectations. Keys are soft and yet sturdy. Backlight works with three different brightness levels. Highly satisfied as of now.
5,solves the purpose and soft keysyou can get any baclite keyboard at this price so no need to cry about quality.still it is perfectly working and led brightness is perfect. i found keys are too soft else i am using everyday since 3 months. and working like charm
4,"Lacks what's needed in a keyboard and that's smoothness of the keys.Sound is less, light is beautiful and most of all, the size is lovely as it doesn't occupy much space on the desk unlike the other backlit keyboards.For writers or coders, this keyboard would be a little trouble only because of a little harsh keys. But, if you get a hold of it, it'd be great."
4,"Keys aint smooth. have missed keystrokes. Hoped for a good Linear keyboard with good back light. Got the backlight, but truthfully a little disappointed by the lack of Linear-ness of this keyboard."
5,Excellent product at the right price for those who want a backlit keyboard.It is simply efficient at silent typing as well as gaming.The light can be turned on and off at a press of a button. Much much better than any tacky RGB flashing keyboards which are overpriced. Very happy with this purchase.
4,Not uniformly lit throughout but that doesn‚Äôt bother much the 3 levels of brightness and the feel of keyboard is great. The white light is really helpful for me as RGB is distracting and mostly because I am not a gamer.  The price at which the keyboard is available leaves me no chance of complaint. But one thing do test all the keys after delivery. I GOT A FAULTY ONE BUT GOT THAT REPLACED.
3,So I purchased this keyboard because I always wanted a backlit keyboard for my setup. It's design is very good and backlit light is very good but there is a issue with this keyboard. It's keys started to stuck after few months of usage. I don't know if I exceeded 10 millions keystrokes in this period of time but I couldn't use it after the keys became hard to press.
5,Very good product. I had bought a Logitech and some of the keys stopped working. I contacted the Logitech Customer Care and they were not available in Jodhpur. I had to courier it to them and the cost of that was almost half of the total price of a keyboard. I looked online and decided to buy this keyboard with back light so that I can work at night.The product build quality is better than Logitech. The keys are good and the back lighting is perfect for work at night.
5,I was hesitant in buying this product because it‚Äôs a new company but all the good reviews compelled me and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed.The keyboard is beautifully lit and has soft keys that are almost noiseless.I work nights and this enables me to keep the light and sound low for others sleeping in the room. I could barely see the keys on my noisy old keyboard placed above the new one in the picture. Not to mention how cost effective this is. Let‚Äôs hope it lasts.
4,"works on a non powered USB hub that has a mouse, pen-drive, and this keyboard connected from a laptop USB port.no signal loss experienced even when the laptop was running on batteries.only down side is - cant register for the warranty on the official website."
5,"No doubt, Its a 5 star product but it comes with its own set of minor issues which may affect certain set of users only.Rest its a wonderful product from Logitech. You get full functional keybaord in small comfortable to carry package with every required key on board. Typing is a breeze on this keybaord with soft responsive keys.UNBOXING1. Keyboard2. USB unifying receiver3. 2 AAA batteries pre installed (pull off white pullout from batteries, to power up keyboard)4. Two extra battery covers to choose your flavor (in all pink, blue, white)PROS:1. Full qwerty keyboard with numpad2. Keys are soft & responsive with proper feedback3. Full row of function keys with alternate shortcuts4. Light weight & overall small profile for easy carry on5. Comes with unifying receiver (look below for details)6. Nice looks, though not premium7. Good quality wrt soul porpose of keyboard ie typing8. Battery test: Working properly since 15th oct. Rest for how long it lasts, time will tell. Logitech claims 2 yr life, but i will update my review whenever battery replacement is required. Just for an idea, my mouse lasts for upto a year with single duracell, so we can expect good life from keyboard also.9. Upper arrow key is slightly projected, for easy identification in cramped layout of arrow keys. But you need to get used to it.10. Plug n play. Easy setup. Just connect & use.11. Works good with smartphone & smart tv also. Infact no setup required in case of android device, be it tv or mobile. Just plug in receiver & both keyboard & mouse will work without any issues.12. Price bracket. If you get to grab it on lightening deal, then its cherry on cake.CONS:1. Slightly thick profile especially in front zone, that too without a wrist rest, so may feel uncomfortable in long typing sessions.2. No caps, num, indicator, so you need to rely on software based on screen caps indicator. (in my case, my laptops own keyboard has caps led, so it indicates caps status)3. Would have preferred full size arrow keys. They could have reduced size of shifft key instead to accomodate. To cover all keys in small package, they have highly customized the layout. It will take time to get adjusted to it.4. Slight flex  in lower middle zone near space key due to improper height of mid zone rest pads. Theres 1-2 mm gap below them when keyboard rests on flat surface. So it can be fixed.5. Some basic fn shortcuts missing as per laptop perspective.-Theres this software named Setpoint by logitech available from product download page which you can use to customise FN + Function keys shortcuts. But you wont find setting to add brightness +/-, wifi toggle, touchpad toggle, projector etc. Its havving general shortcuts like my comp, copy paste, play pause, control panel, page up down etc.UNIFYING RECEIVER:It allows upto 6 compatible devices to connect to computer with just one receiver. Look for unifying symbol on device (orange square patch with clear asterisk mark) (pic attached)For easy setup,1. Install unifying software from logitech2. Start it and click on advanced3. Click on pair & follow on screen instructions4. All connected devices will be listed(Alternatively you can also follow direct steps on screen & click on next)Tested on Logitech B175 mouse & working properly. Both keyboard & mouse seamlessly connect to unifying receiver. B175 comes with normal reciever, but mouse is compatible with unifying technology.GENUINITY:Some users have commented on receiving fake or first copy product. I have received genuine product, successfully registered on Logitec site without any issue.Advice: Be carefull while choosing seller, to avvoid issues like this, check their ratings, amazon fulfilled tag etc. So far i had an awesome experience with Appario Retail.FINAL VERDICT:Its a perfect low cost, compact & effective device. You wont regret getting it. Its pros outweigh its cons. Havent faced any serious issue so far. Its all good & perfect company for may Dell XPS L502x."
4,"Its a nice keyboard and works great.PROS:1 light weight and compact2 unifying supported3 long lasting with batteries(24 months)CONS:1 has a bit flex when typing in center of the keyboard2 the stickers on keys are very reflective and not visible properly some time.3 has no indication leds for caps, num and locks4 up and down arrows are smallOverall a nice keyboard and would suggest if u can compromise few features for compactness and wireless."
1,"Do not buy this product. its fake.I got a duplicate item ,failed to register on logitech site.Logo  on the product differ from the original logitech logo even though the product in the picture given here has original logo ."
1,"Have purchased the product on 10 Aug 2017, On 25th aug  keys of O,I S,E & more keys has stopped working. on 29 Aug after talking to customer service they refused to replace the product..Very very bad product...please do not purchase...."
3,"Here is my review in 7 points1-Keyboard is compact. But not for gamers2-Good portability and lightweight3-Key press is normal. Neither soft not hard (see the video review)4-Since it is compact, one will need to get used to the keys. If you have big fingers, then this one is surely not for you5-The scroll keys are very small and as again, little hard to find. You somehow slip the tap and finger goes to adjacent key6- Unifying receiver works very smoothly with Logitech mouse7-Now comes the last and important point. There is flaw with the battery cover. It is not at all sturdy and pops out with a small pressure. Meaning that the locking is not that good. Even if you are carrying it for example, in the bag, it is surely going to fall offThanks for reading the review. Hope you find it useful"
1,This one is not working . What do I do now ? It never worked from the beginning . I was waiting for my computer person . And now I can't return it also . What do I do ? Will never buy electronics from Amazon
5,"Excellent keyboard specially for Laptop users.Pros:- Compact & Stylish design, looks nice.- Lightweight but sturdy build. Almost silent keys.- Matches 15"" Laptop keyboard layout, joy for Laptop users.- Unifying Receiver, 2 AAA Batteries, 2 extra Battery Compartment Panels provided.- Simple Plug-&-Play setup, fast link-up with receiver, single receiver caters to upto 6 Unifying supported devices.- On-Off Switch and prop-up legs at the bottom, slot on the side to carry Unifying Receiver.- 2 Years battery life as claimed by Logitech with Auto-Sleep function. Only time will tell the actual findings with about 8 hours per day usage.Cons:- Standard Desktop Keyboard users might take little time to getting used to this one because of its compact size.- As a Laptop Keyboard, back-lit keys would have been a great help while working late nights.- Caps Lock key could have been smaller and Enter key could have been bigger.Overall a great purchase. Value for money."
5,"I have been using this for few months now it works really smooth and fast, despite being wireless you don't feel any lag in sending inputs to machine or neither in connecting, you just slide the on/off switch and it works in milliseconds.. no hassle ..And batteries are like you just forget there are any.. never had to change them(yet).Key's are pretty well but a little small in case you have big fingers, also those multi colour side panels looks wonderful.. just buy it..!!!"
5,"Pros : Before i purchased it,  i used K220. This K230 is just an upgrade of the previous one. Very compact in size. We can use both Desktop and Laptop. We can hold it in our laptop bag during travelling. Those who are having the ability of speed typing, should purchase this product. Another one an important pros is they have made the SHIFT key as its original size. some immature keyboard manufacturer built the shift key as small size along with the nearest button of [ | \ ]. During speed typing, our finger may typed [ | \ ]button instead of shift key. But this key board built in correctly.  CONS: 1) There is no led light in Capslock key. 2) We need to hold FN button + printscreen, during capturing any screenshot instead of single print screen button."
1,"Initially the keyboard was good, now the keys are not functioning properly. I have to press really hard to make the keys work. It's not just one or two alphabets but most of the alphabets are having the same issue. This is not a durable product. I am forced to change my initial review."
1,worked fine only for a few days. post which either the shift key or the ctrl key would get stuck and cause issues with typing. Not at all expected from logitech
4,"i brought this keyboard for 650rs during a deal. and i still consider this as one of the best wireless keyboards under 1000rs but still it has some cons. now lets look at its  pros and coneslets starts with the pros‚óí it is one of the smallest full sized keyboard with a number pad, you can easily carry it around in your laptop bag‚óí i heard the battery life is awesome and it uses 2 regular AAA batterys which are cheaply available in the market‚óí it is from a trusted company and my previous experience with Logitech customer service is good‚óí you will get a slot to keep the dongle  in the keyboard itself and you will also get 3 interchangeable battery covers with the keyboard‚óí i didnt face any connection issues or lag while using the keyboardnow coming to the cons‚óì the frame of the keyboard is week and you may get irritated with it flex while typing especially with the stands on‚óì the navigation keys have an odd shape and its hard to use the up arrow properly‚óì overall the quality of the materials feels cheap and i don't think it can survive a drop or rough use, so you will have to use it carefully‚óì  if you intend to play games with it, just don't. then i will suggest to buy something wired or invest more to get something more rugged‚óì overall if you are looking for a wireless keyboard you can carry around in your bag you may go with this one. But as i said this is not intended for gaming or rough use if this review helped you please press that helpful buttonUpdate after 6 monthsEven after six months  of use the keyboard is working perfectly and i didnt have to change the batterys yet. That battery cover gets easly scratched though (images are included)"
1,"Those who r giving high rating have any idea of how a keyboard should be? Why we use a keyboard?If you are buying the keyboard for general browsing then this keyboard is ok but you if use the keyboard for writing blogs, journal or writing assignments then this keyboard is not for you.The keyboard is flexible like rubber. Not stable at all. Compactness and flexibility make sure that your typing is full of errors because you can't be sure which key you are pressing as the keyboard is flexed. I am surprised why can't they make a stable/hard base.If portability is the only requirement then you go for this else don't waste your money. Don't even buy this as a backup keyboard for an emergency, ‚Çπ100 local USB keyboard will work far better than this one."
4,"Logitech K230 is a wireless keyboard that comes with some interesting features. It is a compact keyboard which is  smaller as compared to the other keyboards. It is an affordable wireless keyboard and here, we take a look at its pros and cons:PROS.#.Good Wireless Connectivity.#.Security-128-bit AES Encryption#.Long Battery Life#.Travel Companion.#.Plug And Play.#.Value for money#Compact Design.CONS.#Some Fn Shortcut Keys Are Missing.Moreover it comes with 3 years warranty, which is quiet goods. Overall its good product to buy for daily use."
5,I liked below:Compact SizeNumber pad like normal keyboardSmooth and big buttonsUnifying receiver to connect 6 unifying wireless devices. (same unifying receiver of my keyboard paired with my old wireless logitech mouse without any hassle. Both the new kew board and the old wireless mouse working like a combo unit using single unifying receiver supplied with the unit)I did not like:There is no On/Off marking at the power switch at the back panel. I had to use external marker to note on/off of the unit.
1,I absolutely HATE it!I didn't return it right away as I waited to acclimatize to its HORRIBLE key placement - truth is even today after nearly 8 months of use I still have to look at the keyboard to hit the Delete & Backspace key.The reduced size is good to look at and also makes for a cute product shot but the buck stops there.
4,"It's not a deal maker or a deal breaker. It simply gets the work done, hands down. Numeric keypad is useful in such a compact size. Light weight makes it portable. You get two different coloured battery covers (on the left) as spare or to customize your needs.Logitech Unifying receiver is an added advantage as I am already using a Logitech wireless mouse. Just download the Logitech Unifying utility software and pair both devices to either of the receiver. Arrow keys are a bit small but I think you'll get accustomed to it. No Caps, Num, Scroll lights, but yeah there's FN key atleast. I think, you can't ask for much from Logitech at this price."
1,I am not sure how this is rated so high yet a poor choice compared to other keyboards.1. The size of the keyboard is smaller than typically expected. You have to squeeze your hands to type and it is inconvenient.2. The keys on the lower row can easily come off in few months as it is not covered.It falls short on ergonomics and nowhere good for anyone who wants to type for a long time / with ease.3. The key tap is neither soft nor quiet.4. The product description image looks nice but it is a cheap plastic.4 You can replace but you cannot return this itemI wanted to replace my Dell keyboard for a better one but after buying this I started to like Dell keyboard better.
5,"PRODUCT DESCRIPTION - Logitech's very sleek, compact yet spacious, smartly designed keyboard. Its black in colour with Logitech written in grey strip (also complimentary blue and pink Logitech strip offered) branding on left side of the keyboard under which you have batteries. Battery placement was quite impressive. No need to toss your keyboard for battery replacememt. So it's been 2 months plus and I have no complains whatsoever. Working smooth. The spacing between alphabets/numericals is good for easy typing. ""Ergonomically designed"" with raised buttons. The range keyboard covers is jaw-dropping (pretty huge distance between desktop on study table and keyboard on bed and still works wonderful during movie times). Keyboard can be kept at an angle for more height/ comfortable typing with the help of brackets given backside of the keyboard. Requires gentle pressing of keys. User-friendly, hassle-free, does not require any Installation of software to be done. Compatible with almost all laptops/desktops I believe. No flaws found.BRAND - One can blindly trust Logitech. True to its claims and functions and does the job.SELLER - Sold by ""Appario Retail Pvt Ltd"". Nicely bubble wrapped and delivered.PRICE - It's high but against quality given its totally worth every penny. Its a long time investment.DELIVERY - Was on time and as expected.PS - Keyboard is provided with set of batteries."
3,"The keyboard got problems within a month of purchase - a few keys started working on their own, without pressing them, making the keyboard useless. Fortunately the Logitech Service Center in my city replaced it with a new one on the same day.Pros:1. Small & compact.2. Comes with a Unifying Receiver and Unifying support. So can be used with other Logitech Unifying supported devices with only a single receiver plugged in. I use my mouse (Logitech M235) such.3. Has a Numeric keypad.4. Logitech service is good as they provide replacement asap. And there's a 3 year warranty.Cons:1. No Caps lock on/off indicator. Same with Num lock.2. Flex in middle part of keyboard.3. Placement of certain keys is not good."
4,"Keyboard is compact, takes very little desk space and looks sleek.The keys are soft and its Great for typing.Ignore the reviews posted that it's not good for gaming. I've played warzone, fortnite etc. And faced no issues.Although while gaming it has key ghosting if more that 6-7 keys are pressed at the same time. Not an issue for most games your left hand has only 5 fingers.Latency: No issues, Modern wireless keyboards have come far as to face not such delayed response times. I can say the same for this keyboard as well.It'll take a few days to get used to."
1,"It's a pathetic keyboard. Coming from Logitech such substandard quality is a surprise to me! I ordered one and post receipt I realised that no matter how close or far you are from the PC, the keypad is unable to transmit properly thereby resulting in half of the things not being typed properly. Post pressing a particular key, its takes about 2-3 seconds for it to appear on the screen. And sometimes it doesn't even appear and to top it, the same letter appears continuously on the screen despite releasing the key.I returned the item and ordered a new unit. The new unit behaved well for a week or so and thereafter it too started giving the same problem. I think there is some fundamental problem with the design of the keyboard. I tried the keyboard on both my laptop as well as my PC but the problem persisted. Now with the return window closed, I am stuck with this defective item which works as per its own whims and fancies, typing and churning out letters on its own once a particular key is pressed.Overall a bad piece of equipment coming from a renowned brand such as Logitech.Bottom line: Don't buy it. It's a complete waste of money and is useless since it cannot be used even for basic typing without getting frustrated."
5,"Product came with clean packing. The adapter and keyboard wqs well packed. Comes with 2 AAA batter fitted itself in keyboard one had to pull the paper tags to make it working.Now coming to the product. Product is working fine. Those who complaining about the product should visit logitech website and download the required software. You should also update the adapter firmware as it will smooth your experiences. And also download the software for keyboard which will help you to customise the shortcuts. Overall a great product. Buy without any doubt because according to price it good.Just one complain keys like shift , enter , arrow and , ptrscr , scroll etc is very very small . But if one need just the keyboatd for the sake of doing few stuffs its a good go.I am not a gamer so won't be able to say how it behaves in games. I don't switch off this device as it has auto sleep feature which i guess works great . Using since 15 days working great till now. Registered on logitech website product shown as genuine and got registered."
4,"Bought this keyboard as I wanted a keyboard which is unifying receiver ready.  Not only is the keyboard unifying receiver ready, it actually comes with a unifying receiver making it a bargain for Rs. 699/-I did not use the receiver that came with the keyboard; instead paired it with an existing receiver to which all my other keyboards and mice are paired.Keyboard has been working as expected and quality is good as you would expect from a Logitech product.The keyboard is great for cramped spaces and is also a good choice if you have to move around the keyboard or would travel with it.The issue with the compact dimension is that keys are space closer to each other and spacing is different from other keyboards including other Logitech keyboards.  The function keys, cursor keys and Home/End/Pg Up / Pg Down keys are also smaller and these together can introduce typos when you are touch typing, i.e., typing without looking at the keyboard.  I am hoping that the error rate will come down as I get used to the keyboard.  Will update the review based on usage."
3,"Cursor key is one of the most used key for gaming/ documents and it is the most badly placed key in this keyboard .. it almost impossible to hit upper arrow with pressing any additional button with it. its kind of frustrating. and as amazon do not have return facility, Its useless product for me. I even trust to sell it as low as 500 but the next person returned it just after use of 30 minutes due to the same problem.  That much annoying design it has. Dont look as the cheapest price tag for logitech keyboard. It is one of the worst of logitech. I have 7 keyboard mouse of logitech and they all works fantabulous but this one Sucks."
4,"This keyboard was perfect suit for my needs. I needed one that fits on my table and isn't stretched across the table. This kind of gives a feel of the 14"" laptop keypad. Its easy to type and occupies less space. Some of the pro's and con's after a month of use -Pro's:1. connects in a flash. the USB nano head comes with a small asterisk painted on top to indicate which side should be plugged into the PC. Does not fumble while plugging it in. Once plugged the connectivity is instant. Did not observe any lag in typing and keystrokes reflected on screen.2. Extremely compact. Got all the keys crammed in. Easy to type3. Convenient - easy to carry around and also occupies less space on the table topCon's:1. Certain utilitarian keys are missing. e.g. The right click key, backlight to indicate whether caps or num-lock is on2. the arrow keys usage needs some practice and skill3. Due to its compact nature some times your fingers might press the adjacent keys instead of the ones you want to hit. Takes a bit of practicing."
5,"Very soft keys. And stylish look. Three color battery cover, on/off switch. N software for battery indicar and media keys function. Full size keyboard with number pad. And unifying technology was a master point. Because I have brought m235 mouse separately and joined with single dongle.  And I have registered both products in Logitech website so I get three years warranty. Thanks Amazon n seller."
3,"The keyboard feels cheap in quality, little bent at the middle and squeaking when pressed the plastic areas at the sides, though the packaging is great with 2 extra battery covers. The size of the keyboard is nice but the right Ctrl key placement and volume keys in relation to Fn key is aweful. There is lag in video games as expected due to its wirelessness, especially in racing games the lag is very noticeable. Overall okay keyboard at this price."
4,"Product plastic is very average quality, not flimsy, but not strong. Key spacing is little congested, however after few days of use you can easily adjusted to it.  Up arrow key is little and placed little higher so we can easily recognize without seeing.Performance wise this keyboard is performing very nicely, range is good and no lag observed. Instantly connects when you plug the unifying receiver to it.I observed one issue in the product serial numbering which is also confirmed by Logitech. Box serial no is different and product serial no is different. As per Logitech, keyboard S/N no is important and that need to be registered at their website.Lets hope it last as it is expected. Will review again if any issue I encounter with this product."
1,very difficult to type usin this that keys are difficulty to press as we are accompstomed to regular keyboard thse keyboard are too small and keys are place at irregular distane .even pressing shift keys are difficulty and those keys .dissapointed and htat space bar keep on pressing when i sleep and use this keyboard .dissaponited .why they made is so small .zebronics companion was better did a mistake ordering this any way had it been bigger would have given 5 star .need to order another good qualitythis i shall use while on the go traveling time any way if i practice in this keyboard i may l oose that typing skills in that regular keyboard .
5,"This is our second Logitech keyboard, the first was the MK250 set. I gave that set to my cousins. This board comparitively is much smaller and easier to carry in a slim profile laptop bag. Love the Logitech Universal set point application. The keys do have a bounce but there is no ""clicky"" sound. It is a slimmer board so the plastics are not thick, there is a bending that will occur if you purposely try to bend it. All the hotkeys/function keys are present as well as the number pad. There are NO LIGHTS on this board, BUT if and when you engage Caps lock or Num lock it will show on screen and if your laptop has these lights it will be lit up as well. This is an exact setup and length as my 15"" Toshiba Satelite C55 board. Overall it's a nice unit to have if 1) your desk space is minimal and 2) if you take your laptop and keyboard in a laptop bookbag or satchel."
4,I have been using this from beginning of Feb 2021. It is good but here few issues I would like to bring up:1. The letters and symbols on the key are protected by some coating they are such a strain to eyes and many a times I have to move your head to get the clear letter. For those used to typing without looking at key board it is fine but nor for others like me.2. I have already changed the battery once on 8th March 21. So it has come only for a month. The Logitech key board I was using for last 20 years (Bought in Dec 2001) had a very good battery life almost one year.But for the above it is very good.
5,"Pros:This is the only reasonably priced keyboard I could find with Logitech unifying receiver, which could be useful for future mouse pairing with same receiver.The keys are reasonably quiet while being tactileVery compact form even with separate number pad.VFM at INR800Cons:There is no off switch. Need to check how long the battery lasts.The battery covers options doesn't include black (minor gripe)The piece I received had a very hard 's' key and I was about to return (replace) it. But with little bit of usage, it appears fine now. However this points to poor quality check by Logitech.Some may need time to get used to the placement of arrow keys, Home, End, Page up/down, but this is a necessary trade off for the compact size."

If you need a compact keyboard and want to carry a keyboard in travel bag, then go for it without second thought.I would definitely recommend this purchase."
4,"Its a good wireless keyboard just plug and play so easy to use and its usefull for just daily tasks like typing and etc, its a bit small in size than other keyboards but for gaming its not ideal at all, if you want this gaming dont go for this i reckon coz the keys are on stiffer side and the key travel is deep so 'No' for gaming. Finally its good bank for buck for normal usage but definitely not for gaming. Thanks :)"
4,"Keyboard is compact. Key placement is also good. I bought this for daily office use. And my most of the work involves in writing code. So being compact, my fingers can reach the keys without much of wrist movement and gives me a confident feedback while typing. Connects like a gem and never had any issues so far. Been using it for last 2 months. The only downside I see is the function keys are slightly hard to hit. But nevertheless recommended keyboard! specially for programmers."
4,"Portable and good connectivity. Built quality is reasonable for this price. Good for browsing and general work. Not suitable for high speed typing.No CAPs lock LED. Bought along with mouse.Note: you have to install LOGITECH Unified software to work with keyboard along with mouse. If you bought only mouse, it can be used with out installing any software.The Battery backup is very good. You need not to turn off the switch.Another con is the keyboard turn On switch doesn't have marking. The upper side is ON. As there is no LEDs, difficult to find ON/OFF condition."
4,Pros:1. This is a compact keyboard2. Looks nice and optional colours in side bar provide vibrancy3. Material quality is good4. Connectivity is seamless5.  Overall a solid feel of the product so looks durableCons:1. The top keys as well as the arrow keys are too small and thin to operate smoothly. This affects both speed and sometimes accuracy.2.  The board has keys spread all across right till the bottom to make it compact. This results in making it bit inconvenient to use the keys in the bottom line of the board.So consider Logitech K 345 or similar product for regular use and buy this one for occasional use (by kids/ others) only.
5,"I was a bit reluctant to buy a secondary HID for my Surface Pro 3, but when my type cover stopped working, I was left with no choice. I did a lot of research on Amazon and wanted an HID that was relatively inexpensive, but worked well with Windows 10. I decided to but this Logitech K230 keyboard, without knowing whether it will work properly. Sure, I went through all the Amazon reviews for this, but most of them were pretty useless, tbh!Well, the device arrived and I was pleasantly surprised at the build quality, look and feel of it. I simply inserted 2 AA batteries, plugged in the 2.4 Ghz wireless dongle in my USB hub and voila, I was up and running in no time.The keyboard is compact and lightweight, so very easy to carry around. The keys have a decent amount of travel and a pleasing clicking sound. The keys are also quite durable and I especially like the fact that there is a number pad as well.Overall, this is a very good device and highly recommend it as a portable HID."
5,"Logitech k230 wireless keyboard, obtained at rs 689, the price fluctuates but its always around rs 650 to 800.  As soon as I received the keyboard i unboxed it, the packaging is good at first the keyboard didn`t respond, turns out I didn't remove the directional paper attached over the battery terminal Works well with my laptop and android smartphone over USB otg.Pros :1. Works out of box, just connect the USB unifier to your laptop USB port.2. works in Linux too , just add the solaar package to get more functionality like pairing,wireles link and battery.3. works in android smartphone (I tested it in my oppo neo 7 and redmi 3s prime) both support usb otg.4. white color holder is really good.Cons :1. no place to keep usb unifier , so if I lose usb unifier I have to purchase  new usb unifier or the entire set.2. the wireless link breaks3. no manual and user warranty."
4,"I Bought this mouse in Jan 2021. Detailed Review for Keyboard and Mouse is as follows after proper usage (gaming, documentation and graphic editing)A. Keyboard1. Looks - 9/10 (Slightly non-standard size keyboard. Font on Keyboard is ok)2. Ergonomics - 10/10. (Curve ensures less fatigue while typing)3. Keystoke - 7/10 (Will require a slightly harder press on the space bar and certain other keys. Downside is there's only 19 Anti-Ghosting Keys)4. Backlight - 10/10 (Keys are well backlit for night use)B. Mouse1. DPI - 8/10 (There are only 3 DPI options till 3200DPI. Sometimes while gaming, the DPI auto resets to the lowest value)2. Looks - 10/10 (Though plastic material it looks good)3. Ergonomics - 9/10 (Though plastic, the fit of the mouse in the palm is good)4. Buttons - 5/10 (Though called as gaming mouse, it isn't one. Only 3 standard buttons)C. Overall1. Wires - 4/10 (Nonbraided wire)2. Length - 10/10 (1.5m long)3. Connector Plating - 0/10 (Not gold plated as said in specs)The mouse is good for daily use only. After 3 months of use, my mouse started losing right-click functionality. Would only register 2/3 clicks for every 5 clicks. However, I contacted the customer support and my product (mouse) is replaced.  No issues with the keyboard"
4,"Have used Offloud outloud bluetooth speaker..own it since 5+ yrs, still using, this company has potential..Now about this product.Pros- looks attractive, useful multimedia keys, good light effects, key press feel and sound, lovely compact size, quality at par with price.Cons- description not correct- no gold plated connectors, combo mouse led cant be turn off, everything mentioned about the mouse it incorrect, keyboard cable is not braided so again product not as described hence the 4 stars..Thats it..meets my needs of casual gaming on laptop..so m good..rest is upto readers."
4,"1. Keyboard:  Let me say this first! The keyboard has a completely different look than your average membrane keyboard. All the keys look like they are sticking out and it looks weird in a good way.  The keys are easy to press and has a nice feedback. The RGB lighting function of the keyboard is an added bonus to it. It looks wonderful when turned on. (pics above).  I compared this combo with various other brands like Zebronics and many, but this seems to be the best out there in this price range at the time of me buying. I didn't want to go for Zebroncis because their mouse making is just bad or it seems so for me as the mouse wheel scroll stops functioning after some time (happened for 3 mice).  Last night, I used the keyboard for intensive typing, but didn't encounter any pain in my fingertips(happens while using laptop keyboard). So, overall a quality keyboard with RGB lighting at this price range.2. Mouse:  The mouse is as good as the keyboard with its RGB breathing mode that is always on. It looks wonderful nonetheless. The precision of the mouse is good although it has only 3 DPI modes (800-1200-1600) as given on the box(see pic), so that's a contradiction with the description saying 3200 DPI. The mouse response is well, the buttons work well.  Eventhough, it is called a gaming keyboard and mouse combo, you only get 4 usable buttons like a regular mouse. There is no forward or backward mouse buttons as in the Zebronics  or other counterparts (if that is very important for you, you can go for the other brands).  Overall, a good mouse that seems to get its job done.A thanks for the seller and Amazon and for Offbeat as well."
4,"My Detailed Review:Bought it for around Rs. 1090 and for the price, its a pretty good gaming keyboard and mouse combo. The rgb lighting looks pretty dope on both of them but u can't turn off the lighting on the mouse. The keyboard works pretty good and been having a good time playing warzone using this. My complain is with the mouse, in the description, it is specified that it is a 6 button gaming mouse but in reality, its only has one dpi button, thats it. I would have given it a 5 star but the false description of the mouse prevents me from doing so."
4,I was satified with this product for 8/9 days buttt then i found mouse i worst i used to play csgo minecraft and many games and sometimes it gives free look butt sometimes it becomes too hard to aim coz the mouse's ain moves by itself i just move mouse a bit but it does full 360 in minecraft and my sensitivity is 35 soo keyboard is toooooo goood but mouse is worstt
4,"This really a worth deal for 1090 which I got this pair of keyboard and mouse for .  keyboard also doesn't have that clicky feeling it has a soft feeling .üòå wires are normal 1.5 M usb cable ....overall a good deal but don't get your hopes so high ,the quality is good for the price you are paying you don't get to customise the RGB of  lighting or u can turn the lights off but you cannot turn off the mouse lights üí°but I likeLaser keycaps with lights emitted from keys on this Price .Overall Ok ."
3,"The product box came damaged and some keys of the keyboard were disembled the wires are normal keyboard and mouse wires1:Keyboardthe keyboard is good but there is no option to turn off RGB breathing so you gotta unplug then plug it back in the port there are no drainage holes but it says in the description that there are drainage holes2:MouseThe plastic quality of the mouse is poor, There are no extra buttons or to turn off RGB"
5,This keyboard and mouse combo was awesome and the RGB breathing mode in both of them are amazing but there should be forward and backward buttons on the mouse üôÇüôÇ
5,"You'll enjoy typing with this keyboard if you're good at typing! However, it does make noise ! I was expecting noise-free ones! Although good product value for money!Mouse - Auto color led changes itself - good thoughNever used for gaming purpose ! Enjoying WFH! üòã"

1,"*** One and half year review ***Multiple key failure. Keyboard totally useless. Ordering an new keyboard to replace this one.Product NOT recommend for long term usage due to quality issues.*** One year review ***Now after 1 year and 3 months of usage across two keyboards (including replacement), I am facing contact errors with the keys. Last month Numpad-5 key started showing contact error. Now numeric-1 key is showing serious coontact errors. I have to bang the key very hard to register a hit.Reducing my previous rating of 2 to . (yes, the one key didn't register).*** Six month review ***I highlightedt faulty back-lights in my six month usage review last year. I raised the matter with the seller and my faulty keyboard was promptly replaced."
5,Much better than expected... Wow. Everything working perfectly for now .... Will update my review after a month. One thing i need to mention to all future buyers is that ... It need usb 3.0 to work... It will not work in 2.0 ... My own experience. Anyway the product is really good for the price right now... I recommend to go for it . And also ... Nice packaging + delevery before expected date...thanks amazon..‚ò∫Ô∏èüòä

5,"Got the brown switch version at 3k.It's a steal.Pros- price- Good RGB (I usually keep it turned off)- the design is very classy. No kiddish extra cheap branding and all.- its still makes some noise, and I feel the fun of typing.- cable is braided (quality stuff)Cons- the keys might be too soft for some people.- selected keys like backspace, shifts, etc make a little different noise. Might be on purpose, or might be loose.- Love the handrest.Mann ki Baat- I am writing this review coz am loving typing on this.- Don't through away the manual as the backlight key combinations are written there, and it's hard to find it online.- excise duty proper hoti to foreign se yahi price pe bluetooth wala mangwata. (fadu looks k saath)"
1,"The keycaps broke and i can't use this cheap keyboard anymore, waste of money! WORST QUALITY"
5,"A bit heavy keyboard, because of the aluminium body. 13 backlight patterns. Awesome to use while gaming. Wrist resting plate provides comfort. Compared to Redgear and other same range keyboards its stands out a bit with some extra features. If anyone looking for the 1st gaming mechanical keyboard, close your eyes and go with this product. Given it 5star as i was looking to cut a star but it haven't given a single chance to do that... Thumbs up from me."
4,"In the beginning I was unsure if this was a good purchase, but after typing on in for a long period of time and gaming I realized my wrists or my hands weren't paining as they usually do. It takes time to get adjusted to the caps and shift buttons though (Important for Moba gamers and csgo players) but overall this Keyboard fairs well with good feedback little heavy but if you've been using a membrane keyboard you'll probably just ignore it and its easy to clean the keys them selves don't catch any dust or sticky dirt but the aluminum plate will. A small soft brush should do the trick to keep it clean. Just a reminder go on their official website and sign up for an extended warranty of another year giving you 2 yrs of a warranty period. Have a nice day :)"
5,Great Mechanical Keyboard for budget.And the JIXIAN Blue switches are just awesome.
3,Good budget mechanical gaming keyboard. The switches are a chinese version of the cheery mx brown keys. Not too bad to be honest. Good tactile response and silent as compared to blue switches. Absolutely ideal for day to day usage and occasional gaming.Overall satisfied with the purchase. My only gripe is the red colored wrist rest/hand rest. It doesn't look bad but a black colored one would've been better.Will update review after long term usage.
2,"I bought this keyboard in July 2019. It has 1-year warranty provided by the manufacturer. The keyboard itself is very good, the lights are bright and feels good to type on.  But keys stopped working after 1 year.I suggest getting a non Mechanical keyboard from a good brand like corsair. Or get the cheapest but proper mechanical keyboard from Gigabyte that costs around the same money as this one, it won't have RGB or any backlight but they are good reliable keyboards that come with 3 years of warranty."
1,"i will never buy cosmic byte products , their terms and conditions are not user friendly. their returns policy is most worst, product  quality is weak.Pros :-Keys are very , have good feedback.lot of RGB options.COns:-big in sizekeys makes lot of noisekeyboard build is not sturdy and very fragile to use.the metal cover where are keys are placed is thin sheet of aluminum very cheap and easier to get dents. (as per policy you cannot get replacement for genuine problem if its dented)if you see pics uploaded RDB stopped working for few keys after infrequent use of just 6 months.there was no keyboard replacement as stock was not available. below are some  terms and condition you need to read before purchasing.Kindly note -  The product needs to be properly packed ensuring the product is intact and shouldn't get damaged during transit.Cosmic byte will not be liable in case of any damage caused to the product in transit.Upon receiving the product, if the service team does not find any issue with the product, the return courier charges will have to be borne by the customer.Warranty will be void if the product is any physically damaged, caused by neglect, misuse, abuse, and unauthorized modifications that are done on the product."
5,"I bought this keyboard about 7 months ago. It was a great keyboard until the point when my main key for gaming, ""W"" key suddenly stopped working. I really love this keyboard. They replaced my unit with a new one as it was within the warranty period. If you want a blue switch mechanical gaming keyboard at an affordable price, this is the go-to choice!"
4,"All I can say is this feels very good in terms of Price, Quality & Experience. Good work to Cosmic Bytes.generally outemu, kailh are good products. Kailh is a bit superior & close to Cherry MX. Beside being cheap they deliver good experience. I've used a few for years.Their blue switches are very clicky.But this brown swtich pretty quiet. I think this is linear with no tactile feedback. And it's really amazing, my typing speed have improved by atleast 5 wpm within a day.Large keys like space bar, backspace, shift & enter make some spring noise, which is quite normal, but considering the silence of other keys, they are a bit disturbing.Other than that this keyboard won't disappoint any mech switch lovers."
4,"Does have some issues but overall for this price it's pretty good.Only cons:Keys stroke sound is inconsistent with some keys and the feel is even more inconsistent. Pressing the key like ""w"" for prolongated period of time broke the key, now the mechanical click isn't clicky enough as the other keys.But overall. I love it."
5,"Pros:1. Value for Money.2. Keys feels very sturdy.3. Brown switches makes less sound than the blue ones.4. Multiple lighting mode, specially the gaming mode lighting is best while you play games. Also, there is a Gaming mode where you can modify the lights in the switches for specific games when needed.5. Build quality is more than satisfying in regards with the price point.6. There are three levels of brightness.7. Wrist rest in a good add-on.Cons:1. Wrist rest is not much comfortable, but again, the price matters and its good for me."
5,I Purchased Cosmic Byte CB Gk11(Outemu Brown) in the deal.My First Impression...... My Opinions* The Packaging was great no tear/damage.* Manufactured and Imported in Dec20.* It came with a wrist pad & a Key remover tool.* It felt quiet sturdy and durable.* It also looked semi premium as compared to others brands in the market.* Cable Quality was also good in the price range.* RGB effects are amazing never seen this type of RGB effects.**The Feedback was Above Average. But in this price it's great.***The Price of this Keyboard was shockingly amazing.......2.2k.These are my first 3 days impressions.If you want a great RGB Gaming mechanical keyboard with a wrist pad under 2.5k. I blindly suggesting you to buy this one.But Before Buying this Please Check the Switches that you want. I prefer Brown switches because these are silent/linear as compared to blue switches.
3,"INITIAL REACTION: This is the best product you can get in this price bracket, very good but little bit noisy switched but it is responsive and very very easy to use and hand rest will not hamper long usage as it sturdy and well built.Edit: it's been 16 month since I'm using this keyboard and it required RMA in 8th month due to ghosting keys and now again started to stop working on few keys for sometimes and work smoothly later so I think it's life span is nearing to the end and it served me well but this is why people spend more money on pricey Keyboard because they last long.My initial reaction was amazing but I went through difficult RMA process which wasn't easy as I had to courier it to Bangalore to get it replaced and it was not delievery at home but I had to visit courier office to collect it. If you do want to spend too much then go for it but it won't last long as you expect."
3,"There is a thing with the keys.... eg: key 1 has 2 symbols... '1' and '!'. So the lights are placed in such a way that only '!' symbol get illuminated properly... and '1' symbol gets less illumination... and its problem all keys that have 2 symbols... the top symbol illuminates correctly... but the bottom one hardly gets any light...(shown in image)nitpick: the wrist rest is difficult to attach as no instructions are given and I had to search a video on how to do that...Keyboard looks good with good brightness at max level(esp. Red key... its bright enough to like the color) the click are there...Also, the space key and enter key has different feel and sound to it while typing...(not sure if intended or bad design)... but this is my first Mechanical keyboard and excited to use it :DAlso, giving it 3 stars coz it arrived late(didn't dispatched for a whole week and dispatched at the date it was supposed to arrive)...Also, DON'T THROW AWAY THE MANUAL... The key combinations are given on that and there is no software for color coding keys...And the in-built pre game modes are sh*t... but some combinations are good and tou can color code your keyboard however you like"
1,"Bought this keyboard in January 2019 and it worked flawlessly for about 15 months. Then problems began with keys not working and even after a thorough but gentle cleaning with compressed air after removing all the keys, several keys are not working. In addition, the illumination for some keys has failed.At this time, the 'w' key isn't working at all and several other keys have a mind of their own, they come and go as they please. I'm having to paste the letter 'w' from the clipboard each time!Dust is the likely reason for the keys failing and I do keep the keyboard covered most of the time when not in use. It perhaps extended the life a little.At this rather high price point, it simply isn't recommended."
2,"The build quality is just okay. I don't know why I feel like the reviews are exaggerated. On an other note if you come from a cooler master keyboard, you'll find this keyboard pretty cheaply built. The keys are okay but too loud. I'd suggest the brown one. The keycaps look really really cheap with the matt black finish."
1,"1 month after purchase, my spacebar and ""T"" stopped working, tried every solution didnt work. 2 month later, almost all keys don't respond 10% of the time, especially during gaming when it most count. I mean, it shouldwork fine atleast 6 months after the purchase given the 4.5K price, no? Rather go for Ant PC MK3400 cheaper & better... -_-"
3,"You are on budget and want a mechanical keyboard, Yes go for it. But if you are not on budget but still want a mechanical keyboard, please please please go and buy an expensive one.Pros:The built is good. it doesn't move or tilt while typing.The RGB effect is great and is pretty bright even in sunlight.Has dedicated multi-media keysNice packing and looks premium.Cons:-Only looks premium but one hand on the laptop and you will understand.-The keys are wobbly as ****. I bought mechanical keyboard for fun of tactile pressing. Instead I am more of wobbly keys than the tactile sound.-If you want to feel that awesome mechanical keyboard sound, don't go for brown switches. Go for blue one.  I know whole world is saying that brown are silent and yes they are. Very silent. its only the sound of keycaps hitting the base of the keyboard what you will hear . hence, you want that chirpy sound buy blue switches.-Backspace and space bar sound are so so bad it seems I am using a normal keyboard.Overall I am bit sad as I had budget but i went on reviews. I believe most of the people didn't buy a mechanical keyboard or are just over joyous on spending Rs. 2,000 and getting a keyboard with all Diwali light options.Go for a better and expensive one if you can. Else, go for this one as it won't disappoint you much. It has keys and they press and when they press they type :)"
1,I liked the keyboard. It's everything the reviews say it is. But I have a problem with this culture of sending a mildly defective product and hoping the customer won't notice. This is becoming quite prevalent with Amazon. So only 1 star.. the space-bar led doesn't work!
4,This is an affordable full RGB keyboard. I opted for a blue switch variant.  Build quality is good. The keyboard looks better in reality than shown in the images. There is LED logo on side also which looks cool. Jixian  keys on this are heavier than my redgear invader keyboard which comes with Kailh blue switches. If you are buying mainly for typing I would suggest you better go for redgear invader.
1,this keyboard worked well for 3-4 months and then the space bar stopped working i have to press it 5 times to work oncei never mentioned that i bought this keyboard 3 times 1 of them is working till now the others don'ti've wasted 6k on this keyboard when i could've bought something that has quality and durability DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
5,"mild metallic clingy noise on hard key press mostly space barBut otherwise a really really nice blue switch keyboard for the price. Nice build, nice effects and custom options, no software to control but has media switches.worth the price I would say10/10 hope it lasts at least 2 years now"
1,"Very cheap quality keycaps and gets broken with normal use, worst sturdiness. Its only for the very delicate use. A big NO for gaming. Also one of the led (alt key) stopped working."
5,"Very very sturdy built and heavy too and cable is braidedEach key is 7 colour customisable, but no software provided, you have to record each key in colours you want and then save it.But the keycaps are very bad in design as the bottom portion letter doesn't lights up(see the above photo to understand), so there's that you have to keep in mind.And for information it don't have outemu switches but xixian switches, they're of lower quality than outemu ones, but I don't felt the difference personally speaking."
4,"I got my product delivered today Cosmic Byte CB-GK-11 Black Eye (Brown Switches). Packaging by amazon was great, no  damages on the box. First impressions, it feels cheap tbh and also there is a lot of wobble and cheap plastic springy sound while pressing the bigger keys. Mine comes with brown switches, if you are switching from a membrane keyboard to this the typing experience is really different. There are lot of RBG effect modes and also lights are vibrant. Don't expect any high feedback from the key presses as these are Chinese brown switches, but what u are getting for the price is pretty decent. I'll be updating my review according to my experience with this keyboard."
3,If you are a gamer you will know the pain when the W key starts giving you problems. I was using it for both gaming and for my office work. The W key started having issues within 6 months. Now when I say what it becomes hat. It is no doubt the cheapest mechanical keyboard but the keys that I use often have slowly started becoming unresponsive. Go for it if you are using as a temporary one till you get a good mechanical keyboard.
1,"Defective product is delivered. Unfortunately I was went on out of station becuase of personal reason. After a week when I came back & unboxed the key board with excitement.Same way I have disappointed becuase the product has manufacturing defect. The space bar switch lights are not switching on.I have paid huge amount of 3769 rupees. By believed that the cosmicbyte is the best brand. Unfortunately my belief was wrong. The cosmicbyte product are not the good quality products.Also trying contacting customer support. They just playing email game. Not calling, when I am calling not picking the call."
1,back light stoping to work one by one after 4 months 10 keys stops working.Update after 7 months. 40% lights stoped working. And some keys dont respond always.Update after year 70% lights stopped working
5,"This is my very first mechanical keyboard. I have bought the blue switch version of this keyboard and the experience is just superb. The feel, click sounds take it to next level. The lighting is per key RGB, which I don't think that there is any keyboard that offers this feature at this price point. There are static RGB effect and some preset patterns and also the lights can be turned off. Although there is no software to change the lighting effect, it can be changed in the keyboard itself. I live closer to coastal region, so the USB ports in my PC tend to rust due to this weather; The gold plated USB connector comes very handy. I will update on the durability of the keyboard after some months of usage. Overall a nice and satisfactory purchase. I regret that I did not purchase this keyboard earlier."
5,"Best Gaming mechanical keyboard you can buy, if you want more noise of key caps then go for blue switches, if you want for gaming i suggest go for brown they are bit more responsive than blue and moderate noise then go for brown switches, just for your info red and black switches are best for gaming but they are bit expensive compared to blue and brown. Built quality is awesome made of metal.."
5,"I am going to write a review at different timelaps.  Now forst impressions then 6 months later , 1 year lator and then a final review.First impressions :- pakaging from amazon was so so . expected better.  The box was a little damaged at corner but thats due to shipping and kb was all good.  Kb was awesome . build quality was so good . you can hurt somebody badly if you hit em with this.  Keys were good.  Rgb was great . a good purchase as of now.  I Will try to find some cons after some time of use."
5,Amazing keyboard at this price rangeBrown switch has low sound than blue switch13 rgb effects are amazingwin lock key feature is very useful while gamingthe fonts on the keyboard are not good but keys are greatu can use it with your android phone alsorgb brightness are very good
5,"So i have been using it for the past month delivered (28.11.19)So far so good.No misclicksNo ghostingGood feedback.Just want it to last,Paid 6k for Logitech g613, lasted for 6 months. I was furious by thatThis keyboard feels good to type on."
3,"this keyboard is really good, but not that great for long term use, you can get a replacement for free if your keys suddenly stop working, but this is my experience with the keyboard.After 6 months of use, the favorite key of gamers, W key started to not respond, out of 7 clicks, it will respond only once. I tried resetting the keyboard using fn + esc key, and it worked, but for only 3 days, again it started to not respond. cosmic byte, improve your qualitypros are:Sturdy and heavyBrown outemu switches give a good feeling while gaming and typing.aluminium finish on the upper body, plastic body beneath.Wrist rest is good, but a cushion on it would be better.of course, the rgb, everyone's favorite, top class rgb and its  effectsCons:key caps are not good quality, they shake even with lightest force.otherwise, the keyboard is very good,."
5,(i have the blue keys version)its just amazing for the price probably the best mechanical keyboard in the budget range the sound is great the feel is premium also the per key RGB lights are great u get enough combinations....you also get the hand rest with it so its helpful for coders also how type for long time.....and it is very durable the lower is plastic but its sturdy and upper is alluminium which has a good feel and it feels strong and durable also just a small suggestion also visit cosmic byte official website you might get better deal there sometimes but sometime Amazon also gives better price so better look both ways
5,"Save some money and go but the updated version of this keyboard this is old shiz have a look atcbgk -16 firefly by cosmic byte, it's perkey RGB is ok but they're are very less animations, not to mention the RGB resets every time you turn on your PC EVERY TIME but typing is kinda ok but you need time to get used to the layout."
5,The design of the keyboard is very stylish. It has soft keys for smooth and effortless typing. The small shortcut keys beside the keyboard makes it a complete keyboard in a budget range.
1,"this was my first and last amkette product.. very very poor quality. many keys stopped working after 10-15 days, now it is completely useless for me. and customer support is also very bad."
3,"Hardcore gamer here, the W key started fading after 2 months of use.2-3 big sized key(Num + and Tab) needs pressure for output.On the positive side, The design is good and stylish and weight properly distributed.Once it becomes adjusted you can type really fast if that's only your priority go for it."
5,"It is a very good keyboard in the ‚Çπ350-range. Keys are moderately soft, and is comfortable & quiet for normal typing. The multimedia keys are all working properly. Not much rugged design (but not that loose either) , but of course, in this price range, you can't expect much, but you are getting a decent one ! Also, packaging was decent. MUST BUY FOR NORMAL TO MODERATE USAGE. ALTHOUGH FOR HIGH INTENSIVE GAMING, THIS MAY NOT SUFFICE."
4,"It's been around 10 days now that I am using this keyboard. It's kinda okay for it's price, nothing great nor anything bad. Though it could have been better. The plastic that is used here feels kinda cheap and hard hitters can type twice the same letters that they are tryna type. Feels extremely light in weight so it doesn't give you a sense of great quality in this keyboard. Though design wise it looks good atleast from a distance. Keys are extra smooth so they don't feel forced on this keyboard which is a good thing but can be bad too if you are typing rapidly because you would end up typing the letter twice and then you would have to go back and delete it. Though it's a fair attempt to provide a fancy looking keyboard at this price, so it's alright not a bad keyboard. It serves the purpose and that's enough."
1,"The look attracted me ..So I took a chance and went a head to get this product.. but was disappointed with the build quality of the product, plastic is very delicate and can be easily broken... I'm not sure if it's leak proof as I take care of it very much also gaming i haven't tried ... So only build quality is the concerned point here.. Typing is really soft"
1,"I owned it for a while, never had much use till lockdown and wfh.. This is a very bad keyboard for working.. Has to edit each line to remove repeated letters after typing. There is a 10 percentage probably that one key press types it twice.. that means every line in an email will have 3 repeated letters.. So painful..  Also it's a flat keyboard. Nothing special in ergonomics regard."
4,"I ordered this keyboard as my long running logitech keyboard gave up. I have never been fan of Amkette products considering their cheap quality.However I was pleasantly surprised with this product. The keyboard has got separate multimedia buttons on the right side and quick access keys on the left. The WASD keys and arrow keys are marked in orange which gives it a gaming keyboard look. The keys are very soft to type and are precise to strokes.Overall a value for money product with good ergonomics, fast typing and casual gaming."
5,The keyboard is quiet sturdy at this low cost for just Rs279. Been using it for 6+ months and its still going great. Its keys are not hard nor too soft. No ghosting at all. Keyboard multi function button on both sides edge (orange) are working exactly shown.  its a full fledge keyboard in compact size.  Its just plug and play no cd or installation needed.Con I would say has a usb wire which is a bit short than normal keyboards if its for desktop.Honestly i was sceptical about this keyboard at that price but I went ahead and purchased it and now I am HAPPY that I made the right choice. You can go ahead too if you dont want to spend more for HP or dell keyboard which has less functions and those all the things which this keyboard does .
1,"I am not a gamer. I needed a Keyboard for software development, I bought this on 21st May 2020. Reviewig o : 07th July 2020.Pros:The keys are butter smooth. I liked it very much.Cons:10 days ago, the PageUp button stopped working.Now B and N keys are not working. Either I eed to press hard or it will get typed with multiple characters.So, If you wat a reliale keyboard. Thik wisely and get a etter oe.Puzzle: Add N or B in the unrecognizable words in this post. I typed this sentence from my laptop, hence it is readable. The rest are typed using the this Keyboard.While writig this review,  the Left Arrow key stopped fuctioig."
2,So I ordered this product under a lightning deal but due to my bad luck some keys were not working in the keyboardI asked amazon for a replacement and they replaced the keyboardAgain some weren‚Äôt workingI took refund of the keyboardStory endsNow from my experience you should definitely not invest in this cheap productYou can go for amazon choice keyboard or any other branded keyboard like HP or Dell
2,my experience was bad with this keyboard.Received the keyboard first time stopped working in few days.Then request for replacement second time got broken keyboard hence i returned the second time and finally got a refund.Mainly the keyboard size is short too.Go for Logitech or dell by paying extra 200 rs which actually worth
5,"Product is good, After recieving the product I felt it's little bit small.But the keys are smooth.Length is 18.5 inchBreadth is 6.5 inchUnwanted extension given below the space bar. Key texture and print are good.Cable quality is also above average.The media and special keys at the sides are super. At first they didn't work but after restart they are working fine for windows 10 OS. It has around 13 holes to remove dust dust and liquid spills from bottom. It has 17 screws to open the back cover.Completely plastic body"
3,"When I got the product, the escape key wasn't working, after some this it did work, but still stops in between. I wouldn't recommend the product if you are going to use it for typing since the enter key is weirdly shaped and I not reachable when you are touch typing.The only thing I liked about the product was the color. Overall I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,"Writing this review almost after a months of use.I must say it is a good purchase for me. In this price range this is a very good product. Not very much sturdy, but enough rigid as per price. Does not have premium look. Typing is good. Not issues with typing. I also tried gaming with this keyboard. I played pubg with it. It does not have sticky key issue. More than 3 key roll over is possible. But it feels that the key are harder in terms of gaming. You should not expect it as a gaming keyboard cause it's at least 1/10th of price compared to proper gaming keyboard. So I'll rate it a five star considering it's price."
5,"The buttons are very smooth and soft to touch and the multimedia buttons eases up our work.Only drawback i saw till now is that maybe the buttons are not very mch durable for a long use i guess.It's been 4 months i'm using this and didn't noticed any problem bt the keys durability.Some mostly used common keys FOR e.g :- M key for opening MAPS in games gives little different feel when pressed.So, ive removed the button and adjusted the material inside button to the centre and placed the key back in hoping to regain that old smoothness and surprisingly it got smooth again.That's it ....other than this key thing, which is also not a big deal and on the basis of that you can't judge this keyboard.In this price Range this Keyboard works like a CHARM****"
2,"I bought this keyboard for ergonomics, primarily, the functional and easy to reach multimedia buttons on the right and the left..I am a designer and I listen to music 90% of the time that I am working on my computer. The volume up and down, forward, backward, pause/play buttons on the right and the mute, calc, folder, home and email buttons on the left are extremely useful to me and very easy and quick to reach and use.The material and build quality of the keyboard however sucks. I think it's been a month since I bought it and several keys started popping out and falling off within a couple of weeks. I have to push them back in place every now and then. I am not sure but I think there have been a couple of instances of double key strikes/mis-trikes etc. I don't think this keyboard is gonna last very long.The design is beautiful however and I wonder from whom Amkette rippled it off...oh okay ..they ripped it off from Foxin, coz I have owned an identical keyboard from Foxin which was cheaper and better built though not excellent ..Foxin might have ripped the design off from some other brand as well ..who knows ..or they both purchase from cheap third parties ... I've attached pics of the Amkette and the Foxin side by side for reference...."
5,The keyboard is just awesome. The keys are smooth and doesn't make any noise. While gaming also it feels nice. Most keyboards at this price range starts getting stiff keys and all but even after rough and rash use its still smooth and noise free. The only demerit is the keys cannot be removed or cannot be interchanged. Apart from that everything is super.
1,Dont buy this keyboard ...its filmsy plastic ....keys are going to break in weeks ... my previous keyboard was iball ..it worked up to 6 years...  I have a amketee wirless keyboard which keys are fine ... ( security issue is there in wirless keyboards)  so i try to purchase this amkette keyboard ... I will buy iball keyboard from shop ...I lost my money anyway
4,"This key board is very good in a reasonable rate. Also it has media player controlling option and all most silent keyboard.It can  be improved more by placing some very small white LED bulbs along the four corners , two at tops and one near up/ down arrow sign, inbuilt.Then it could be operated in dark room , when students studying but his/ her parents are sleeping in same room, so it could have been a newest type of key board in the market."
5,"If you're looking for a good trustworthy keyboard at this price range, look no further. You can easily go with this option.Have been using this for around 3 months now and it's serving its purpose just fine. Plus the ergonomics are really good and the multimedia keys are a blessing. The multimedia keys are one the main reasons I bought this.However, if you're looking for hard-core gaming, I don't think this product is for the long haul. You'll be able to play comfortably but for me and some other users as well, one or two keys might get stuck at times; has already started happening with me with the Shift key so this is one of its disadvantages. Not an absolute deal breaker though cause you can't expect more than this at this price range.It feels like a premium product and I remember this company Amkette making floppy disks during my childhood so yeah another good point.A definite buy at this price range!"
3,"Specifically bought this one for gaming as dont want to ruin my laptop keyboard.The keyboard is decent in terms of build quality. Ive played COD,CS,FARCRY titles without any issues.The only problem i feel is, you have to press the keys hard while typing unlike other branded keyboards like dell,hp etc.The shorcut keys for volume, previous,next etc really help while watching videos. However plz be careful as they get accidentally pressed while you lift the keyboard for some reason while gaming or watching a video."
5,Really satisfied with the keyboard. It's best in the market. Way better than zebronics multimedia keyboard. Multimedia keys are very helpful and are placed better. Keys are soft and keyboard is strong. Everything seems good. Note:- And i'm never buying zebronics keyboard again. Stopped working in just one week and service is very bad.
4,"Writing this review 2 years after the purchase..Pros:Seems to work fine even after a period of 2 years. No problem with key functionality and super smooth as well as silent. Compact design . A big advantage, it has a separate key for controlling sound/music etc. More than worth the priceConsNote that I've been using the product for 2yearsKeyboard is not for hardcore gaming or games which includes multi keys to be pressed at the same time. Ghost key count is less. The print seems to fade if same keys have been used continuously..refer pics uploaded."
5,"I am basically practising Touch Typing for a long but this keyboard helped me score the top speed easily.The first Impression>>>Pros:>Keys are really soft and spacing between keys are low because of that it is easy to reach on every key easily.>Utility Keys on both sides of the keyboard is so helpful and accurate.>Light Weight (May be due to  plastic build but I didn't feel that as low quality)>Height of the keyboard is less (compared to previous keyboards I had used) because of that it is easy to reach numbers and function keys(F1, F2....).> SilentCons:> Utility keys on both sides are of Rubber finish and sometimes it feels little stiff(just a little). But it doesn't matter much because the response is really so accurate and fast.> Size of ""Enter"" key seems a little bit small compared to other keyboards because of that my pinky fingers need to be stretched a little more while touch typing.Overall worthy for this price range."
5,"Do not expect a very high quality keyboard at this price. However if you just looking for office purpose, mails , multimedia use. Its a very good option since it does have extra keys for multimedia too. Looks a bit flimsy but hey the price is cheap..comes with warranty of 1 year. For gamers I will say go with something more robust and strong.if you can buy a gaming laptop or desktop then definitely you can save more to get a high level keyboard too."
4,"This is the best keyboard for typing. Even though the materials look cheap and feel cheap its really comfortable for those people who type alot in the computer. I dont recommend this for hardcore gaming coz at sometimes the keyboard just stops working for a few seconds. If you are playing some causal games then its good. And again for typers this is the best keyboard, once you get used to it you can type really well."
4,"I wanted it for my laptop as working on keyboard is easy. Coming to quality, it feels flimsy, key strokes do not bring confidence of a good quality product, feels like they may come out in few months usage. This is definitely not made for heavy keyboard users (those writing long reports or work extensively on Excel sheets). The shortcut keys for volume, calculator, hard drive, email client, desktop, etc are very handy and useful"
5,"Liked the shortcut true the most.Opening the mail, calculator,browser, file manager has become very easy with it.Along with this the media playback controls are also awesome.Typing experience is very satisfying with noiseless keys .Keyboard has many holes at the backside that helps to drain water if some thing spills on it without damaging the keyboard.The rubber padding on the lower end of the keyboard isn't sufficient. Due to which it slightly slips on the table while typing. Although it is a good product"
5,"For a price of Rs. 400, Amkette Xcite Pro USB Keyboard is truly good to use. Keys feel comfortable to hit or to push down upon softly. I have no hesitation in recommending it. Recently, a new version of it having UV coating and splash proof design has been launched under the label Amkette Xcite Neo Wired USB Keyboard. It looks more sober and elegantly laid out now!"
4,"I have bought this for ‚Çπ300 when I wanted a super cheap keyboard for gaming on laptop.I used this everyday for 1 year 10 months until very recently when the cable at the keyboard joint broke and became unusable.It is very lightweight and ergonomic. It is often advertised as water-proof which I have tested but then again how often do you swim with a keyboard üòÇ. Keyboard still looks good despite such heavy gaming use and the added buttons on its sides were very useful. For gaming particularly, I didn't see any added advantage nor was I expecting any either. I just needed a cheap keyboard for gaming so that my laptop keyboard did not wear out early because of gaming.I am slightly disappointed now it has become non-functional but it was very cheap and I had zero long term expectations."
5,"Lets just rate the entire procedure.(Based on 3 day experience)1.Delivery-Like always ..way before the stipulated date.10/102.Packing - Excellent. On addition to the Carton coverage the keyboard was wrapped in bubble wraps. So 10/103. Product- Sleepy, Ergonomic, & perfect for any purpose. The product was exactly as per the specifications. Little bulky but still manageable. The 10 shortcut key on the sides are a blessing! It fits perfectly for my work needs with volume,track controls, Calculator, MailSo if you managed to read all this , I would say go for it before it runs outEdited (01-02-2021)Never expected to be writing this, but the item has stopped functioning. Literally Nada. Nothing works. Except for the occasional luck-based one timer when it works. Otherwise just an unproductive expense. Infact this worked only for like 3-4 weeks , enough time to relieve Amazon for refund or exchange liablities. So I guess the rating for me then comes down to a mere 3 /10"
5,"all good , all keys work proper;y expect 3 keys1st shift+2="" ( whenever in keyboard wrote that when you press shift +2 =@) this problem is solve by exchange that both keys but their is not hastage keywhen i press shift + 3 =¬£ this icon comes that was not good for my work and their is not any key which can replaced by '¬£' key.  all are very good infect write this comment with this keyboard .  i use this from 2 or 3 days and this very good. check keys 1st when you recive this thanks for your time .if anyone want to grow their instagram accounty ,youtube channel then contect me  on my IG ID @moonlight_promotions"
5,"This keyboard is good quality and looks reliable as i have been using it without any issue for the past year. But the paint on repetitively used keys may come off after 1 year of use.But in spite of the paint issue, i have ordered the same keyboard again for another computer. I like the smoothness of this and reliability."
3,"delivery before time but packaging was poor.in fact open.so i checked all the keys in itPro:1.multimedia keys2.spill water proof3.gamng look3.lightweightcons:1.plastic quality in little on downside,cheap type. no arms or lap rest proper space2.shut down button should also be included like multimedia keys.i have this feature in my previous foxin keyboard fkm 902."
4,The keyboard is good.The keys are soft to press.it has a big backspace.All the keys are working fine.The extra multimedia keya are really helpful for me.There are two cons of the product1.The side multimedia buttons are made of rubber which does not feel durable.2.The wire of keyboard is Really small.if u are going to use it for laptop then it is fine.if you are going to use it for desktop then the wire length could be a isseue.
5,The product works very beautifully. The extra keys are so useful. Every one who sees the keyboard wants to buy it.Cons: Keyboard cable is not so premium and looks cheap.Buy it. You wont get such a keyboard anywhere for the price.
4,lightweight keyboard with shortcut keys used for frequent functions usable for house work and not good for office typing work purpose just. faced connectivity issue while connecting first time due to drivers installation not happened

5,"Not recommended for heavy gaming, but works fine for simple games and has a nice build. For this price, this keyboard is really nice and is very light weight. The functional keys in orange colour on both the sides of the keyboard are the USP. These keys make the work easy, and are really great. Go for it. Value for money!"
5,I got this keyboard today and at first glance it looks awesome. The typing experience in this keyboard is good and I would recommend every basic user to go for this keyboard without any doubt. The keyboard it a bit flexible but as compared to its price point I can't expect more. The design of the keyboard has been upgraded as shown in thumbnail(just telling because I myself was confused with the pics of old review and the thumbnail)
1,"This is one of the cheapest and poorly made products I have come across.Let me tell you why:Pro's:None whatsoever. I would mention the pricing but for this product, that amount is overpriced as well.Con's:Everything people.In short. NEVER GET THIS PRODUCT EVEN IF YOU ARE A CHEAPSKATE!!"
3,"The product I received earlier has some faulty keys. Amazon replaced it very efficiently. The replaced keyboard is working fine most of the times, but there are many occasions where it stops working completely. The USB has to be removed and attached multiple times to make it work. Also it does not have options to change the inclination/height which is a standard feature in most of the keyboards."
1,"first time, i  received and packaging not ok, also looks many scratches .second time, i got aa replacement aand thsi keyboard shift keyis horrible and sseveeral  times ssame world is repeating..like this sentence.dont buy it"
4,Good keyboard. Looks cool and durable. Keys are soft. The only problem I see so far is the Ctrl key (See the pic) it misses it's spelling. It's not a big concern but still company should take care of its finishings.
1,It doesnt work waste of money. Please dont buy.i bought this on 7 th september and used it for 18days and thus went off. No breakage or any physical damage. Useless cheap boards are maybe i side this.
5,It's a cool keyboard which has soft keys and very responsive to the touch and it's is recommended for editing and typing.Not recommended for gaming.
4,"works fine, few letters came off (not the key itself, but writing on it). Mainly used keys are OK."
5,"Pros:1. Nice Build Quality2. Satisfactory press sound (which you expect from a mechanical keyboard)3. Dimesions are perfectly fine, not like other keyboards which take a lot of space on your table.Cons:No Cons!!!!"
1,Worst Product.....The keyboard get failed in three days and even I can't return it now as all I don't have the product cover.Extremely disappointed !!!
5,It is a very good keyboards at this price range. Recommended to buy this for those for plan at this budgetCorns. Led of Numb lock  n captions is very deemp
1,What a worst product..Key is jam like using railway station keyboard... Never recommend this keyboard. Your work may reduce to 40% only due to this jam keyboard
5,It is very good with all keys and it works with just a touch..
4,Low price good quality and good product.
1,Worst product ..... Received item in damaged condition twice.... Intex is much better .... Purchased intex .... And now I am working with it.
4,Works well. Mouse is very flimsy and not very reliable or sturdy but for the price cant complain
2,Side corner damged Keyboard...  Quality is not that much good and  Z key need to put more pressure to work. Not worthfull for 400
5,Nice Keyboard And Mouse......Really Good Looking.......And Working Fine........Worth The Money
4,"Value for money, but the cable is a bit short of length compared to others, and I had to drag my CPU a bit closer.."
3,Overall keyboard worth the price but switches are not much comfortable and not working smoothly compared to dell/iball/microsoft keyboards. But this is a good product in this price range..!
1,"defective product,i receive this product there are no some key"
1,The keys have become so hard. We need to press several times to give the input commands
2,Buttons stuck after 1 month...
3,Satisfied the product

5,Good product working perfectly fine
1,Hard keys unlike promised soft keys

1,Faulty keyboard with missing keys
2,"Mouse is faulty, not working"
1,"Enter button gets stuck in 1 month,mouse losses USB connection on its own all this after one month use."
3,Good enough
5,Amazing product.Very smoothly works keys.Stylish keyboard
3,"It's good, but there's no stand, so you have to do a desi jugaad for that. Also, the keys are a bit clustered."
3,It's good
1,Mouse stopped working in 2 months

5,Long lasting board than dell and amazon basics

1,"Dear Sir/ Madam,I have purchased this product through Amazon online shopping.  I liked this product. I am using this product for laptop. Now a days, I have some issues on this product. When i press some keys, some strange characters appearing on the scree insted of letter or number.I hope you will replace this product for me. It is undef warranty period.Awaiting for your reply.Thanks,  Best RegardsAbhilash"
3,"First time when I got this order, I got it in good condition but when I start using it, I notice an issue with the keyboard. When you press ""R"" on the keyboard it display some other alphabet. Same issue happened while press other words and numbers as well.Looking at this issue, I had asked for replacement, which I got after a 1week almost and when I got it I was shocked to see the condition of the packaging. It's was damaged completely and looks like someone has stuff the keyboard and mouse inside the box and tapped it and sent it. BTW the package seal looks to be already opened and later Tapped them. See the photo which I attached.I wanted to return this product and replace it but looking at the fact the delay which happen last time when I replaced, did feel like doing it again.My point here, when you spend certain amount of money on something, you expect to be good and well presented...."
1,"Worst product i ever buy. From Amazon part they delivered product on time but the product from seller even after replacement didn't work. Mouse & keyboard both goes off after two minutes of idle , i have to remove Bluetooth every to get connected again & Even u r connected mouse have too much lag.Stupid part from Logitech that mouse don't have any button to kept it manually on/off & Bluetooth is too big not like conventional Bluetooth it is just like pen drive .If possible try to avoid  this model."
1,"Design is so worse that we will definitely start using Laptop's keyboard again...1. Poor design2. Special keys (Backspace/Insert/ Arrow keys, etc) are stuffed into too little space3. Borderless keyboard4. Not friendly to typing5. No light indicators for capslock/numslock/low battery lifeMouse1. Heavy as you insert 2 AA batteries2. Look wise good3. Age old design of the wheel.DONT BUY...."
1,I can understand the need to save space but this keyboard is ridiculous. There is no caps indicator nor is there a num lock indicator which is extremely inconvenient. The delete key is a tiny button placed right up on top (next to the function keys). I just cannot understand how anybody can type on this thing. I tried to pass it on to unsuspecting colleagues but got a mouthful. I requested the seller to send me a better keyboard and that I would pay them the difference but to no avail.
4,"Concidering to the price point of 999/- lightning deal it was a good deal,, only cons what i think, there is no notification light in keyboard and arrow keys are very small definitely not suitable for the gamers,,, but overall in performance 5/5"
4,"I purchased similar logitech keypad and mouse around 4 years back. That time this product keys were some old fashioned and also the keyboard had sharp edges and was too sleek to handle. I didnt have another option looking at the price and delivery and opted for this. To my surprise, this keyboard has curvy edges, the keys are lovely and feel awesome while typing. The mouse grip and shape is super. The only flaw in this i would say is Capslock light. Only if this had a light for capslock, i would have rated 5 stars. During this electronic age where we use lot of net banking and online transactions, we cannot risk giving wrong passwords. But at this price this is an excellent product.Thank you Amazon, Thank you seller, and most of all Thanks to the delivery person."
5,Awesome product I like this product very much as it is very helpful for those who want to use it wirelessly this is the best wireless keyboard in this price range as it offers more than its price only the thing that I didn't like was there are no LED is all over the body of this product but the plus point is it enhances the battery life and also it is only for professional use and not for The Gamers
5,"Working on laptops these days is a routine job. You are on a roll when it comes to your job! Thence, it is very necessary to get your hands on keyboard and mouse while you are working on Laptop. There are several reasons behind getting them. The major one being, since you work so much on your laptop, it becomes sometimes difficult using the mouse on the laptop. Also too much of work on the laptop makes the keys of the keyboard weak and they stop to function properly. This causes a lot of repair and maintenance expense.Therefore, it is important for you to get yourself a keyboard and mouse combo. So, logitech mk215 is the best."
1,"I can tell you this right now that if you're are looking for a sturdy replacement for your keyboard. This product is definately not it.1. The package is an absolute garbage. Both the product recieved was seemed like stuffed up product as is the delivery boy just picked up the product as a return and delivered it to another customer.2. The make of the product reminds you how Chinese manufacturers just are dumping crap in our backyard and even getting paid for it. It's all made up a plastic. I felt the only redeemed product is the mouse and felt it made the cut.3. The length, width of the keyboard and travel space of keys are just so crappy that it will leave you retyping everytime you use it.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!"
5,"Super Awesome, I was so worried seeing lot of NEG reviews of defects and replacemens however I got it today and working so fine .. very handy keyboard easy to carry, keys are smooth.Mouse works smooth too. Completely satisfied with my purchase."
3,"Pros:1. It connects with Computers, TV and Phone seamlessly. (Usb port is a must for use)2. The battery life is impressive as i have not changed the batteries (supplied along with the set) since i started using it over 6 month month back.3. Compact design for a full sized keyboard is very impressive and looks good.4. Key pressing response and Mouse clicks are very good.5. The overall range of transmission is quite good as i have used it at a distance of 300 cm between transmitter and keyboard / mouse without any issues.Cons:1. There is lag in mouse whenever the bluetooth transmitter is placed behind the computer thus i advice to place the transmitter at a place where it has no obstruction between transmitter and keyboard / mouse.2. Please do not buy it if you are planning to do average or heavy gaming on it will not suite that. There are gaming specific keyboard / Mouse for that."
4,"These are a good alternative to my old laptop that sits at home with a broken keyboard. But if you plan on travel with it,don't even look at it.This is a good wireless keyboard for a budget.Pros:Wonderful keystrokesTyping is blissGreat performance / no disconnect or lagWorks with linuxLightweightMouse is light and nimbleCons:Little flimsy as a whole. One drop may break it.The arrow keys are badly placed, numpad could've been left out making the keys better.Not a deal breaker but cannot game on these.Mouse left click sounds different but works fine."
5,"very affordable and qwality product, logitech devices are always well built and works out of the box without issues... batteries were also included by logitech.... since the keyboard and mouse works on 2.45 GHz, they interfere with home routers working on same frequency...."
5,"Very good, compact, light keyboard. Only mouse is a bit heavy. No ON/OFF switch for both keyboard and mouse to save battery. You need to get used to this if you are accustomed to working with bigger keyboards. While keeping your hands for typing be careful about your thumbs positioned for using the space bar.  Keys function smoothly. To use The ""Rupee Symbol"" which is combined with the 4+$ key, you must look forward appropriate language settings and combination of keys to be used."
5,"Brilliant product , good quality ;1: mouse is very responsive .2: I have never seen such a good scroll button and soft clicks.3: keyboard is thin , light and very responsive .4: its true that it can be used from a 10m range ( I have tested it).5: just plug the Bluetooth stick and you can use it instantly.6: worth buying ( I would give it 6 out of 5 if I could ).I am satisfied with the product ."
5,"It is a pretty decent keyboard and mouse.  Detects and works within seconds. I have tried it with my mobile as well via the OTG, it works perfectly fine.The only thing which i am not happy is the size of the keyboard and size of few buttons. They could have gone with the conventional keyboard size which would have been more easy to user. Anyways you get used to it within few days."
1,In the six month of buying the keyboard the key such as U and S key when I press  then it typed the other characters and the computer is hanged. The function key is also not working and one numeric is 4 is not working . So the problem of this keyboard is the malfunctioning of  various keys. The other problem is that the numeric key 0 when i press it stuck.The one of the most problem is that on this keyboard the typing experiences is  very bad. So don't buy it.The model no is mk220 and amazon shows it mk215 why?Go for other keyboard like Hp . Worst for money.
5,"Best part is it comes with 2 two batteries.Pros:1) Very sleek and elegant.2)Unified wi-fi  di dongle.3) Very closely packed keys = less key travel + faster typing speeds(depends on your qwerty familiarity ofc).4)Dedicated multimedia buttons for fast access.5)Almost silent key press noise. But that depends if you're in an office or at home.6)Easy to grip and ergonomic.Cons:1)The up and down arrows are squished into a single key space.2)The mouse first feels very light but when u add the 2xAAA batteries, it feels heavy and also diminishes the weight distribution. That is hardly anything to complain abt once you're used to it.3)No backlight (ofcourse) cuz without lights it gets a tad bit frustrating for moderate pc users.4)Main ENTER key is really small. smaller than those on laptops... but again that you'll probably get used to it.5)No lights for capslock or num lock.I think this is the best deal for a wireless keyboard+mouse combo.Must buy.FUNFACT: I am writing this review using this keyboard. :P so yes it is NOT defective at all."
1,"I purchased it on 23.05.2020, After receiving I found there is no Caps Lok Signal. Nub lock Signal, scroll lock signal, we need all this indicators in current scenario for passwords. second thing its Number Lock  not a proper, you have press its after each & every 5 minutes . its really unsatisfactory a Logitech is reputed brand in keyboards % mouse .I already Purchase it Rs.1500/- during lock down period. Do not purchase it. Waste of money"
4,"I was initially planning to buy the Dell keyboard + mouse combo but it was not available for delivery in my area. That's when I decided to go for this.I'm not facing any issues and the keyboard keys feel good to use. If you like the feel of good old PC keyboard, then this one is ideal for you.But if you prefer soft keys, then you might want to consider the Dell one.Also it does not have a premium look. But its a good full size keyboard."
1,"I purchased this keyboard in Jan 2019 and now I have started having issues with the key. A letter ""A"" is gone bad and it types the letter ""a"" itself without pressing it.The bad part is that I tried to contact the Logitech customer service but their number seems out of service so finally I wrote an email to them 3 days back but still no response. Really bad service."
1,Product is good but delivery was very poor.  I received after 12 days with crushed package. Disappointed greatly on AMAZON PACKING. The seal has broken already. Keyboard looks modern but mouse isn't like that....... It is not easy to use if u already used single battery wireless mouse... I shocked at this packing.
5,"It has very tiny 'up, down, right and left' buttons. Enter, Backspace & Delete keys are smaller than normal.But you can't complain much because the keyboard only is supposed to be small as expected. so they have reduced the size of these important keys to make the keyboard small.For gaming of any sort which needs the direction keys, this keyboard is not the right choice. Good for all time word processing and web based duties.This mouse does not have an ON - OFF button - takes 2 pencil AA size batteries but last for more than a month. I use rechargeable batteries so I have no problem at all even if it lasts only for 15 -20 days. The Mouse is very good though.The USB dongle is the normal large one.. not the nano usb (thumbs down for this)"
3,"The product is good but Not suitable for multi-media purpose. It's small in size but I should have checked that before buying. The wifi connectivity is poor when I kept the CPU under the table and plug this gadget in the rear end. It does not work. It works only when It's plugged in the front USB. Sometimes the connection is slow with editing platforms. But once I got used to it, I am able to use it."
2,Logitech is a brand name and one expects a quality product. The first keyboard I received caused so much havoc with constant mistyping that my PIN got locked. I requested a replacement and received a new keyboard within 3 days which was great. The new keyboard seemed to work fine but has started giving similar issues. It randomly inserts Caps or odd letters or spaces while typing. You have to keep removing the pen drive and re-inserting to tackle the problem. And this occurs at least once every 2 days.Please don't bother with this product. It only looks good.
5,"I had purchased a wireless USB keyboard + mouse in 2018 or 19. While moving homes, the mouse got lost. I was using a wireless keyobard with a wired mouse on my secondary computer. Recently I decided to upgrade all computers, bought this full set.Pros:Product works like a charm on Windows, Mac and Linux. I tested on a a Dell Inspiron with Windows 10, a MacBook Pro with Mac Catalina/ Big Sur; a  MacBook Pro with Linux (Manjaro, Pop Os) and also on a Raspberry pi 3.Four words to describe the experience:Works Like a Charm.Thanks Logitech for an awesome product. Good battery life, thanks for sending the batteries too. Sometimes getting one set of batteries is a challenge.Cons:This unit uses both AAA (Keyboard) and AA (Mouse) which can cause a bit of hassle. My only gripe so far."
1,"I have no words to express how pissed off I'm with this product. When I received the product itself I noticed the package was open. But I didn't quite mind it then. I should've returned the item immediately. It worked well for one day and today it started typing starnge keys on each keypress and ends up opening my browser every time. At first I thought it may  be a problem  with my laptop and did eveything possible to rectify the problem.. nothing changed. Hence I tried  the keyboard on 3other laptops. It's the same.When I checked the keyboard again, I noticed that the model no.on the keyboard is K220 while I have ordered MK215.(the cover/package is of MK215).I requested for a return and it shows only a replacement available for this item. I don't want to be cheated again. I just want my money."
5,"comes with batteries for keyboard and mouse. both connect using one dongle. assembly is easy. size of laptop keyboard so might be difficult to adjust but for me it is comfortable. very satisfying to type on. i have connected this keyboard to my apple laptop and most of the functions like (windows +c) instead of (command + c) can be used. good quality mouse with three buttons (middle one to scroll, and the normal left and right ones) there is no light in the keyboard and it is very light weight but good for its price considering it is wireless and comes with a wireless mouse too."
3,The mouse is perfect.The keyboard is very small compared to standard size full length keyboard. See photo comparison with Dell wired keyboard. So it will take a month or so to get used to small keys and closer key positions. But otherwise very good looking. Cells were provided and can be quickly installed. Mouse 2 AA and keyboard 2 AAA.Both worked quickly with Windows 7 and 10
4,"I'm using it with my laptop(windows, Mac, Ubuntu), Android TV and Android mobile(with help of a usb to micro USB connector).Everywhere it is writing as expected.And it is using only one USB port to use keyboard and mouse.Not sure about battery life. I'm really using it now a days and still I didn't changed battery for last 3 months.ActuallyOne drawback is there is no power button for more and keyboard. So I'm removing the battery and saving energy."
3,"I have used wired Logitech keyboard+mouse and they are awesome. This one is nowhere near what you would expect from logitech. The look and feel of keyboard is ok but the key design-formation is very bad. Direction buttons are not usable at all even for people with small/slim fingers. The keyboard is actually very light as compare to its contemporary Dell wireless keyboard and is no better than Rs 300 wired keyboard in anyway. Mouse is nice and has a good response time. Overall, not recommended for a person who use his computer for any kind of typing work. Ok for people who only want to surf web."
1,"Don't buy dis productTotal waste of ur money üí∞--U don't feel real keyboard typing becoz its 35% smaller than original keyboard--keyword sometimes gets mismatched with ur typing--no indication of light--no button to off both mouse and keyboard--Not up to mark--suggestion -buy dell keyboard with chicklet typing, good feel, soundless--manufacturer don't seen how a wireless keyboard be total shit--don't worth money--i could have not give single star ‚ú®--continuous emmision of radiation becoz product has not got key button to off it after its use.THANK YOU."
1,"I have purchased this product through Amazon online shopping. I liked this product. I am using this product for laptop. Nowadays, I have some issues with this product. When I press certain keys, strange characters appear on the screen instead of letter or number, even some Apps pops out.Waste of money"
5,this is my 3rd pair of wireless mouse and keyboard from logitechone of the most comfortable keyboards and mouses ive ever usedthey claim 24 months battery for the keyboard and 5 months for the mouseand it works as claimed and the mouse battery literally stood for over 24 months !I love thisGo ahead and buy it
3,"I am using this product since 9th July, 2019 and now facing some issues.1. When I press some keys, some strange characters appearing on the screen insted of letter or number. It's going on repeatedly until I disconnect and reconnect the batteries of my keyboard.2. It was said that battery life of keyboard will last for 2 years. But unfortunately. In the initial stage of working with the keyboard, every time I have to disconnect the batteries of the keyboard and then reconnect it, otherwise no key button is working.  However, once connected, it is working fine.  So I do not understand here whether it is a battery problem or a keyboard problem, although both problems are very serious to me.  I really depressed about what Amazon is saying in the specification and what is actually happening. Therefore, you suggest me or inform me what should I do to come out from those problems."
2,"I did not look at the dimensions and bought this combo. To my disappointment what I found that it is very small in size. Keyboard keys are too clumsy and cluttered. The mouse is also small. Mouse and keyboard doesn't have ON-OFF button.I can not comment on battery life though because I managed to return it.People looking for portability might want to buy this? Maybe, I would use rather laptop keyboard instead of this.I hope it helps."
4,"Teardown pics and scale reference pics uploaded check it outNot for gaming , ofcourse u can game with the keyboard no noticable lag or delay BUT the mouse cursor lags , I mean really lags if you are especially using wifi in the pc/laptop and doing heavy upload/download - during that time mouse will lag . Otherwise it's fine .Nothing special in the mouse - simple wireless , invisible optic mouse.Keyboard is good , smooth small linear travel, not very tactile like all membrane keyboards are . But it's really silent except the spacebar keyNo on/off button in both the mouse and keyboard. Keyboard uses 2 AAA and mouse uses 2 AA."
4,"This is my second order. Logitech has thoughtfully sent batteries also. Takes a few seconds to load and the Windows 10 recognized the Keyboard/Mouse and you are in business. From my earlier experience, the batteries last for a few months.My only crib is the Enter key is small and for people who use the keyboard all day long to code/edit software it is a pain not to have a large L shaped Enter key. It doesn't have any tell tale Capslock, Num LEDs. But other than this, this keyboard/Mouse combo is sturdy."
3,The package was horrible - water had seeped in - due to heavy rains in Mumbai - the mouse had some water on it - batteries and the keyboard were safe.Started using it immidiately - mouse and keyboard work as expected.Only downside is the arrow keys in the keyboard - too small for my liking.Also the function keys need to be pressed with Fn key - as laptop.Bought this because other keyboard and mouse were not being delivered to my location.Overall it is ok - go for it only if u don‚Äôt get anything else
5,"Pros:1) Ultra thin silicone material that protects your keys from water splashes and dust.2) Sticks well without any adhesive, it's a perfect fit for my Macbook Air m1.3) Does not dim the backlit keyboard so you can use this at night as well in dark rooms.Cons:It's a 500 bucks keyboard protector, ismai bhi cons dhoond rahe ho :pNone that I found."
4,"On the plus side, it's thin, flexible, and fits the M1 MacBook Air 2020 perfectly.However, it reduces the contrast and effectiveness of the backlighting, and you have to type a little harder. Having had keyboards damaged by water splashes on two previous MacBooks, I'm willing to put up with these two minor issues, rather than coughing up Rs 20,000 because two keys don't work.That said, this cover does not provide adequate protection around the perimeter of the keyboard - you still need to be careful"
4,"The overall product quality is great, I'm satisfied with the purchase.Pros:*Thin and soft*Fit's perfect*F and J key indicators.*Almost feels like invisibleCons:*Keybord click sound will disappear also typing becomes bit difficult.*Thin, I know I mentioned it on pro's as well but it's too thin that it may damage pretty easily.*It didn't fit well at the corners(F12 & arrows), I think it's not with every product I'm just unlucky.If you are someone who uses keyboard alot and likes the sound that magic keyboard makes, please don't go for the keyboard protector because I don't think any other product can fulfill it.If you can compromise over sound and want protect your mac from dust and fluids on the table you can go for this."
4,"It is ok product, when it comes to covering keyboard. it dosent fit perfectly, so when you type you can feel cover above your keyboard is moving vertically. Horizontally it fits perfectly, vertically all key shapes are slightly bigger than actual keys.I am using this with MacBook Air with M1.Worst part about this product is, it's Made in China."
4,its cover is very useful because of  our surrounding lot of dust & sand particles .it is harmful for keyboard button lot of dust are stored inside button so its not properly working so these cover are useful for protect from them.
5,"Especially in India we have a lot of dust in the air, so it is quite uncomfortable to clean laptop keyboards every now and then. So, I bought this case for my MacBook and it is an awesome fit. I surely recommend everyone to take this for their MacBooks. Great Job by the creators."
3,"It does serves it's purpose, that is keeping the keypad dust free. Before using this, my mac used to get dirty, specially the keyboard area, but this product solved the problem. It only has one con that, typing becomes a bit difficult when this is on relatively to when it's not. I don't know about other products, if they too cause the same problem. Check that yourself, dear reader ! ( from their reviews )P.S : It's still manageable !"
4,After a lot of search I decided to try this keyboard cover for my m1 macbook airThe cover sits perfectly and key presses don't feel that bad as I expected.I was worried about the small dust particles and this product definitely solves the problem.
5,Does not really stick to the keyboard but it offers firm protection to the keyboard and prevents it from any scratches or scuffs.It is no way value for money since it costs ~ten times as compared to what it takes to produce something like this.Looks good on my MacBook Air M1 though!
3,"The product is thin and hopefully durableFits well on the keyboard in the middle but is slightly lifted towards the edges. So given that the purpose is to protect from dust collecting on the keyboard and going inside, it would not be doing a good job towards the edges. If you can live with that, then at 499 Rs. it's a decent purchase."
5,It's a good product.I was facing the issue of dust creeping into the gap between the keys. This helps solve it!Mostly you don't even notice that there's a cover on once you use it for a while
4,"It does feels good when you are typing. But I wont suggest it if you use keyboard all the time, it might come off easily. The F4 F5 F6 switch looks different than the original ones. Other than these it‚Äôs a good product and you can go for it."
4,"Good Product at the cost taken, Quality & Fitting Is good, just it does not provide adequate transperency to backlit keyboard.But yes on terms of protection, it keeps the keyboard safe from various spillovers that might happen. Also gives a good grip to typing, no hindrance in key travelling. Also reduces sound while typing.Good product, by quality, look and price."
5,"Bought this for my MacBook Air M1. Its sleek, transparent, sits flush on the keyboard and feels perfect. The delivery experience was great too. Although I dont support the price to be so high for a thin sheet of silicone but I guess you have to get used to that buying Apple products."
3,It is okayish. Go for it. Quality is above par. It is not sticky. But let's see how it performs over the time. Let's hope it doesn't turn pale yellow.
2,"Just got it today. Had ordered the green one. The color is much darker than it looks on the images. It feels good while typing. The alignment of the letters on the actual keyboard and the cover is moved by a mm. It cannot be used in the dark as it is not transparent, the backlight on the keyboard does not come up. I am using it on M1 Macbook Air."
5,"It's a very little to the expensive side,but it's ok if you want to save your MAC's keyboards with dust and protecting your keys from stains and patches.It's very sleek that it does feel like it is there or not,it perfectly blends and fits over the keyboard."
4,Good. However the thickness could be little more and it would fit on the buttons perfectly.
4,"Nice product, fits the keyboard very well. It's very thin, but doesn't feel like a 500 rupees product.... A thin film of precision cut (with machine) silicon or rubber for 500 rupees is too much"
5,Good fit. I had issues of dust settling into the keyboard or MacBook Air. That got resolved now
1,"Poor quality, edges bend when open the package... Don't buy it"
5,This is very good product awesome material quality and durability it protects mt laptop key from all dust low cost looking so nice very cost effective products
5,"As mentioned, it‚Äôs very thin. Suitable for Laptop with touch ID."
1,"The keyboard cover did not fit properly on my MAC 13"" so I had return their product and asked for the refund, however so far have not received any update, been a week now. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER."
5,Actually its good for me. It works as per my requirement

4,"The following is my review of the Logitech MK 345 Wireless Keyboard and mouse combo:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This product is a combo which means it comes with a Wireless Keyboard and Wireless mouse.Before i get into the review here are the contents in the box:-1)One wireless Keyboard with 2 built in  AAA Duracell Alkaline batteries.2)One wireless Mouse with 1 built in AA Duracell Alkaline Battery.3)One USB receiver for connecting the keyboard and mouse to a Desktop or Laptop4)Warranty paperwork &5)User ManualThe Keyboard is a Logitech K 345 wireless keyboard.It works on the 2.4ghz wireless band.(The same band used by Wi Fi N routers).The keyboard is black in color and the keys are predominantly black in color with a few blue accents on the 12 function keys.The underside of this keyboard is blue in color.It is a full size desktop keyboard with 12 function keys on top as well as numeric keys at the side.It has an on/off switch on the top right side of the keyboard.It comes with a palm rest on the bottom to rest your palm while typing.It comes with 2 AAA Duracell Alkaline batteries built in and logitech claim that these will last for 48 months or 4 years.However,i have yet to test this claim.The operating range of this keyboard is about 10m.It has auto standby which means that the keyboard will go into a low power state automatically when not in use to preserve the battery  and you don't need to worry about draining the battery incase you forget to switch it off.The mouse included is a Logitech M 275 wireless mouse which also operates on the 2.4 ghz wireless band.It is a standard size mouse which could be used comfortably with people with small,medium and large sized hands.It is black in color on the top and blue on the underside.It is an optical mouse with 1000 Dpi (Dots Per Inch) resolution.It has an invisible optical sensor which means that the laser beam emmited from the sensor on the bottom of the mouse cannot be seen with the naked eye unlike the sensors on other optical mice which emit a red laser beam from the sensor on the bottom.It has a left and right click button as well as a scroll wheel in the center which can also be pressed like a button.It comes with a single AA Duracell alkaline battery built in and logitech claims that this battery will work for 18 months based on 8 hrs a day usage.It also has an on/off button at the bottom and this also features auto standby.The operating range for this mouse is about 10 m.The only flaw i feel this combo has personally is that the USB adapter which comes with it is not a unifying one which means that it is paired exclusively with the mouse and keyboard it comes with and if you lose the adapter the combo becomes useless as you cannot buy a spare one from the store and use it with your particular combo.You will have to buy a new combo altogether.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall it's a good product for office and home use as well as some light gaming as well.All in all it's a pretty decent combo for all it's worth and if you can overlook this one flaw it's a good buy.I hope this info was helpful to you.Thank you for reading my review."
4,"Its Being a Long time since i wrote my last review , hope i still cover all the basic points and finally the real issues that everybody misses...First of all my old DELL wireless keyboard stopped working so i brought this one , it had some battery issue otherwise was working fine for the last two yearsI consider this a BASIC or starter wireless keyboard and mouse, and I am reviewing it IN THAT CONTEXT (even though there are a couple of Logitech wireless combos that are below this one). In that regard, it is quite good.Right from the outset I was very impressed with it's no-hassle plug and play aspect. I literally removed it from the box (batteries came already installed), plugged the tiny nano-receiver into a USB port on the old laptop that I happened to have handy at the time and both the keyboard and mouse were recognized and responsive in under 30 seconds. From box to working in a minute or two. That is probably record time for any computer accessory that I've ever installed.‚û§'TIP: While this is plug-and-play and works perfectly without installing any drivers or software, you can get some added functionality if you install Logitech's Setpoint software. I have provided the link for it on the bottom of this review.'‚û§IMPORTANT NOTE: Many people comment that the mouse is small. This is partially an ILLUSION due to the SHAPE of the mouse, which is a bit different from others. If you see my comparison photos, you will see that it is not much smaller than other mice.I used two standard size mice and one very small travel mouse for comparison. Some people have also commented on the light weight of the mouse. This is actually true as it is in fact relatively light:Here are my weight comparisons (without/with batteries):Included Mouse (M275)-63g/86g VX Revolution (M-RBU126)- 83g/110g Marathon (M705)-87g/135gVX Nano (M-RC134)-73/95gFIRST IMPRESSION (Overall): Both the keyboard and the mouse are fairly light. There is protective plastic on the keyboard which once removed reveals an attractive glossy surface around the key portion of it. The palm rest has a flat rather than glossy finish and has small indentations which give it some very subtle texture. The mouse has a very narrow wraparound glossy collar (also covered with protective plastic). The sides (indentation for thumb and opposite side) have the same flat sheen and textured design as on the keyboard's palm-rest. The result is a sort of two-toned black on black look. Aesthetically, the mouse and keyboard co-ordinate very well.MOUSE: This is quite obviously a right-handed mouse. Some might consider the mouse to be on the SMALLER side. This is really a MATTER OF PREFERENCE and as I already noted, this is largely an illusion. I have used both larger and smaller mice and sometimes it is just a matter of what you are accustomed to. I usually prefer the smaller mice because they seem easier to maneuver around with subtle finger movements. It has an overall ergonomic shape that feels pretty comfortable and natural in my own medium-sized hand. I can understand those with bigger hands preferring something a little more substantial. This is a great mouse to use with a laptop (or as a dual-use travel/stationary mouse), especially since it works with the nano receiver and has the small look.This is a no-frills mouse. It has the basic left and right click button and wheel. It does not have any extra buttons that you find on some other mice that are usually programmed to move forwards or backwards through web pages, zoom, etc. The wheel does have a push button. When depressed, it puts the mouse into a 4-way scroll mode, that is you can scroll in four directions around a page by moving the mouse as you would normally move the cursor. Depress again to return to cursor control. It is made of a rubber-like material which gives it a nice feel.The mouse seems responsive and I have not had any issues with losing connectivity so far.KEYBOARD: Normal full-sized keyboard. There is an on/off switch and an LED Caps Lock indicator. The ""Function"" and ""Control"" keys might be a little larger than on other keyboards (especially the Function key) and it seems like the space bar was made a little smaller to accommodate this. I have not found it to be a problem for me, but felt I should note it any way. There are the typical flip-out feet to set the keyboard on an angle. The palm-rest is angled nicely and feels a comfortable size, not too obtrusive nor too diminutive. The keys feel soft when pressed and are fairly quiet. Logitech claims this to be a spill-resistant design. I have not tested this out yet, but if you knew me, you'd know that I will be able to report on this feature fairly soon.There is a full range of function keys across the top with default shortcut/media keys displayed as icons (Home, Mail, Search, Calculator, Media Player, Previous, Play/Pause, Next, Mute, Decrease Volume, Increase Volume). You need to download the Setpoint software from Logitech's website for these to work properly and the way that you want them to.BATTERY LIFE: Logitech claims that this combo has ""Advanced energy-efficient design"" which should yield a very generous battery life of 3 years for the keyboard and 18 months for the mouse. Of course there is no way to prove or disprove this just yet.Packaging : When i opened the plastic wrap than immediately the USB connector fell out i was a bit surprised as the whole box was not even opened yet , then i found that the whole box was badly torn and a hole was there where it came off , as we all know that connector is the main thing without it its useless and the hassle of invalid return because of missing items i would suggest the seller or amazon to better take care of this issue and hope no one else faces it againIN CONCLUSION: I will say again that this is good basic or starter combo. If you are in the market for such for yourself or someone else, I don't think that you can go wrong with this. The main point should be making sure that the user will be comfortable with a smaller rather than more substantial mouse (at the risk of sounding sexist I will go out on a limb and say that this mouse is probably perfectly suited for many female users). If it is for someone who is not a gamer/cutting edge/latest gadget type of a person who just needs the best of the basics without a lot of extras, than this might just be perfect.It is also a good choice if you need something fairly portable or for occasional use with a laptop.I have provided a few pictures below hope they help in making your choice...Questions/Comments welcome."
2,"The mouse double stopped working after a couple of months use, I bought a new mouse M235 but again I was unable to unify with this product's with the receiver since there is no unifying feature in the keyboard. I was expecting the life of this product to last around 2 to 3 years but the mouse stopped working so early which is very disappointing. I believe they should include the unifying feature to this product as well."
4,"I bought this combo for my home use. First thing I like about this product is because of the price. At 2k it is pretty decent keyboard and a mouse.Keyboard:I like the ergonomics of this combo which is pretty good. The keys of the keyboard are fairly well spaced, and there is as well positioned sloping arm pad extension, resulting in an amazing ease of typing. I could even type comfortably, placing the keyboard on my lap.The keyboard also has a small green indicator for Capslock, located just adjacent to the On/Off key.It is not fully soft touch keyboard and it has a distinct sound which was little annoying to me at the beginning but when comes to the comfort am happy with the keys.I found the ""Fn"" which is bigger in size initially i thought it was weird but when it comes to the accessibility I feel it is really innovative.I didn't find any delay in input while typing, it is pretty responsive.Mouse:The mouse provided with this combo is for the right hand comfort and i like the ergonomics. It fits in my hand.Receiver is very small compact USB receiver. Both devices wireless range is good.Windows 10 on my lap top was able to detect and download the driver with ease, no need for an overhead searching for additional drivers least in my case it worked well.Only Disadvantage, One receiver for both the device. If the receiver is lost, DONOT PANIC look for the best deals again.  :)I received this product with Duracell alkaline batteries included both for the keyboard and mouse. I typed this entire review using this keyboard it was so pleasant. Happy Typing !"
1,"This keyboard has very nice ergonomic design and the keys are very well built and tactile. But the connectivity is extremely poor and gets interrupted frequently. Which makes it almost unusable. If you are typing something, then some letters will be missed because of this connectivity issue.Battery consumption is also fairly higher than my last logitech model.My advise will be to stay away from this model."
3,"Pros:- Good tactile feedback while typing- Great keyboard ergonomics- Batteries lasts almost a year of heavy use- Good quality printing on key-caps- Keyboard has a wrist-rest extension- LED indicator for Caps Lock- Media keys for volume, play/pause, etc.- Shape of mouse comfortably fits in the palm- Switches to turn-off the keyboard and mouse- Tiny receiver dongle; can be left plugged into laptop permanently- Looks and feels premiumCons- Keys start to get jammed and mouse clicks can get unresponsive after about 10 months of heavy use- Noisy keystrokes- Mouse scroll-wheel can be tight for someIt's great for home use, but stay away from this for professional use. I'm a programmer and I type for a living. I was very happy with this purchase for the first 8-10 months, after which a couple of frequently used keys such as Ctrl and Spacebar started to jam. At around the same time, mouse clicks began to miss, and click-and-drag operations started to become a pain.I may be wrong to criticise a membrane keyboard at this price point to show wear after 10 months of heavy use. Nonetheless, it's a fact that this set won't last you over a year if you plan to use it heavily. It will, however, easily handle home use and other light office use-cases. It's got great ergonomics and works a good distance away from the receiver.[Rant] It's been a good year with this duo, but it was high time I upgraded to a mechanical keyboard. I bought the TVSE Bharat Gold as my first mechanical keyboard and it's been absolute joy to type on. Once you experience typing on a mechanical keyboard, there's no going back. I urge all the professionals out there to also make the switch. Seriously, it's worth it. [End Rant]"
1,"This is probably the worst keyboard I‚Äôve used (not that I‚Äôve used a ton, but still).First the packaging itself. It was one of the worst you can find anywhere. Appario ships it without any protection. Just the original cardboard box Logitech bundles it with for the keyboard and an unsealed polybag‚Äînot the sealed blister pack you get even with the cheapest mouse from China, a 3√ó5 inch polybag‚Äîfor the mouse, both slipped inside the plastic bag supplied by Amazon. When I opened it, the cardboard box of the keyboard was completely squashed, with no joint intact; the keyboard itself was out of its plastic sleeve as was the mouse as both were unsealed. The cover for the battery compartment for keyboard was loose too, in the outer bag no less. I wonder how the keyboard or the mouse survived the transit. To top it all, the receiver was missing, making this combo a completely useless product.Now the keyboards itself. The only thing to write home about it is the palm support. Everything else reeks of stinginess. It is a‚Äúfull‚Äù keyboard in the name only. It‚Äôs smaller than most‚Äîeven the cheapest‚Äîkeyboard you‚Äôll come across (thus using less material and saving costs to the company). The keys are small, the space between the keys minimal (so, if you have chubby fingers, don‚Äôt even think about buying it). Tactile feedback is below average (not the worst though) and key travel is horrible. If you type a lot, this is not recommended at all. The stingy icing on the cake of this keyboard is that Logitech has done away with separate Menu and Windows keys on the right. Menu is clubbed with Ctrl under Fn key (that is, you need to press Fn + Ctrl to get Menu) and right Windows key is absent.I don‚Äôt know what justifies the more than 2k you pay for (as I‚Äôm writing this review, the price has gone up to almost 3k). Certainly the palm support is not that costly. The performance is worth maybe ‚Çπ1000 max for the combo, if you throw in the wireless connectivity. The keyboard is like the sub-300 sold at local computer peripheral shops around you (did I say it‚Äôs made in China?).The mouse is great (at least when new), with nice feedback (remember I didn't get the receiver; this is, ironically, a non-working feedback). Good ergonomics and non-slippery grip. But it certainly doesn‚Äôt, and can‚Äôt, overcome the limits of the keyboard it‚Äôs paired with. With Apple-like crippling on board, you cannot use it independently of the keyboard unless you use another keyboard (wired or wireless). In any case, it in itself is not that cost-justifying (2k, not to talk of the current 3k).Clearly not a value for money product."
1,The same goes to me The mouse s left click developed clicking issue. Never expected such quality from Logitech. Keyboard seems to be fine but this particular issue with mouse is common with most of the people so I strongly recommend to NOT buy this.
1,"Some keys are not functioning properly after few days of use -- they get stuck in the middle when pressing. The major issue is the random automatic clicks and text/item selections that happen without touching the mouse or keyboard at all! I ensured that there are no interfering WiFi or other devices located nearby, but still the issue of mouse generating random clicks and selecting items on its own persists. I have tried using different surfaces to place the mouse as well, but the issue persists. Not happy at all with this product -- didn't expect this quality from Logitech."
1,this product plastic is very cheap. it is a made in China Product. all of the logitech products that i have used till date had very good quality plastic. this is the first logitech product out of all that i have used till date that has a very cheap quality raw material. the lock behind its keyboard is made up of very weak quality plastic. try logitech mk320 that has a good quality raw material used in its manufacturing.
3,"Not for gaming or any such thing. The keyboard layout is for day to day use. While the keys have a pressing depth which is very good for fast typing, the key surface seems a bit squeezed and smaller horizontally. Never seen that before on a keyboard. The mouse is contoured and a tad small- but does its job. The overall feel of the product is very tacky, light and cheap. Still can be ignored as the typing experience is better. A not so good feature is the hotkeys like browser launch, volume etc don't act on pressing, till you press FN+  desired hotkey. EXtra work.What I didn't like is the seller first sent me a keyboard which had some defect in some keys not working. That was JUne 2019. I asked and got prompt replacement- Only to travelling till Diwali. Today  I broke the seal and though all seemed good- the USB connector that is kept inside the mouse was missing. As return window was closed to due my delay in inspecting- I am now left with a set having no connector- I pulled out the old connector which is working. Seller didn't inspect and sent a pack with missing parts. Not nice I didn't check on receipt. Never happened before with Amazon. Lesson learnt. Poor service."
3,"The overall plug and play is really good. Just attach the USB dongle to the computer, turn on the keyboard/mouse and it starts working, right from Bios. This is great!However, the biggest problem I have with this product is that the keyboard stops working intermittently. For every 3-4 minutes of use, I encounter a blackout period of about 15-30 seconds (where no key works).  The mouse had no such issue.I searched online and could not find any documentation related to this. I suspect that this is some interference issue. However,  as it is plug and play, there is no configuration options (specifically what channel to use, transmit/receive power, etc). So, even if it is related to interference, there is no way to undo it.If some one has found the solution, they can post it here.-2* for the intermittent failure."
1,"This would be the worst wireless keyboard in the market, considering the price range,U would get 2 better once at the same price.1.Firstly mouse click stoped working, 2.Then usb receiver stopped working, opened it up n put a paper under it, then started working,3.mouse scroller started misbehaving4.Lastly few keys in keyboard wont work thus resulting utmost frustrating u would smash it on ground.Then u would be wasting 3k on nothing.Thank you!"
4,"Mice:- Overall a good product for day to day use.Pos: I already own M221 Mice since my dell combo's mice started recognising double clicks and the scroll wheel stopped working, compared to both dell mice and M221 this one comes in between in case weight, while the former one is the heaviest and later one being the most silent.It has green led to let you know the status of battery and when its turned on the green led stays on for quite a bit.Cons: At this price the mice should come with silent technology, for God's sake this combo costs Rs1800 this is the least we can ask for, the clicking sound is irritating after using M221.Not as accurate as it should be, downside of being 1000dpi but even my dell mouse was more accurate than bith M221 and this mice.Keyboard:- Really good keyboard, better than my dell's keyboard, it keys make a really good clicking sound which I love to hear and they even look good.Pros: On/Off button to switch it on/off to save battery power.Logitech's devices are known for its battery life and adding to this the switch will help you to extend the battery life.Good color scheme blue and black looks really sporty and attractive.LED indicator for caps lock which makes life that much easier.Good and broad wrist support is provided makes it easy to use for long sessions of working.Cons: LED indicator for num lock is missing, would be appreciated if company had provided indicator.Keys are relatively small than my dell's keyboard and well its a bit hard to get used to it, maybe I am nitpicking here.No hotkey function provided to increase or decrease brightness, maybe they made it thinking it will be used with desktops only but well even laptop users need external combos logitech.A reall large size function key is provided on the right side which is bigger than all other keys around it, instead a 2 small function keys on both side would have been more helpful, well every device has some shortcomings.NOTE: I bought this combo for my laptop and the connector shown in other reviews mentioned it being the size of a pendrive whereas mine is really small as shown in the pictures. I appreciate the fact that logitech updated it as a big connector would have added to the task of removal everytime I had to carry my laptop with me in bag. This is plugged in and its as it is since I have plugged it in the laptop.Duracell batteries are provided, maybe the claim of long battery life will be fulfilled as duracell batteries are really good, lets see.Will update on durability and battery life after few months use, until then take care you all.If you have any doubt feel free to ask."
2,"Great Keyboard and Mouse Combo. Have been using it about a month now and the battery indicators are still showing as good. Sometimes i even forget to turn off the keyboard and mouse but it hasn't affected the battery life.Update: 17/03/2016: I had to downgrade the rating on this product as after about 6 months (it failed at some point in February) of use some of the keys on the keyboard have stopped functioning. I will be contacting Logitech to claim under the warranty, but I expected better from a company like Logitech. The mouse is working just fine. Disappointed with the keyboard issue though. Lowering the rating of this product to 2 till the matter is resolved. Will update soon!"
4,"The keyboard and mouse work all right. Range is decent as long as there is line of sight to the receiver. It refused to connect after a few days, which turned out to be the fault of the USB extension I had purchased to get the receiver in line of sight.I expect battery life will be fantastic like all other Logitech wireless products I use - I need to wonder why they stop working once every few years, then realise I might need batteries. Like all others, I expect the middle mouse button to stop working after six months. I use it a lot to open new tabs on browsers, and it wears them out.The keys feel good. They are fairly silent but not as much as the chiclet types on the K400. They definitely feel better than the G100, which was horrible to start with and then just got worse over time. Mouse is a little small. I only have 7"" palms and on that it feels small, though not as tiny as the M235 which I have two of. The sculpted shape makes it feel smaller than it is, if it was ambidextrous it would have probably felt a bit chunkier.All in all it's pretty good. I also have another wireless unit that i use on another machine, this was a step up. I'm taking one star off for the lack of multimedia keys, which are critical when trying to control a TV from 10 feet away, and the volume icon is just too small. The Fn functions do work, but in the dark they're almost impossible to see."
5,I just love it.  Feeling to work more using this keyboard.  As usual Amazons amazing deal price of 1700 is another attraction.  My experience after two days of usage.1. Trendy look and dual color.  Bottom blue and media function keys.2. Duracell batteries.3. Smooth keys and mouse movements.4. Plug and play.  Just hassle free starting.5. Light weight keyboard.  I feel a bit heavy mouse due to battery in it but later realized that it sits nicely in the hand.6. Apt setup for office and business usage.
1,"This is my review after using this kb mouse combo for over a period of 6 months.Kb is still good. Keys are spaced out exactly like how I want.But, the mouse is pathetic. It was good for 3 months and gradually it came to a point where click does not get registered at all first time and it becomes pain to do operations like drag and drop. Replacing the batteries also did not help.So, my recommendation is to avoid this combo only because of the pathetic mouse quality"
4,"It may easily be the best Wireless Keyboard Mouse combo available in this range. I'm writing this review after two years of continuous and extended usage. I have used it for a little bit of gaming and doing work (design work) involving a lot of usage of the mouse. Agreed it may not be the tool for actual professionals but it has held good for these 2 years. The keyboard buttons are nice to press and type and the buttons haven't gone hard or unresponsive yet. That extended area to keep the palm is really nice. The media and shortcuts buttons multiplexed with the Function keys are really handy. The arrow keys are decently spaced from other keys and the seperate Num pad is another plus. There is also a light to indicate caps lock. Would have been nice if they included one for Num lock too.Now about the mouse. It is well suited for right hand use and designed with that in mind. It fits well in the left hand too. Now the problem with the mouse is something that is common with many of the Logitech mouses. The left button got dodgy in 6 months. It was a hit or miss which was really frustrating and hindered my work. Now the solution to that is opening the microswitch for the left mouse button and bending the springy contact inside so that it clicks nicely. It has been holding so good after I did that. It would have been a perfect device if not for that silly microswitch which is surprisingly made by a well known brand.I have been using this combo for my laptop and I am yet to change the Duracell batteries that came in the box. I'm quiet surprised by it's performance and battery usage. It still looks cool after so much usage. The gloss on the keyboard will certainly get scratched, but still looking fine nonetheless."
3,"OK for the price. I also use couple of mechanical keyboards. This is nowhere near to that typing quality. None the less considering price, the quality is OK. It is fine in you type now and then and in small lengths at a time. But if you type a lot, these are definitely not good. Mouse is of reasonable quality."
1,LATEST REVIEW AFTER USING FOR 6 MONTHS:The key board has lost it‚Äôs original feel. The keys are becoming tight and are VERY NOISY. Typing sound distracts my nearby colleagues and also interferes with audio when on conference calls. So it is almost impossible to type when you‚Äôre on a call without muting the laptop/headphone. The mouse is really good and continues to perform well. Overall response time for both keyboard and mouse are fantastic.OLD REVIEW 1 WEEK AFTER PURCHASE:Been using it for a week now. Both the mouse and keyboard have a pleasant tactical feel and are easy to use as they‚Äôre very responsive. Typing especially is stress free. Both have a compact and ergonomic design. Only fault I see so far is that the keyboard height raisers are not robust. So I‚Äôm a little careful when I deploy or fold them back
5,"I hand a chronic neck pain while using my laptop for long hours in the office hence I purchased a stand that would elevate my viewing and once I got the stand all I wanted was a keyboard n mouse so did some little research on ergonomic keyboard and mouse combos and found this one. It has been 3 weeks now and man there is a hell lot of difference the keyboard and mouse are both extremely good the functionality, design and quality are top notch and durable. All I can say is its a great product and if you are looking for ergonomic keyboard n mouse this is the ONE!!!"
5,"Pros:1. Fast Plug and play: be it Windows or Linux, you just need to plug in the dongle and your keyboard/mouse will be working within 2 seconds.2. Full-size keyboard with dedicated numpad and function keys.3. Very durable: I've dropped the mouse more times than I'd like to admit and it hasn't broken.4. Long battery life: Been almost a year and I still haven't needed to change the batteries that came with it.5. On/off switches: they're present on both the devices so you can conserve the battery life.6. Reliability: never faced any drop in connection with either the mouse or the keyboardCons:1. No extra buttons on the mouse: just the standard left, middle and right click.2. Bottom surface of the mouse is a dust and lint magnet. I have to clean it every month.3. Mouse is on the smaller side. If you have big hands this might be a problem.4. Lack of Menu key: they made the function button really big so there's no dedicated menu key. Pressing Fn+Right Ctrl does the same thing though."
4,Logitech MK345 Wireless Combo  is known for its PC accessories. This one keyboard is full blown one and its best for the office use and its keyboard is also very sturdy.Mouse at sometime we may feel the palm pain. may be need to get used to this mouse with the rite posture. But if you are looking for full keyboard and mouse wireless one . This is the best one .Also has the Power on and off on both the keyboard and mouse. Its really usefull to save the battery power when not in use.So far not used for Gaming yet. Let me try and see how it works :)But the price of the product varies a lot on different places
5,"I was using K400 earlier for the past 3 to 4 years and I remember to have changed battery only once. Its keyboard was struck due to long exposure of dust. This is the point where I  brought Logitech again, this time MK345. In contrast with the previous version, MK 345 is a full length keyboard and rugged. Its built quality is strong and key presses are tactile unlike K400. Palm rest is comfortable and I feel full in control when I type and sit in front of the computer. Mouse too is handy and good for small to medium hand size. Installation is very simple and Windows recognizes immediately as soon as it boots. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase and recommend for anyone who use computer heavily."
4,"Works well, the range (distance between receiver and keyboard/mouse) and responsiveness are good. I am not using for anything demanding like gaming but use it across platforms (windows, android tv and Mac - yes seems to be supported by Mac too). They keys are well placed. The touch typing experience is good and you get used the keyboard fairly quickly. No it is not a mechanical keybaord, but there is a significant key travel and satisfying click after a key press. My only gripe is with the keyboard is that it is ever so slightly mushy, but people who haven‚Äôt used mechanical keyboards probably won‚Äôt be able to tell the difference. I wanted to give this 4.5 stars, as that option is not available, it‚Äôs 4 stars."
1,"This is the worst experience I have ever got by purchasing any product through Amazon. I purchased it in the month of March, 2018. The keyboard was not functional in the month of September, 2018. Then I claimed warranty and got a new keyboard+ mouse combo. This new combo is not working properly right now. Some keys in the keyboard are automatically pressed ( for eg. in my case cntrl button). I have replaced the batteries also. But cannot get rid of it. The mouse is OK. But the keyboard is not working properly. This same problem is occurred more than one times in two different sets. Now, I am not in the warranty period. So, I cannot replace it. After investing more than 2000 rupees, if you get problems frequently within and after the warranty period, then what will you expect from this product? So from my point of view, this is only wastage of money.I purchased another keyboard+mouse combo from Logitech whose price was near about 1160 rupees (I forgot and that product was ordered from my friend's account). I got the same problem in that combo also. I replaced that combo two times. But after warranty period, I had no option instead of purchasing another keyboard.So, my overall experience to the Logithech keyboard+mouse combo is very bad. If you want suggestion from me, then it will be better for you to either use wireless combo of another company or use wired keyboard and mouse."
3,"What I didn't like is the palm rest advertised. In the picture if you look you will think it is great, but when you have the product, you realise that the width of the support is not at all sufficient. Moreover, the function keys are sleek and so you need to be careful while using them. Another flaw is the home key. In all the keyboards I have used so far they were all in the same place of the standard layout, but this one has insert key there which is very annoying when you try to combine with shift key for copying something.The mouse that comes along with it is excellent.So buy it only for a discounted price (anywhere below 1900/- inr)"
5,"It's the right size for medium size hands. The battery life is supposedly great - yet to test it out, but with my history Logitech products, they usually last forever battery-wise.The materials are all plastic and nothing premium feeling, but that's expected for the price (I got it for around Rs 2100 for the mouse + keyboard in May 2020).5 stars for doing what it's supposed to do!"
5,"Extremely good keyboard, the battery life is good, the keyboard buttons are all placed so ergonomically that will not feel any fatigue even after long hours of typing, moreover, this keyboard is extremely sturdy just its USB Keyboard counterpart such as TVSE Gold, and aesthetically extremely good to look at. I have been using this for around a year, and am extremely satisfied, it looks sturdy, is extremely responsive, is compatible with Windows, Linux or Ubuntu laptops as well as desktops, I have used them on all of these. And I must thank Amazon for prompt delivery."
5,"Hi,As a fulltime software Dev, I was having eye & neck pain due to wrong posture and screen too near. So coupled with lappy stand, this keyboard helps me a lot.*Pro Tip:* The wrist/palm rest works best with 7degree keyboard legs open.It felt uncomfortable & the keys looked small plus mouse gave me a nasty wrist pain at first  & for 2 days I was cursing both mouse & keyboard.But after using for few days, when I got habituated. I really loved them both.They are truly ergonomic according to me.-:Shubham Shree,  NIT Trichy CSE Grad"
5,"Was a skeptic of wireless keyboard's and mouse for a long time, but this beauty makes a convincing case for all those who are in the skeptic boat. It was a breeze to setup , just plug in the receiver and it starts working as expected. the palm rest at the end of the keyboard is a rarity these days and is much appreciated. The plastic seems durable, and the keys give a good amount of feedback though they do take some time to get used to. Only the elite programmer will be disappointed i feel :)Mouse has a shape that is unconventional and yet is comfortable to hold.Combo comes with the duracell cell's and i hope they last a long time, as proclaimed.P.S- Registering my product by making an account on Logitech india website, confirms the prduct warranty to be of 1 year duration from date of purchase.[ attached the amazon invoice, and typed in the serial number found near battery compartments of keyboard/mouse.]"
4,"Using the keyboard with a Ubuntu and MacBook pro.Experience with Ubuntu laptop has been great and almost flawless. I connect to windows virtual machine and the keyboard shortcuts worked great for them. Felt as if directly working with windows machine. So this has become the defacto combination to use for long hours of work.Experience with the Mac Book has not been that great. It works ok for regular keys. But as might be the case with other keyboards as well, the windows specific keys do not work, or at least I have not had the patience to figure out to get them to work. Couple of times, the keyboard stop functioning. I had to pull out the usb reciever and plug it back in to get it to work again. After couple of such instances within a day, I have totally kept the keyboard away from the using with Mac. Might try it out a few days later when previous frustrating experience fades.I ordered this one looking at some space for palm rest. The size looks small given my hand size. It is still better than not having anything at all.The mouse is decent although again felt a little small. The shape is comfortable to use for right handed user.Months of Mac usage had probably got me used to a little wider spacing of the keys. I felt my fingers getting little cramped when typing on day one. After couple days of use, feel like the fingers have adjusted and typing has been more comfortable."
1,For Seller:1. The packing was awful. The box was torn and the keyboard was sticking out.Few points on Keyboard:1. The keys are too hard and are uncomfortable. I have used mechanical keyboards and they are not this hard to type.2. The palm rest is of no use as they are very small. You cannot rest your palm on it. Dell keyboards with palm rests are better.3. On switch on the keyboard does not work. The keyboard works whether the switch is on or off. I cannot switch the keyboard off.Few points on Mouse:1. The built quality is not very assuring. The plastic used is of inferior quality.2. Clicks on the mouse are clumsy and do not assure any confidence.3. The cursor jump when you use it.4. Tracking is not good.5. The size of the mouse is too small.Pros:1. Easy plug and play.2. Batteries included.3. Wireless receiver is small.
4,"18-Jan , purchased. Good product.21-Oct , After 10 months from purchasing mouse scroll wheel stopped working. Contacted support and service, they gave a plan to upgrade windows , inter chipset, bluetooth and wirless driver. This is happening in 2020.16-Dec , Received a Replacement Product today. Luckly i was under one year warranty.Recommend not to invest in fancy high tech keyboard and mouse. Mid series are fine. I got K220 as a replacement for a short time , it is a good choice though looks cheap but serves the purpose."
2,"This product I bought as I thought that logitech would make reliable stuff. The mouse broke down 6 months down the line. (First time this happened to me) Click and drag stopped working, so selecting texts etc was bad. Went to logitech center as still in warranty and got replacement in 3 weeks. Now after 9 months the mouse again gave up. I guess I am out of warranty as this was covered for 1 year.That is beside the point. the  mouse should not have gone kaput in so little time.Maybe will buy unbranded cheap products . They might also last as much or longer"
5,"Writing detailed review after 2 months of office use.Pros -- Keyboard & mouse are convenient to use and are very responsive since they use the Logitech's USB Nano receiver.- Mouse is sized perfectly. It's not small as it looks in the pictures due to its right-handed use shape.- Batteries will last long ( 3 yrs for keyboard and 1.5 yrs for mouse)Cons -- Bit pricey at 1900 Rs but worth investing if you want a trustworthy wireless solution.- At this price I was expecting better quality key presses.- Key caps are bit wiggly and often resist the key-press if pressed with a slight angle.I needed a keyboard & mouse for office use and had to research a lot. I even returned 2 keyboards before this final purchase. My requirements were.1. Standard layout.2. Quiet, unlike my loud mechanical keyboard in home that I love but is very clicky.3. Wireless, because i need to take my laptop to meeting rooms & presentations quite often.4. Good quality keys.5. Ergonomic design.6. Not too expensive as it will be kept in office.It fulfilled all my requirements. I love this wireless solution. I keep the USB Nano receiver plugged in my laptop all the time so that I don't loose it and it's barely noticeable since it's very small. Everyday before leaving office I just switch off both mouse & keyboard to save some battery but even if you don't, this battery should last more than a year.Conclusion:This keyboard cannot be my main programming keyboard because I love my cherry MX brown cooler master mechanical keyboard.But for my office use nothing beats this Logitech MK345."
3,"The palm rest on the keyboard is too small and useless, unless you've tiny hands. Only my thumb rests on the palm rest, not my palm, and I don't have huge hands.Function keys are packed together. Have to look at the keyboard each time you want to change the volume. A minor inconvenience during gaming.I use a G300S for claw grip. And this mouse is about 2/3rd the size of that. Will be uncomfortable for long gaming sessionsMouse has no DPI modifier. Might be better off buying a cheaper one from a local brand"
3,"I chose this keyboard because of wrist rest. All other keyboards does not come with it. But when actually keyboards arrived, I found wrist rest is very small. If I put my wrist on it, my fingers can not type lower side keys.Still build quality of this keyboard is good. I think there is no alternative to microsoft ergonomic keyboard."
3,"It's almost going to be 3 years this july since I purchased this product.I've used both these products at an average of 5 mins per day in the last 3 years. Since the usage is pretty less, I expect more lifetime.1. Ergonomics is decent. Don't expect much.2. My left click on the mouse has gone for a 6. After 4-5 hard clicking, it does a click on the screen or sometimes the other way round. This is the most irritating part.3. Keyboard as of now hasn't shown any signs of going kaput.I would have given 4 stars to this product if my mouse clicks hadn't gone berserk.I need to see better options to replace my mouse. Yes, henceforth, I'll be wary of Logitech for future purchases."
4,"Nice keyboard for normal use at this price range only one issue ""back space key is too short"" otherwise this product is highly recommended one more thing i get this keyboard for 580 i think they should reduce price to 500 and if possible 450 well at 580 this is also value for money product i used this product for normal typing purpose i find this keyboard is nice deal this is a compact key but still keys are very decently arrange enough gap or space go for it"
2,"As a programmer it bit difficult to use this keyboard mainly backspace key and spacing between the keys are not that great hence there is always typo mistake happens using this keyboard, i always have a love toewrds chiclet or mechanical keyboard, I love using amazon basic chiclet keyboard which is bang for bucks"
3,if you want to buy a cheap keyboard and yet a little premium quality then go for it.. i have been using for the past 3 days and liking it. i will do a short video on my channel as well. however there are cheaper options but they will slide over as they are too light and of not so good build quality.
3,Please produce the earlier TVS CHAMP KEYBOARD which you had. This new one doesn't stands near to that one. Very disappointed with the keyboard design button spacing and usability.
3,I bought this keyboard thinking it'll be made in India. But sadly it's imported from China and marketed by TVS. The keys feel cheap and very flimsy. It's better to go with a cheaper brand which also imports from China than pay ‚Çπ 650 for this. Disappointed with TVS group.
1,The keyboard is not working properly. Many keys appear multiple times for a single key press. Sometimes adjacent keys also get typed. I am very disappointed. Please let me know where I can get it serviced.
1,"This product quality is not good , one of a key was damaged. and the keyboard was printed in hindi and that is not requested. or not given in description also."
5,|This is very good keyboard with BIG ENTER key. This is very helpful for accounting with big ENTER key

2,"Plastic quality is poor, biggest regret is its a Chinese product."
1,"Review based on usage for more than 10days:Keyboard is not really ergonomic as claimed. It has just one level adjustment at the back to increase height. Keya are not soft and have to press really hard, like a typewriterMouse was okay, but now has started giving problems. When I try to select text, it unselects automatically, so have to go back from the beginning. Very difficult to work with it. Now I'll need a separate mouse, so what's the point of buying a combo üòûPlastic is very cheap quality.My advise... Skip this and buy something else.Update on July 18:Keyboard also stopped working yesterday. It just doesn't type few keys and you need to hit the keys very hard (like an old radio) to make it work. Very irritating. I stopped using them both. Can't return too. It didn't even work few weeks"
3,No batteries include and no instruction. Didn‚Äôt expect a lot anyway. Would hardly recommend
4,"This keyboard is a little annoying to use. The box says quiet typing but it is not like that. The sounds of the key is a little higher than you‚Äôd expect but however, it varies from person to person. The mouse is good for small hands but for medium or huge it is a problem. Also the length of the wire for the USB is small and you may find it irritating. But I needed it for sometime. If you don‚Äôt have any problems with the things mentioned above, then this is a good product considering the price."
5,"Keyboard and mouse both very comfortable to use and easy to install.The mouse immediately started working after inserting battery.For keyboard, after inserting battery, you've to press Esc and K keys together then you'll hear it connected to the laptop.Price seems a little costly."
5,"The keyboard and mouse really competes with other branded wireless keyboard and mouse available thus far. The typing experience is sublime. The keys are mounted like a gaming keyboard (minus the luminous display and the silicone padding beneath the keys!). The Mouse is good, I have never needed to change DPI settings so I cannot boast that quality here.The wireless receiver for both mouse and keyboard is located on the underbelly of the mouse.Unlike many other wireless products this keyboard requires 1 AA battery and the mouse requires 2 AAA batteries.All the extra keys work perfectly! You have (in order) Media pause/play, Media Stop, Media reverse, Media forward, Volume increase, volume decrease, mute, Calculator, web browser (set default), mail app (set default), file explorer (set default), sleep and shutdown.I cannot attest the durability because I have purchased the product quite recently.The negatives (if any) I must say is about the make and looks of the product. For this price range the quality outshines the fashion.The Keyboard and mouse do not have a 'off' button. It works like some wireless product in the market after a minute or so, if we do not use the mouse then it automatically switches off then a click will activate it again.The stickers on the keys of the keyboard might be washed away over time. There is no capslock on/off and numlock on/off indicator on the keyboard. The battery power indicator blinks only when the battery runs out of juice (I guess)Hope this review eases the decision in buying this product."
1,I'm really unsetisfy for this your product and I'm always anything item purchase from this site I'm always happy for this service but this time it's products is not working proper and this thing wasting my time & money so I'm requesting to amazon.in to solve my problem and give me refund policy or return policy-thank you
2,product is not so much good... but regarding the price it is good for some time use... for normal it is okay... but if you want to game then please with mechanical keyboard...this time I have not so much budget so I bought it for some time use... later I will buy a good mechanical keyboard and a wireless mouse
2,"You get what you pay for. Quality is satisfactory as per the pricing. Good for those who are looking for a temporary and less priced keyboard mouse. For longer usage and durability, I'd recommend other."
1,"first time i ordered, mouse did not work.i ordered replacement, the keys were loosely scattered all over the keyboard when I got it.Returned it and asked for refund.Will buy some other brand now."
1,Mouse was good but the keyboard.. Responds like after 5 seconds and is pressing by itself. There isn't a return policy either. Applied for a replacement. Made in china
5,"Generally i've seen external keyboards ..mone like this though  some keys camedismantled (not broken ) typing is very soft nd  smooth no noise , just dont go by comments  if ur looking for a *wireless keyboard and a mouse * at this price. PI would reccomend order it and  experience it yourself.value for money.sheerness, comfort. Afterall Amazon offers free exchange even if  received damaged !"
4,"Combo is good for the price but I started finding some issues with mouse clicks and a few keys like SHIFT. Mouse started clicking twice on my single clicks but not always but most of the time. Left shift button gets stuck at times and so does right shift and enter. This tends to happen often with budgeted keyboards and mouse.  So, I would recommend only if you are slightly tight on budget."
1,"I did not use the product for 12 days after it was delivered .Now, when i checked, the keyboard does have an annoying sound while typing and mouse does not stay at a place . It moves away according to it's wish . So , i thought it would be an issue with mouse pad . I changed the mouse pad and now , it's the same as the mouse moves to different directions rather than staying at where i point or direct it .I cannot return the product now and i am not sure how to make use of the warranty to get the mouse changed."
5,Good quality
1,"Do not buy thisReview based on usage for more than 30 days:Keyboard is not really ergonomic as claimed. It has just one level adjustment at the back to increase height. Keya are not soft and have to press really hard, like a typewriterMouse was okay, but now has started giving problems. When I try to select text, it unselects automatically, so have to go back from the beginning. Very difficult to work with it. Now I'll need a separate mouse, so what's the point of buying a combo üòûPlastic is very cheap quality."
4,I liked the mouse and disliked the keyboard as the keys are hard and it makes difficult for me to type for longer periods. I usually use the mouse for playing GTA V and Fornite and its works perfectly.If there would be a individual review for mouse and keyboard then I would rate the mouse 5 stars and the keyboard 2 stars.
5,"Worst product after 2 mnth of usage, eating more battery, need to change month. Not satisfied"
4,"I've been using this for a few weeks and it's as good as any other brand. I've used HP, Dell and Amazon basic over the years. Yes, their finishing is better but when it comes to the use this is as good as any of these brands. It's cheaper and serves the purpose. Definitely worth your money."
4,Like the price for such quality. Buttons are too soft. They press too below surface. Due to that typing speed reduces. Make sure pressed distance should low. When I connect to laptop then for aome time all zoomed part goes in left side automatically. Don't know why. When I disconnected the keyboard and mouse then it stops. Hope you fix this.
1,"The keyboard is not having even a single blinking light. When anybody presses the Caps lock on off, nothing can be observed whether the caps lock is on or off......The keyboard is lagging many times, a little bit late responsive sometimes. If your typing speed is faster, the keyboard is going to deceive you since it will miss the characters.The keyboard gets hanged, you keep on pressing several keys, but the keyboard will not respond. This problem has been faced by me, many times.Mouse has now started giving problems. The scroll bar of the mouse is malfunctioning. When I scroll something Upwards, it scrolls that downwards and vice versa.Not a good product till now.Never buy it, guys."
5,The product has come up to our expectations and there are no problems in using it. A good purchase.
5,Sheerness is good comfortable is okok value for money yesDoesn't come with battery and any other instructions or manualWill review more after  using
1,"Product is good at the price of 1k but Its says ""Made in India"" but its ""Made is China"" product. Feeling being cheated, i wasn't looking Chinese product as I hate Chinese products. Also stopped working now after 1 month, Could not find local service station at Abohar, really sad"
1,"1. Build Quality is very Poor, A road side vendor will have better quality than this.2. The Slots for Battery is so bad that, after inserting the battery even if you just turn the keyboard to use, the battery allignment gets changed & you will not be able to use it.3. For Repalcement / Return in warranty period you should either go to there sevice centres in Punjab or Uttarpradesh.. i got this information from there customer support Number...Over all very worst experience"
2,Mouse has a problem after a week. Mouse laser light is blinking continuously and not working.Keyboard is verygood. Extra key for media control are very useful.Returned it. Will update the review after I get the replacement
2,"Sometimes few specific keys wont work & u need to revisit the word to correct the spelling.I have returned this & purchased Dell Wireless Keyboard which is upto my expectations (Keys are just like Laptop keyboard, while price is also competitive at Amazon)."
1,"Within 1 day of very light usage the left shift is not working. The left shift key is pressed inside and denies to come out. Apart from that the multimedia sleep and power key does not work. Raised the replacement request, let's see if that works fine."
4,damaged keyboard provide after that changed light wt same as plastic box but good price value of money
1,"A BUTTON WAS MISSING ON KEYBOARD. Unlike other keys, The 'esc' button was installed in a 'vertical' manner (which I fixed later on my own). Very poor built quality - keyboard and mouse looks like  cheap old video game sets we buy from cheap toy shops. And I AM NOT ABLE TO RETURN OR REPLACE IT because I bought it on an offer. Totally unsatisfied with this 'product'.Never buy this 'product' please. It's best to call it trash (I am serious)."
5,The noiseless keys is the best loving feature. The material quality needs to be improved. The bottom side should have rubber grip as to stop sliding with even a small force applied.
2,"I changed my review after use for 2 monthsIt started showing lot of lag,also buffer character and type it multiple times. Very annoying experience talking with teammate over IM"
1,I am writing this review after 3 months of use.High precesion Mouse start doing malfunction.On single click it is performing double click operation.Keyboard keys are not smooth now. Keys Feeling very heavy while typing..Request you to Please inhance the build quality because nobody want to purchase the set of mouse and keyboard in every three months time period.
2,"Mouse keys are very hard as well as keys of keyboard so my fingers started paining after few hours of usageInitially I though that it is a fault, so I applied for replacement and got another piece on second day, but even that has same issue. This means it is manufactured in that way. So finally I returned it back and for full refund amount. Very nice customer service by Amazon"
4,I am writing this review after 10 days of using this product. Keyboard is nice and sturdy.  Mouse is also good but is not as smooth as it should be. We have to click twice left button so many times. But anyhow it is very good product at such low price. Just go for it.
3,"This is cheap product, Keys gets pressed multiple times in single tap.Bad about Product:Build quality is very poor, always there is risk of getting break.Noisy keysDelight keysMouse is heavyNo light for Num,Caps and batteryGood Things:Dust resistivity is good.Plug and play"
2,"Very flimsy. Very light and keys are not strongly made. Altogether I made the wrong purchase. I am used to Microsoft key board and Mouse, which is strong and the keys are strongly made. My mistake that I bought this. Delivery etc are good as is usual with Amazon."
1,Keyboard i received is broken and some of its keys are also coming out whenever i turn it upside down. Mouse was good.
5,Good value for money product. Using it since last 3 weeks. Mouse seems a bit slow in clicking but it's manageable. Firm built and keypads are strong and easy to press. They r not the soft once
1,"purchased.. got delivery - mouse did not work ...so got replaced...this time key board did not work,,finally had to return to seek refund. bad experience"
1,"Received the keyboard with one key out which I was able to put back in. However, it‚Äôs the performance which is horrible. Mouse doesn‚Äôt work that well. Keyboard is erratic. In 10 days I am unable to use the keyboard. There is delay in typing response and it is typing multiple times when pressed once. I wish I could just return it and not use it ever."
5,Design of this keyboard for gaming is good...Its build & material quality is strong..Very responsive button with nice letter font..Ergonomics is not satisified...Keyboard feet is slight higher after long gaming cause slight pain palm wrist....Weight of this keyboard is heavy and it provides grip to the surface...RBG of this keyboard looks good but brightness of these light is too low in bright daylight..without room light or dark room its look good and lacks different rgb effects....So i give rating 4.5/5
3,"Your Questions Answered :Did you reach here because you love Mechanical keyboards? - This won't make you happy, travel between the keys is less, and accidental key tap can happen Often.Did you reach here because of the backlight keyboard? - This is not for you, wont justify why it's not for you. the backlight situation is BAD.Did you reach here because you are a gamer and you like the way it looks? - Just run from this product, it's not for you nerd..So who is it for?For someone who likes, - Big keyboard cable, - Bad backlight, - OK typing experience.More Reasons to stay away.. - For some reason, the keys are multi-colored, yes it's not RGB, the letters through which the ""white"" light is seen is colored. - The Cable is huge and it takes away the look of your desk. - The backlight is soooo dim. the images are from a totally dark environment, yes it looks all good in pitch dark. but usually, you have a bright monitor in front of the keyboard. and this keyboard is so dim that it looks as if it's about to die.Overall:Usable but Wouldnt recommend.."
5,"If you're looking for a keyboard that provides a great typing experience and also feels like a mechanical keyboard, go for this one. I bought it and took a chance since there were no reviews. But go for it if you want a keyboard that is lightweight and also makes your typing faster."
4,i)Awesome keyboard good for gaming and very smooth really recommendedii)Top among its budgetiii)Only the back-light could be improved it would be perfectiv)The keyboard is membrane but feels more like a mechanical keyboardv)Currently typing with the same keyboard and it feels amazingvi)Premium qualityvii)I replaced my cooler master keyboard with this keyboard so i would recommend this keyboard for sureix)Being a fps gamer i feel very comfortable to use this keyboardThank youHope my review will help you chose......Keep Gaming Keep typingStay home Stay safe.
3,"Nothing to complain about the delivery service of amazon.But about this keyboard, 1. backlighting shoul be brighter, and 2. A palm rest could be added.I've been using this for a couple of days, keys feel good.I want to say one thing that don't treat this as a pocket friendly gaming keyboard, better treat this as a costly regular keyboard."
5,Good keyboard not a typical switch based mechanical keyboard but gives you the feel. Btw the key travel is 2mm which is not that much for those looking for more key travel but this works for me as I am not a hard typer.
3,"I thought the keyboard which are good for gaming are are good for programming too..but that's not the case the R-CTR which is frequently pressed is shifted way into the corner ,in its place dedicated option key is placed ....for programmer a more laptop like keyboard is more preferable"
4,"Packaging:1. When I reached the main keyboard box, they had reused the hp logo sticker to close the box. While other straps of both sides were not even intact within the place. It was very clear that the box had been opened before.2. When I reached for the keyboard, the keys had lots of dust particles on in.Product:1.The keyboard is great for gaming purposes I guess because I bought it for typing purposes.2. Other than that, everything works great, the RGB is a lot enough and the keyboard looks super cool. The wire is thick and the USB is also of great quality.3. Overall, the keyboard is perfect!"
4,"When I received the package, then seal was broken. I didn't request a refund or exchange as I urgently needed a keyboard and the board itself was totally fine. This keyboard is quite value for its price. Build quality is decent and back-lighting is also okay not something to  write home about.Pros:1. Good feedback and decent travel making typing quite fun and enjoyable.2. I also play games with this keyboard. No latency issue or anything like that.3. The RGB gets the job done of typing in low light although it is not quite necessary for me.Cons:1. The build quality feels cheap. Although it is kinda expected at this price point for a keyboard claiming to be a ""gaming keyboard"".2. Random times both the enter keys gets stuck when pressed. This issue can easily be fixable at home.I haven't used any ""gaming"" keyboard at this price point so I don't know with whom to compare with. I am more of a Logitech K200 guy. I recommend this keyboard. Its an HP product so you can't go wrong with it."
5,"The keys are perfect. However, the backlit is pretty dim. Might recommend for gamers who knows their keyboard really well. The mechanical key feel is perfect and have great shape to it. The performance of the keys are superb. So far I've been gaming hardcore on the WASD keys and it works amazing. The key movement has a mechanical feel of a premium keyboard.Tip: For the fact if you're looking for a well lit backlit keyboard, this would not be the best option for you. For gamers, they keys are solid 10/10"
1,"- It's not ergonomic in terms of usage.- They keypress is pretty fast. That's about here the good parts end- LED Lighting is more of a fancy piece. Bright lighting and accessibility goes out of the window- To add to after 3 months, the keyboard has stopped working. Complete waste of money"
5,"Five star for fooling people into buying this crap.Five star rating given, so people will read the review and avoid this product.The purpose of backlighting in keyboard is to highlight the keys in dim environments even at glancing angle. I should have remembered HP always makes the worst Ergonomic products. Cheaper brands have better uniform LED backlighting. The intent was to use backlit keyboard to quickly locate shortcut keys in video editing and 3ds max. The alphabets on the keys are very stylized in unrecognizable sci fi font, guess HP gimmick to lure in gamers. If you are hoping to get a backlit keyboard like on a Laptop, this is a waste. Here the backlighting becomes so dim with any form level of - day light, table lamp, even a monitor."
5,"Arrived in record time.  Very good quality keyboard, and the keys have a nice mechanical feel to them. The material also is quality stuff, and this is a good keyboard for gaming, typing or programming as well, as the pressing action is really smooth.Although not recommended for older people as the letters are very faint, and the backlight is quite dim. Overall a good keyboard for casual gamers and for regular use as well!"
3,"My personal review:-Pros:1. The keys are smooth.2. The touch is premium for the money.3. Feels good to type on it after a little practice.Cons:1. The keys are comparatively small. I had to do a little practice in order to type perfectly with this keyboard since the keys are comparatively smaller than the other generic keyboards and closely packed.2. The backlit in this keyboard is dim, not customizable to your favourite colour and the fact that the keys are individually not painted in white texts, it becomes difficult to type with it when you are typing in a well-lit room."
1,"Just like a regular keyboard, backlight is not that impressive and not bright at all under Rs. 899 price tag. It is just the name ""Gaming Keyboard"" but there is nothing compare to the other available LED boards which are much impressive under this price."
4,"The HP K300 model keyboard is said to be a gaming keyboard, whereas it's not. IT IS NOT A MECHANICAL KEYBOARD FIRST OF ALL. The click feel of this keyboard lies between a normal keyboard and a mechanical keyboard. All I can say is that, if you're purpose is completely based on gaming, do not go for this k300. This is a 25% mechanical and 75% normal keyboard. The only thing which i liked about this product is that the build quality is good.PROS: 1) Good built2) Average click feel3) Has height adjustable stands.4) Good cable and USB INPUT quality.5) Has good cable length.6) Keys are slightly taller from the base which does not hurt while using it for a long time.CONS: 1) Very poor backlit2) The RGB can't be customized.3) No surround RGB.4) Not good to carry around as it's heavier than other keyboards.5) Lock Keys Light is very cheap."
4,"This is for the people who are trying to get a good keyboard but a on budget, people who are also looking to get RGB or get a feeling of mechanical keyboard they can get this model. It does not have any bright RGB lighting it is just namesake. It has a  good build quality, cables are thick, Key strokes are deep to get a better feedback. It has 3 modes to change and it works on Mac and Android also. there is a feature to disable windows accidental keypress in games you can turn it off or on."
2,Poor lights and the keys are very close to each other. The space bar misses hits at times.You will always end up with lot of typos because of the close proximity of the key. HP Gaming Keyboard K500F is a better one.Happy shopping !
3,"Everything about this keyboard is good , the ergonomics , the feel and feedback ..but the brightness is too low ..can‚Äôt see properly when the room lights are on"
4,"The keyboard looks wellbuild..however durability mostly depends on luck; could work for just a couple of weeks or may serve me for years to come...BUT for what it's worth its awesome..I don't quite get why everyone is complaining about the backlight, Yes, it's PERFECTLY READABLY dim (exactly how I would set backlight brightness settings if I was given an option)...keys are comfortable and punchy to type and doesn't skip..no ghosting issues"
5,"A good keyboard is very important for any user. Ive  realized this after i made this purchase. Earlier i used more generic keyboards but this one, for its price, is a game changer. I totally love typing on this keyboard and will suggest this particular keyboard to everyone. For its price you cannot ask for more."
4,"The keyboard is pretty amazing for its price but I did notice some rocking while typing which shows it wasn't manufactured right. It just passed the bar for gaming and isn't anything special. No mechanical sound or feel but is better than regular keyboards. I suggest going for cosmicbyte at the same prices for better value. The look is definitely very sleek and minimalistic which is good. The RGB on the other hand sucks, so if ur a big fan of RGB don't buy it. Very old hp product so it's expected but overall ok for its price. I mean it's only 1000."
1,1) The box was already opened. Seems to be they delivered somebody's returned product.2) Keyboard having scratches.3) Oneside height adjustment clip missing.4) RGB not working.5) Where is HPs protective cover inside the box?Please do a quality check before delivering the product.
5,"Is it me or are the keys a little smaller in width? The key click sounds just like any other membrane keyboard. Surely looks mechanical but not. Lights are exactly like in the pictures. Has breathing mode but the colours don't change around. Overall, not bad."
5,"1. Built quality superb.2. Keys designs help more to type accurately.3. Weight is also heavy, better than cheap-feeling metal lite keyboards at this price.4. Sounds good too.5. Wire is also bigger and thicker. üòõOnly the backlit could be more, but it suits perfectly as Minimal.It was the best buy for me.And Amazon delivery was awesome too for the fastest delivery within 16 hours."
3,Keyboard looks is good specially for gamers but if you are looking for mechanical keyboard or your work mostly based on typing then don't buy this.. first reason is the keys location is not in the right place there are large gaps between keys and you have to set your hand according to this keyboard structure.. and second reason this is not a mechanical keyboard as they are showing in the banner this is membrane keyboard which is not good enough for typist.. I'm giving 3 stars because of 3 reason 1. looks 2. LED light 3. I got this at rs. 825 and there is nothing good in this keyboard..
4,The buttons are absolutely not visible. Backlight is too dull. And I am not exaggerating because I needed a keyboard with not so fancy/bright backlight. This one is okayish I would say. But still the backlight is pretty damn low.
5,"I don't write reviews of products generally. But this one, I felt I should write, because I liked how it feels while typing. I type a lot and often, but never tried a gaming keyboard. After trying this keyboard for a few mins, I felt I discovered this keyboard very late.  The make is tough, the backlight is uber cool. There seems to be no doubt that this will last."
4,The keyboard is perfect for me aslo looks like the expensive mechanical keyboard. although it is not mechanical but the keys are raised enough... the only thing that bothed me was the compact design. I used to use a standard sized keyboard and shifting to this reduced my speed. also the space bar should be a bit heighted as the other keys hide it and it was difficult to reach for the space bar with my thumb
2,"No ergonomics in this board, key heights are unnecessarily high, left shift key and enter key began squeaking after 11 days of use and the spacebar key has a weird flex to it, athe backlighting is stupid dim. The keys are not printed properly you won't be able to see them even in daylight. Also the worst input lag I've experienced till now of all membrane keyboards."
1,"Most of the keys are giving two output like m/n is giving mn, b/v is giving bv etc. Not at all recommend. I would have given this a negative rating. Total waste of money. Seller also didn't reply to my message. I will never buy from this seller. They sell defective piece."
4,"A very good product, anyone can choose this keyboard for its performance and price, make sure you receive a good product without damage as it can happen due to online shopping, backlight I would say decent enough coz u must understand that a product from reputed company comes out with several plans and ideas behind,so one cannot put all the best in a single product that too for low price,don't miss this price offer, good product to be honest with decent backlight XD"
4,this keyboard is very well its a good mechanical keyboard at this price range that to from a branded companybut the sad thing is you dont get any option to change the lights or any mods which can change the type the lights are present . this keybpard is for the people who want a cheap mechanical keybpard from a branded company with warranty . and you just gget a option to adjust the brightness of the lights present . thats ityou can go for it . the packaging was good
4,"Just received it today and the packaging was good. Feels good when typing and it's not too loud. RGB was kind of disappointing, brightness is low like you have to be in a dark room to see it clearly but still not bad for a keyboard that costs a 1000rs. When typing it gives a good feedback and was responsive. Material is good and feels heavy, but it's mostly plastic."
4,The only problem I would highlight is the font and the brightness of the light.Font is difficult to read especially with the lights on as it's dim and doesn't cover the entire alphabet
3,Its good strong keyboard..But I gave 3 stat becoz that back light is not bright..It only look good only in pure dark room..In this budget if u don't get other products u can go for this one
4,It's a decent enough keyboard. The only problem is the lighting through the keys. Overall a solid keyboard. Mine came with some damage therefore I returned it and I was lucky to get the hp k500f at the same price as this one.
3,"I bought because of the HP brand but disappointed after receiving the product, the lights are very dim with full power, and sometime its difficult to see the actuall letter with low light specially while gaming or while reorienting."
5,I purchased this for my wfh. It will be great for those who types a lot as it serves as mechanical keyboard. + Point it also has backlight. Not sure for gaming experience as I am using for work.
5,Its not a mechanical keyboard so it feels like any other membrane/normal keyboard when typing but the parts and the keys looks of quality and are sturdy we also have the brand warranty so no need to worry about anything......
5,"I have been searching for a better rgb keyboard with all the features.I found this new product with all the features in it and I bought it. Believe me, the best keyboard you could ever find below 1000 rs. And i can even say that this keyboard can outnumber the other keyboards in feautures which are above 1000.I can't find any cons..believe me it'd be the same with you.1. Perfect brightness and lot of lighting options with rgb or not. You can control the lighting very easily.2. Mechanical type.3. Perfect buttons, stand, lengthy wire, etc."
5,"This keyboard is comparable to a $30 or a much priced one! Like the crosair k95, razer blackwidow. It's got everything (otherthan macro keys). It's durable, got really good quality keys, and the typing does feel a bit like the mechanical ones mentioned above. Its Smooth af. The best part is key to key spacing. And the water resistance works!Till now I haven't found any cons. Which is pretty great, as most of the other keyboards available in the store has got some or the other issue. And I'm pretty sure the unboxing makes you feel pretty dope!"
1,"Looks cool and li8s are fine a big BUT,The keyboard feels cheap, the letters on it is cheap looking,And almost after 20 days of usage (office work not gaming) unlocked a feature ( for which I haven't found a use yet), that everytime I press space bar 'a' also comes is out of no where.. the charecter 'a' is input every time space bar is pressed..Please advise if you guys could think of its use.PS: the item looks and screams cheap to anyone who sees it.. screwed up my money.."
4,"this keyboard is very very cool and good for just 999/-it has various lighting modes and brightness levels.. it also comes with three different levels of speed.the multimedia keys are extremely handy and the keys are uplifted and gives you the ultimate pleasure of typing.the keys are removable and the keyboard is easily cleanable. its a membrane keyboard but gives you a mechanical feel.the only downside of the keyboard is how it looks, it has a very weird design, it could've been plain and simple like a rectangular keyboard, then it would've been epic, but other than this flaw of its weird design, the keyboard is flawless.typing the review with this keyboard. hope this helps.. :)"
2,THE BRIGHTNESS ONTHE FUNCTION KEYS AND NUMBER KEYS IS VERY LOW. TYPING EXPERIENCE IS NOT GOOD.THIS PRODUCT HAS NO RETURN POLICY.
4,"PROS : Affordable, decent material, mechanical feel, can choose among 7 different colours and modes, shortcut media buttons are very useful, wire is high quality, overall great budget keyboard..!!CONS : Not for professional gaming as responsiveness is not that great for fast tapping, it is a actually a membrane keyboard, RGB control is limited by keyboard only.. no ARGB support and software..."
3,"A decent keyboard in its price range, but I would not recommend this for gaming.1. Membrane keyboard, so its pretty soft if you are only going to type with it or are going to very casually game.2. No anti-ghosting, not even for WASD + Shift.3. Lights are pretty dim compared how it is advertised here, it screams that it is a cheap keyboard but in reality it really is cheap so what are we complaining about?4. Wrist Rest is decent enough for small to medium hands. For large hands it pointless, I'd advice picking up a separate memory foam wrist rest to slide next to it.5. Body is plastic and not really the strongest kind of plastic I've seen. But again, this is a cheap keyboard so we really shouldn't be expecting a titanium body."
1,"I won't recommend this keyboard.I had ordered this keyboard,nice that i got early delievery.But the product was damaged internally.I got the ctrl key detached from the keyboard and lying in the box, it really disappointed me as i ordered a new keyboard so it was not expected.When i plugged it in into my pc,From the very beginning onlyIt was automatically disconnecting and reconnceting again and again.It created lot of problems for me,hopefully on the last day of 10 days replacement time,I asked for a replacement,Got it within a week, and i was shocked ,the replacement keyboard ,after 2 days,It also started creating the same problem.I have returned this product, and i won't recommend this keyboard to anyone.Don't get fascinated with the price.Its cheaper coz of the quality as well.Not a very gud quality of keys as well.Buying This keyboard was an awful experience for me."
5,"Best keyboard under 1000. The keys give mechanical like feel. 25 anti ghosting keys + customizable rgb gives a good gaming feel. Brightness is a little bit low but it's fine. The most useful things are the multimedia keys, now I don't have to minimize the game and start music, I can directly control it from the keyboard. The build quality is plastic and feels cheap but the keys are high quality. Overall the quality is excellent and I would recommend anyone who is coming from Cosmicbyte keyboards üëç"
1,"It is sturdy otherwise.comes with laser itched keys, that means you can barely see the letters on the keys even in daytime, unless lights are turned on. Key caps are narrow and scaled down from top, too much chamfered/fillet on top, reducing surface area while making keystrokes, resulting in too many typing errors,for if your finger lands on the side of the key, there is a great probability of hitting the adjoining keys. backlight is poor as with all other rgb keyboard's, considering the fact, what max you can achieve over just 0.5v usb, and wasting all the wattage on fancy disco lights in back rather than using that power for only backlit keys, for letters/alphabets to glow brighter.***this review in general applies to all rgb kb's, where manufacturers focus only on showoff and fancy details with no eye to cater to professional users who demand productivity.also mostly rgb kb's have narrow key caps(not just with this one), so that more light can bleed out of membrane, making it look more flashy and alluring to the major segment of nube buyers.**got it for Rs 999 without any sale or offer."
5,"When I heard name chiptroniks I was a little hesitant but all the features is keyboard has really helped, its been 5 months and im using it to play all the multiplier and our story games and the the RGB man... it works like a charm and adds a cooler look to ur setup, the keys are responsive and almost inaudible even after rough usage, I recommend this keyboard for coders as well, because it makes typing easier and u will feel less tired XD."
4,"Brightness is not much. Average that you can work in dark place without eye irritation.Sturdiness is fine for the price.IRRITATING PROBLEM IS BELOW :Only problem is with the ""ENTER"" key placement. Usually the enter key will be in ASD row in most usb keyboards, but in this  the ENTER key is in vertical combined both ASD and QWE rows. \| this key should've been in QWE row.Because of this whenever you are speed typing you will type ""\"" instead of ENTER..takes time to adapt...."
4,"Loved it. Customization is decent, can't expect more at the price, and wouldn't know honestly what to do with more. Macro keys would've been nice - the given keys at the top right are somewhat useful, the left side is uselessResponse is nice, sometimes not enough though - of course this is not a replacement for a mechanical keyboard.Wire is decent, has gone through a few strong pulls and is working"
5,"awesome keyboard.big key size, I require that.Satisfying click sounds.The touch feel is great. Way sturdier than my previous keyboards.the lights are bright enough to be seen in daylight.Pretty heavy"
5,"I am so satisfied with this keyboard being at this price point it is just the best keyboard to buy also you can control the rgb of it to single color, it has 3 presets and you can customize the colour of the presets also and you will have 7 colour options like red green yellow.Go for it. :)Only one thing which can be a pro as well as a con.It is that this keyboard has transparent switches which means that you can see the switches when you have turned the rgb of the keyboard on and your room lights off. But you can never see it properly when your rgb of the keyboard is turned off so do not turn it off."
5,My Honest ReviewPacking : 5/5MECHANICAL FEEL  :5/5sound: 3.5/5BUILD QUALITY: 4/5RGB EFFECTS:4.5/5BRIGHTNESS :4/5CABLE :5/5Gaming: 4.5/5Design : 4/5Multimedia keys: 4.5/5Price : 5/5Conclusion : 4.5/5For Rs 1000 Just Go for it .it is the best RGB gaming keyboard
5,best looking keyboard  beautifull every thing working perfect thanx amazon  i use many expensive  keyboards but this one is the best lokking and eassy to function keyboard.amaozn delvery very good good packging.101% saisfied for its looks perfomance and gaming and lights i give 10/10 for they beautifull keyboards specially  for gamers
4,"This review I have posted after using for 2 daysPROS:keys are very comfortable to press and backlights are very attractive everything is ok with this product.  I suggest buying this keyboard. when talking about the keyboard wire, they have provided the best quality wire(I posted the snap of keyboard wire)the coolest feature of this keyboard is they are providing different patterns of LED blinkings(like rainbow, single color, multicolor blinking and etc...)few snaps of the keyboard I have added check thoseCONS:When you turn off backlights of the keyboard the letters on the keys are not visible properly. This is the only issue I have noticed"
5,This keyboard is unbelievable for its price. It is the cheapest membrane gaming keyboard that has full rgb support with different lighting modes. The rgb looks really awesome like much expensive keyboards. The multimedia keys are a really useful feature as well. This keyboard is absolute value for money.
5,"The background light can be switched off if not required, changing to the required color is swift. the keyboard feels like a mechanical keyboard. Overall a good choice, i am satisfied after 3 months usage. No issues. buy it confidently. i am sure the user will be happy about the choice and its price."
3,"Great quality for the price. Cable was long enough for PC setup. I never use RGB light, but this one came with so many options I am now a fan of RGB lighting.Cons:Only issue I faced was the Multimedia keys like Mute, Volume up and Down are not very responsive. At one point the volume just wouldn't unmute after using the Keyboard Mute key."
5,"I thought i will never get this product as the tracking section says it was lost in transit. But i wanted it badly so i waited patiently 'cause it was already out of stock. Ordered this product in August and got it in the last week of September. When i finally got it, the packing was not good (you can see in the pictures). Nevertheless, the keyboard is a good one. Very reasonable price for soft keys while typing or gaming. RGB lights are great and everything is nice."
5,"Just installed the keyboard to my computer and it looks swell....all the features that were mentioned on Amazon was there on the keyboard and the touch too is really soft and the keyboard is really sturdy. Worth for the money. Hope IT STAYS THE SAME WAY, atleast for a YEAR OR TWO !!"
4,the build quality of the product is ok also the amount of colour combinations is also really good and it's something that you do not get at this price point. But since it costs only thousand rupees hence cost cutting had to be done in some places. The quality of the keycaps is little below average also in an effort tu to include all the keys inside the standard size of the keyboard I have to say that the size of the keys is little bit small and if you like me who is accustomed to typing on a laptop then you will face a little problem initially but this is not a deal breaker because it can be e adjusted to in about a week or so. Also the force required to press the key is really less so since the keycaps are small sometimes I accidentally press 2 3 keys at the same time but that again can be adjusted to in sometime. in conclusion if you want an average quality keyboard with lots of beautiful colour combinations then you can definitely go for it.
4,"Pros:-1) Working very well and led lights are best,2) Very happy to use them at night without needing room light to type.3) Also it has more function keys to run the pc.Scope of improvement -1) Need function keys for changing brightness, sleep.2) My CSE student brother says that this keyboard needs more mechanical typing feeling.3) This particular feedback is for the amazon courier service that it really needs to make sure that the product be delivered in good packaging condition. When my mother received it, the outer cover was not sealed but fully opened, but when I checked the product, it's working & physical condition, I then decided not to return and I am happy that this product is good enough for keeping as I urgently needed the keyboard to use the laptop after my laptop lost it's in-built keyboard due to water vapor and that short circuited the laptop's motherboard chip and therefore had to shell out Rs.3,200/- for repairing it and could have to shell out Rs.1,800/- more if replacement of in built keyboard was done and still there is a chance to get issues in future especially in rainy season or weather.. Still the product could have been changed by the delivery person as Mom said that he was looking clearly in rush mood. Then I realized the reason but was wondering why did he do it when he didn't change the keyboard-_- So one star less for this bad experience by delivery person.I got it @ Rs.949/- which is reasonable for this keyboard. So, Value for money! Would surely recommend to buy this one! Thank you!"
5,"Writing the review after using this keyboard for gaming for about 300+ hours. The keys are perfect, the key travel distance is optimum, 7zone rgb adds up the cool feature. Other rgb features are mentioned on the box.Best thing that attracted me to buy is that the keys are translucent so the rgb light comes through it rather than around it which makes it better in dark. Another quirk is it has multimedia keys and wrist rest.Cons- It is much wider and takes space.Lot of dust settles between the crevices so cleaning is difficult.Overall the keyboard is game killer and much more cheaper than we'll known brands which provide similar features. Totally value for money.I would recommend this keyboard to anyone who is tight on budget but wants quality."
5,Loved the keyboard. The keys are really well balanced and love the feel and the clicks. The colors and the keys to change the options are easy enough to remem. The only gripe I have is that the marks on the individual keys are sometimes not visible. And they look unfinished. Maybe it's just mine. But over all a good keyboard.
4,"I bought this keyboard which was on sale for Rs 999/. The space bar was found seperately in the box and that's where the cons end. After 10 days of usage, I find this keyboard really comfortable to type with and the gaming experience was good as well. No other cons found in this product. It's the best you can find under 1000/-. Go for it ‚úåÔ∏è"
5,"Pros: Smooth keys, Great looks, Good Quality usb cable, Many RGB control options, Turn off lights option available, Dedicated as well as combo multimedia and function keys, Enough hand rest space, Good for gaming.Cons: Nothing as such.Note: As this is a gaming product, Dimensions (LxWxH) of keyboard may not comfortably fit into standard computer table furniture.Overall great product."
5,"This is the best Keyboard I have used till now (not including mechanical). It has got 7 different colours which obviously you can set as oer your preference !! The Breathing Light Feature is just amazing, You can Change the brightness of the lights and the even Speed of changing colours !! The Key Travel Distance is Nice !! I use it very Roughly it has got a Really Nice Build Quality !! It also has Multimedia Keys On the Top !! Surely If You Want a Keyboard in around 1000 to 1200 rs this is a really nice choice !!"
5,"Hi ,I had a gaming keyboard earlier i.e asus cetrbus and it cost me around 2.8k. idk what happened but 2-3 keys stopped working soni had to buy a new one and trust me i had spent around fee hours looking reviews on YouTube and this keyboard is more then i expected .For approx 1k i got this keyboard and its superb amazing and therr is a gold plate usb whicj gives you 2 ms response .The keys are softer and smooth.The downside i felt this keyboard should have a bit more brightness and a little big enter key thats it .Apart from that i m very very happy to have this keyboard"
5,"Wow! Love typing on it, the keys are soft yet just clicky enough to give you a positive feedback while fast typing. They seem like a good balance for both fast typing and gaming. The media keys on top sre a great addition and are adequately soft for quick operation. Of voirse the RGB is always fun to have and is customisable."
5,"Very good quality plastic, so built qualityis awesome at this price range ... It‚Äôs Good for light to medium gaming, Good RGB lighting,bright enough,but it's not programmable (neither keys nor rgb)... Good CC suppor(over WhatsApp also) ...  Go for it..."
3,Without led button are poor to visibleLed light is not proper brightWithout warranty it is garbageIt does not have warranty card
4,The keyboard is pretty good for the priceBuild is decentThe buttons are responsiveComes with a braided cable etcBut there is one major con that made me take away 2 starsThe keyboard lacks anti ghosting which to be honest is very annoying while using multiple keys during gamingAnti ghosting could've been added at this price range but seems like they've cut corners hereOver all great keyboard but lacks an essential feature
5,"Good built. RGB leds are working fine with a lot of presets. Mechanical feel, pretty confortable to type when uou get used to it. Long sturdy cable. Overall a good purchase."
4,The overall look of this keyboard is brilliantReally value for money. The brightness is pretty goodWould have been better if it had a software to control lightning and  individual led lighting
4,Some buttons are not working after 1 month use. There is 1 year warranty for this product says description. How to claim warranty? Seller please help.
1,The main issue with keyboard is keys are little blackish in colour so brightness around the key is high as compared to on the key letter because key letters are not enough transparent for light to pass.Also keys are not individually illuminated. So it give irritation to eyes while sitting in the dark. If you want to work at night or in the dark room better go with some moonlight keyboard .
5,"I wish I could give more than 5 stars. Best RGB keyboard. Totally satisfied with the quality and the working. Keys feel good while working.Just one minor flaw or habit-adapt, keys are bit small i think so it will take u a bit to adapt to it.Otherwise, its a great product to go with. Actually ergonomic and comfortable"
3,"This is a normal membrane keyboard with unusual raised and tiered keys, a bit like typewrite, but keys are not raised high like on a type writer.It is written on the carton of the keyboard that it is ""inspired by mechanical keyboard"". The part of heaviness is caused by the metal plate put on the top of membrane inside the keyboard. There is also the weight of the palm rest.I bought just because it looks different.The rows of the keys are arranged just like seat arrangement in cinema hall. The function keys are raised highest, followed by number keys, and then the first row, second row and third row of letters. The third row of letters and the last row of spacebar is about equal. Under spacebar button, there are 2 springs that are visible. There are no tamper-evident stickers on the top of any of screws under the keyboard. There are 8 screws on portion of the main keyboard, and 4 screws on the palm rest portion. Now think about some cheap keyboards that are littered with many small screws.Palm rest is detachable. However you must be careful in removing it. First remove the screws for easy detachment of the palm rest. I disassembled the keyboard for review purpose. However I strongly recommend you not to disassemble. After disassembling and re-assembling, keyboard was not working properly and I had to spend 3 hours assembling the keyboard several times to make it work.Build quality is undoubtedly tough. But I haven't felt particularly comfortable using this keyboard compared to the Rs 250 Amkette keyboard that I had earlier. However it is good for long hours of typing because of the spacious palm rest.If you want to use multimedia keys, use them with FN key. There is no rupee symbol key."
5,"The keyboard is good for this price. Thanks to Amazon, for the on time delivery. But there was no cardboard packaging. Only the keyboard box was wrapped up with a tape and it was shipped. Now coming to the product, it is superb. The price is reasonable and the quality is good. Without using the back lights, you cannot see the letters or number printed on the keyboard. It offers good comfort while gaming. When you pressed the keys, you can hear the sounds. Build quality is also good."
5,"Pros:1. It feels great to type on this keyboard2. Typing speed is significantly faster compared to other cheaper keyboards3. Love the palm test, very helpfulCons:Paint on keys fade after few days and this is true. If you want to keep you keyboard safe keep reading.I read few reviews which said the paint will fade eventually, so I coated all the keys with a very thin layer of transparent nail polish after two days of purchase. I have attached the image you can zoom in and see the nail polish there.Tip: wipe your keyboard with a clean clothes before applying, also apply a very thin layer, if you make it thick then the paint will look dull.After coating a layer of nail polish dry it for a few hrs before using it.There you go! No worries now!Cheers!"
1,"Bought in July 2018. Looks good, feels good while typing but keys bounce back in a too sensitive way that almost every keystroke is repeated and I get double letters causing spelling mistakes all over a page. I had to spend double the time it takes for typing for just correcting the double keystrokes. I have used the good mechanical TVS keyboards till now but it died on me and I bought this stupid thing. There seems no way to turn off this thing touted as ""anti-ghosting"".Maybe it is good in gaming, but bad for typing in MS Word. At first I thought it was due to my habit of typing on TVS, and I would get used to this new keyboard. But even after two months it is the same story. And the noise it makes when typing at some speed is too distracting! It is different kind of sound, not tapping sound of a mechanical keyboard, but some friction kind annoying noise. Throwing this thing away and buying the good reliable TVS again. (PS: this review typed on a borrowed cheap membrane keyboard)"
3,"PROS:1. liked the simplistic design with no frills or RGB led.2. packing is decent3. raised keys similar to mechanical keyboard4. decent palm rest5. less flex2.CONS:1. the pal rest is not cushioned2. bit on the bulky and heavy side to my liking3. please do not compare the keypress or sound mechanical (it is not)Verdict: decent wired keyboard, worth to try."
4,the keyboard replicates a cherry mx blue key with its clicking noise and tactile bump etc. its a very good full sized mechanical keyboard but the rgb is a bit lacking. the effects look really nice though. if youre hard pressed on spending over 6000 on a keyboard buy this one
5,"Best Mechanical Gaming keyboard under 2000. Keys are very nice and provides a clicky feel. It is ergonomic. Comimg to LEDs, the lights are very bright and the different modes are also stunning. And I personally loved the custom LED mode. The arm rest is just awesom,  and I personally like it very much....If I talk about its cons then I must say that the lights are not RGB as mentioned in the add. But they are just normal LEDs, different colour in different rows which, more or less, provides a RGB look...Still I must say it is great as I am quite satisfied with it...Go for it..."
5,"So when I bought this, I thought that it would be hard to use it because it was a very high profile keyboard(long-distance travel of keys) and I was only used to the laptop keyboards which were low profile(short distance travel of keys). And then I quickly went to a type test website and realized that I got a much better score with the keyboard than the laptop keyboard that I had been using for almost a year! So if you feel that you won't feel comfortable with the high-profile keys, don't worry this is crazy good.When it comes to build quality, It is very good! And it's very sturdy!So I definitely recommend this keyboard even if you're not used to high profile keyboardsHope you found me helpful!"
1,This is a waste of ‚Çπ850. You can buy a cheaper more durable mechanical keyboard instead. Several keys have stopped working within 2 days of purchase. They sometimes work with a lot of tilting and adjusting the cable. Absolutely useless product. My advice is to buy something else.
2,I bought this in October 2020 at rate of 1.9k. Firstly the packaging was not good. There were bents and folding on each corner.The keyboard does not come with the the hand rest attached. You have to attach on your own which is risky.The keyboard is fine. But it is very loud and a bit irritating with the feed back. The print on keys are already 20 percent faded.I would strongly recommend you to buy livetech kb03 model which is amazing and way better than this model kb08.The only feature at which kb08 is better is that it has rgb backlight. Where as kb03 doesn't have backlight.In every other way kb03 is better than kb08.
3,The keyboard looks sturdy and durable. The hinges/contacts of the palm rest  were found to be broken on arrival. There is no scroll lock light available on the keyboard. The quality should have been bit better for the price tag.
5,"Best at the price point,just one problem without led backlight hard to see key alfabates but it's not big issue ,I got it under 1500 thanks Amazon,it's sturdy,keys blue type not cherry MX blue but no lag at all ,wire is strong,it looks like premium product,I think it will last longer!"
5,"Just got this product (15th August 2019). The keyboard is good as per price. I bought it for Rs 959/-. The wire of keyboard is not typical one that we usually see in keyboards. It is nylon strand wire so, I am not sure how reliable the wire is. Wire has Velcro to bind, just like we see in laptop chargers . I suggest you to tie the wire with one of the whole of the keyboard to avoid any kind of tension at joint.Pros:- Looks premium- Easy to clean- Though it does not have mechanical keys, however feels like mechanical (except the click sound)- Plastic quality is good.Cons:- It has LED for Caps Lock and Num Lock only. No Scroll Lock LED. If seller is reading this feedback, please mention this in description. I replaced this product once just because of this reason. But, the keyboard which I got in replacement also has the same problem. So, I believe it does not come with Scroll Lock LED. (You can see in image)- If you are not aware about the position of keys, it is going to be hard for you to find the right keys in dark room. Because, light does not pass through the keys.I am giving this feedback after using it for one day only. Though, I am not sure about the longevity, but still it feel good to work on this keyboard."
3,"So I'll preface by saying this this is fairly a budget option, and you're supposed to expect these kind of thingsBut the seller is kinda shady, the product I recieved was clearly opened previously, looking at the way the wire was left in untangled.Upon closer inspection my W key wasn't bouncing back up. I see that the rubber that's supposed to make it retract is broken.Well I didn't have enough time to replace and return so I used a spare keyboard and transplanted it's rubber mechanism to this one, and it seems to work fine.But this is not done.The keyboard is good, heavy metal plate, nice smooth long travel keys, spaced properly."
3,pros:1. good looking. unique looking. metal finishing is good2. gives a mechanical keyboard feelcons:1. the letters printed on keys are off extremely bad quality. i think within few months it will fall off. looks cheap.2. it needs support stands in back so keyboard so it can stand diagonally.3. cable is quite short. needs to be longer.4. it's not a mechanical keyboard
5,I received this keyboard with somewhat bad condition..there was one button who's mechanical switch was not functioning...plus the box was damaged from outside as well..so I placed a replacement..I received a perfect working keyboard.so many options for the RGB..loving it..its the best recommendation for this price rate
1,"Don't by this product Because after 1 month SHIFT Key not working other keys also not working. So don't buy this product. Looks so Good, Color is too Good but keys will be not working properly. so if possible it will be replace or refund so please help me out. because this is not about money this is about product I bought in 1830/- INR. so this is waste of money. and this is not Value for money Product this is my personal experience. I Would like to suggest you guys you can by other brand Keyboards. Don't by this."
5,The product totally satisfied me..and i love the clicky loud blue switch sound that it emits
3,Are you a programmer or touch typer? Take a closer look at the positions of pipe key (UNIX pipe) or the backward slash key (directory seperator in Windows). In this keyboard they are adjacent to ENTER key. Usually they lay above ENTER key. That minor blip might not hit every one and keyboard is very good apart from that. So decide for yourself.
4,"Received the product today [on time]RGB lighting looks beautiful.Compatible with any PC/Laptop.Little bit noisy compared to RED-GEAR BLAZE.Keys feel Slippery as Its a New Product.Key Tick sound feels noisy.Braided Cable With Gold Color Coated USB.Separate Palm Rest is Provided in box. [Feels difficult while installing and removing]Metallic Spring Sound while pressing the SPACE BAR4 Stars due to No Amazon Packaging Was Provided By Seller. [No Seal Was Given on The Box, Anyone Could Have Opened it Easily On the Way]"
1,Received today on time
4,"The Live tech Keyboard KB08 is quite good, i like most is the lighting system with different light mode . And the reason why i gave 4 stars is the packaging is so bad that if your not lucky enought it might be damage during shipping."
4,"The keyboard is sturdy and responsive. Keys are well lifted to give feel of mechanical keyboard. Palm rest is good add-on at this price point. But the colours of alphabet started to fade away after Just a week of use that's the only disappointing thing. Letters will fadeaway after a month, so think this before buying."
1,they send defective & replaced keyboard. i could clearly see the original packaging was removed & resealed. i was thinking that this might be a defective one & someone has replaced it.very disappointed.
2,"Got a faulty keyboard when I bought it the first time,the backlight on one of the rows was not working properly,got it replaced.After using for a month,one of the keys (q key) stopped working properly and some keys typed twice even though pressed once (e key being one of those keys).Really expected much better for the price range.My last keyboard was a 500rs normal Logitech keyboard that lasted me 3 years.Would be much better if they actually concentrate on the performance rather than making the product look fancy."
5,The quality of plastic is very nice.. it is hard plastic and not that cheap one  I would definitely recommend this if you want quality and yes this is not a mechanical keyboard but a membrane keyboard.... Built quality is decent
5,If your looking for a budget mechanical Keyboard this is the best you can find. The effects are Dope. Clicky sound. Good response. Been using it for over a month Gaming daily for 2-3 hours. Takes times to get used to it ur switching from a normal keyboard to a mechanical one.
4,"One of the best keyboard I haves used so far.a good design and is much comfortable to use.the keys are a but raised, feels like a type writer. For gaming its great.Only 4 stars because of the worst seller(Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd. Bangalore).Received the product broken.The extra attachments for palm rest is broken.Dear Amazon ,please take necessary actions and dont disappoint your future customers due to the sellers."
4,For value for money this is little costly ...but ergonomics and typing comfort is good ..it could be more 250 rs cheaper as per local market pricing ..Anyways good attempt
3,"The keys are decent and the feel is good. This isn't an rgb keyboard. I've been using it for 8 months now and already, two of the keys have started to exhibit no response. I would suggest going for a more durable gaming keyboard and spend a little extra for longer usability."
1,no long lifelong process of warranty claimCheap services..Not satisfactoryDurability. ( zero)
5,"Pretty good when compare with other membrane keyboards, light glowing is fentastic, keys are very sharp and feel like Mechanical keyboard. Recommended product"
4,My Live Tech Vulcan Mouse doesn't let me down for the past 2 years and counting.....I hope KB03 PRO deosn't let me down.as mentioned before.....for gaming it's good but for occasional typing it will do
5,I didn't expect the keyboard to be this good. At a price of Rs 1900 this offers the biggest bang for my buck.The only con i see till now is that the right arrow key is a little loose and comes out easily.
4,"I'm not a keyboard guy, so I can't tell much difference, but this sure is way better than my old keyboard. I'm giving 4 stars because it came with a broken arm rest. but it probably was because of the shipping and not factory fault. I just kinda superglued it and it works. 5/5 would recommend"
5,"We are very happy with this keyboard. Amazing keyboard, has an amazing feel & very cool while playing. The colours are so beautiful while keying & playing. It was definitely a good decision to buy this product.  My son is in love with the keyboard."
4,All things are very good in this.. at a price of 1850... just the packaging was on a bit lower side.. i just found 1 problem that the text written on the keys is very faded as because of that the keyboard cannot be used without the backlighting..
3,The second row from the top is lit with blue led and the characters are not bright as in other rows and are not visible. I don't think we can change the color of the row. In the keyboard that I received there are two END keys. The left one must be the DEL key. Serious quality check lapse. The typing feel is good.
4,"I love this product. Everything written about the product in the description truly fits. Keys are  smooth and the mechanical feel enhances the typing experience. The keys are raised which provides the mechanical feel but the key heights are countered by the arm rest/pad. If you are bored of using the same old flat multimedia keyboard and mechanical keyboards are out of your budget line then  this keyboard is a one of the best products. I am satisfied with the product and I'd have rated it at five stars but according to me, the product is a little overpriced. Except for the price issue(my opinion), the product is flawless."
4,"Rubber dome, NOT mechanical. Good feel still. well built for the price. And the design is good for easy  maintenance and cleaning . FN keys are a good add on. N the strip blue indicator light for lock keys are not bad to look at, rather impressive at this price i'd say. wrist rest is tiny and gets in the way slightly but can be removed with some prying. the lettering will start fading away in a couple of weeks of intense use."
5,"This is great entry level mechanical keyboard.This keyboard has blue mechanical switch from Chinese manufacturer not cherry MX but still its nice. it has nice clicky sound. Gamers and typist gonna love it. This is not actual RGB keyboard. It has rainbow lighting you can change lighting Mods but color on every line is fixed like from top to bottom 1-Blue, 2-Red, 3-Orange, 4-Green, 5-Purple, 6-White.i attached video with all lighting mods.and some images this is how keyboard look at night."
5,"The keyboard is amazing for this price point,You know the good part, ill tell you about the bad part of this keyboardI am updating this after 4 month of heavy usage and gaming! (28/11/2019)1-some people might find lack of stabilizer in keys as a issue2-Only top plate is aluminum, BUT KEYBOARD IS STILL 0.98KG3-Jixian switches are soldered to the pcb, but at this price its ok4-Lacks in built memory , so you have to reset lighting again and again once you turn it off.5-Aluminium plate can pick some scratches if not handled carefully6- MOST IMPORTANT the cable being not braided can be issue for some7-The user manual has a lot of mistakes and has wrong features written , i mailed cosmic byte to confirm , they denied any such features mentioned.8- Ok,after usage i realized, that the key puller is real flimsy, please take good care to avoid any such damages.I got this keyboard for under 1900/- so, wait for the right time and buy it at cheaper rates, because if you are willing to spend above 2k rupees, the Zebronics max pro would be a better option.However at this price point. the keyboards build quality is amazing, I am using it right now to type this review!So buy it when you get a good price or buy a combo  if possible."
4,"I've been using this keyboard for past 2 days and typing feels amazing, mechanical keyboard feels great, the soft tactile key presses and feedback is so satisfying. The only problem I faced so far is the lighting pattern. On this keyboard the lighting pattern tends to reset every time when I turn on my PC. It is very annoying and I hope Cosmic Byte does something to fix this problem, and also I don't find any drivers for this keyboard.I bought it for Rs 1745 and for this price i think its a steal.Edit :- I've contacted CB for the above problem and the solution is to keep pressing ""FN + ESC"" for 10 secs and it works,also their customer service is very helpful and very prompt. 10/10 for overall experience."
3,"Update: I wrote to Cosmic support and they asked for a video to show the problem. I did and they suggested two things which didn't work. They replaced the keyboard with a new one as they stated that the problem was no fixable. This seems to be working fine at this time (received it 10 minutes back). I upgraded my rating to 3 from 1 because they have very good aggressive support and take lot of pain to ensure that the issue is resolved.----Few additional points:- Suddenly the W key stopped working. I had to press very hard for it to work sometimes.Update on 26th November: It has almost completely stopped functioning.  I have enclosed a video showing the issue.- Sometimes this keyboard is garbling output or dropping some keys when I am typing too fast.- Overall this keyboard is not giving me what I expected from a mechanical keyboard.Earlier review (still valid):The single biggest issue is that they used a strange font for keys which is hard to read. The B looks like 13 for instance!I had to look for several seconds just to guess the @ key. There was absolutely no reason for adventurism with key fonts! To add to the misery they used strange words as opposed to sticking to what we are comfortable with and found in 99.9% of the keyboards.Till date, I don't know how to set scroll lock!I don't see much value for rainbow colors or even the multiple disco lighting modes (for lack of a better word) in the keyboard. It serves no purpose and just an annoyance.Use of acronyms like WASD in the documentation is another bummer.The keys could use more brightness.For for the pros, the keyboard is solid and has nice keys."
5,"This is the only mechanical keyboard that is being sold at this price range(1.7k). It is my first mechanical keyboard. If you haven't tried any mechanical keyboard yet & want to buy a mechanical keyboard then at this price this is a steal. I GOT IT FOR Rs.1649 & it was a steal. the keys feel soft but they have a tactile feel when they activate, also responsive, the backlighting is the cherry on top. but one thing is the font used in the keycap i don't like it maybe you do or do not that a personal preference & i'm also being nit-picky about it. Value for money!EDIT: [11/09/19] have been using it about a month & it's still fine. Also i discovered some new stuff pressing fn+1,2,3,4,5,6 changes it to pre configured lighting. try it yourself (not the numpad 123456 tho)EDIT 2: [06/01/2020] HAPPY NEW YEAR if you are reading this.Now this keyboard has been serving me well no issues what so ever!"
2,"- If you're a Mac user like me and do a lot of coding/typing then please don't buy this as there is no driver from the vendor and out of the box driver is very flakey.- The media keys are not supported as well on a Mac- Sometimes, some keys don't respond, so you will definitely miss lot of key strokes- No inbuilt memory to remember the rainbow lighting setting so everytime you disconnect everything reset to factory defaultAll in all don't buy this if you use Mac, for linux and Windows for basic testing everything just works (full testing pending yet)"
1,"You might think that their is a lot to be happy about just because a mechanical keyboard is cheap,BUT trust me their is NOTHING to be happy about, it's just one of those Chinese products which flash in people's eyes so that they buy and regret later . So lets talk about this keyboardDurability - WORST i noticed a slight input lag on day 1 and some keys delayed in registering , thought I was trippin at first or perhaps it would go over time, but it got worse over time.  Should have returned it on day 1(BAD EFFIN LUCK) , just in 3 months the keyboard is at the point where most of the keys wont register or double register. Even my membrane keyboard worked absolutely fine for 5 years,  just the rubber membranes went bad.Anti-ghosting: just a fluke, sometimes multiple key presses wont register.Wire- fine, unbraidedKey caps-fineSwitches - fine as expectedBody- metal, heavy, somehow has a cheap feel to itLighting- Not rgb, just backlit, awful predetermined key lighting which gets reset after every shutdown.Circuit- i guess the keyboard's main circuit is the problem it might be that's it build quality is poor or cosmic byte is clueless how to make a keyboard chip.I would suggest to save a little more and go with zebronics max pro, or a premium branded one if you could afford it. Coz if the keys don't register their is no point to any other feature.I regret not saving and buying this!"
4,"Don't be taken back by the reference images which make the keyboard look orders of magnitude uglier than it is. The keyboard looks okay and the typeface could definitely be improved. After all, keyboards are made to be touched, not looked at. Speaking of touches, the Outemu Browns aren't that crispy-tactile and the keys are a bit wobbly, though that doesn't deter a programmer from using this. At this price, the keyboard is worth every penny, given I'm migrating from a Logitech K380 membrane keyboard which was more expensive, had interference issues, key failures and sometimes typed by itself like it was posessed (and no, I never brought so much as a drop of water close to it). The keycaps are decent and I opened up the machine to see a beautiful circuit with very good soldering. The lack of non-volatile lighting memory is kinda annoying. After all, you need about five bits of storage and any decent microcontroller has a non-volatile store these days - meaning the manufacturer deliberately downgraded the software here to sell a pricier keyboard. I might desolder the backlight LEDs and forget that one. All to say, it'd be a fool's act to go for much pricier keyboards when they offer only slight improvements over this. The journey's only begun and I'll update in case anything relevant happens."
5,"""If you like this review please press that helpful button""Review :---------Its a Good entry level mechanical keyboard. The swiches are blue so it have that satisfying click sound. Previously i had a TVS Gold barath keyboard which came with cherry blue swiches compared to those the swiches are not as good. But cosidering the fact that the TVS  no longer comes with cherry & the cheapest  cherry switch keybord cost over 4000rs this feels like a great buy for a fraction of money.  BTW i brought this for around 1600rs during amazon shopping festival.I would say its a must buy if you are still using membrane gaming keyboards. Mechanical ones last much longer and feels way better to type on.The major con i found on this keyboard is its lighting. There are some funky lighting patterns but there is no option to keep the backlighting to a single color. We can adjust the intensity of light and can use some predefined lighting patterns. I wish there was an option to keep all the backlighting to a single collor preferably blue or white.Overall i completely recommend this keyboard if you can get this under 2000"
1,Pathetic product! Keys not working properly just within a month. Pressing them repeatedly misses every 4-5th click. What should i do now? Watch the video attached.
3,"I liked its tactical feedback anti-ghosting functions, 6 color lights and different patterns of lights but its a bit heavy and the keys are raised a bit more that can attract dust particles more and more inside it. bought it for 1749 on Amazon but available for 49 rs less on its official website for only rs 1699. overall good mechanical keyboard at its price. fast delivery by Amazon. I don't like Amazon's policy of removing negative reviews."
5,"This keyboard is pretty solid, you will need a bit of time to get used to this design. But once you do you will be greateful for making this purchase.The click feel and the sound emitted when you click it is satisfying. Highly recommend this for not just a gamer but also a typing enthusiastic like me."
1,Considering the price it's one of the cheapest mechanical keyboard available on the market buy it has some flaws. I am a programmer and gamer(mostly csgo) and this keyboard has disappointed me. I have some problems(One of them is weird).1. Sometimes some keys dont register while typing and also gaming which is not acceptable.2. My laptop goes into a bootloop if I try to boot while this keyboard is connected.... weird3. Keys are tactile and loud but the feel and actuation point is not great but for the price its acceptable.
5,"I have regularly used HP/Dell Wireless keyboards and wanted to switch to mechanical keyboard.I do casual gaming and lot of coding.This keyboard is compact and may take some time to get used to, but the typing speed is great for me with good tactile feedback.I have taken the brown switch version- I have checked by removing some keys, and it uses Outemu Brown switches.The sound is not as loud as blue switches (I am comparing with some videos I saw on Outemu blues). But if you smash the keys hard, they do make good sound.The keyboard panel is made of aluminium, cold to touch and the build quality seems excellent. Far better from all the plastic keyboard I have used. There is gold plated USB connector which seems will last long without rusting.I have checked all the keys and it is working fine. I will update the review after few weeks on my experience.The led lightings and effects are ok. I do not prefer the effects and keep all LEDs on. Though there are around 10 patterns if you prefer.ALSO, this I discovered late, there are more patterns if you press Fn+1, Fn+2 upto 6. Fn+1 lights up WASD, Esc and arrow keys so it is lights for minimalist gaming buttons. 2 through 6 lights up few more keys.The keyboard misses on few areas, but it should be no bother at this price point, but here they are:1. The lightning effect gets resetted each time you power cycle your system/ unplug and replug the keyboard. It starts with the annoying snake pattern mode. The brightness setting is also lost. So you have to set it up with Fn+Ins for effects and Fn+arrows for brightness again.2. The markings on keycaps are not too visible when leds are off. This should not be a concern for touch typists, but for me who hover their fingers on the keys, I have to keep the leds on permanently. Though on the lowest brightness."
5,"This is a fantastic mechanical keyboard which for any 1st time user or even for someone who just types out long documents. The lack of individual RGB is surely a CON, you really need to think if buying a full RGB support keyboard is worth spending another 1,000 which is almost double the cost of this keyboard.I own Cosmic Byte CB-GK-16 which are Outemu Blue Switches while these are Outemu Brown Switches. The Brown switches are quite silent and very home friendly.They do miss out on the tactile feel, but I would rather have a keyboard that is much silent than noisy.The keyboard is quite easy to recommend at the asking price of Rs. 1799 - 10% = Rs. 1619Can't really go wrong with it. Anyone who is using a membrane keyboard and wants to try a mechanical keyboard this can be a good starting point."
5,"I loved this keyboard a lot its build quality is great no flex. Has full aluminium body. The keys don't have a lot of wobble. The switches are amazing and satisfying.Rainbow look is cool and has 6 effectsThere are 2 cons thoughThe feet are not rubberised.(keyboard is heavy, not always a problem)The brightness isn't top notchAgain can't expect everything from a budget keyboard.If this your first mechanical keyboard it Is great though I would suggest to spend 700rs more and get the redgear one with kalih blue switches if it is in your budget otherwise, go for it."
4,"Here is my One month usage review. This keyboard is good and really perfect has nice design that from gamers to typewriters everyone will like. Has some led back ligthing not RGB but someone from the keyboard community named it Rainbow though I am not getting that rainbow effect, seven colors of the rainbow are not present on the keyboard :DThe keyboard has decent typing feeling that normal new mechanical keyboard lovers will like but those who are using mechanical keyboard for many years surely will get something wrong in it. Being a mechanical keyboard users for 2 years I have found some glitches here and there. Let me type down below in order.1. The keyboard has loud tactile sound that needs to be greasing for lowering it's sound.2. The keyboard may sometimes for a micro seconds does not response which should not be present in any professional keyboard which will lead typos, I know this is a known issue of the chipset it's used. It will not break the keyboard though.3. Jixian blue switches are good but it does not provide the feeling of outemu while typing.My old keyboard had outemu swithches that really given me a nice smooth typing feel of which only 50% I am getting from this keyboard.As I have to write lots of thing on my computer that's why I got those problems but normal users will never able to find such problems.But if those problems be kept aside then I can really recommend it to anyone who wants to use mechanical keyboard, at least it has solid Jixian switches not like logitech mechanical that once break you are finished.It's good keyboard for its price and nice. New users once get it hands on will never able to detect such problem at all."
4,"This is an awesome keyboard in this price range and it has no build quality issue. Its keys are nice and clicky and having good feedback as well. But there is some issue with the driver of this keyboard I think.The main issue with this keyboard is, sometimes it skips the keystrokes while typing. I am using this keyboard for 3 days and I have faced this problem at least 2 to 3 times in a single usage. It's not a hardware issue, I searched for that problem and I found that its a driver issue. So I visited the official website of Cosmic Byte and there was no driver available for any Cosmic byte keyboards. So, its a kind request from Cosmic byte to provide a proper driver for your keyboards. Thank you"
1,"This keyboard is worst,  just after the return period it has gone bad. The led light of the complete row is faulty.The light blinks continuously and it won't stop.I wanted a return but since return period is over I can't get it.If any of the cosmic byte official is reading , then please help , as i am stuck with this pathetic keyboard"
5,"This is my first mechanical gaming keyboard, used membrane keyboards earlier and was used to it but this change felt nice.About the keyboard- Sturdy heavy build, looks much better in person than in picture, chrome bezel looks nice and colour intensity is amazing. Texture and slope of keys can be worked upon by company, but that's not much of a problem. Also, there is no inbuilt memory for colour profile selected. Overall this was the best purchase at the offered price of 1575. The company doesn't have many service centres so the longetivity of the keyboard remains an issue. Will update if any problem arises."
1,"Not so great keyboard, but a basic Mechanical Keyboard. The RGB is weird, every time you restart/start, the lighting‚Äôs gets reset. Not Individually lit RGB(I don‚Äôt expect that at this pricing). Though it says anti ghosting. Its not! I faced multiple times that keys are ghosted while playing Games. Yet Value for money.Ok, adding on. Dont buy this keyboard.the Cosmic Byte support is one of the worst support team in the world. My keyboard failed to work and upon contacting the support they were like, what should one expect for 3k value product. Means, this product is supposed to for one year only. Instead of spending money on these cosmic Byte products. Add 1k more and buy a good Keyboard. Even Logitech G 413 is better than Cosmic Byte‚Äôs Crap!"
5,"This is my first mechanical keyboard and I am loving it! I was explicitly looking for ""Brown"" equivalent switches as I was not sure about the sound factor of the ""Blue"" equivalent switches, having come from the common membrane keyboards and the usual laptop ""Chicklet"" keyboards in my college and professional life so far, but I was sure that I wanted to experience the ""mechanical switch"" based keyboard, having worked with them in my school days.Thank you Cosmic Byte for making this extremely value option available for people like me, especially with the ""brown switch"", which is an absolute rarity in India at this price point. And it is an extremely well made keyboard! Remember the movie fight scenes where a keyboard is used as a weapon? Well, this keyboard can actually be used there, it is so well made! And the finishing touches and details are great too, nothing to complain about. I work in IT and I have been using this as my primary keyboard for the past 2 months, and there have been no complaints. I have also been trying to improve my typing speed and this keyboard has helped me get over my past membrane keyboard based average of 38 wpm, I am at around 45 wpm right now, and I can clearly see a lot of room for improvements, I am sure that word count is going to grow significantly in near future.I bought this from Amazon, and it was delivered quickly as promised to my address, and was even replaced once at my request within the replacement window. I had requested a replacement as there was something loose within the keyboard that was making a clinking noise when the keyboard was moved, though there was no isue with the keybpard functioning. The relacement was done without any hassle from Amazon. At around 2k INR, this is a clincher. In fact, having used it for a couple of months, I wouldn't mind buying it at the stated MRP of 2.5k if I ever have to buy it again. I would obviously advise everyone to go for it, if you want to try the mechanical keyboard as an option to see if you really enjoy the feeling of one, and if it improves your productivity significantly, this is one of the best options to begin your journey -  it is a very well made keyboard, but it does not cost a bomb and if it does not go to your liking, you can still find a use for it as it does not make an unhealthy amount of noise (think office environment or late night work from home, or even as a gift to someone deserving, like a student in your family who scored really well in the exams). However, if it does go well (the most likely scenario), you will glean many pleasurable hours (hopefully years) of usage, not to mention the admirable glances and vocal compliments of all who witness it! It sure is a treat for the eyes, if nothing else, in all its back lit, effect filled presence on your table.I have worked with membrane keyboards that cost in similar figures (1k+ INR), and I would say this one is definitely more value than those (relatively) expensive membrane keyboards, solely in terms of the typing experience and expected longevity. You have to allow for a few days to let the ""feel"" settle in to really understand and appreciate the difference a mechanical keyboard makes. Though I have not worked with the more expensive ones marketed as ""semi-mechanical"", but I would say try out a mechanical keyboard before spending a bomb on a ""semi-mechanical"", especially this one with Outemu switches, which are one of the best, if not the best, value Kailh alternatives out there. I saw a lot of Youtube video comparisons to come to that understanding, as I am sure you would too before opting for this.The only reason to go for a membrane keyboard if you are willing to spend in the vicinity of 1.5k INR would be if you are planning to carry it around a lot (even then, I would say save your money and buy something cheaper, they are not worth more than 800 INR at the most IMHO, and even then, get a back lit chicklet one, they are the most sensible portable alternative), as this one is not meant for being carried around - it is heavy (as all mechanical keyboards are) and is best used at a stationary work station, not lugged around in a back pack. You can do it, if you really want to, but I wouldn't recommend it, considering the weight, and also considering what a beauty this is, I would say it doesn't deserve that ""treatment"" of being smothered in a backpack. If that is not making sense to you, just wait till you set your eyes on this beauty, and it will!"
1,"Build quality is excellent in price range but the main fault was key prints are not clearly visible look likes faded i dont know its only in my piece.I am reviewing it again yesterday my W,A,Sand D jeys stopped working only in 2 months tume what a bad thing it is . I will not recommend it to anyone instead buy some reputed brands."
3,"This is one keyboard I have not gotten completely used to, even after almost two months of use. Not sure why. I still miss keys or press the wrong one.The keyboard gave trouble from the beginning. The comma key was mostly stuck. No amount of prodding, cleaning would help... after a few hours it would be stuck again and it got worse. I was in touch with Cosmic Byte and they promised replacement, but not after a highly annoying requirement of sending them photos as well as a video of the malfunction. I asked them to keep it on hold as the process was tedious. They asked me to use the keyboard lock and unlock button a few times, and over a period, it helped. The comma key works fine now.As far as the rest of the keyboard is concerned, I find the keys a tad too resistant. Also, the font used to display the keys is highly annoying... needlessly stylised typeface cause issues. Keyboards should have simple types, so recognition is instant.Overall, the build seems good. Package graphics are unimpressive. There was a little device (a ring with two extensions) that looked like it was placed mistakenly. Only later I realised it was to be used to pull the keys out. I wish the manufacturers had devised a method of inserting it into the keyboard body for storage.Another annoyance is the lights are not truly RGB... but each 'zone' has different colours. So, if I want the entire keyboard to show only a certain colour of backlight, it is not possible.Keep in mind I am not a gamer, just a design professional looking for a decent keyboard without paying through my nose."
5,"I purchased it when it was first available after pendamic i.e 4th Oct in Rs.2000. I am using it consistantly for above 8 hrs or more every day for my professional use. I buyed it just for typing experience and my accounts n operation work, need lots of calculation so number keys is also performing good and using it for my ofc use. I don't care about lighting effect coz i am touch typist and my avg speed is 55 wpm.I must say it is one of the best keyboard available in the market. Its also compact in size.The only Con i notices is it is slightly wobble or stabilization issue but don't spoil typing experience and keys are super soft and just need small force to register. Far better then chicklet key. Half pressed or lazily pressed also register the key.I don't like cleaky sound so i purchased brown switches which is from Outemu brand and it is also respectable brand in international market after Cherry switches. It's good over kaihl switches and can't be compared to gixian as per you tube videos and some research done about types of mechanical switches. So in short otemu is 2nd best after cherry switches. Go for it and far better typing experience than those chicklet keyboards"
5,"This the best keyboard ive ever had. It feels so smooth and premium, its really durable.Some features:1. 5-6 different lighting patterns.2. U can change the brightness levels and the lighting speed aswell.3. U can either choose no light or totally lit option.  (In no light feature the lights are totally off and when u press any key, the light below the key lits up)4. ""Mechanical keyboard"" so u dont have to worry about wasting ur keyboard while gaming.What i dont like is that THE CABLE is not braided, thats it.Just order it why are u still reading ü§®"
4,"Okay, so if you are looking to buy your first mechanical keyboard then this is one of the better options. I opted for the Outemu Brown switch variant as the blue switches are just some cheap Chinese knock-off and I prefer brown for the lower sound but similar tactile feel.If you have only used cheap membrane keyboards this is a big step up for typing alone and for gaming it's in a different league.The only con I have felt so far is the somewhat limited spacing between keys. More expensive models like the Ducky ones from meckeys or Corsair or even the Zebronics one have slightly better spacing so easier to get used to and less typos.Will update this review if any build quality issues pop up but it is built pretty well with aluminium chassis. The cable is cheap though.Anyway, hopefully this review helped and surely it is bang for the buck as an entry level mechanical keyboard, far superior to membrane keyboards at this price point."
3,"Pros -1. Best build in quality.2. Stylist good, having metallic body.3. Sleek design compare to Zeb nitro.4. Best in price range.Reason why I had returned this product because-1. Color of the Font is grey, you find difficult to recognize what's written on keys.2. Fonts of keyboard is a bit weird.3. Color of every line are fixed. We can not change color to any specific color.4. Position of keys in this keyboard is not up to the marks."
5,"The S key is broken i have to press it 3-4 times at least so it can register . so disappointing  , really cuts the gaming experience .It turns out its common issue in mechanical keyboards , u can fix it by poring rubbing alcohol into the socket ,"" u can find the fix on youtube"" . u can get rubbing alcohol from any medical store ."
4,"I received my keyboard yesterday and I love it. So far, it seems like a great deal and I'm very happy with it. I'm still getting used to a mechanical keyboard but it's not too hard. I've also come to appreciate the clicky nature of blue switches. When reading reviews, I noticed that a lot of people mentioned they received Jixian blue switches while the browns were typically always Outemu. Once I received the keyboard, I immediately took off a keycap to determine what switch I got and was surprised to see it was an Outemu switch! I checked a couple other keys and they all had Outemus. I'd assume that these Outemu switches are better than the Jixians, so keep this in mind. My only complaint with the keyboard so far is the fact that the function key symbols (such as volume up/down) are not backlit since they are painted onto the keycaps. I guess I will have to commit each function to memory if I want to use them in the dark."
4,"Hey, I got this keyboard for Rs. 1800/-.I have to say that price of the keyboard is completely justified. But few things I didnt liked in this.Firstly the print of characters. They are invisible without Backlit, even if there is ample amount of sunlight.Secondly, I feel the weight of the keyboard is bit less. It could had been somewhat heavier. While gaming intensively it tends to move or slid.Lastly, cable could had been braded.Beside these and considering the price point this is the best we can get.I'm happy"
1,"Please do not waste money on this productBuying this keyboard for this much money was a waste of money for meAfter 4-5 weeks, the RGB lights started flickering out of pattern, while typing some keys just gets missed or double typed and now it is automatically changing the cursor positions while typing.Intried to claim warranty from cosmic byte and they asked me to send the product to Pune... On my expense which they will reimburse later.I just don't have enough time to bear wirh this malfunctioning product after paying this much."
1,The product has a dent at one corner and the aluminum sheet is not at its place.
1,"I bought this because I wanted a cheap backup mechanical keyboard which looked decent. The package arrived yesterday in a taped up box. It definitely was opened and/or used before. I still gave it the benefit of the doubt and open it up. Just by looking at it I could say that it would have issues working, but still I had little hope that it might actually work.I plugged it in and it lit up fine, I noticed a cut on the ESC key, about 2 millimeters wide. The left key was stuck pressed. None of the keys worked, I tried disconnecting my other HyperX keyboard and tried this, it only lit up and nothing worked. Tried it on another PC and a laptop but still the same.If I had bought this a month earlier and if the function keys worked to change the pattern of lighting then I probably would have hung this on our Christmas tree. A decoration light which looks like keyboard, a shame that even the light pattern changing keys don't work. :-)I've asked for a replacement, will update when this review when I get my replacement."
5,1st time mechanical keyboard user. Used primarily logitech membrane wireless keyboards before. After using this keyboard I'm never gonna use membrane keybs againButtons are buttery smooth.Adjustable light brightness good feature and light at full brightness does not disturb eyes.Primary use programming n regular office workUSB cable is long but non braidedThis is a 1st day review so can't say how durable it is.At 2000 rs it's a good buy.Brown switches. Sound is extremely low and keys don't wobble like membrane keybsI own a amkette Evo fox 10keyless membrane rgb keyboard but cosmic byte keyb feel is totally smooth.
5,Bought it for my work and gaming needs. Excellent quality and tactile mechanical keys. I went with the brown outemu switches as I don't like click sound of blue switches. Overall a decently priced gaming keyboard. Don't think will ever switch back to membrane keyboard now. Only thing lacking is breathing light for the switches üò≠. CosmicByte should have given breathing light instead of so many lighting effects which would made this keyboard a killer at this price point. Also memory function should be there for the lighting effect. I just use one effect all the time and have to set it every time my system is restarted. Best one if this is your first mechanical keyboard!
5,"PROS:For those who know to type without seeing the keyboard, this keyboard is a boon. You will never miss a key. the keys are very soft and deep and actuate early, so when typing fast you dont need to hit the bottom, and also it doesn't hurt the fingers unlike a chiklet keyboard with no height at all(those that are found on most laptops).You can remove the keys safely and easily for cleaning.CONS:could have included wireless for this price,and there is option to turn off the backlights blinking serially, but it will resume again after system restart.also, the letters printed on top of the keys are too dull and not visible in low light conditions."
5,"Very sturdy, excellent build quality. Value for money. Mechanical blue switches work as they should. And the RGB is adjustable from the keyboard itself. Heavy enough and has rubber feet so that it doesn't slide. And the cable is also good quality with sufficient length. In my opinion this is the best true mechanical keyboard with a Number pad, that I could find at this price range. Would definitely recommend."
3,"Nothing to complain about at the price point! If it had remembered the light effect it would been a great keyboard. It  is annoying to reset the light effect every time :(UPDATE: After using it for some days I found that the hardware on this keyboard is incapable of handling fast key strokes. When I type over 80-90 WMP, it becomes unresponsive for some microseconds, technically it leads to typos. I'm of the type who use keyboard 10x more than mouse. This is so disturbing. I got replacement but that too have the same issue. I've never noticed such a problem in any keyboard before."
4,"Look I've been using it for like couple of months and For gaming : Fine (I play fortnite, minecraft, overwatch, GTA v and mostly Fps)The thing itself is pretty strong.The one thing I don't like even though I know it supposed to be this way is : the key's r not bright u can't see them at night or even in daylight, u have to turn on the LED lights all the time to see. Which is kinda annoying.But u know it's a mechanical keyboard with a very strong build u get what u paid for.The lights just leave them you'll get used it."
5,I used this on my recently purchased MacBook Air M1. I got a minor scratch on the lid and so started looking for cases. This one fit the bill. It was selling for 1300 and with few cash backs that was on offer by Amazon for I was able to get it for around 1100. I received it nicely packaged next day and it fit the MacBook Air M1 perfectly. I had to push a bit for the snap but nothing alarming. The golden colour is nicely visible through the clear case. They had also provided keyboard cover which is good if you are going to use it open in dusty environment. Also supplied was the trackpad protective layer and some plugs for the USB-C and headphone sockets. Nice touch. I mostly use my setup closed like Clamshell and this is very useful to keep the setup safe.
3,"Overall a decent product with a good build.Pros:1. Good build quality.2. The "" World Map"" pattern on the case is beautiful and gives the laptop a funky look.Cons:1. Once the screen and base cases are fixed, the screen can't be taken all the way back due to the thickness of the cases. This is especially a pain when keeping the laptop on your thighs while sitting on a sofa/bean bag and working as the screen doesn't have the mobility to go right back.2. The base case clips the body only on one side (either left of right) and not both sides.3. The keypad silicon is meant for the 2019 air book model, not for the 2020 model. Another problem with the keypad silicon is the back light can't be seen once the silicon is placed on the keypad."
4,"At the first glance I thought that this might ruin my MacBook but it turns out it fits well. I don't liked the keyboard cover to be honest as you can read from the title & apart from that lid cover makes it heavy so you will notice your screen sliding down backwards. This might damage device so use it at your own risk. Otherwise at Rs.1299 you can't go wrong with this as there is all sort of protection stuff provided like trackpad protector, keyboard cover, port protector, lids."
4,The keypad shown in the pics  resembles the colour of the case but I received a plain black colour keypad which was crushed between the two panels thus making it useless.Otherwise the colour and finish of the product is flawless. Fits fine but a bit more loose than it should be. I don't think it'll be durable for more than 6-8 months again depends upon the kind of a user you are.It is absolutely easy to remove. No hassles what so ever. Colour looks really good on the new MacBook Air.
5,"So when i ordered this, i didn't know that i'l also get free keypad, touch pad etc guards along with the macbook cover.I am a using these macbook pads n covers from last 7 years.. Compared to the previous one which i got at 999, this one is a better deal coz i got extra safety pads too, which will cost you extra Rs 1000 if you'l buy it separately.Definitely a 5 star."
2,"The product is made in China and its fitting is awful the sides doesnt fit at all with macbook air 2020, keypad skin is a film which falls while using. Design is not upto the mark at all.The left side hinge missing which causing the cover to come out. Keyboard skin blows away with slight air.Ended up damaging my Mac air while fitting this"
4,"Pros:1. Case fits the MacBook Air 2020 Intel Model A2179 perfectly. Compact case and offers good protection. I have noticed that the Space Grey A2179 model unlike previous models scratches pretty easily, so this case will definitely prevent further minor scratches.2. Also comes with the keyboard protector, trackpad protector and port plugs which is useful.Cons:1. Matt Black variant leaves many fingerprints which are difficult to remove.2. Trackpad protector doesn't come with instructions and leaves lot of bubbles if applied incorrectly.3. Packaging was bad, could've been better."
2,"Not worth it AT ALL and here‚Äôs why:1. I got this product a few hours ago and have barely used my Mac since I put it on and you can already see finger print marks2. The material is cheap plastic - was expecting some rubbery texture for grip but well. Failed.3. The bottom lid is flimsy - if you pick up your Mac aggressively, it‚Äôll come off slightly. It doesn‚Äôt fit well at all (I use the M1)4. Look at the keyboard guard - it‚Äôs a JOKE. The space key on the guard doesn‚Äôt consider that the actual space key on the M1 is HALF the size. So the space key on the guard covers the key adjacent to the space key as well.Won‚Äôt recommend you to burn 1300 bucks on this ridiculous product. Skip it."
5,"It fits amazingly and is a sturdy cover. The keypad and touchpad covers are superb, it doesn't feel that there's another layer on top of the original thing and it functions smoothly."
4,"Reduced two stars since the case is a fingerprint magnet, and the keyboard cover that came with it isn‚Äôt great quality - it stretched near frequently used keys within a few weeks.Otherwise, the case fits well for my 2018 MacBook Air and protects it well. Opening up the screen beyond a certain angle will face extra friction though."
5,"Price is on higher side.But No compromise on quality. An amazing purchase, but could have been better if range was kept b/w 800-1000 max.Rest keyboard guard, laptop plug covers and mouse guard excited the most as I didn't expected this in box.Thanks amazon"
2,"The product in the ""ADs"" looks very appealing, but isn't worth buying. The images uploaded are from the 2nd day of using my device. I am not a rigorous laptop freak. so imagine what happens with people who are on their laptop for 10-12 hours daily.Rather buy the transparent version, or laptop skins (dbrand, etc.) are recommended for anyone who doesn't like to see fingerprints at all."
5,"Lovely product , came with matt covers , mouse pad shield , rubber pligs for the opening and keyboard guard......its slim and nice!P.s- its for only 2019 / 2018 mac book air"
4,It is a perfect fit for A2179 model. However the trackpad skin was bent and so the sticker keeps coming off.  The thickness of the case is sleek and does not make the laptop heavier.
2,"Well quite disappointed with the product, Product was shown something else on the site, Apple logo was quite visible on the item shown, but when I got the product it's hard plastic material through which apple logo isn't visible at all.It's hard plastic so I guess durability will be there but not happy with what I got.As you can see in the picture, the fitment is also a problem. From the back side of laptop it is not get properly fitting the macbook main body."
4,"I have a Mac Book Air  A2337 (M1), the cover fits very well.I personally did not like the colour that I ordered which is 'Airy Blue'. The products representative image shows a bit of a translucent  sleeve, which I wanted, but this is a solid pastel shade -_-."
4,"Overall the product looks sturdy. But I received it in a bad condition, it was too dusty and the package was in a miserable condition. Including there were scratches on the top cover also with some mark on it but that‚Äôs not visible after application, Can manage tho but the keyboard skin is not worth your penny, it gives a weird look to the laptop and won‚Äôt stick properly. Looking for a replacement."
5,"It is an absolute stunner. My 7 yo daughter using her MacBook Air extensively for her online classes these days, has fallen in love with her Mac after putting up this cover. Looks quite safe too."
1,Pretty much useless. The back cover did not fit my mac a1932 Model 2019. Sheer waste of money. It is strange as to how Amazon has quoted the defective brand as 'bestseller'. Supremely misleading. Avoid wasting time and money on this.
3,"The case is good and durable and cools nice as well. But there are flaws as well. The keyboard cover provided with it doesn‚Äôt fit the macbook. Also the case doesn‚Äôt fit the macbook perfectly from the sides near the speakers, it fit perfectly only on one side and not both the sides at the same time."
2,Brought on september 2019Photo taken August 2020Defect: the Matt lamination on the case started ripping off after two months of use. A good scratch with your nail itself will rip the lamination.Material is good incase of protection.
5,"The packaging was good!the Cover is a beauty, looks stunning and feels so good. When you run your hand over it you can feel the engraving on it. Loving this... Gives an even classier and personalised feel to my MacBook Air.Loved it and it is very useful.the only demerit is, the keyboard cover which fits on the keyboard but some key are not corresponding to the actual keyboard keys.But overall it's all good."
5,"Extremely satisfied with the product. 1 day delivery with prime. you get a keyboard and trackpad protector with it. a good thought is to provide the USB C closing lid with it. minimal use of it but a good thought. overall, the cover is extremely hardy, easy to install (with the guide provided). 10* if I could."
2,The give keyboard silicon is for the older version of MacBook pro .so kindly i need a replacement . Ok the silicon
5,Excellent Product. Fits perfectly. Has rubber studs to fix on female Jack's of MacBook.Has a nice screen guard and mouse guard
5,Awesome perfect fit comes with keyboard cover and cover for all the ports I want to give it 100 stars. Just buy it
5,Fits Macbook perfectly. Good all round protection.Keyboard skin is good but You can't use backlighting of keyboard. Touch pad protector is good
3,The case for lid does not fit well. Bottom case fits perfect. Keyboard cover cuts are perfect but it spoils the aesthetics. The case came with a lot of scratches on it. Not very happy with the product and I am back in the market looking for a case that will protect my mac and not spoil the looks.
2,"Writing this review after 4 month of use. Product quality is not good as per price. Not worth for money it didn‚Äôt last for 2 month n started breaking from corners. No free movement, screen stop at 90degree angle. Once corner breaks you can move screen backward. Not worth more then 3-4 hundred."
5,Perfectly fits the Macbook air 13inch 2019 model. Upper case is too tight to fit though. Macbook becomes little heavy with shell case. Good product with few add ons. But it highly overpriced I feel. If you search in local market you might get it for a better deal
5,"I am happy with the product. Fits well to my Macbook Air 2019 version. Important to check you mac series number before ordering as it is very size specific. Came in good packaging. I have not added the keypad over, only the outer cover, and happy with the results."
3,"I bought this after heavy research and when it came, the top part fit perfectly (and quite beautifully) but the bottom part didn't fit at all. If it locked into place from one side, it wouldn't lock into place at the other side. I'm giving it three stars because if the bottom part had fit, it would have been perfect."
1,Worst case dont waste your money on it it doesn‚Äôt fit the 2020 MacBook properly even if it fits it wont come off i am not able to remove the top and it just looks bad and attracts fingers and the keypad protector also doesn‚Äôt fit properly
4,Fit and finish is okay. It MIGHT protect the MacBook in case you accidentally drop it but will definitely protects from scratch and stain. I haven‚Äôt received the trackpad cover.
4,"The product as such is very good. Value for money. The packaging, however,  was a little crumpled. Even though efforts were taken to ensure that the product stays intact, my cover had a little scratch on it. The silicon keyboard cover is not up to the mark. However, it does its job and does protect my laptop from harm beautifully."
5,"It is a perfect case for Macbook, where we can see the Macbook exterior and get good protection."
5,"Very happy with the product, comes with keyboard protector and touch pad protector too. Very good quality, since it is new I cannot comment on longevity but it looks neat and not too heavy as well"
4,durable product
1,product has factory effect as its one of the corner is going to fit properly by any mean. my product got cracked while doing so. bought it again but different brand
4,"Apart from keyboard cover rest everything was fine. The keyboard cover didn't rest properly, there was no adhesive and it kept moving"
4,"This is a good quality product from ATEN. I ordered this product with lot of queries in my mind, but after installing teh product, my worries are vanished.I connected Two laptops to one monitor + one keyboard and mouse set (wifi with single dongle) successfully. Using one switch, you can switch between two laptops/desktops. I have observed  2-3 secs lag for the monitor,  but there is no lag for keyboard or mouse.  so far everything is good.On the -ve side,a. over all product quality is great except for the switch cable. that looks very thin and may damage easily.b. fixed cables - all input and output cables are fixed and not removable.c. it comes with fixed VGA cables and latest laptops has hdmi ports. so you need to purchase HDMI to VGA converter  separately.d. I observed that my laptops are not waking up after sleep mode and initial assume was it was due to laptop issue, but later realized that it is due to KVM switch. you need to remove hdmi/vgi cable whenever you observe this issue."
5,"Have connected two windows pc using this KVM. I would say that it is a very good product  and does what it is supposed to do.ProsVideo quality is good. It is not compromised. For folks with higher resolution, it may not work. But I feel that the resolution provided by KVM is good enough for most folksSwitching time is about 2 3 seconds, but it is something one can easily live with.Wires and connectors are of good quality.The switching switch works well and does its job promptlyConsGot a product with older manufacturing date. But product was new and well packedThe KVM box is made is light plasticFor those folks who complain about the delay, please  read more details about KVM on Wikipedia. This KVM offers great value for money."
2,"Had purchased this product after reading several reviews and seeing that it had decent ratings, sadly the device that I received started giving me some flickering issue with my display, this happened to all the output units that I tested with the device and the seller sadly doesn't have a return policy for the device, so now I am stuck using it only to switch my keyboards between devices and connecting the monitor to my laptop and PC separately."
5,"while I was placing this order I had a doubt if this Switch would work, but having it used for more than a week I am very happy.only issue is a lag of 2-3 seconds , which is absolutely fine for  me.Display clarity is just superb.I have connected this device to Apple( Mac OS) and to Dell laptop( Windows 7 ). saved lot of money and effort is very less to switch between two systems, just press the button...."
5,"Quality is good and it works fine. I am using it to switch between Windos and Linux mint laptop.It minimize the wires, i connected usb wireless mouse and keyboard and no any issues with itSwitching fast and it works perfectly for my use."
5,"Superb and good quality product. Does what it's supposed to do i.e. switch seamlessly between two PCs connected to common monitor, keyboard & mouse. However sometimes you may have to restart a PC so that supported monitor resolutions are correctly displayed. But that is a Windows issue, nothing to do with this KVM. The remote cable could have been sturdier, though. Overall a good buy. Let's see how long it lasts."
5,"I got a original product from the seller and the quality is awesome. supports upto 1920 resolution. it is working as expected. however my macbook not working at full resolution when the lid is open. so i had to close it , to get the good resolution in the monitor."
5,The quality of the product is good. Easy to setup and get it working. Hardly spent 2 minutes for setup. Unfortunately I did not have the male vga to vga cable because of Monitor side and kvm side it‚Äôs female. Once I got the cables it works.
5,Not using the VGA splitter (who is in 2018?) The USB switch works instantly and dependably. The included remote is why I bought this. It allows you to hide the mess of cables out of sight.This hub is expensive but I've bought 2 cheaper hubs and had to throw them away because they were rubbish.
5,It's been more than a month while I'm using it.No issue so far.Not too fast but yes still we can say Quick switch between two servers.I've bees using this daily for both of my servers and I spend daily more than 10 hours a day.So I have very heavy use of it and this device delivers great response.Again Highly Recommended!
5,This is exactly what we were searching for all this while . It makes the transition between the computer and laptop so smooth...all at the click of a button.  No more changing wires and the whole mess and inconvenience of it all. A really useful product for someone using multiple devices with a common CPU.
5,"Very good build quality as compared to others from the same prise range.No blur imaging , no fps drops what so ever , supports max resolution.currently using with Windows and Linux system.Also tried with Dell wireless keyboard mouse combo , work like a charm while switching.Packaging also good as mentioned."
4,"Initially the product was very good image quality was too good on the next monitor but after 2 months of use, picture quality on the next monitor is becoming hazy. Overall its good and value for money"
3,The device is convenient when it works. However the keyboard or the mouse stops working sometimes through the KVM. I have to disconnect the KVM from both the USB power sources to get it to work again.
5,Good performance. Just as in Specification. No issues. No longer in use. I have changed to 4 port -Aten one recently purchased due work requirement.
5,"Good build quality and switches smoothly.I faced an issue when used with extended monitor connected to KVM switch. Switching did not work well, when one of the connectors were not terminated. Floating connectors showed an issue. With this fix, it work like a charm."
5,I like this product. Good build quality. Everything is in place. Package intact and delivery on time.
4,"Great picture quality and smooth switching. The only drawback is its switching lag. It takes 2-3 seconds on average to switch to another source.A bit costly, but overall a good product."
3,"By considering personal User experience I would rate it 3, as you see in the image that the length of the USBs is locked, and it cannot be useful for laptop that have 1 USB ports on both sides (where u may need to use Hub to connect 2 USBs). But it serves the purpose."
5,"Nice, very easy to setup and works very well"
5,"It just works, you don;t need additional equipment other than one mouse keyboard, monitor shared among pc's."
5,Excellent switch.Works even with wireless usb keyboard and mouse combo.
5,It's getting d job done. Not having any problems in the past one month's usage.I'm using a wireless keyboard and mouse with win 10 laptop and ubuntu desktop.
4,The fact that the cables come integrated makes it a breeze to setup and start using the switch. Feels sturdy and of good quality. Slightly pricey though...
5,Wow!!!! Life is so cool after buying this accessory!I can seamlessly switch over between my home PC or my office laptop without having to get up from my chair!
4,Value for money product. However made with desktops in mind. Had to slice open the rubber joint connecting the VGA cable with the USB ones. That joint should‚Äôve been adjustable
5,Very usefull product. It works as mentioned. It was very usefull. I used it to connect one DVR system and one CPU to Same monitor.Works fine
1,Buy from some other seller. Product is good.
5,"Helps in multitasking on different pc with single set of monitor, keyboard and mouse"
5,Best kvm Switch in the market. Good quality materials used. Great finishing.Hassle free and Easy to install.
1,Product not working and they say no return option is available.
2,"Some time working, some time not working, hang problem"
5,Excellent product to use two cpu with one monitor. Switching between pc's are very smooth
5,Nice product working perfectly
5,"Super built quality,compact design and works as expected."
5,Very fast and easy to switch between computers. Very satisfied with this kvm üòÄ
5,Very useful products
4,i bought this product for my office use picture quality is not that good
3,All good except some lagging issues.

5,Keyboard is working fine on my desktop.Worth for money..

4,It's basic keyboard.In this price segment 5 out of 5If you are purchasing for typing practice I don't recommend.For home pc.. normal use.. Go for it.I have given video review on YouTube also...
3,Now using for 5 days and it is ok. But not the best. Many times letters repeat itself. But I am happy since keys are very soft and it is the design which I wanted since I like typing very fast.
5,Good quality for the budget!Does exactly what it needs to do . No fancy features led or anything else. Good plastic and not the best key travel length and there is almost no noise while typing.Great product overall for the price!üëç
5,Ya Sare mi Ke Phone ko support karta hai truth OTG table is very  useful product new Android mobile connect and typing practice this product and all PC supported
4,It's an ok ok product  cant say much in this price... Its Usable Not excellent (kamchalau) if u r professional and type more than 5000 words a day u should go for standard Hp Or Logitech Keyboard... Otherwise it's a good deal for this pricepoint
4,"Good budget friendly keyboard.. works fine..u can type properly on this, I'm using this on my smart phone and works great.. I'll recommend you a costly one if u hv money, because the built quality is not that good"
1,The product is of inferior quality. It pastes the last copied data when i press Shift button. Its of no use now . I wasted my money on this pathetic keyboard.
1,After month stop working
1,i press one key  but automatically press two times
3,Ok
1,Received broken keyword... pathetic service...DO NOT BUY
1,The USB port is kind of flimsy and I needed to unplug and put it back often to get it recognized.
5,Superb Quality Keyboard in this range. I truely loved this one. And the way they sent me packed was honestly excellent. Wonderful Kayboard i took this for my laptop and it works amazing. Also very silent. Just love this product amd the way they packed it. 5on 5 starts
1,"I am giving review after using this for 15 days. For 1 week it works fine, after that it has started problem. Now some key has stopped working, some work after pressing for some time. Now it is completely waste. Such a waste keyboard."
2,Key layout and sizes are a little different than usual. The USB port is kind of flimsy and I needed to unplug and put it back often to get it recognised.
1,Worst Product... If i press a key one time its typing 3 to 4 letters at a single press... The plastic is very weak... It looks like a cardboard
4,Keyboard is comparatively small in size saving space. Easy and soft keys. Very light weight. Though value for money it lacks the look and shine of a new product. Also the packing was quite loose(no outer packing with box).
5,I received my keyboard for warranty claim...Live tech customer support is awesome. Thanks for your support. For rating out of 5/5....
4,"Best budget keyboard, key's are very comfortable, i get it for ‚Çπ199"
1,Not recommended..The keyboard is not working most of the time after hardly 1 month of purchase. I try unplugging & plugging to other ports and sometimes works. They say 1 year warrant but how to claim warranty?
3,Lightweight USB keyboard in affordable budget
4,Good for daily usage. Not recommended for gaming.
4,Good product for this price but off course gives cheap look as well.
3,"Works ok but some keys like backspace and Spacebar most commonly used keystrokes tend to stick , Numerical keypad also has erratic function . Overall ok at the price point."
3,smooth but appears fragile quickly
5,Office use little small and compact
1,Just Worked for 2 weeks...
4,"Basic Keyboard, good value for money"
1,"Bad product, very poor, bakwas..."
5,It's best for who need to learn fast typing because it's something hard.But makes you a fast typer
5,Keyboard button very easy press
1,"Guys, Pls buy some other model keyboard. You have to press certain portion of the key to use it especially keys like enter, back space and space. Not worth for the price."
5,"I bought it just Rs.199, really it's good and value for this price range.."
1,Worst ever thing i got from amazon ryt now worhtless product which is full of defects i wont suggest you all to buy this and hope amazon contacts me for the problems i had faced
4,It's a good product at a given price of 200. Definitely worth purchasing.
4,"Live tech KB01 standard keyboard, maine purane wale model ko Purchasing kiya tha...paar aaya new model.......Its size is small but the product is good."
5,Good budget keyboard for general usage. The only thing that degrading the keyboard is very loose keys. Otherwise it is good.
5,Good one for this price range...wrinkle free wire...nice one...
4,Good product
3,Okay okay productValue for money I can‚Äôt say it s too worst but okay
4,"It is a perfect fit for asus tuf f15,f17,a15 and a17. It also fits well for some of  the rog laptops if they have the same keypad design.The cover isn't exactly transparent, it's more of a translucent type. I bought it since I'd heard that the paint comes off the buttons after excessive use of the laptop (gaming,typing for a long time etc.). It certainly protects the keypad from wear and also from external spillage,dust and other dirt stuff(XD). It is flexible, and they claim it to be washable too. I personally think it's a bit overpriced and that they could've sold it for 200-250 price range. Overall it's a great deal."
5,This is a good product on time delivered and packed well.Perfectly fits on laptop and quick installation.Looks very sturdy and saves laptop from water spill and dust.
5,The Keyboard was excellent fit - Grooves provided for each buttons separately. Quite transparent. No need to remove for typing at all. Will certainly reccommend this product.
5,"The design is great, it's thickness is not much and hence it is very easy to type. A great purchase overall and value for money."
5,Its simply amazing to protect my laptop..for online schooling of my kids this keyboard cover protector is very useful..simple and protective..
5,i really like this cover . it is simple and well comfort . good quality ü§† product.I am fully satisfied with this item
4,Space bar design is little different. Other than that it is a good product
5,Perfect fit for my Asus A17. Highly recommend.
5,"I really like this cover simple ,amazing and protective nice one for my laptop."
4,Good
5,What a amazing precision cut.
4,Good
5,Useful product.  Comfortable in use. Protect keyboard.  Good quality.
4,Perfectly fit over the keyboard of Asus Tuf f15.
5,Perfect fitting for Asus tuf A15 .great product and value for money
1,really nice. Right fit in my laptop's keyboard.
2,Too costly and cheap quality
2,Quality not good compare to price
4,Best keyboard cover for asus tuf a15. A perfect fit for asus tuf a15 laptop. The quality is grt and is much transparent then other products available in the market.
5,Very good qualityPerfect fitWater proofValue for money
5,Good product iball keyboards & mause and thanks amazon
4,Nothing great but works well. Keyboard is a bit clunky but one gets used to it.
5,"i recd before the guaranteed time. ths for amazon,  the product is very nice, i connected the key board n mice to my SAMSUNG lap and it perfectly fits and works amazingly, write this review after 4 days of regular use.. and don't panic with picture (actually amazon/seller will give good and big pics of key board and mice (do not give box pic like this) for this product, i search so many sites and get correct pics and reviews and ordered), its original i ball product and quality one."
4,First product received was defective. Replacement was given in less than 2 days time. New product works good. Quality is average but seems sturdy. Excellent mouse. Good for the price. Paid rs 649 for combo.---update on 22/08/2020---Right click button on mouse has stopped working at times. Keyboard works okay.
1,"Purchased this iBall Keyboard/Mouse Combo during Big Diwali Sale on 17th October 2020, the keyboard was giving was giving trouble since last few days, today it went out of control, doing anything on it's own after pressing any key. Had the opportunity to call I Ball service center regarding this, but was very much disappointed by them, it's a kalank on the name of Service centre first the call takes time to get connected, even after getting connected there is no one at the other end, only silence no one speaks, I called them number of times thinking that someone will answer my calls but was disappointed after calling them more than dozen times. The Service centres also work like this only either the phone numbers given are not working or they just refuse to answer the calls. So beware of these thugs & do not purchase anything from them their after sales service is pathetic."
5,Writing the review after 2 3 weeks of usage.Great item. Value for money.I've used few other keyboard earlier but this one has a attractive design. Keys are really smooth how lack the mechanical clicking sound that a ger generally love but yes really good choice for office or home use.Mouse is a perfect size and feels good when you hold it. Comfortable grip and nice clicking sound and even work on slight uneven surface.Overall. great product.
1,"Defective product delivered. It's not believable that the seller didn't notice the defect before dispatch, keys was broken. It doesn't seem to be caused during transport or shipping either...not at all happy with the seller...the I all products are good, but seller seem to be trying to push out defective items"
5,"Best performance devices, the keys are very smooth and fast and mouse is running well with more sensitivity. Best for gaming and programming."
2,"1 = It's Keyboard button sometime clicks double automatically2 = WORST is it's usb connector cable which we using for connecting to PC, its very cheap quality, sometime its getting disconnected."
3,"Received the product. Packaging was very bad. The box was wrapped with a plastic sheet which was half torn. Not happens with Cloudtail. Key board keys are not that soft, If your previous keyboard is from Logitech then you will find the difference. They makes annoying sound  while typing. If you are thinking of using this for typing or coding then it is a big NO, then please go for high end Logitech. My 5 years old Logitech wireless is much smoother even today than this new one. OK for web surfing or small tasks.  Overall good combo at this price point."
4,"Its a good keyboard in this price range. Keys are spaced well, size is ideal, operations are mostly smooth.Few improvement can be  like reducing Key press sounds, at times few keys get long pressed causing unwanted prints.I have ordered Mouse it and it's Ok. Not great, not bad."
2,"This product only for common use not for heavy users, keys are not smooth at all very noisy sometime keys stuck.Plastic is very poor.When i got this product box was no packed even there was no tapping any where. Seens someone has alredy opened it ."
1,"I was out of town when my cousin received the keyboard delivery.. It was not opened at that time..I can back after a couple of weeks later..and then got time to open the package and check the keyboard.Now Came the ISSUE with the keyboard:The 2,A and Z keys are not working in it..i tried a lot..but still no solution. Fells like a duplicate product.and by the time I opened the package, the return period was already over..so now I don't have much choices left..have to bear the cost of faulty Keyboard..One request to amazon: Please make some system for the sellers so that they can only sell authentic and Original products, not the faulty or duplicate ones.."
5,"Good, strong, comfortable, well designed for gaming, value for money product, light weight."
4,"at first i got the defective piece, it was auto typing, due to this i lost few files because out of no where it will auto click the delete button and after some time it will auto click the enter button. thankfully i recovered all the files.  then i placed an order for replacement and i got it after few days. everything looks good at the time of writing this review. i would say keyboard is good, but the mouse is too small to fit in someone's hand."
5,Good product.Smooth working switch.No issue I have write review after 3 month use.Don't wait go for buy at this price good.Don't waste your money..Buy this cheap product .I am very satisfying to use this product.
1,"I received a defective keyboard.  Few keys did not work.  After I press it hard, then only it will work.  Its been almost 15 days, I have not heard anything on my replacement request.  I have raised another request after 15 days."
4,i am using this product (iball-mouse and keyboard combo) for the past six years.  So only i choosed the same product again.  But this keyboard's keys are more soft to use. And mouse is also working good. Please go for it
5,i Ball keyboard is always my favourite.This is the second time I am purchasing it. First one was used for almost five years without any hurdle until it got spoiled due to accidentally drowned in water.The keys are so soft...... delicate....i wrote my entire thesis with this..Go for it.
1,All the keys of this keyboard works properly except numeric keys zero '0'and ')'..... Will the to press hard this 0 and) keys to get type on screen and it works sometimes good and most of the times you will not get the 0 and) typed on screen...Waste of time to buy this keyboard
5,"Well placed keys, with incline stand. Mouse quality is okayish. Keyboard has good travel and comfortable to type fast. Chord length is also good. Can definitely opt for this combo"
5,Great product at this cost. Got it for 399 RS and I am too happy to have this. Both keyboard and mouse are excellent with no issues. Keys are very soft and there is no noise on typing. Mouse is also very smooth and the clicks are preety smooth. The mouse roller is also good. Overall the product is the best you can get at such low cost. Thank you amazon and the seller for the offer.
2,"Just bought itFirst impression ...A very Cheap and in sturdy productPackaging Very poor , carton was torn at many areasWill give a detailed review post usage."
4,Accha lookSimply Press ButtonMouse PadGreat
3,"My first experience using,- Mouse is excellent. Good grip and response.- Keyboard is average. Keys are too soft & doesn't respond at times as it should. Logitech keyboard I find much better and cheaper than this."
5,"I am thankful, that I brought this very good, awesome."
5,"It is worth the price. The keyboard worked well with my system. Mouse is slightly smaller, but workable.As a replacement keyboard or as an extension, it is recommended."
1,"3 NUMBER KEY NOT PRESSING MOTHERLY AND SOME TIME PRESSING TWO OR THREE TIME THEN TYPE  ALSO WHEN WE PRESSING SIFT AND @  SCREEN SHOW ""  EVERY KEY NOT SMOOTH LIKE I HAVE ONE SAME MODEL KEYBOARD WHICH I PURCHASED SHOP"
3,"print of 'V' key  fade away in a weekalso  sometime there's delay like 20-30 milliseconds while gaming maybe ghosting keys issue for normal use like browsing ,office work etc it's best liked the mouse also"
1,"Defective products are given by the seller. The keys are loose and one of the keyboard keys are missing.  We have not checked the product at the time of delivery but later on, when we opened we found all 3 keyboards are defective."
5,Best keyboard in Rs. 549
4,This is best keyboard for typing speed and useful for improving your typing speed . Most Competitive exam center and typing exam use this kind of keyboard. This key really helpful for who prepare for Government exam  . Mouse also handy to use........
5,All good
3,"Received product WITH OUT Amazon packing.Amazon bill was stuck on the transparent plastic cover, and that was also torn at one end. But product is working. I am currently using the keyboard and mouse now. Seems to be ok."
5,Nice product
5,Good performance
5,Very good. Smooth operates .
5,Combo is good. you can go for it. Awesome smoothness. Delivery on time. 2 months passed. Working very well. Will update after time passes.
1,"Alphabet (O)  key is not working.Wondering how some one can sell a product with out checking properly.I request Amazon to remove "" i ball"" products from its list/store."
4,6 months updatesSome of keys have stopped workingDelivery is good. smoothness of key press is not same as logitech or HP i am using. feels little like typewriter.
3,"Almost the same size as an HP 14"" Notebook's keyboard. Makes a lot more noise upon key press than I'd like, but for the price it is expected. Also, pictures posted by seller show that there is a flap to flatten or elevate the keyboard, but that isn't the case in the actual product (see attached picture). It is non adjustable."
5,"I bought this keyboard 9 months ago for normal usages like ms office, CAD work etc. during travel.But later I realized that this makes very good color combination with my silver color 22"" HP monitor and gives premium look. And this became my regular keyboard. I'm sharing my rating/experience below :First of all let me tell you that, I'm typing this review from the same keyboard :)1. Looks : It looks premium, like apple clone - 7/5  The most I liked was the look of this keyboard2. Build Quality : Decent for the price point - 4/5  Plastic build and keys are little loose, but still quite strong3. Key Press : Very soft hit, and comfortable - 4/5  At beginning I felt little uncomfortable since I was using another keyboard, after using this 2 weeks I started feeling comfortable.4.  Customer Support - 5/5  I returned my first keyboard which I thought was faulty, but it was not, and they arranged the replacement.  Actually I got confused with the numeric pallet implemented on the usual keys.Tips : Don't forget to disable the ""Num Lock"" before using this or else you may also repeat my mistake.I hope this will help other customers.Good Luck :)"
3,pros - product looks nice as in the picture.-  the raise provides some comfort while typing.cons- price marked high during sale(almost 1.5 times) to make the discount offer lucrative.- keys are not so smooth.- the raise is not adjustable as one will assume from the picture provided.
2,"Update after 2 weeks of use:If you're looking to use this keyboard along with a mouse with a USB hub, please avoid this. I have tried this on two different USB hubs and the keyboard doesn't register (Mac/Windows/Linux). It's not worth the price if you want to have a two system set up. The keys are still flimsy but get the job done if you don't spend a lot of hours typing. Buy something better.This is a cheap build with low WPM. I could clock a maxumum of 70 words per minute compared to a 2012 macbook keyboard of 100 words per minute. The keys are hard to push and it takes a while to get used to the small size. Buy this if you need something really compact, cheap and throwable until your next keyboard upgrade. The product also has two images and i got the one with the arrow keys slightly lower than the last row of keys,"
4,Value for money..
1,"The keyboard's keys are so clunky that they just don't get pressed. Most times I am correcting my spellings after typing a word. They make just too much noise and do not capture your press well enough. After having been used to Mac keyboard from quite some time, I needed a compact physical keyboard and this one resembled the size. What a mistake I made! It is made from cheap materials and is fit to be run under a bus for want of better use. Do not purchase this useless piece of plastic."
1,"I was looking forward to receiving this keyboard but was disappointed. There is an issue with the action and some keys were not registering when typing. As a touch typist I was continually coming back to retype various keys which only registered with a hard stroke, which slowed down my typing significantly. So I ended buying another keyboard from Logitech."
5,"I used to use apple's magic keyboard. But after one or two years some keys have always became unusable.  magic keyboard is not cheap thing, and you have to buy the new one if only some of the key became unusable. it is not really reasonable product  so i changed to use this. last few month i have no problem with this product. I am very happy. thank you."
4,"Small, good looking keyboard. Good only if u have space problem. issue with keyboard is typing experience is not good. So if you want a keyboard with heavy usage in typing, this is not going to be comfortable."
1,"As you can check the images closely, seller is posting different images and is not mentioning the dimensions. The best way to bring an end to such ambiguous listings is to avoid buying such products."
5,"Light weight and also value for money &Cute ,chocolate keycaps ,No driver required"
5,Amazing as expected.Light wt.durable keys.Now i dnt miss my damaged apple keyboard.Complete value for money.No damage in product or non functional key.At 550 rs for me it seems complete worth.
5,"The keys are not functioning,,,,,ordered in 14 DEC 2019.It is under 1 year warrenty, how to get it replaced,,,,,,,"
5,"Product is excellent, was a bit confused whether it will work with mac or not.but it worked smoothly without any issuesjust need to configure some keys to work with mac and its done, its working without any issue"
1,"Mine had issuesI have press Fn KEY everytime to use the Alphabet, should be the other way round as u can see in the Video"
5,"Soft press keys, beautiful like apple keys, this is the 2nd purchase of the same product. 1st one bought last Jul-20. Looks and works great. Compact size. Perfect."
4,"Its compact, lightweight and value for money. Feel of the keys is OK. Bit soft and long travel. As the size is small, some keys have to be pressed using a special button. Layout is kind of OK as you may have to get used to it."
2,"Keys are making sound while typing.It is raised keyboard, you can't adjust it to flat position.You can't return it."
5,Super light weight + value for money first class product writing this review with the lapcare keyboard... #just awesome  go ahead and grab a piece for yourself... mini keyoard lover will definately love this product..
1,The light indicators for caps lock are just for show there are no any physical ones.The keys are to delicate once your done typing the keys keeps on types continuesly without even touching.The function key doesnt works at allThe keys plastic quality is very cheap and the letter gets scratched easily.
5,"I really like this from as it's light weight, portable and it's colour. Keys are working nicely with soft touch in the very first day. I hv to check for months to get a real experience on the quality."
5,"It's a sleek keyboard, not too big. Perfect for your tab if you use a USB to Micro USB adapter. Works flawlessly and looks good too."
2,"You have to keep the function key pressed for using regular letter that are on the left side of the keyboard. It is more of a gaming keyboard, not suitable for writing documents because you always have to press the function key, which could be frustrating."
1,"Looks are just fine for the money but, the typing experience is very very poor. Keys feel spongy when you press them. You never feel a proper click on this keyboard. And the worst part is no finger grip on the keys. Fingers slip from the keys when you try  to type even on avg speed."
5,Very impressuve. Feels like an extension of laptop. As keyboard in laptop has defects this is super good.
5,"If you buy you will surely say ""value for money"", its comfortable and very light weighted. I am happy using this product."
4,"Received product today. Same a shown in the pictures. Light weight. Makes sound while typing. But nothing too loud.Connects automatically to the laptop.As of now, i am satisfied with the product."
5,Dont think too much just go for it.Awesome Design and very slim.Easy to carry in your regular Bagpack.Value for money.
5,Very useful. I bought it coz my keys were causing a lot of trouble on my dell laptop. Using this keyboard resolved all issues. Also it's sleek and neat looking.
5,Easy to carry around in the laptop bag. Works with the Apple MacBook Air.
5,Worth Buy.... Too Good... Compact use... üëç
5,I totally love the keyboard. Color is also as shown in the image. The response is awesome. No defects no broken keys. I love it.
3,Its compact. As if now it's ok n working. Less keyboard noise. But the response is few secs late. Please don't compare ever with apple. Its not that sleek design. But very short n handy. Plasticky feel.
4,"could have been much better if separate home and end buttons are given, since they are frequently used."
1,"Trash! None of the keys function as stated, that is what's printed on the keyboard buttons aren't what their functions are, cannot be changed using computer settings either"
5,Happy. Good buy. Comfort of use. Portable. No worry of battery .
4,Nice product. Looks very cute. Wish they should give other color options too
4,Not very bad size is good looks good but build quality not so good
1,First made mind to return..then decided to Keep
5,only the tilde is us type + key. rest are fine works well after two weeks.
5,"A must have accessory if u have a Smart TV at home.....works with all apps in an Android TV.....keys r easy to press...RGB light is awesome... connectivity is good....u get a charging cable ,a BL 5C Li-Ion battery n d receiver dongle.....using it from past 1 day....dont know how long it will run.....will definitely let u all know abt that later......u can go for it!!!"
5,"Very good wireless mini keyboard with full qwerty functions plus extra control keys for further convince. It's very compatible and handy. Can be used on android phone, android tablets and laptops/desktop etc. Very easy to use. Comes with on/off switch and charging micro USB port. Do switch it off when not in use as the battery will be discharged. Overall a good keyboard. Has 3 back lite, green, blue and red."
4,Product paired easily.. No complaint in battery life but the connection does not work sometime and you have to remove the usb and replug it. They could have given a splitter in the box and charged for it.Update after 2 weeks.Added a star as product working fine other than that it sometimes doesn't latch on to the usb switch and one has to remove the usb from the splitter and put it back
1,"This whole lot of mini-keyboards is RUBBISH. This is the third one I bought. And it doesn't work. Even after charging it fully!. I gave it more than a fair try this time. Recharged the battery a couple of times. Rebooted my FireTV (in case the problem was at that end), but no luck. Just like the previous two, this one turned out to be a defective piece, too. In the process, I missed the Return deadline by a day. So, I am stuck with this rubbish (and a couple before that). Of the 5 I've purchased through Amazon, only one has worked so far -an 80% defective rate. Are you willing to take those odds? If you are, good luck to you."
4,"The buttons are actually tactile and not membrane although the led colour is only Red, Green, Blue not full RGB spectrum. The branding on is literally a Viboton sticker. Mouse pad is not a concern it works just fine with plenty of keyboard shortcuts that you will have to try although the print on the mouse click buttons is inverted ( Left click but Right click image on the button ) so keep that in mind"
5,Use it with my desk top computer with various programs. Very useful device as it is also backlit. I also like the small form factor. These machines have different keys for activating backlight. There will be an icon on the function key combined with fn button. It is also very useful in multimedia programs.
5,"This product is a wonderful one. I m totally satisfied that i got my moneys worth from my order. This device can single handedly work as a mouse and a keyboard at once. There is backlit feature with 3 colors as well. Perfect for night usage and perfect for someone who travels and can't take their external keyboard with them. It's handy, smooth, sleek in design and comfortable to use. I would definitely give a 5 star rating as this is cheap and qualitative together. It's easy to use and we only need to plug in the adapter and it works smoothly. The battery has good backup and the auto turn off - turn on feature is a brilliant idea. Totally this product is one of the best item in its prize range. Totally worth it."
3,"The previous one I'd bought was great. But this time, the one that I got is problematic. It stops responding sometimes, and clicks random stuff on the screen automatically. Frustrating. And the backlit option Fn+F2 acts stupid. It stays at a desired color only for a few seconds, but then it does this sick DISCO thing that is so frustrating."
5,"A amazing gadget, awesome battery backup and range when full charged. Gone are the days of 2 different device‚Äôs known as USB keyboarders and mouse. Plug and Use in seconds."
5,The product is really amazing .First received a non active but later seller replaced and made sure that i receive a active product . i am really enjoying the wireless keyboard plus mouse pad in-build. Great quality üëçüèª. Working on my smart tv as well.
4,Product is nice. package quality is also good. Only one problem in this keyboard is you can't connect this with Bluetooth or wifi. Its only work with usb dongle.üôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇ
5,"Thanks Amazon and main help from customers reviews.I have a old Onida Smart TV, 32 inches this is working comfortable with TV.  I have just started using, so far so good."
5,"Awesome, a must have gadget, i use it for my pc which is connected to tv in my room.Backlight is awesome & u can change them like funky, chek youtube how to change colors & has hidden color settings."
3,Use of the keyboard is pretty limited on television. It work while navigating and typing in an app but difficult to shift from one app to another
3,"Product is good,Packing is good also.Small keys drawback.For Smart TV volume is on F9 & F10.Silent mode on F8 & home on F5.No direct function control of volume,pause etc through this Set for Smart TV.If you want to buy for PC,then buy Logitech wireless Keypad and Mouse"
4,"Easy to use keyboard. When u want to change light use fn key + F2 to change. Works with ipad, mac, android and windows pc. Only problem is don't have bluetooth connection it only connects through OTG cable."
5,"Works like a charm on my Sony 65 inch 8500 series , so handy that you can put it in ur jacket pocket in case you want to move around."

1,did not even work on thomson b9 smart tv 40th1000 tried everything i could still no go.
4,"Nice product, very easy to install and start using it.But i am not able to use volume options when connected to TV. It would have been more useful if Smart TV remote syncing is enabled."
3,"Using it with smart tv , it really handy and value for the money.I paid about 600 plus for this"
5,Great product. No problem at all. Works fine with both computer and television.
1,Very poor it stopped working after 5 days now it goes on charging but never charges and it does not turn on. Full waste of money. No way to return or replace now
5,"Best product in budget price, loaded with feature."
5,Bluetooth device is inside of remote near battery location.
5,exactly as in description.. will last long... light in weight.. works well
5,Really Nice üòä best wireless keyboard+ mouse in this price rangeI hv tested it in both Android phone and tv it works fine and also works smoothly in windows 7 üëå10/10
4,Better for helpful for average uses. Requires some practice of usage after that it is easy
1,Very brittle. Within two days it was broken.
3,Overall it is okay.. But once it goes to idle mode.. It takes 10 sec to work properly.. Every time i need to switch it off and on to use properly
4,It's nice using this keyboard it works for computer & android devices as well but it's definitely not usefull if you need to type for long time and for gaming it's better but not the best
4,"The product could've been more transparent , without the backlit display it's kinda inconvenient to see the keys but not that big of a deal, but it does fit my Y -540 perfectly and protects the keyboard . It's water washable so whenever the dirt accumulates one can always wash it"
2,"It fits good,no Impressions on the screen,Clear Print,Good Quality Plastic.but but but............... It's not transparent, My back-lit keyboard becomes a Non-back-lit keyboard.... and it is frustrating... If you don't work at night ... you can buy it unless Buy Clear Protection."
4,Ordered the transparent one.Initial impressions:Fits perfectly (Y540).Good transparency even when the keyboard backlight is off.Little bit expensive.Will edit the review if some problems arise after using for some time.
4,"Thickness is on the thinner side to adjust closing of the lid.... Perfect fit for legion y540 ... Only problem I found is that brightness controls on actual keyboard is on F5 and F6 ... But on this it's on F11,F12. Overall a good product to protect from dust particles."
5,Lenovo legion y540Great material used strong plastic keyboard cover and a Perfect fit .I‚Äôm happy and it‚Äôs done it‚Äôs job well .
5,A perfect fit for my legion Y540 no regrets..  Comes in good packing and has perfect print fitDefinitely a buy
4,Material and concept is good.But the secondary printed keys are mostly wrong
2,Keyboard backlight is been blocked .some of the keys order as changed I'm getting confused to press the correct key after placing this cover
5,Sleek and Easy to use .
5,Nice fit for keyboard and good protection for display..loved it
5,It‚Äôs worth the price the quality of the product is amazing
4,Does what it says!
1,worst
5,Don‚Äôt look at the black prints on the keyboard. It‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt clean the keyboard before placing the cover üòÖ. By the way OP product and very smooth. Just one doubt- can I close my laptop while the cover is on keyboard ?
5,"First things first!This is neither a mechanical nor a gaming keyboard. It is just a normal keyboard with colorful LEDs under the keys. Again they are not back-lit for each key. It is basically difficult to read the letters on the keys.However, I liked it because it is very nice when it comes to typing. It is light. Keys are responsive and very soft to type. The looks are very impressive with the colorful lights underneath keys.Also, I don't blame it for not being mechanical because at this price it would be obviously impractical to manufacture it.So verdict is, Good for home and home-office use. Not for Gaming.Oh! The last thing, I received a faulty one for the first time and requested for replacement. Both Amazon and Seller were prompt and punctual on the replacement."
4,Best KEYBOARD for gaming and light weight
5,"Have always trusted HP, never been disappointed. It's a light weight keyboard with backlighting. Three modes there... lighting, beating, breathing! The Fn key gives you some additional options which are great. The build quality is solid...metal top with good quality plastic keys. The lighting colors are sober and decent, nothing flashy about them. I wish the fonts (type) were a bit more legible. But, overall a great keyboard to buy for all purposes!Pros:Solid build quality.Sober lighting colors.Nothing flashy about it!The keys have a mechanical feel to themCons:The font (type) could have been more legible."
1,The item had many dead keys on arrival. Did not have the manual and other documentation in the box. Item was used and had oily fingerprints and residue on the keys. There was also a sticky substance on under some of the keys. Terrible experienceDo not buy!
1,I gave 4 just because the RGB lights are not that bright.Also if you turn off the RGB lights its hard to see the letter print on the keyboard.However it looks way cool if you make your room to dark.Do remember to buy a Mouse as well to match the keyboard.The grey part of the keyboard gets faded out might take a month or so but this will look bad on the keyboard.After 3 months of use the shift+q keybstopped working. Checked in other laptops as well. Seriously this ticked me off. Being a good brand please dont think of itnas a gaming keyboard.
1,"This is advertised as a 26 key anti-ghosting keyboard which implies that it can register 26 unique keypresses together/simultaneously,which is a pretty important feature  for gaming for obvious reasons.However the keyboard has an issue with anti ghosting, when you press and hold 'W' and 'Left Shift' key, and then try to press 'H' together,the 'H' key press doesn't register.Which is pretty obnoxious cos I've my flash bound to 'H' in CS:GO, so in the scenario where you are shift-walking and want to switch to flash by pressing 'H' while keeping to walk,it won't work.Now I thought it was a problem with the particular piece so I put up a replacement request. But to my surprise the second one had the same exact problem which have now led me to believe it is a design fault.I couldn't find out if the problem came up with other key combinations or not but it is a pretty serious problem for a keyboard advertised as ""gaming keyboard""Other cons:1.the key height is obnoxiously  high making the actuation point so deep that you literally have to press like 1 cm deep to get it to actuate2. the spacing between the keys are too big but that's subjective so you know just saying...Pros:1.the rgb is adequate for the price can you get more bang for your buck in this price range?YES but you know..."
5,"I really comfortable with this keyboard. Their built quality to the performance, it's all good for me.  For gamers, I play fps games like csgo, valo and i find it much comfortable using so it's definitely for gaming.The build is also good so no question about that. For me it's a value for money. Only drawback is the keyboard lighting, i feel it could have been little more sharp as i can't see letter from sideways. Overall good to go."
4,"This HP gaming keyboard has relatively amazing lighting and key caps. I bought this on 2nd June 2020, I am giving this 4/5 stars only because this keyboard is slightly heavier than I anticipated but it does have a sturdy build. The keycaps are well designed so that your fingers will have a good muscle memory while playing intense games. However the space bar in the issue for me because it is slightly rough to press than other keycaps, it is a bit uncomfortable while pressing the space from the corner of the space bar but again it is just 1100/- so we can‚Äôt expect it to be perfect. If you‚Äôre from India and want a non-chinese gaming keyboard in budget then go for it!"
4,"Pros:Sturdy build quality and brand value of HPDependable anti-ghost keysGood key prints, won't get washed in 5-6 years.Anti-Spill proof.Cons:Key strokes never feel like mechanical.Lack of MM keys.RGB functions are limited.Value for money - this keyboard will easily last at least 5-6 years given the build quality. Don't expect too much about the feel as it's still just a membrane keyboard."
4,Compared to other gaming keyboards it feels I little underwelming but for this price it's pretty good. And it looks really great as well. It's also built in pretty good quality. At first I didn't want to buy this cause of the lack of many reviews but I'm glad I did cause I couldn't find any other keyboard in this good quality for such a decent price. If your looking for something at a low price but good enough to get the job done this is probably your best bet.
5,"VFM [Best in class I would say üòâ]You will get 3 lighting effects, you can easily increase/decrease brightness of backlit or turn it off completely.Build ~1. Build Quality is good, sturdy af with no flexesBuilt like a tank I would say2. Even the keyboard elevated stand is made of good quality plastic3. Keys are on the softer side, clicky yet tactile and very easily accessible for large hand users as they are placed at a good distance apart between each other4. Don't worry the volume controls along with play/pause and other functionality is already there as mentioned in the picture of manualCons~ 1. No braided cable nothing else"
1,"Best keyboard at this range, feels tough and keys are smooth and don‚Äôt make much noiseEdit: after just a day i realized i got a used renewed product I should have guessed it after seeing the damage box and fast deliveryReplacement orderedEdit: even the replacement had same issues the W and S keys are broken"
5,It properly justify it's price. You can control it's brightness level. You can also turn off the light but you can't change it's colour. By default it has rgb lighting as the the picture shows you in amazon. You can also put off every single key for cleaning.
5,"I don't normally write reviews unless I really hate a product or love it. This is the latter. I wanted an external keyboard for my laptop for some casual gaming. I wasn't expecting much looking at the price but was pleasantly surprised. Here are the pros and cons:Pros:‚Ä¢ Looks great (even better than it does in pictures)‚Ä¢ Good for casual gaming (cannot comment on eSports)‚Ä¢ Great value for money (compared to the competition- Redragon, Redgear etc in this price range )Cons:‚Ä¢ The letters aren't legible without the backlight (which doesn't matter, as you shouldn't be buying a backlit keyboard if you want to turn off the backlight)‚Ä¢ The space bar is slightly angled towards the front which makes it uncomfortable to use (Easy fix is to use some form of a wrist rest to raise your hand to match the height of the space bar.‚Ä¢ The colour scheme cannot be changed. I initially thought we could change it to a single color but that is not possible. The colour scheme you see in the pictures is what you get. However it does look a lot better in real life. You can change the brightness of the backlight and also change the modes (between beating and breathing) which is pretty good but I prefer the default setting.Note:I don't type too much so I cannot comment on that. For what little I've typed on this keyboard, it's pretty comfortable.I've never used a mechanical keyboard so I can't compare this to one.If you're looking for something that looks good and can be used for casual gaming, look no further."
1,"Ordered the same on 20/07/2020.Sad part is , seven of the keys have stopped working. Some of them are Alphabet N,Comma,Dot, Forward slash,Right arrow,Number lock Zero,Number lock Dot.Didn't expect this from HP.The keyboard is just 52 days old and 7 of its keys have stopped functioning. How can I trust it for 365 days for which company has provided warranty.The keyboard is just used for typing purpose,I wonder, what would have happened if I played games"
5,"For this price range this is the best keyboard u can get .Build and quality looks good .Only issue i felt was , keys make a lot of sound when u press but i think its a common think in low budget gaming keyboard ,anyway on the ones i have used but so far best one is this one.If ur r coming form a normal keyboard , it will take some time to get used to this keyboard .For this price range go for it ."
4,Perfect gaming keyboard with good quality under such a price. But if you know how a mechanical keyboard feels and you expect a mechanical feel from this then that's not possible. But if you have never used a mechanical keyboard then you will definitely like the special feel that this keyboard gives. It has its own unique feel. Rgb lighting is nice and can has 2 lighting modes with brigtness adjust. No woobleing keys.
2,"My review after using for 4 months:If you really want ""kind of RGB"" lighting in your keyboard for nearly 1000 bucks more than a regular keyboard only then you should consider getting this one.# Kind of RGB  - no actual control over the lighting, only the rainbow kind of rgb is there you cant switch to any color of your choice. just 3 options like breathing and control the intensity# Quality: Although it looks like metal and i was impressed in the beginning, later I realised it was some cheap coating on plastic which starts to come off after 3 months (in my case).as you can see in the picture.keys are decent, will get the job done.# My opinion: not worth it, I would recommend investing a bit more and buy real gaming keyboards like Logitech or Razer with or without RGB"
4,"I am stunned by this keyboard its size and the way it's made for use....so slim and metallic body....if you play games like csgo, valorant and more FPS games then keyboard is made for you sure....but games like gta,tomclancys etc playing hours and hours will make you feel discomfort....and it's so less expensive which do the work of gaming ....."
4,"GREAT KEYBOARD FOR PLAYING GAMES LIKE CSGO , GTA V , ETS2 AND MUCH MORETHE FEEDBACK IS GOOD AND ACCURATE , THE CLICKS FEEL JUST KAILH BLUE SWITHCES CLICKY KEYBOARD THE QUALITY IS GREAT THE FRONT SIDE IS MADE OUT OF STEEL WHICH GIVES A  PREMIUM FINISH TO ITUSING THIS KEYBOARD SINCE LAST 15 DAYS MORE THAN HAPPY WITH THE QUALITYMUST BUY FOR 1249 INR"
4,"You can't change the light color. You can however change the lighting mode and brightness. The key press travel is enough for typing enthusiasts. The key face is smaller than expected and mis types happen, but when you get used to it in an hour or so, your hand tends to glide right. I have huge hands. Love the typing experience overall, lighting quality is amazing, but I would've liked a single color option too. Rainbow is a bit too loud for my taste. The key board is quite raised, you may need a wrist support for smaller hands. For gaming it is quite good. Cable is long enough to reach my CPU below the desk."
5,"Now as many others said earlier that this is not a mechanical keyboard, its true, its semi-mechanical. Its tactile feel is good through, with decent enough feedback and still gives that click mechanical sound, even though its not up to that level of performance. I mean come on, Mechanical Keys are the best and you pay for it. But for those who are not into mechanical keyboards but still want its performance to certain extent while gaming, this is a good solution. And for those who say this is not good for gaming, well its their opinion. For me its more than just being decent and I have no complaints on its performance. On the build quality side, there is nothing left to desire much, but its definitely neither too heavy nor too light."
4,"Build quality is just okay not that greatButtons are just okay not that clicky, they are kinda mushy at the lower end.Because of the shape of keys the accuracy is reduced a bitI got it for 799 so for me its for for what I paid.One thing to note, the HP logo only glows when scroll lock is on, don't know it's a problem with my unit or with everyone."
1,"I order HP K500f keyboard but when I received my keyboard I noticed that my keys are different then shown in the pictures and then keys also doesn't have the roundness as shown in pictures so I did some research and I found most of the people who order HP KM300F combo of keyboard and mouse get this keyboard and not as shown in the picture, in KM300F pictures also the keyboard has different fonts on keys and has roundness but still they send keyboard with flat keys and different fonts."
4,"If you work at late nights, this keyboard is best for you. All keys are transparent so light coming through keyboard letters. I am not a pro gamer so I don't know about gaming purpose. You can even control volume/mute by using FN+Function keys.You can increase or decrease brightness hitting FN+PGDN key multiple times and viceversa.Only con is Keyboard doesn't have fixed colour. There is no dedicated keys for Volume up, down and mute."
5,"I love the keyboard's feel - the keys press very smoothly, and the added light is a plus if I‚Äôm working an early morning or late night. I was looking on the keyboard market that lights up so I can see in the dark while typing/gaming. This is exactly what I was looking for, and it is bright. You can turn the lights off and even change the brightness depending on what your preferences are. I turn it to full bright, and it adds some style to my desk."
3,"i like the look and feel of the keyboard. didn't buy this just for gaming.the weight is good enough to make if feel sturdy.the backlighting is subtle and doesn't feel cheap. RGB looks good even when you are not using it for gaming.its worth the money. key travel is just enough. (very less typing sound which i prefer)BUT, i saw that the keyboard box seal was already open (torn) when opened the amazon package.this makes me wonder if they sold me a refurbished unit??as of now the keyboard is fully functional and has no issues. i would have given it 4 or even 5 stars. the only thing stopping me from doing so is that pre opened keyboard box seal. Surprised to see, a seller like Appario retail gave me an open keyboard box where the seal has been tampered with."
4,"I bought this thinking HP is a brand and worth while buying. This keyboard looks great at night. Manufacturing quality is good.Cons:Problem in daylight workking, printings on keyboard you will be unable to see.Said light weight but it's  not it is too heavy.No change in color of Keyboard. The constant theme of light will always be there."
4,Overall experience with the keyboard is satisfactory for a person who uses a laptop keyboard all the time.The keycaps are too high and keyboard itself is high which makes it difficult to reach the function keys.The 'fn' key is placed to the right side of space bar which makes it difficult when we use left most function keys [these keys are mostly used for media controls].The cable is not braided which is a minus.Excluding these reason everything works fine and for typing it is good. The keyboard has aluminium top with plastic back which is great for this price range.
5,I feel just amazing . its quality is superb as this range. I suggest that you can buy without any doubt.What I like:1) keyboard button üîò feel2) keyboard key button view quality both in day and night3) trusted brand4) premium feeling5) easy to clean6) rgb color qualityDislike :1) Cost2) no color options for keyboard body
2,"You'd think how bad can a cheaper keyboard be. You just need a simple keyboard with lights. But apparently there is no minimum standard for low cost stuff any more.Many reviews here speak of the lights and the unreadability. Its also the terribke choice of font that makes it so hard to read. And not only is it a bad font, it also printed badly, giving it that extra cheap skate look. The home key doesn't even look like home, same as many others.In usability, it is just alright, the bare minimum that one could expect in a keyboard."
3,Good product. Build quality is very good. LED lighting works as expected.Used only for personal and office(2 months/Jan/2021). Not used for gaming yet.Keyboard sound is reasonable(All keys except space bar). Only space bar key has 2-3 connected spring and makes spring noise(As if some oil need to be applied to it). Need to figure-out customer support process and get help to fix this. It is slightly uncomfy with space key as it is the most used key!
4,"The lighting feels dull. I don't think it should be called a gaming keyboard. To decrease brightness press fn+page down. I wish to see this keyboard with white backlight instead of funky three color combination. Overall it feels like typing in typewriter because the button height is huge. overall mixed feelings, I guess one needs some time to getting used to."
1,"I had ordered the keyboard which looks nice , but the ‚Äò@‚Äò key is not working properly. When u press it a ‚Äú inverted comma appears. It is a 2nd replacement I guess the whole lot is defective and it should be removed."
4,"For those who think of buying let me be Honest with this. I bought it mainly for typing so there is no issue with the light intensity, it is perfectly comfortable for our eyes and the keyboard is smooth to use, there is a tiny slope in each key which is a good thing. After all it's hp products and for some, the product may be damage it's okay cause it happen sometimes. Return and replace that's the option you got only if you recieved damage products. And i didn't give any rating for gameing since... you know what i mean!! Thank you!!  :) If you appreciate the review do give a thumps up!!"
5,"Buttery Smooth, decent lighting. Bought after lot of research. Mainly bought for using in the night. Video Editing purpose. Very nice quality and serves the purpose. You may find cheaper options but trust HP make/manufacturing. Sturdy and Reliable, not harmful to the eyes in dark. Just perfect"
5,"hh has never disapointed me, as well as this product also did not disapointed me. Very good gaming Keyboard. its the best membrane keyboard, it gives a lovely mechanical feel and has a awsome lighting system with 2 types of breathing modes and the brightness control. In short i have fallen in love with this keyboard  since i am using it.light keys,light wheight, soft keys, symbolick light , breathing modes of the lights are some of the feautures of this keyboard. This keyboard, overall deserves more than 5 stars , i would mark it more than  stars but unfortunately amazon only has a limit of 5 stars.The overall review is lovely,insane,awsome,great, speechless product from hp.  THANK YOU AMAZON & HP"
5,"This is really a good product. Arrived earlier than the delivery date. Good to use. Can play GTA 5 and PUBG Pc . May be , thetyping speed might get reduce because its little hard for typing , but you can manage . Overall , its a 5-Star product from HP."
3,Cons:1. Bad printing on keycaps. Some printing is off-centered (image attached showing G shifted right and shift doesn't have proper font).2. Squeaky sound on pressing spacebar. This is extremely irritating.I am not sure about pros. My laptop keyboard works the same and doesn't have any of the above mentioned issues. Not expected a poor quality from hp.
5,PROS: -Metal frame -anti ghosting - good Rgb lighting with breathing and lightning effects -Although not a mechanical keyboard still gives mechanical feeling and sound -Light weight -Also package was in a very good condition . CONS: The keys are  not visible without led lightning -We cannot customise the led backlightFINAL VERDICT :Keyboard gives an outstanding performance for the money . But for a hardcore gamer not highly recomendable.
5,"This product is amazing I'm reviewing this after unboxing it , I'll continue to update my experience with you guys . worth it. The delivery guy was so cooperative and his helping nature was perfectly balanced."
4,It's Really One Of The Best Keyboard Combo In This Price Range Dpi Button Is Seriously Amazing... Keyboard And Mouse Build Quality Is Litte Low But Still Good... Feeling 100 times better than Normal Keyboard... forward backward button is also very helpful many mods with RGB can't setup with software but mods are more than enough literally we can change every position and color... backlight keys are little transperent so that's why lights are coming from words...that's also very goodOnly con is low build quality and parcel packaging was very bad no Amazon packaging only keyboard box and lable
5,I was not sure whether should I buy it because there are many keyboards like zebronics and ant esport but this looked good and it was a new deal so I took it and I can say now this is the best keyboard you can get at this price range
3,"Cosmic Byte Dragon Fly RGB Aluminium Gaming Keyboard and Mouse Combo !!Keyboard GoodLight effect also good, effects are changeable  use keys (FN key + 1 to 9 key, + PG UP and PG DN, + and - key)Building Materials with Plastic only frame is aluminumwaterproof or not don't know,Mouse Ok But not good, Light weightboth are comes with 1.45 Meter Braided Cable"
3,Overall great budget gaming combo with durable build. But color sprayed on body is not done with precision. This makes a poor impression as you can see in images and it also affect rgb lighting which main usp. Body is aluminum and passed in magnet test. Mouse is big but great with grip and handling. Middle mouse roller should have protruding pattern for enhanced grip. Would recommend for budget conciuos buyers.
5,"Highly recommended for programmers and gamers who are looking for budget gaming keyboard and mouse combo. My typing speed has improved after using this keyboard and I have been using for longer working hours without any problem. It is a well built keyboard, you don't have to worry about the quality. It's a value for money product."
3,"The product is very good and feels like mechanical keyboard,  but I am receiving defective products always. The first time I ordered I had oil stains and keyboard framing out and the next time the caps lock indicator stopped working.This is really disappointing"
5,"7th button of mouse is not working.I have replaced the combo but it still not working üòîI am updating this review,7th button of my mouse started working after reinstalling the software."
4,"The keyboard is very good. The keys are soft, perfect weight, sturdy. However I felt that the mouse is little compromised. The buttons are hard click, especially the scroll wheel button. The weight is more or less okay with good grip design. The RGB effect and DPI levels are something elseüî•.But I am disappointed with the packaging. Packaging was horrible. Literally horrible."
5,Keyboard came with a manufacturer fault then I replaced it and got a good one. It justifies its price. Value for money. Will recommend to budget gamer it feels like a mechanical keyboard and the mouse is pretty good considering it has its own software. Will add more to the review after more months
1,Waste product keyboard doesnt work after while waste product better buy some orther keyboard i replaced it 2 times even tho i got same dagamed products so pls dont waste ur money
5,Nice product. üëç
5,"I bought this product for gaming. It does good job but one problem with the mouse is the RGB lighting will not off even after laptop turned off, you have to remove the usb from laptop to off it. Keyboard is very good, it will give you the experience of  nearly a mechanical keyboard."
4,The lights are awesome except sometimes they don‚Äôt turn on. You need to replug the keyboard in order to make them work. Apart from that it works great and looks beautiful. Keys are soft and fun to type on.
3,the keyboard is epic at this  price point but the mouse you can't move while butterfly clicking I get pain in my hands after 2 hours and you can see my cps me doing butter fly click but while moving the mouse I get 5 cps
5,"Go for it ..best in this segment. The keyboard feels good and comfortable to type on for hours and best for gaming . LEDs are great for the keyboard. As of the mouse , you get the best for this amount with macro settings and 10 led lighting presents."
5,Keyboard is great for the price. Keys are responsive and membrane lights do a pretty good job with look and feel.
4,"It is great value for money.Keys are not standard size/spaced i think. A bit on smaller size, to accommodate space for LED light may be."
5,"Good for PC Players. PC games like Valorant, GTA 5, PUBG, etc. Mouse feels so good. It gives a feel of premium quality when I hold it and I can also feel it's heavyweight compare to otherone."
5,"The packing was awesome,combo was worth it,it sounds like a mechanical keyboard."
2,It doesn't work properly at the startup boot menu the F1 button doesn't work properly and you can't change the way lights work
5,Amazing looks and rgb effect and product is also good
5,"Best gaming keyboard at low budget,with good features, and smooth working keys, value for money, would highly recommend"
5,Good for coding and gamingGlow is brilliant with variety of patternDon't know how to change the dpi of mouse ( if you know pls suggest)Good product to buy.
5,Superb üî•
5,"As a league of legends player, this keyboard was able to withstand my non-stop key smacking. And love the lights. Loved the keyboard and loved the mouse"
5,Mouse and Keyboard Build Quality is So Good and RGB Lights of Mouse and Keyboard Is So Nice I Loved It Buy it Now

5,Best among what other big brands are providing.
5,Nice product
5,Value For Money
4,asha hai tumhara product
3,"I got it @1099 so can't complain about Price. But if you want quality this is not one. It's a regular keyboard with backlight. I received it without proper packaging, so it was broken. Now Let's talk about the keyboardPros: Backlit, changeable keys, good placement of the keys.Cons: Built quality, elevation stand won't tilt the device, it only levels the keyboard. Keyboard is tilted towards front, which is totally design fault. Key strokes are silent as hell, feels almost like touchpad.Now let's talk about Mouse...Pros: feels great, (though it's made of low grade plastic). Have changeable DPI settings, which is somewhat helpful in FPS gaming. Light weight.Cons: Poor built quality, colour changes with DPI only. In low DPI mouse movement is not smooth.Extremely doubtful about the longevity of the product. Pls improve packaging and the built quality."
5,"A fantastic combo. The second I saw this I instantly bought it. There is not other deal better than this, at this price.The keyboard feels sturdy and tough. It doesn't seem cheaply made at all and has a very soft touch to it. I like that, but people who prefer a more clicky keyboard won't like that. The backlighting is great, however, don't expect it to be something that you can use to see the keys at night. The keys are not made to let the light pass through but rather they're solid keys with no light going through. The features are well explained in the manual and they're working just the way they're supposed to. The 19 key anti ghosting is like icing on the cake.Now for the mouse. It's perfect. No better way to describe it. Has six buttons in total and multiple DPI settings. The appearance is gorgeous and really pops out and makes you just sit back and look. It has a breathing effect which can also be applied to the keyboard (Read the manual). The optical accuracy is great for any kind of work.All in all, don't go for anything else unless you're planning on spending more. Buy this if you have a tight budget. Excellent build quality, aesthetics, and durability."
5,"I was searching for a keyboard for regular use, but with back light so that I can work in dark too.All the keyboard and mouse sets are above 2000 which was not my budget. But Cosmic Byte resolved my issue.Key board is amazing. I can work in dark too, but in low light Red color is great to work. Mouse is amazing too. You can easily change the light in keyboard or mouse. Yes it doesn't give rainbow colors but my requirement was to work in dark & this set fulfilled my demand. Keys are very soft. I was using Dell keyboard and these keys are more soft than the dell.Few tips to the company:please add the option to turn off mouse light too. Plus change the font used for Num lock and Caps lock light. Keyboard is amazing but whenever i see that font, i feel the cheap side.Everything else is amazing."
4,"BEFORE BUYING THIS PRODUCT PLZ READ THIS ONCE:  This was the first gaming keyboard i bought in amazon.It had both good and bad things which u should check as soon as u receive this and claim for replacement just in case.1.The description shows that it has adjustable light brightness, even manual says that, but trust me only the corona edition of cosmic byte keyboard has this brightness adjustment, ofcourse the breathing effect works fine.2.It seems to have multimedia keys which can be accessed by pressing FN key+function keys.but this works only on windows 10 and not on windows 7.i havent used in linux but this one is not recommended for linux users.3.In my case me and my friend ordered this same keyboard ,both of us had one common issue, WHENEVER LEFT SHIFT IS PRESSED CTRL KEY ALSO GETS PRESSED SINCE SHIFT KEY IS QUITE BULGED AND FORCES CTRL ALSO TO PRESS. if u buy this ,check this one first, I claimed for replacement .ALL THE KEYS APART THAT WAS QUITE GOOD AND REPLACED ONE DIDNT HAVE THAT PROBLEM.4.Mouse has 4 prebiult dpi settings (800,1200,1600,2400),you can just switch to them with the dpi button next to scroll wheel.5.lights look pretty good when viewed from top angle ,but quite dim when placed while typing and least visible in some keys.6.All keys are quite sturdy and a good quality material ,only thing is all application key in normal keyboard next to the right CTRl is replaced by light button.7.MOUSE HAS MORE COLOURS WHICH CHANGES AUTOMATICALLY AND TRUST ME MOUSE IS AWESOME.8.OVERALL QUALITY AND LOOK OF THE KEYBOARD IS NICE AND MY MARK WOULD BE (7.5/10).GOOD TO BUY THIS ONE FOR BUDGET GAMING PC.9.INCASE IF U FEEL ANY PROBLEM RELACE IT IMMMEDIATELY."
5,Ok... Ok..i was expecting alphabets to be backlit.. but it  was not...  Keyboard is made of good material but..  the mouse looks cheap
3,"The keyboard and mouse are great companion. Easy to use, fun to play games with and a nice attraction to show off due to the LED's. I wish the LED's should have been RGB, there's no Green there. & it would be nice to have a software with the ability to customize the colors, if they a were RGB, we can make use of the combo to create new color and similar ideas.The first product 8 received have non functioning backspace key. So, I took a replacement.The major con is that it only supports windows. & since I'm a full time Linux user, I've to work on Windows just coz of this, I've searches their site & internet for drivers, even source code of other drivers so i could build on it.Then i read the description that it only supports Linux, disappointed but didn't want to return the product, so adjusted."
5,Purchase@830rs and this is the best keyboard and mouse for that value...PROS-1.keyboard quality is very good.....2.rgb brightness is preety good.....3.Mouse is very descent and mouse overall looks and build quality is very nice...4.value for money....CONS-1.wire quality is not that adequate....2. And all buttons are slightly close to each other....so i find that sometimes if you press shift or caps lock then both buttons gets pressed...and i am sure that these will happens to you also....Conclusion-1.i purchase these @830 ruppes so wait for the perfect deal....and these is the best gaming keyboard and mouse from cosmic byte.....If you are thinking to purchase it then go for it.....These keyboard and mouse worth buying!!!!!
3,"1 year usagePros=- Love the price- looks great- budget to membrane keyboard-love the colors- I love the function key next to the light keyCons-Could have more than 3 colors-some keys lose black layer, hence light comes out from there as well- I really need the right click button on keyboard which is where the light key is introducedConclusionI guess at this price - this one is the best one compared to 5000-6000 ones -i use this one dailyMouse:Its good and the reason is the colors - looks great!"
4,"This isn't what I would call a gamer keyboard. Though it has esthetic of a gamer keyboard, the use of membrane keys is not suitable for gaming. If you want a keyboard for gaming, look for mechanical keyboards. Other than this is definitely a very nice keyboard. Key travel is good and the feedback on key press is nice as per membrane key standard. The mouse is also good for regular work but I won't recommend it for gaming.I have a mechanical keyboard and a gaming mouse, but since I am at my native place now-a-days, I purchased this as a temporary keyboard and mouse for work during covid pandemic. Coming from mechanical keyboard it didn't feel nice, but in a week time I got used to it and consider it as a definite upgrade from keyboard on a macbook or any other laptop.This brings me to the last point. Though the description says that the keyboard is only compatible with windows. It works on mac and so I assume it will work on Linux as well."
1,we only use the keyboard approx. 1-2 hours a week and after 3-4 months of buying at least 8-10 keys have stopped working ..... this product is not worth spending any money and therefore i do not suggest this product
2,I replaced it thinking it was a defective product but it was not. you need to press the keys so hard. when you type sometimes the keys are pressed but not registered which is really annoying when you're typing. also the side body is wide and there is less confort. all that i liked about this is lighting. i filed a refund this time and ordering something else.i try to run on games pressing Shift and i should press is hard enough and keep it like that. not comfortable to play games too.
5,"* No issues with the delivery, i received the product in good condition without any scratches or damages.* The built quality of both keyboard & mouse is good. (Not best)* Keys are visible in light & in dark thanks to the backlight. Keys are responsive, comfortable to use. The LED is neither too bright nor too dim. Comes with CAPS LOCK, SCROLL LOCK, NUM. LOCK indicator.* The mouse comes with a total of 6 keys ( RIGHT CLICK, LEFT CLICK, SCROLL BUTTON, DPI BUTTON, BACK BUTTON & FRONT BUTTON) all working good. Comfortable to use. Sensitivity is good.* No issues with the cables or USB connectors.Worth buying for 1.2k"
5,"If you are searching For a gaming keyboard and mouse don‚Äôt buy the transformers keyboard and mouse combo, because that keyboard is of cheap quality and mouse doesn‚Äôt work at all but this (cosmic byte dark keyboard and mouse combo) is the best for gaming and for every day use. I will prefer this combo is best in this price range although the top keys... the function keys are not lightened  up that till that high brightness but are good!"
4,"This combo is perfect and looks good like a gaming keyboard and mouse should. I can change the colors of both mouse and keyboard to red, blue and pink. Both work well but there's one flaw. When i switch the keyboard color to pink the keyboard messes up. It stops functioning properly. I have to disconnect and re connect. Red and blue colors work fine on the keyboard but pink messes it up. Otherwise this combo product is very good."
1,the keyboard and mouse look pretty good the price bit the build quality is just poor. my mouse left click stops working sometimes and now the keyboard wire is broken inside and the keyboard only works if the wire is twisted. It only worked good for 3 months. Its ok as a temporary keyboard but it doesnt last very long
3,"I ordered this product on 11 july 2020 and got it on 13  july 2020. Delivery was very fast and the packaging was also very good. I unboxed this product as soon as it arrived and started using it. The product contained a user manual in which false things are written. It is written that the brightness of the keyboard is adjustable, but it is not. Keyboard was in very good condition. Now lets come to the case of the mouse, it has 4 dpi levels which are only interchangable between 4 only. We r not able to change it to our desired dpi. The mouse center wheel was not working. Now i have ordered a replacement of the ordered and will get by tommorow. The build quality of the product is super. The keyboard is made of high quality plastic and has 3 rgb effects that look awesome at night. The mouse also has rgb rainbow effect and has 6 buttons.This is an honest review and i love this product."
5,"I got a bad keyboard (keys were not registering properly) but got it replaced on the 8th day.The mouse is actually the trump card here, it really mind-boggling to get such a good mouse in a combo.Great Mouse for palm grip users at this price point.The keyboard is good at this price point, the replacement works just as it should."
4,Likes  ::  keyboard is very nice. Good for gaming at night. Illuminated keys. Good paint coating and durable build. Very nice combo for the price. Go for it if u need good keyboardDislikes. ::  Came in pathetic packaging. Mouse is only for name of gaming. Very high lift off distance. Fixed lights. No braided cable. Just OK for casual gaming not fps tho. Also keyboard lights revert to red when u restart pc.  Buy if u need the keyboard. Mouse is just bonus.
2,"This product was preety goodmouse was really amazing the only problem with mouse is we can't change color of it's RGB but it was impressive like all the buttons were working fine.but the keyboard was damaged like it came with kinda internal damage it's was fine from outside but some of it's keys were not working like "" backspace"" , ""capslock"" , ""T"" , and arrow keys were working but not properly so i returned it.here are some pros of keyboardbrightness was adjustablei was able to see all keys in dark ( it's not possible in alot of gaming combos in this price range like Zebronics transformer combo)keys were softif you get it good condition it can be a good choice ( i can't say anything on how long it will last etc.)"
5,I bought this combo because i needed a keyboard and my brother needed a mouse.Keyboard is good 4 out of 5 a little bit compramisition on the quality but that negligible.Mouse- 5out of 5This is the ultimate thing about this combo.Mouse is so good for gamers who play cs:go and valorant.
5,Just bought this product and my review is :At this price range this product is more that you can expect . It is a lovely combo of backlit keyboard and mouse with a mesmerising breathing light effect . You can choose the colour as per your likes and also adjust the brightness of the lights and switch between breathing light mode or still light mode .Key functioning is good and precise . Though it wont give you a feel of mechanical keyboard but it is way too good as compared to normal keyboards . It has multimedia function keys for shortcuts . The wire is quality is standard rubber as in other wired keyboards and mouse . Mouse is also great with 2 extra functionable keys .The only 2 cons in the mouse are :1- you cannot turn off the mouse lights2- when you change the mouse light functionfrom breathing to still the scroll gets locked .Rest the product is amazing and a must buy at such a reasonable price range.
2,"Overall the keyboard is pretty awesome, cool design with 3 different color & breathing color effect but As you can see in the picture I have posted that the ""M"" Key is slightly displaced, due to the malfunction in the placement the ""J"" & ""K"" keys are also disturbed leading to ""key doubling"" or ""key repeating"", I have also posted picture of the key repeating. I am returning it right now. Except for this it's a good product."
4,"Very nice Keyboard and Mouse when I receive it, its packaging is also very well and delivered on time..I got it only @829 Rs, its quality is also very good & heavy. 7 colours light in mouse & in keyboard 3 colours light, Red, Blue & Purple with adjustable brightness and breathing effect. If you're buying for normal gaming, you should go with this. But if you're looking for pro. gaming you have to buy a mechanical keyboard."
4,"Basically the biggest drawback is that it has only 3 color and only 1 effects. I happy that i got this for 800rs in this price range you won't get the gaming combo. Build quality is good ,product which i got had had a faded keys buttons,packing was good ,got onTime . If you want to order then you can buy this product"
1,Keyboard worked fine for a month... after that every now and then it stops working. It will be in use and all of sudden it stops working. I have to reset the cable and reboot the PC for it to start working. Worst Keyboard i have ever used.
4,This gaming keyboard and mouse combo is nice but when we do gaming the mouse stuck for 3 to 4 seconds after every 10 to 15 min and when will shut our computer the keyboard light will be off but the mouse light still will be turned on  how to switch the mouse light off
5,Don't think just buy. If you are looking for a rough use keyboard or a pro keyboard just buy this product. It have soft key and the mouse have 6 buttons which can be used as a joystick like mouse. Of course the back light with 3 variety of colour is awesome. The mouse is just look like a alien spaceship however it is so big and can be handled so easily. Just buy the product.
5,It is working fantastic at first use. Hope it will last for a long term. Color function plus backlit r awesome. Price worthy and must hav product.
3,"It's definitely a good and lucrative option at this price point (1249) but it's not the best combo out there. The keyboard is heavy and looks heavy duty but you might face it shutting down and not working at times if you press the light changing button a lot of times, that said, the mouse is really good, not for people with small hands though, the mouse comes with RGB lighting and it just keeps changing on it's own and there's nothing to be done, you can't change the colour, pattern or even turn it off, so it's kinda disgusting at times !After all that, you can go for it for sure, but maybe all check some more alternatives !"
5,"Pros1.Good looking2.Nice keys3.Good noiseThe only con about this keyboard is that the performance, it's nearly as a standard office keyboard...So if you're buying a gaming keyboard which is good enough to be called a ""Gaming Keyboard"".Wait like a year or two then buy a better gaming keyboard which actually is good enough.At this price this and Ant Esports KM500W are the best options.Thank You"
5,"overall good quality, key movement is smooth and silent, backlit is great , built quality is really good,and mouse is great too.if u are budget tight just go for it.Though never heard about this brand beforeüòÇ I myself having second thoughts but now a satisfied customer."
4,"Good product if you want cheap gaming mouse & keyboard, I don't have any problem with the Keyboard but the mouse is a bit on the heavy side acco. to me, as I play eSports titles, I don't know it might be just my problem that it's heavy for others it can be not heavy, as I used to use lighter mouse. But the quality & finishes of the mouse are good,One more thing to say, it's been ~2 Months I'm using the keyboard & it started to fade the colour of WASD  keys, & ya I don't use its mouse coz it's heavy, so I can't say anything on mouse's usability."
5,For casual gamers this is a great combo right here. Been using it for approx 2 months now and let me tell you it's amazing. The RGB brightness is damn good and it comes in three colours along with breathing effects. The mouse has a dpi changing button and is very much handy. If you are a casual gamer who is looking for keyboard and mouse combo with RGB effects under 2k this right here is a great combo.
5,"The keyboard and mouse look cool and feel good. However sometimes the buttons of the keyboard feel too soft. And there should be buttons for airplane mode,etc."
1,"Mouse was defective, raised request for refund right after opening the package"
1,I bought this mouse a long time ago after i started using it liked it but after like 1 to 2 months the clicks randomly happen when i play fortnite and i randomly fire some time and the keyboard it was awesom till 3 weeks ago now my shift stops working randomly plz if you are a gamer plz plz plz dont buy this buy some thing better.
4,"Its the best out of the lot, specially the keys with lights looks amazing. The only issue i see is with keyboard stops (Hangs) working at times, if the light selection key is pressed multiple times. The only workaround is to unplug & plug the USB cable."
4,"I am facing an issue with the mouse. Sometimes the pointer didn't move until I hit the back button on the mouse. This is happening often. If this is a feature, please tell how to disable it. If it is an issue, I would like a replacement."
2,"At first, the product seemed to be pretty great, with the design, backlight etc. Aesthetically, it's a good build. I started using it and for the first month, everything was working great. But later, my mouse stopped working properly. The clicks were uncertain, where it clicks 2/10 times, very annoying. The keyboard is still working well, but looking at the mouse, i feel the durability is questionable."
4,"This is best value for money keyboard and mouse combo. Really suggested to buy. It has very smooth keys with lesser noise. But mouse may be not like by everyone as it is large and make noise when clicked and the extra buttoms on the side are very bad. If these things dont matter you,then this is made for you.But its delivery is very bad some including me got damaged product."
3,"I got it @1099 so can't complain about Price. But if you want quality this is not one. It's a regular keyboard with backlight. I received it without proper packaging, so it was broken. Now Let's talk about the keyboardPros: Backlit, changeable keys, good placement of the keys.Cons: Built quality, elevation stand won't tilt the device, it only levels the keyboard. Keyboard is tilted towards front, which is totally design fault. Key strokes are silent as hell, feels almost like touchpad.Now let's talk about Mouse...Pros: feels great, (though it's made of low grade plastic). Have changeable DPI settings, which is somewhat helpful in FPS gaming. Light weight.Cons: Poor built quality, colour changes with DPI only. In low DPI mouse movement is not smooth.Extremely doubtful about the longevity of the product. Pls improve packaging and the built quality."
5,"A fantastic combo. The second I saw this I instantly bought it. There is not other deal better than this, at this price.The keyboard feels sturdy and tough. It doesn't seem cheaply made at all and has a very soft touch to it. I like that, but people who prefer a more clicky keyboard won't like that. The backlighting is great, however, don't expect it to be something that you can use to see the keys at night. The keys are not made to let the light pass through but rather they're solid keys with no light going through. The features are well explained in the manual and they're working just the way they're supposed to. The 19 key anti ghosting is like icing on the cake.Now for the mouse. It's perfect. No better way to describe it. Has six buttons in total and multiple DPI settings. The appearance is gorgeous and really pops out and makes you just sit back and look. It has a breathing effect which can also be applied to the keyboard (Read the manual). The optical accuracy is great for any kind of work.All in all, don't go for anything else unless you're planning on spending more. Buy this if you have a tight budget. Excellent build quality, aesthetics, and durability."

1,Keyboard worked fine for a month... after that every now and then it stops working. It will be in use and all of sudden it stops working. I have to reset the cable and reboot the PC for it to start working. Worst Keyboard i have ever used.
4,This gaming keyboard and mouse combo is nice but when we do gaming the mouse stuck for 3 to 4 seconds after every 10 to 15 min and when will shut our computer the keyboard light will be off but the mouse light still will be turned on  how to switch the mouse light off
5,Don't think just buy. If you are looking for a rough use keyboard or a pro keyboard just buy this product. It have soft key and the mouse have 6 buttons which can be used as a joystick like mouse. Of course the back light with 3 variety of colour is awesome. The mouse is just look like a alien spaceship however it is so big and can be handled so easily. Just buy the product.
5,It is working fantastic at first use. Hope it will last for a long term. Color function plus backlit r awesome. Price worthy and must hav product.
3,"It's definitely a good and lucrative option at this price point (1249) but it's not the best combo out there. The keyboard is heavy and looks heavy duty but you might face it shutting down and not working at times if you press the light changing button a lot of times, that said, the mouse is really good, not for people with small hands though, the mouse comes with RGB lighting and it just keeps changing on it's own and there's nothing to be done, you can't change the colour, pattern or even turn it off, so it's kinda disgusting at times !After all that, you can go for it for sure, but maybe all check some more alternatives !"
5,"Pros1.Good looking2.Nice keys3.Good noiseThe only con about this keyboard is that the performance, it's nearly as a standard office keyboard...So if you're buying a gaming keyboard which is good enough to be called a ""Gaming Keyboard"".Wait like a year or two then buy a better gaming keyboard which actually is good enough.At this price this and Ant Esports KM500W are the best options.Thank You"
5,"overall good quality, key movement is smooth and silent, backlit is great , built quality is really good,and mouse is great too.if u are budget tight just go for it.Though never heard about this brand beforeüòÇ I myself having second thoughts but now a satisfied customer."
4,"Good product if you want cheap gaming mouse & keyboard, I don't have any problem with the Keyboard but the mouse is a bit on the heavy side acco. to me, as I play eSports titles, I don't know it might be just my problem that it's heavy for others it can be not heavy, as I used to use lighter mouse. But the quality & finishes of the mouse are good,One more thing to say, it's been ~2 Months I'm using the keyboard & it started to fade the colour of WASD  keys, & ya I don't use its mouse coz it's heavy, so I can't say anything on mouse's usability."
5,For casual gamers this is a great combo right here. Been using it for approx 2 months now and let me tell you it's amazing. The RGB brightness is damn good and it comes in three colours along with breathing effects. The mouse has a dpi changing button and is very much handy. If you are a casual gamer who is looking for keyboard and mouse combo with RGB effects under 2k this right here is a great combo.
5,"The keyboard and mouse look cool and feel good. However sometimes the buttons of the keyboard feel too soft. And there should be buttons for airplane mode,etc."
1,"Mouse was defective, raised request for refund right after opening the package"
1,I bought this mouse a long time ago after i started using it liked it but after like 1 to 2 months the clicks randomly happen when i play fortnite and i randomly fire some time and the keyboard it was awesom till 3 weeks ago now my shift stops working randomly plz if you are a gamer plz plz plz dont buy this buy some thing better.
4,"Its the best out of the lot, specially the keys with lights looks amazing. The only issue i see is with keyboard stops (Hangs) working at times, if the light selection key is pressed multiple times. The only workaround is to unplug & plug the USB cable."
4,"I am facing an issue with the mouse. Sometimes the pointer didn't move until I hit the back button on the mouse. This is happening often. If this is a feature, please tell how to disable it. If it is an issue, I would like a replacement."
2,"At first, the product seemed to be pretty great, with the design, backlight etc. Aesthetically, it's a good build. I started using it and for the first month, everything was working great. But later, my mouse stopped working properly. The clicks were uncertain, where it clicks 2/10 times, very annoying. The keyboard is still working well, but looking at the mouse, i feel the durability is questionable."
4,"This is best value for money keyboard and mouse combo. Really suggested to buy. It has very smooth keys with lesser noise. But mouse may be not like by everyone as it is large and make noise when clicked and the extra buttoms on the side are very bad. If these things dont matter you,then this is made for you.But its delivery is very bad some including me got damaged product."
1,Worst quality product. Don't buy and west ur money. Be aware be safe b b b b b b b
5,"I bought for PREDATOR HALIOS 300 2020 Model (PH 315 52)I Like Most:1. this is super thin and good quality2. doesn't blur or dim the keyboard lighting, see the attached images.3. key alignment to fit ratio is completely perfect. They done a great job here.4. doesn't capture fingerprint or smudges, so display will be safe.Only one cons price should be little bit low.You can definitely go for it."
4,Product is good I bought it for my acer predator triton  300 . Received just now. First impressions were nice. I will update after uses whether it's water resistant and dust resistant.
5,Product is perfect no complaints it fits perfectI cannot Complain about price if the quality is good and it fits but could have been little less in terms of money.
5,"Actually good, but looks like cheap, not so thin, typing experience affected when you type you clearly feel that there is a cover over you keyboard. Price is little high."
5,"Worth a buy, covers keys well and same time does not impact its functionality"
5,Nice Product...üëåüèªüëçüèª
3,"It is actually good and fits perfectly, but too over priced it feels like 100 or 120 rupees cover"
1,"Too much space between keys ,,doesn't fit at all,,wastage of money"
5,Perfect fit for predator helios 300 2020. Bit expensive.
2,Did not fit on my laptop
5,Good product for predator.
5,Fits the keys.
5,Good quality
1,Received used product. It seems product is not genuine Hp product.It happened with twice on Amazon to receive used second hand product.Very disappointed..Never recommended any one to buy from Amazon.
1,If you are really looking for a key board for daily use buy HP-KU-1156 or equivalent. 6HD76AA model is waste of money in my opinion. Also better you buy keyboards directly form shops so that you will know what you are getting. Since there is no return on this item i am thinking of throwing it in dust bin.
4,"The keyboard & mouse set is of good build quality. It matched the online description. The keyboard has great tactile feedback and provides satisfaction while typing. The mouse has good response too, be it the scrolling or clicking, both feels prompt. The price may be a bit higher compared to other brands like Logitech, iBall or Zebronics, but that's just me, nitpicking. Overall the combo is a good deal I could get at ‚Çπ840/-."
4,"Basic set of keyboard and mouse. I got this as my keyboard had stopped working . The keys are a bit noisy and lack the premium feel, as mentioned , this is a basic keyboard with mouse which will suit your basic surfing and office needs, won't be much useful for gaming or rigorous typing work."
2,"The mouse is very light, and, good to use.The keyboard, however, very low quality. The keys are hard. Have to hit and not touch. The cheaper iBall keyboard is better. Bought this because of a discount.  Cost was Rs 649. Gonna keep the mouse, but will buy iBall keyboard."
5,"If you are looking for simple wired keyboard and mouse for your daily office purposes, this product is perfect. The keys of the keyboard are very deep which gives a nice old-school sensation while typing. The mouse is also sturdy and smooth. I wish the keyboard was backlit so I could use it at night with the lights off. But despite that I would say that in the wired category this keyboard mouse pair is the best."
1,The keyboard is very bad. The keys aren't smooth. Spacebar is now behaving like a swing. Have to click in the middle only. A very bad quality product delivered. Doesn't feels like I am using a branded keyboard.
4,Likes :comfortablesleek design of keyboardBoth light weightDislike'Clikkkk' sound when you click on Mouse.you may hear little noise in keys when you press on keyoard.. but not that bad..I would still recommend to buy this as this looks decent and working as expected.
3,Keyboard is super smooth. Awesome keys.  Mouse was ok for few days but  after 15 to 20 days of usage the middle mouse button stopped working.  Keyboard is very good and mouse is waste. Better buy Dell mouse.Better to buy keyboard individually than combo.
5,The product is original and fully functioning. I always prefer the Appario retail private ltd. They are the best among all.
5,"I am using it for last 6 months WFH, the keyboard is very good, the buttons are nice and easy to type. The mouse is easy to use and works great. No complains.Bought from https://amzn.to/3l2h0EG , the service is fast."
4,Thought its a spring keyboard similar to TVS. But its a normal keyboard. Ok for the money spent as combo of mouse and keyboard costs same in the open market as have saved some money for travelling to the computer shop nearby
1,Mouse doesn't navigate smoothly just in couple of weeks of use. The curosr gets stuck at one place and you need to lift and adjust the cursor. Did not expect such horrible quality from HP after paying a decent amount.
5,Nice product. Quality is good. And the keys are smooth of keyboard. And the mouse function is very smooth and clickable is very fast. I refer to others buy this product without any doubt or questions. And one the thing I am not tested for gaming or others to use this product. I using it in my HP Laptop for general uses.
5,Good keyboard and mouse
3,I am using for programming. Some time it loose connection when I typed speedy. easy to handy and best in class.But yes  there  is scope in improvement.  6/10
5,Good quality product. It was having a good longevity and very much comfort to use it. I made this review after one month and my suggestion was that go for it.
1,Keyboard keys are not working. When we press any key it is stuck and going long press. I requested for refund and they tried to send replacement. It's not at all value for money. I will give 0 star. I canceled the replacement and now defect part is with me. I end up buying  new keyboard.
4,Good
5,Both the keyboard and mouse are compatible with my old HP laptop and started working instantly and perfectly with ‚Äòplug & play‚Äô:awesome product and the price is very reasonable. Don‚Äôt know about ‚Äògaming‚Äô
1,This item is very bad it is not as shown in the picture i want to return this item but there is no option for returning this item so please do not buy this key board and mouse combo please help me to return this item
5,They work well. Finish seems slightly poor than I expect from a big brand. Even made me feel it maybe a duplicate product but can‚Äôt tell. Works fine as such.
5,"Keyboard keys are light and pressed effortlessly Nice big sensitive optical mouse. Both wired with enough length of wire. Overall nice buy !! Compatible with laptop, desktop USB 2.0"
2,"This keyboard is giving me issues within a week of use... as soon as i connect it to my HP laptop , the keyboard doesnt work properly... and there is no return on this(my bad i dint notice that)..."
5,"Excellent quality from HP, unremarkable, very comfortable to type and less noise. Overall quality is worth the money."
4,Good
5,"I'm happy because  for it is delivered fast as per mentioned date ,and hp brand awesome both keyboard and mouse are smoothly work .and it's a good deal in this price I'm very happy"
1,A very bad product. frquently disconnects from 4G network. Has to be rebooted every now and then. Cant return as the return period is over and i have thrown out the box. Am stuck with this piece of scrap.
5,nice product
1,"we Received Keyboard with mouse (compo Pack) But mouse Not Working Propperly and damaged , already complainted but still not solved my problem from amazone sideKindle Collect damage product and Return my cash.very bad beheive from Amazone Delivery people"
4,very good plastic material .. nice keyboard & mouse ..Go 4 it .. recommended
5,Very good product.Both are working fine
5,"Came to this after trying a ""gaming"" Ant esports kit. This isn't mechanical like that one, but still significantly more dependable. Just works."
5,Well happy to buy this and good controlling as expected and delivery is also very quick. Good device
4,Good build quality and nice experiences as per its price range.
3,Cheap and low quality products and not comfortable for typing as I expected..
1,It is not properly working so I think about to leave the Amazon's account because it is 2 time item is not in working condition
1,"Damaged product, one key from the keyboard comes out, mouse cade opened and left key is not easy to click,  very hard, it seems some one opened and returned item send to me.Very bad"
5,NICE TYPING EXP AND STRDY FEELING GREAT FOR DAILY OFFICE WORK AND HOME USAGE
5,"For daily use a real value for money, with sheer ergonomics."
4,"I wanted a cost effective keyboard for my second computer and did not want to spend much on a fancy keyboard.At less than 500 bucks this keyboard is a value buy. The keyboard is sturdy, the keys feel is good, does not make much noise. The ergonomics is kinda OK, when you use the flip stand to change /increase the tilt of the keyboard.The special media keys all work with the additional pressing of the 'Fn' key, which might not be pleasing to people who see a lot of multi-media in their computer. The Sleep button is missing in the keyboard, which could have been a useful addition."
1,"Build quality is below average, the body was bent and kept moving while typing, had to stick something below to stop this.The keyboard stopped working after 2 months, it gets on when I plug it in but the keys aren't responsive at all.Not sturdy enough to last a long time, would not recommend it."
3,This product is slim and compact. It is a wired product with usb connectivity. Due to its compactness keys are arranged closer. Definitely you will hear a lot of sound of keys while pressing and releasing if you are in a silent meeting or con call. ' I think' a bit pricey for the product.
4,"First of all it is Made in China, which doesn't shown in product description. The quality is good, design is beautiful and typing is better with this."
5,"I have been using this keyboard for past two or three months, I liked the quality of the keyboard. The keys are strong and sturdy. Typing is butter smooth. Just go ahead and buy this product."
1,Poor quality or damaged product. Some of the keys not working. Disappointed with the product. Delivery was on time
2,"Not chiclet style keyboard, takes too much pressure to type. Is tacky and shaky. The key travel is deeeep..like you need to positively pound the keys for it to work."
5,"Its a chiklet style keyboard, they keys give descent feedback, overall good enough for basic use."
5,"Very smooth n slim Checlet PC keyboard, it's value for money, but ‚Çπkey don't work/pre-installed.If you require please download this softwares from other sources."
5,Easy to use. Buttons are great with proper space. Value for Money product.

4,Gud one
5,"Cool product, functional and stands out. There aren't many reviews of it but that's the catch. It's the one no one is telling you about.A great buy."
1,I am talking generally about this product.. All products from Cosmic Byte are useless.. This keyboard is my second one and it got spoilt within a month without doing anything.. I used it to play some small games which does not need spamming of keys.. When I connnected it back to my PC after a week it wasn't working.. None of the keys work.. Only the lights come on.. I tried askinn for the warranty  and no one from their Customer Service Respond.. If you want to experience anny of the above Non-Sense which happened to me then you can have a look at the keyboard.. If not say 'NO' to all Cosmic Byte Products!!
5,Very good build quality... Same as description... Fast and safe delivery ... Well packed from seller ... Easy to install .. working well for me ... Using from last 10 days .. satisfied... üëçüëçüëç
5,"I have bought this in Feb 2018. So, it's a long term review. Things I've noticed so far are the keys have a lot of travel than a normal mechanical keyboard, backlighting has only 2 modes: Normal and breathing effects. Well designed for gaming and durability is really good as body of the keyboard is made of metal. Keyboard keeps my palm cool even after using it for hours. The only cons I've come across are color damage on keys and metal parts, dust accumulation under keys, but you can clean them easily. Overall, I'm much satisfied with this product and would suggest it as best value for money gaming keyboard."
2,"The build quality of the keyboard is fine as it has a metal plate on the top so there is minimal or no deck flex. The lighting is fine. The colors can't be changed but the brightness can be increased or decreased and there is also a breathing effect. For the people who want these qualities it's a good keyboard. BUT...... if you want literally anything else the one I got was not at all good. The keys are very mushy and it does not feel good to type on. The actuation force on the keys are uneven, it takes a lot of force to start pressing the key but the rest of the key's travel requires no force at all which is very annoying if you type a lot or game. Then there is the spacebar, Oh.. The Spacebar...it's just bad. The spacebar is so heavy that it requires no activation force to press and the key struggles to bring it up. The spacebar bounces back if you slam it but if press it gently like normal people it gets stuck to the chassis of the keyboard. This is VERY annoying if you use the keyboard at all because the spacebar gets stuck and you have to pull it up to use it again (this issue of the spacebar getting stuck maybe exclusive to my particular unit, but however the actuation force is non-existent on the spacebar). So consider whether the spacebar issue is important for before you buy this product, I game a lot and use the spacebar very much so it is an instant deal-breaker for me, and if you game I suggest you stay away from this keyboard. But if you are buying it for casual use go for it."
1,"Update after 1m: Key smoothness was already a problem and now in just a month the wasd key started losing its colour.I regret buying this.If you are gamer then don't buy it. My redgear keyboard worth Rs.999 is much better than this Rs.1099 keyboardSometimes i type for giving a quick msg to my teammate so that they could aware of the situation but this keyboard make me raze. The key stuck most of the time like 90% and so it doesn't press easily and you lost your typing rythem!The key WASD sometimes stuck which gives a free kill to your opponent when you try quick peek in games like csgo, valorant. I don't recommend you this at all.I'm reviewing after 1 month of approximate uses,so the product might look good at first view but sooner you will lose that moving/typing pace. Goodluck, rest is upto you."
5,"At the very beginning I wanted to return it but it can only be replaced, sad. Its good keyboard, durable but I thought it's not built for gaming or casual use because of the way the keys were designed, they are not flat or symmetrical. but... it was my fault not being able to adapt the design, after struggling for 2 -3 days I was able to adapt the key design and I'm able to use it without any problems. still the design of ctrl and shift button makes no sense as while gaming you have to immediately switch between ctrl to shift but the way these two keys are made completely opposite angles that it's annoying. Maybe need more practice but instead of learning how to use a keyboard the designers should have focused on how friendly it looks for gamers... looks and design don't matter, they should be simple as possible, just add RGB in any mechanical keyboard and it's gaming keyboard üëç (sarcasm)"
4,"Good Keyboard for beginners and casual gamers. I have used it for over 1.5 years and  I don't have any issues with this keyboard. Must buy if you are looking for a cheap keyboard.This is not a mechanical keyboard.UPDATE: I have used it for 3 years, working fine, just S and D keycaps lettering are faded because I used to game a lot and I keep on pressing S and D keys. I still recommend this keyboard."
3,"It is a good keyboard except one issue - The spacebar key. It requires 3 times force to press it compared to other keys when you press it at the ends of the spacebar. If you press it at the center, it works fine, but I press it at the ends with my thumb, thus it becomes impossible to type because for every space, I would have to press with three times the force, thus destroying the flow of the typing. Due to this one flaw, I had to return it as it made it unusable to me.Another minor issue is the big cosmic byte logo right above the arrow keys. You would think it is something written on the keyboard, but no, it is a plastic component with height same as a pressed key. This makes it annoying when you press the up arrow key and it hits your fingers. Please don't put such huge logos on an otherwise good keyboard.The keyboard build quality is excellent. It is metal, and keys have a nice feel to it. The lighting is also excellent. I don't know why they made these two issues with otherwise a very good keyboard. I bought it because my friend had a two year old cosmicbyte keyboard which was excellent and had none of these issues, and that was the only reason I choce a cosmicbyte keyboard, and now they have these issues..."
5,The metal floor makes it look really premium..and the lightning also looks great..it‚Äôs the best keyboard for this price
4,First of all the keyboard is very sturdy. It's backplate us made up of aluminium. This keyboard is a membrane keyboard not a mechanical one. If you plan on typing with this don't buy ut. It is strictly for gaming. Typing experience was not good. I gave it a 4 star because I am gamer and the backlighting was also good . Because typing was up to the mark it would have been a 5 star.
1,"I got this item as I was looking for a budget gaming keyboard and it looked pretty while marketed itself as having anti ghosting keys. I got the first item, tested it and I got disappointed as the space key one pressed remained so and didn't pop back. I couldn't get the refund and ordered exchange and got it within 2 days. To my shock the exchanged one has exact same issue. Now, I have no choice but to settle with it. Neither I have time not patience to replace again. Disappointing product."
3,Packaging review:The packing was so poor that it didn't even had the bubble wrapping around it or anything to protect the product from external damage and from the pictures you can figure out that the product box itself was sticked using several tapes as it was torn from corners and middle. No so good service from seller himself.Product review:This keyboard is not for the people who like fast typing andlike to have fast response from the key pressing. You can buy this product for the price and features it offers but its not for everyone. You have to press keys little bit harder and right in the center which is not convenient while fast typing nor for gaming at certain extent. Don't buy this product just because it offers aluminium body which is not even how the keyboard should be described because it doesn't have aluminium body but only the upper part of keyboard if made out of aluminium and rest of the keyboard is still plastic which is also not of good quality.They plastic key caps looks paints after assembling the keyboard as they have shadow paint marks on them.Overall this keyboard is good for the price but you can get even better keyboard at this price point in the market.
3,The keys itself are good and the backlit RGB are super bright. The paint work on the left palm rest peeled off after a couple of weeks since the material is built from an aluminium body. I advise you to buy another keyboard with a plastic body if you're a heavy gamer that constantly rests his left hand on the keyboard.
5,"I am not a gamer so i cant tell you about the gaming abilities of the keyboard.. but it has sevral controls.About the visibility in the dark the keyboard works well, very well lit keys. You can easily type without any light in the room.Sturdiness: The built qualiity is very nice. Keys are housed very well in the aluminum frame.Key pressing is also very satisfying. And the cable is also very durable. Loved the product.Only draw back is that it came without mouse."
1,After few days (15-20) it stopped functioning
1,"I honestly liked its sturdiness and ordered. Problem is None of the keys get pressed.  Bang it... one... twice , thrice. It just does not get pressed. Mind you , I like hard things, and I am not a soft typing guy. I peck keys once at a time and I type hard. May be, Hard luck for me in this piece, and I am rating my piece at this level.  May be... Maybe there are other good pieces. God bless"
5,I was wishing for a metal body .. the plastic is thin on the borders... Keyboard performance is best according to the pricing of the product...the cable is long and braided so that there won't be working problem.... And yes please can you (cosmic byte) give another mode for the lights as fade or colour change.. as it gets boring after some time. Key quality is good...
5,"Very durable, sturdy, assuring key press with subtle quietness. I had bought another membrane keyboard from amazon but this is cheaper, sleeker, very very cool to use. Just buy it. The only con is there are no single color lighting. The multicolor stays on or off,  but is never a deal-breaker. Just buy it."
4,The key board is good. But you only get two effects in it simple and breathing. It will take time to get use to this keyboard. For gaming it a nice keyboard but for business and sturdyness I would prefer you the corona model of this keyboard. It is aluminum build around the keyboard but if it falls from your hand and something else I think it will break as it is not so strong. And the keys are removable so cleaning is not a problem. BTW it is a nice keyboard but I would recommend you to go with corona model as it is much more better than this on the difference of 100 rs. Thanks
5,Awesome keyboard... with a premium look.Keys are so soft and some particular keys have different sounds ...But there is an issu on my keyboard...Space key is too loose. Often it doesn't move up after press .... I think i have to put an extra Spring to it ...
2,I would not recommend this keyboard.. After 1 n half months the keys started becoming hard like literally we have to press the button hard then it would work.. I thought it might be defective but my friend also brought the same model  and he is facing same problem... Besides this the keyboard is great
5,"It is very good as I'm a beginner right now and I asked my pro friend about it but he said "" It still is very good but for beginner. I don't quite like it"". He alway suggests me things that makes me better an he said he woul recommend it for gaming for beginners"
3,Keyboard i got at first was good but it had few keys on which there was very low lighting so i went for replacing it. But the keyboard i got after replacement has even more dim lights and more keys where there is no lighting in it. Product is good for usage but my only issue is with this defect in backlight.
2,Well that's not what I expected from cosmic byte man worst products right now first I ordered cb gk 02 which came defective so I wanted to replace but there was no option so I returned it and then I ordered cb gk 05 and I am using it from past 7 days and I haven't even used it 10 hours and the space bar is already getting stuck not what I expected from cosmic byte üò¢ü§¨üò†üò°
1,"This keyboard has a decent build quality but is not made of aluminium. It's iron with a silver paint and then a black paint over it. Once the edges start rusting, they're sharp and can injure you. The keys aren't the best either. The anti-ghosting is only valid for 3 keys at once. Space, shift and enter key wears off very quickly and this should not be the case considering it's advertised as a 'gaming keyboard'."
5,"It's not a mechanical keyboard. Let me put this out here first. However, it's somewhat like a hybrid and it gives you the feel of a mechanical keyboard. Looks great, quite sturdy, lights are good. Ideal for long usage. Keys are hard at first, however they soften up after some time. Last point, it's made in China, in case anyone wants to know."
1,"Packing was not good and coming to the keyboard backspace, zero in num pad, and the num pad enter keys doesn't have the stablider rods . Its so annoying to type especially while pressing the backspace its doesn't go smoothly . Don't waste your money. ""Go for other keyboards or for some extra 800-1000 bucks u can get a machanical keyboard don't do the same  mistake I did"". Hope this helps others ."
1,Totally bad Don't but it + key is not working it is stickingAnd colour can't be changedKey are hardI didn't gor warranty cardBox wass damagedAnd in user manualSomething is written from pen totally bad product
4,It was amazing and it looks great in the dark the keys are quite hard to type with so id suggest to only buy for gaming and not other purposes when you would need to type a lot. It works extremely great while gaming there is no other problem and all the keys work.
5,quality wise 5/5Keys sensitivity 5/5Led backlight brightness 4/5Price 4.6/5Overall good product only disappointed with LED brightness it should have more brightness for better display
5,"Great keyboard to ha e for the price, especially as a back up for ur laptop. Helps a lot for gaming. Would recommend 100% those who are laptop owners. And looking for a budget keyboard."
2,Its switches are very hard they don't click when I want them to click. but a steady keyboard. It was good at the start but gradually it started to show its true RGB colours. It's good for breaking someone's head because it's very hard *ie keys and body. Good weapons for self-defence best for women in offices to hit their creepy co-workers can be sold for women safety.
3,"Pros:Sturdy keyboard.Good backlit keyboard in easy priceSilent keyboardCons:Will not recommend for Typing. Keys are becoming hard with usage.IF keys are not pressed in center, it will be too hard to press keys.Enter key is not proper. It looks its a Europian layout."
1,Umm.... no. Don't buy it. The keys get stuck all the time unless you use precise angle to hit them. A keyboards first function is to be able to type correctly but all the keys keep getting stuck.
5,Excellent budget gaming keyboard. Just fabulous.You can see the difference between normal keyboard & this gaming keyboard.Game tested with this keyboard nonstop playing :Dota 2 [5 hours]Valorant [2 hours]COD warzone [3 hours]No problem found. Just buy it‚ù§Ô∏è
4,Cosmic byte keyboard is very nice looks very nice colors at night time
5,"This is a great keyboard not only for gaming, but also for any other purpose. It looks cool, and is very sturdy. A definite buy!"
5,I have never used a gaming keyboard before.. This one in reality looks more sexy and the buttons.. the touch.. its great.. Braided cable.. Wht else would you ask for 1k keyboard... Its perfect for gaming and normal use.. Just go with it
4,"Looks good. Body is aluminium so kind of sturdy.Rgb can be at three modes- constant rgb on, breathing rgb, off.Can adjust brightness of the light.Looks like a mechanical keyboard but, it is not mechanical, that the only minus point.Overall good product."
1,"keys got stuck and too hard to press specially spacebar , and many more keys. i will suggest you guys to never buy this scrap. its the worst keyboard only rgb lighting is good other wise a 500 rupess keyboard is much better than this. never go for this product. i am also returing it"
5,"For what I paid I got more than I asked for.This keyboard gives you virtually full keyboard and mouse control from your fingertips and is still light weight.Battery life is good, been using it for 8 hours with back-light before needed a recharge.Has a cool back light with choice of 3 colors and a secret hidden additional 3 more color mode with automatic color spectrum changing.Has a nice grip like feel at the bottom.Body is good sturdy plastic.The only negative thing which might not be sooooo negative for some is that the back-light is very bight as it can be seen under normal room lighting. So when it comes to a dimly light room it is quite bright and might not be so comfortable to your eyes."
5,An essential product for andriod boxes (bought 3)....easy to use....comes with back vibgyor lighting......battery life is awesome works for 5-6 on a single charge with back light off.....overall an excellent product...PRESS FN KEY+ F2 TO ACTIVATE BACK LIGHTNING
4,"I've been using this keyboard for just a couple a days now, but I'm thoroughly enjoying the experience so far.I use it on my SMART TV. The original TV remote does not have a keyboard and hence is kinda annoying.Thanks to this device, surfing on the TV has made it so much easier and less time consuming."
1,"Stopped working after 3 weeks.1. It's a great product, I found it very useful.Unfortunately it stopped working.2. My laptop mouse stopped working after i started using this. Now even this device stopped working"
4,"Worth every penny spent! A perfect companion to my Raspberry Pi.Pros:1. LONG Battery Life (The last time I charged it was probably a month back, and I've been using it regularly)2. Backlight Function looks cool3. Has shortcuts for RMB,LMB, Mute etc...quite useful4. Can be charged via Micro-USB( also has a removable battery)CONS:This is the most irritating part about the product1. The AUTOSLEEP function, if you don't use the keyboard for like 30 seconds, it goes into sleep mode and you have to click a button to get out and start using it normally..there seems to be no way to adjust the minimum time before going into sleep and is a hassle when using it at intervals.2. Not a con but once you lose the receiver there's no way to connect to the keyboard.(i.e normal blutooth connections don't work with it("
3,1. Its not a Gamepad. Dont think that you can play those games you always wanted. Most of the games require a Game Pad which is kind of Joystick.2. Battery - Its the old samsung feature phone type battery. So dont use it till its hot. It may burst.3. Buttons - small but very good. Can be reached with ease.4. Good feature - its has a small mouse pad in the middle. You can right click and left click and also hover around and drag too. Just like a mouse.All in all its a good low priced bluetooth keyboard. Makes work easier from a distance.But please note that its NOT A GAMEPAD or JOYSTICK.
4,"I didnt expect much from this product while placing the order. I just wanted something to make easy access to my laptop, tv. I did some google search and found this product. Here is what made me happy for this product.- I have wireless keyboard and mouse but its not that easy to access from anywhere. No need to carry separate keyboard and mouse, its has qwerty keyboard with multifunctional touchpad.-Size of This product, its really handy. I can carry this in my pocket.-Battery life is amazing.-Just plug and play with bluetooth connector. No extra drivers required.-It has tri color backlight. Red Green and Blue, so no need to worry in night. Automatically it went to sleep mode which saves the battery.- Price is not much. 650rsThis keyboard ia really amazing product, you can connect it to your tv, laptop and Firestick as well.Though it is a chinese product but no other brand manufactured like this product so Im not sure about its life.It is made with plastic, you may feel it cheap quality product but believe many time it fell down from my hands while seating on chair but still its working fine.Im giving 4 star, 1 star less for the poor build quality. Otherwise this is really useful product."
4,"Good product , useful and better than bulky keyboard and mouse. Light weight , easy to use. Quality is decent. Scroll and left mouse click need improvement at it get accidently pushed because of both the function provided in touch pad. Mouse click need to be completely removed from touch pad toavoid such difficulty in selecting wrong functions. Overall good product , value for money. Works perfectly fine from 20 feet distance."
5,Very nice keyboard. Connect immediately the moment you switch it on. Mouse works flawlessly. The only problem is that qwerty keyboard is not in its traditional spacing between the keys and its sizes. If you observe the picture of the keyboard closely and traditional desktop keyboard key spacing arrangement you will understand. But that's ok. All mini keyboards on Amazon have the same problem. Will get used to it through practicing. Rest it's amazing product. Good battery life did not charging even single time after purchase. Usable everywhere. To the seller thank you keep up the good work.
1,"The box within the package was not sealed. The li battery does not work and the slot for AAA battery does not have any connectors. Hence the product does not work at all. Highly disappointed. My experience on amazon during this lockdown period has not been good, this is my third return due to defective product being supplied."
1,"Battery life is poor, really bad I would say. There is a reason why we say cordless or wireless. The connection is not stable. I really wish the seller replaces the item with a better one."
4,"Product is good for general purpose where keyboard and mouse usage is not exhaustive. I use this to just browse and play movies and is very convenient.Manual said it supports two types of power inputsa)  in built Li battery the one we see in old samsung and nokia phonesb) AAA battery mode.Option b) is not supported on the item I received. Battery slot is available but the connecting plate to the circuit board was missing, the flat one for +ve and spring one for -ve which battery touches.Apart from this no issues."
5,This one is truly a gem... a must have for your Android TV...!!!! I love it trulyyy :)Some people says it's battery life is 4-5 hours only but i had left it ON for the entire night for 12+ hrs still it's working perfectly without any issues!!!! :)Might b they have a bad battery or they are playing games with it... Firrrr to 4-5 hrs bhi jyada hain...üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
5,"Shipped early and packed well.Small sizeEasy to connect (worked on windows, Linux and Android phone (Mi Note4) without any problems)Keys are very responsive and have a nice rubberised feel.Rechargeable batteryBacklight works and love the colours (more than 3 since RGB combinations are possible)Indicator lights to notify about Charing, RF status and connection status.Many possible uses with multifunctional buttons.ConsMouse trackpad is a bit small but sensitivity settings can compensate for thatBack plastic seems very very cheapBattery seems to be very small capacity (will update about battery life after 1 month)"
5,"I was looking for a portable keyboard for using with my laptop and smart TV. while researching i came across this product, ordered it to try and boy i was surprised with the functionalities and its features.1. It has backlighting which is very good to be used in dark. also its RGB mode is awesome, my son loved the lighting on the keyboard2. can be used with laptop, PC and Smart TV. I tried with all and really made a difference in searching for titles on Netflix and Prime from earlier when i had to painfully scroll through each letter individually3. the buttons are good enough for daily usage and provide feedback when pressed, for me it was really comfortable4. Battery life is good enough- on one charge it ran for 3 days with intermittent usage where i used it as a keyboard for my laptop too.5. wireless- this is the best, its very portable, fits in my palm, can be used handheld and is wireless. Just plug in its receiver and you are good to go. you can type from couch, i tested till a distance of 10 ft from my tv and it was working fine6. Sleep mode- this is best as it conserves battery very well. As soon as the keyboard is not in use for about 10 seconds, it goes to sleep conserving battery, and when you need it again,  just pick it up and start typing and it will start working again. Really well thought out feature.All in all its a complete package if you want a portable handheld keyboard for your daily usage. Just keep in mind that its not a gamepad for playing games, buy a separate gamepad for it"
4,"Baught at 600 bucks. Keyboard and mouse works with YouTube, Though it is not working for Amazon primeVideos, therefore rated 4*, otherwise 5*. Attached to MI Android box. If attached the Blue tooth dongle directly to box then internet speed (only for tv) is drastically reduced (even sd mode shows buffering intermittently), then attached usb hub to mi box and attached usb dongle to usb hub, now internet issue is resolved, even fhd shows are running smoothly without any buffer with my 10 Mbps speed internet.Itbis just two days i am using it. Will update after couple of months babout durability of product."
5,"Pro's:SizeBattery lifeBacklit keyboardCompatibility and simple to no setup requiredCon's:Sound when keys are pressedFew keys are printed different while the actual keystroke is for something elseOverall a very practical & cheap alternative for costly Bluetooth wireless keyboards.Don't expect it to perform upto Logitech K830 levels, you get what you pay for.Battery life is very good and no mess of replacing batteries as it has built-in battery (Nokia 5C) and can be charged via Micro USB port"
4,"The first thing that struck me is the size. it is so small, it fits in the palm of your hand. Connected directly to my Android box. Replaced the regular size keyboard and mouse and remote that I was using. Takes a little getting used to. For key backlighting you have to press Fn and F2 keys. Slide two fingers up/down to scroll. Press any button to wake up from auto sleep mode. Need to keep it covered so it does not gather dust."
5,"I am dissatisfied with the seller for sending a used product as a new product !! There's dust inside the battery compartment, the labels on the keys are worn out and the battery terminals have eroded .......For now the device works ok, needs hard press of buttons but I have paid for a new product and not a refurbished product. Will apply for return as I don't know when this used device will fail in the near future...Update (10/05/2021):- After applying for a replacement, got a new one in two days. Pictures attached. The seller this time sent a new one and the packaging also includes the charging cable and warranty card. The device is working good. Have updated my rating from 2 to 5 star."
5,Already have a similar mini Keyboard and touchpad. Only difference is that this one has brighter LED backlight. Also this LED comes with three colours RGB plus one cycling mode. Love the cyclic colour mode. The colour cycle mode starts after some left / right swipe on touchpad.Battery lasts 3-4 days (compared to 2 weeks for my previous one). It's keys are sillicon. It's a must have remote like mini-keyboard plus touchpad. It works on PC & my projector too. Basically bought it for using in night / dark. Love this device.
1,"Got a defective item the first time I ordered, so I had to replace it. The replacement didn't even switch ON.Not a good experience for me with this seller. Received Bad Product Twice. Waste of time, excitement gone down.Will order from other seller."
4,A must buy product or may be we can call it a accessorie. Must have for a Android TV.I bought this on for my Android TV with a doubt on connectivity.But when after inserting the USB receiver provided with the keyboard to the USB slot of the TV it atomatically connected without any driver.Typing and scrolling becomes very easy with this.Buying a airmouse and a keyboard combo was also an option but that was too small where spacing between the keys was a issue.I liked the product.Came with a pre-installed BL -5C battery that used to come with Nokia phones.Charging cable not provided by the seller.
1,"I ordered this product on 30th October 2020 and received on 8th October 2020. As mentioned in the product description, we switched on the device and we were expecting the product to work with light blinking on the device. To our surprise there was no response from the device. We thought that the battery has been drained, so we charged and tried again. But it seems like the device is total dead. We tried to do a replacement, but again we got surprised. Replacement is not available and we had to return the product.I paid for this product, waited for 8 days and we were in an assumption that this could be an useful one. Unfortunately it was not working and we had to return the product."
1,"This is too small like size of a mobile.It did not resolved my issues. Also you can't refund you are forced to replace.Please think before purchase twice.If it comes back to me I may give away to small kid as toy as it is not useful. Because it is going to increase my work, reduce speed and performance.Size what you see are confusing."
4,"Its as described. With RGB led looks very good in dark. Sometimes hang if you on light in between . start the led first and then operate. Many youtube video available for change rgb spectrum. Works fine in mobile with otg, good with desktop and even works well in android tv and android tv box too. Works like air miuce remote control. Battery works okay, old nokia battery and can be replaced and also works with two AAA batteries ."
1,Ya the product has a BL 5C old nokia phones Battery...It doesn't fit right worked for few days and it is not charging...There is a no AAA battery option....Money wasted.........Why do you people sell products like these and Amazon supports them....
5,The first thing is the size.....it remind my first nokia phone which becomes keyboard after opening flap.Second thing is no more battery replacement for keyboard........battery which you can charge....Third thing is back lights.........too goodLet's see how durable it will be in coming time.............but overall it is really good product
4,"Really loved it using for my home theater system and apple mac mini computer.My Sony bravia tv control is a breeze much better than a remote. You can switch on and off the Tv, do navigation, all mouse operations and typing.Used it for my apple computer. There was a initial message regarding compatibility. However started working after that. One star less due to built quality and plastic. However for the price it is ok."
5,"Awesome. I ordered this device for reading on laptop from a distance. The best thing is, this has a mouse cursor pad, I can do everything from this keyboard on my laptop. This has replaced my need to sit near my laptop and read.This keyboard is especially easy to use for people who are habitual to mobile keyboards."
5,Amazing product.. Totally loving it..Best keyboardCan be carried in travel..Just loving it so much.. It has colour changing led lights....Super fast responsive..I am so impressed by the performance
5,"When I received, I was a bit disappointed as I couldn't find the bluetooth dongle. I aaplied for replacement. Suddenly I thought why not open the battery side and check. Oh god, it was hidden there. I cancelled my replacement. It works like a charm. I am using it on my VU Android tv. Battery life is excellent."
5,"I loved it.. ordered after thorough reading of reviews of this and other products. Earlier ordered a wireless keyboard and mouse combo and cancelled them after ordering this. Very handy and compact. full functions with keyboard and mouse combo, so u don't need to maintain separate pieces like keyboard and mouse combo.Pros:-handy-compact-multi functional-backlit-smooth trackpad-choice of left and right button mouse on the keyboard-Economical/comes at low cost when compared to wireless keyboard and mouse comboCons:-BL-5C battery (Con only bcoz of availability-normally not available in local market like AA batteries)-Nothing elseFully satisfied and full paisa vasool...JUST GO FOR IT BLIDNLY.."
5,"I have been using this with my android TV, phone and laptop for a few months now. The only issue is the battery life which has deteriorated in the last couple of months. Plan to replace the battery soon.  But otherwise a good product. Makes typing and searching for stuff in the TV so easy. (The remote takes ages to type). A power button for the TV could have been handy. If you've bought this, do look for the secret function of having multi-color lit keyboard (search online - you will find it)"
4,"I have been using this product from past 1 month and below is my review.Cons1. Battery is loose but can be tightened with paper so doesn't matter much2. Power button is loose but it's manageablePros1. Easy to use and button quality is good2. Backlit helps you to operate it in dark3. Mouse pad is also good and works perfectly, you just need some time to get habituated to it's sensitivity.4. Additional function buttons are there which makes your task easy.My opinion is go for it as it's a very good product."
4,"A very good piece of gadget, especially when you want to use your laptop from a distance. The response is slightly lags with distance, but is manageable. Backlights are irritating but thankfully can be turned off or changed to a different colour among - R, G or B. Battery life seems to be adequate, have used it for 4hrs straight and it help on. Works on some Mobile phones too"
3,Im going to list the pros and consPros1. Works perfectly as described. No issues at all. Juts connected it to my TCL smart television and it worked instantly2. Extremely lightCons1. I received an opened package.2. The charging cable that they provide is really small (barely 7 inches). So you will require a separate cable ans charger (since charger is not provided)
2,"Please read till end. Don't buy it (not serve your purpose), find something else. I made a mistake , I returned it , thankfully Amazon took it back returned money. That's why I trust Amazon so muchIt's actually 1/4th size of 1/2th of normal computer keyboard. (Your palm size, imagine how small buttons will be)*Image is misleading.*You think it's big enough but in reality size is as I mentioned. *Key buttoms make tap sound everytime when pressed(not like your tv remote buttons)* Mouse touchpad is rough and too small.(u have to slide fingers many times) Don't think it will be same as smooth Laptop mousepad"
1,Don't buy this product......... I received damaged product....... The description and box of the product shows its having back-lit led but its not working
2,Battery life 5 days or more and very easy to use i m using this wireless keyboard & mouse combo its really much helpful more the old keyboard and mouse wired trouble and sitting front of pc or lapy or mobile this wireless combo keyboard n mouse give us freedom of joy. But the negative point is its cheap material body and small area mouse pad.
5,The first keyboard I received was faulty. I was not able to connect to amazon firestick. I returned it. Amazon arranged the replacement in a week time. Prompt service. The new keyboard is connected to amazon firestick. My son is able to play games with wireless keyboard now.
5,Good product. Let's check life by using.
3,"Received the product today and it works as advertised with no problem and the memory foam provides a good support for the wrists.3 Stars only because of the stupid packaging like can't you just put both of them in a long cardboard box instead of a box one (like rectangle box cost more than square ones even though they have the same volume). The keyboard pad is folded in the middle and the folded center is an eye sore. just make sure that future products are packaged without damaging the product. I mean what actually goes through your head when packing this , I mean people pay a lot of money for this product and you guys screwed by the packaging."
2,"I don't know on what basis people rated this high.  The quality of material is poor, its not gel for sure. There is no ample support for wrist and causing pain also just using after 5 minutes.Caution- there is no return on this one. Wish i realised it before ordering."
4,"For gaming I'm sure it will be good. I used it for intense post prod, and it really helped get rid of the pain on my wrists.It's ergonomically great.. it has a decent thickness of memory foam.. can't go wrong there.Durability seems to be good too so far. It's been a few months only. But the material used over it seems durable even through the moisture.All together it's a great product.. slightly on the steeper side. But I think you pay for quality."
2,"looking at the images, i ordered as i was having tennis elbow and this was the fastest i was able to get post ordred. Now, having used this for close to 1 week, i can say, thought it does its job, it should have been bit thick. I already have one good quality pad in my office and i have been using it for close to 14yrs and this does not come any close to it."
2,Product is good but I am returning it twice as the amazon packing is not good at all. Two times the product is damaged due to packing. It was folded when I received the product and at the folded part its pasting from the rubber board went off.
3,"Good quality, but bit pricey for the quality. The design is not always functional, Unless your elbow is in the level of the desk. And if you keep moving your hand all the time when you use it, you have to keeping adjusting its position. Nothing wrong about the product, I personally don't think this type of wrist pad is effective."
1,It seems like a decent rest for other keyboards. But this is not for slim keyboards like the Magic Keyboard.Seller should mention it somewhere since it is a non returnable product.
5,"Hi , whoever is reading this, know that the product is superior in quality and if you are a gamer or a workaholic like myself. I know we have wrist pains and also arm pains as well.This product takes care of it."
1,"The order which was sent to me was not ‚Äúbrand new‚Äù. The wrist support for the mouse was also missing from the combo. The keyboard support was just okay, nothing special."
2,"It worne out 3rd, not a good quality. I think the life span will be around 3 to 4 months max. I have to stick it by self and use it further."
5,The material is just amazing. Very comfortable but i tad bit expensive for a piece of spong. Comes back to it's original shape after use but i wonder for how long.
5,Does the job well
3,"Product is good, packaging is terrible."
5,"Awesome product, my hands are in a comfortable position now...."
5,Simple but powerful enough
3,Its not worth the price
5,"Good Product, nice support for wrist but before buying please look you have a Laptop with full keyboard or the wrist support for keyboard is waste"
5,I want to do bulk buying. How can I get sellers detail.
5,Very useful and high quality material. I believe everyone who is working for long hours in front of desk should use this as support to you hand ergonomics. Usually without using the cushions and if the keyboard and mouse do not such ergonomic arrangements it will cause the joints pain at the wrists. To avoid that and keep the wrist straight we should have some cushion for both the devices. This product gives me a great relief from that pain and maintains my ergonomics. It's premium made and value for money and highly recommended.
5,"This is such a nice product. I was skeptical choosing the green colour, but it turned out to be even better than the pictures. I am using it with my Macbook Pro and connecting it was seamless. Mac will ask your help to setup this keyboard and once done, you can use it like a normal keyboard. The Windows button on this keyboard will be mapped to the Command key of the mac.In terms of design & aesthetics, it's just stunning. The keystrokes are lovely, there is good enough sound (not too loud) and the overall experience is very good. I type a lot and it doesn't hurt my hands after long typing sessions. You can remove the keys and clean them. It's a beautiful mech keyboard. If you want something different which will not be primarily for gaming, this is your thing. The mouse is good as well, nothing special though.Overall, highly recommend."
5,"I ordered this keyboard because I was in great need of one. It‚Äôs pretty cute and the colours fit perfectly with each other. The green colour scheme coupled with a few white ones make the mechanical key caps pop! It‚Äôs very satisfying to type on and if you‚Äôre looking for a mechanical keyboard with a spunky colour scheme as well as an aesthetic piece of hardware for your computer, go for it. This is the cheapest keyboard (of great quality) available on the market today and I loved this product so much that I simply had to write a review. It‚Äôs a one time investment that‚Äôll last seemingly forever if you look after it and works on batteries which are replaceable.GO FOR IT!!"
5,"I've wanted a fancy mechanical keyboard for so long. This one works just fine. The keys sound amazing. The colors are so pretty in real. The photos couldn't do justice. I actually wanted blue & green versions of this keyboard too but settled on this one cuz they look like yummy candies. Enough about the looks, this actually works pretty well. The mouse is perfectly sized and snug in your hands. It was a bit fast in the start but then I adjusted the settings in my laptop now it works just like how I wanted it to. The keys are a bit closely set together but you'll eventually get used to it. I mean this is my third day and (I write a hell lot of essays) I'm already used to it. I play a decent amount of RPG games too and I love using this keyboard for light gaming. One suggestion I have for the manufacturers is about the indicator lights.  They are placed on the slope of the rounded edge of the keyboard and I can't really sometimes see if the caps lock is on or not. But that's just a minor issue. Really love this product and highly recommend it. If i find anything I don't like about it in the future I will update the review.p.s forgive my lq grainy pics."
5,Satisfied is an understatement for this keyboard. It hits the mechanical type satisfaction to a 100%
1,"Hi,Here I will try to type my feedback with this keyboard, with my regular typing speed. You may guess how busy the keys are in the keyboard.Very cluttered, here is the typing without correcting them:I was impress witgh the desigbn abd thought it could be a very good kjeytboard for mne, but aftewr getting it, I am trying to type with my regular spoeed anbd you can judge ghow vbad the key arrangements are in this keyboiard.The same pareagraph if I type with my old keytbopard, I will not have these many mistakes for suyre. as the keys are well arranfged there.overall, not happy with the keyboard. also overpriced.Thanks,"
1,"Ohh..my...godd.. looking at the previous reviews and all, I thought it'd be great to own this keyboard, but in all honesty, it looks like something an 11 yr old kid would own. It's just not suited to anything I can imagine owning.Secondly, it doesn't fit the Mac environment. The keys for volume controls don't work, and the brightness settings are set on num lock and the next key.I could recommend this to people who like owning candy themed accessories, that they hardly use. For everyone else, I'd strongly recommend against this purchase."
5,"I love the keyboard! The quality is great and looks very aesthetic. The sound of the keys is veryy satisfying and I definately recomment buying it! Was delivered within 2 days which was really quick! And it is worth the cost. By looking at the photos I thought that the keyboard and mouse would be a little smaller in size but its perfect! And also I faced this problem so here is a little tip - There will be a Protective film on all the batteries so remove that and there will also be a film on the mouse on the white part (Look in the photo) remove that film its very thin so might be hard to remove. It might prevent you from smoothly run the cursor so removing that helps. And yes, Batteries ARE included!"
4,"If you're planning to buy this considering it has mechanical keys type , then it's strict no no . Otherwise the product looks good in terms of appearance. The letters are printed without proper alignment. It's a little bulky-feel keyboard with thick round edges. Overall It does justice to the retro keyboard style."
5,Excellent colours and amazing typing experience
4,"It's a nice looking keyboard with good build quality. One issue is since it has round keys as compared to square that we are generally accustomed of, it takes time to adjust and very often it leads to mistypes.Mouse is also quite ergonomic and respond nicely on any surface"
4,"I have been using them 2-3 dats max and believe me i am impressed with their looks , functionality. Operating with this keyboard/mouse combo is not problematic. It is very easy to get them setup ising the nano receiver within the mouse . All in all nice product but yes price can be a little less ."
4,Look wise it's a beauty. It's truly a novelty item. You will take some time to operate it as comfortable as your old keyboard. Function wise there is a room for improvement. Missing the mechanical sound experience. Mouse is bit big in size which makes it less convenient.
5,~Its produces sound which is relaxing and looks exactly as shown in the picture...connects to usb port dongle given in the mouse's battery section~using it for a month now no issues faced!~nice alternative for those very costly typewriter keyboards and is aesthetic looking!
5,"We all remember the old school key boards and mouse. This feels exactly the same. Both the keyboard and mouse are good. No lags detected so far. I use it for office purpose. If you're looking for gaming , this isn't for you."
5,"I was very skeptical about buying this product but it‚Äôs one of my best purchases. I was very confused between the pink and the green, n I‚Äôm glad I choose the green. It‚Äôs very soothing on the eye compared to the to pink one. It‚Äôs worth buying if u want to feel the nostalgia of typewriters."
1,"Contrary to the positive reviews which led me to try this out, keyboard is not comfortable to type on. I spend > 8hrs a day typing/coding. The fingers don't rest comfortably and it's difficult to type fast. I'm using a Thinkpad T460s and I'm back to it's keyboard."
5,"On time delivery, key board is same as expected,colour is also same as display in picture, use keyboard sice 1 months,no problem till the date,keys are very smooth and typing noise is osum. Mouse also looks good,works smooth and hold in Pam perfectly... overall happy with performance ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
4,"Nice, feels like type writer.Work efficiently.Mouse is super cute.Sounds like a normal keyboard typewriter type.But overall super cute.Not for gaming"
5,I bought this Product for personal use and office use for my huawei t5 tab and the quality plus delivery service and packaging was great. As the product got delivered today so this is my review for now. After 1month of usage I'll share my experience too
1,few keys are not working. please help to get it replace. i bought it on 2 may 2021 from amazon.
4,Cute design..works well!!
2,"The keys are placed very close to each other, found this extremely difficult to type on"
5,Both keyboard and mouse are great. The look is also great.
4,Good quality. Exactly same as shown in pictures.
4,Aesthetic looks..works fine but my upper most keywords are not working...
5,Very very good. Working as expected.
4,Good built in awesome colour really love it üòä
5,If you haven't used it than you hane seen nothing
4,Good Quality product. Easy to use
4,"Pretty cute! Love the light build, doesn't give too much of a plasticy feel, even the mouse is really nice to hold and the clacky sounds are just gorgeous! Like ASMR while working, it's so satisfying to work on! Only problem is it'll take a while to adjust to. The keys are closer together so I end up pressing the wrong ones or two at once. It's gonna take a while, but it'll be good practice. Overall it's worth it!"
5,"This is great entry level mechanical keyboard.This keyboard has blue mechanical switch from Chinese manufacturer not cherry MX but still its nice. it has nice clicky sound. Gamers and typist gonna love it. This is not actual RGB keyboard. It has rainbow lighting you can change lighting Mods but color on every line is fixed like from top to bottom 1-Blue, 2-Red, 3-Orange, 4-Green, 5-Purple, 6-White.i attached video with all lighting mods.and some images this is how keyboard look at night."
5,"The keyboard is amazing for this price point,You know the good part, ill tell you about the bad part of this keyboardI am updating this after 4 month of heavy usage and gaming! (28/11/2019)1-some people might find lack of stabilizer in keys as a issue2-Only top plate is aluminum, BUT KEYBOARD IS STILL 0.98KG3-Jixian switches are soldered to the pcb, but at this price its ok4-Lacks in built memory , so you have to reset lighting again and again once you turn it off.5-Aluminium plate can pick some scratches if not handled carefully6- MOST IMPORTANT the cable being not braided can be issue for some7-The user manual has a lot of mistakes and has wrong features written , i mailed cosmic byte to confirm , they denied any such features mentioned.8- Ok,after usage i realized, that the key puller is real flimsy, please take good care to avoid any such damages.I got this keyboard for under 1900/- so, wait for the right time and buy it at cheaper rates, because if you are willing to spend above 2k rupees, the Zebronics max pro would be a better option.However at this price point. the keyboards build quality is amazing, I am using it right now to type this review!So buy it when you get a good price or buy a combo  if possible."
4,"I've been using this keyboard for past 2 days and typing feels amazing, mechanical keyboard feels great, the soft tactile key presses and feedback is so satisfying. The only problem I faced so far is the lighting pattern. On this keyboard the lighting pattern tends to reset every time when I turn on my PC. It is very annoying and I hope Cosmic Byte does something to fix this problem, and also I don't find any drivers for this keyboard.I bought it for Rs 1745 and for this price i think its a steal.Edit :- I've contacted CB for the above problem and the solution is to keep pressing ""FN + ESC"" for 10 secs and it works,also their customer service is very helpful and very prompt. 10/10 for overall experience."
3,"Update: I wrote to Cosmic support and they asked for a video to show the problem. I did and they suggested two things which didn't work. They replaced the keyboard with a new one as they stated that the problem was no fixable. This seems to be working fine at this time (received it 10 minutes back). I upgraded my rating to 3 from 1 because they have very good aggressive support and take lot of pain to ensure that the issue is resolved.----Few additional points:- Suddenly the W key stopped working. I had to press very hard for it to work sometimes.Update on 26th November: It has almost completely stopped functioning.  I have enclosed a video showing the issue.- Sometimes this keyboard is garbling output or dropping some keys when I am typing too fast.- Overall this keyboard is not giving me what I expected from a mechanical keyboard.Earlier review (still valid):The single biggest issue is that they used a strange font for keys which is hard to read. The B looks like 13 for instance!I had to look for several seconds just to guess the @ key. There was absolutely no reason for adventurism with key fonts! To add to the misery they used strange words as opposed to sticking to what we are comfortable with and found in 99.9% of the keyboards.Till date, I don't know how to set scroll lock!I don't see much value for rainbow colors or even the multiple disco lighting modes (for lack of a better word) in the keyboard. It serves no purpose and just an annoyance.Use of acronyms like WASD in the documentation is another bummer.The keys could use more brightness.For for the pros, the keyboard is solid and has nice keys."
5,"This is the only mechanical keyboard that is being sold at this price range(1.7k). It is my first mechanical keyboard. If you haven't tried any mechanical keyboard yet & want to buy a mechanical keyboard then at this price this is a steal. I GOT IT FOR Rs.1649 & it was a steal. the keys feel soft but they have a tactile feel when they activate, also responsive, the backlighting is the cherry on top. but one thing is the font used in the keycap i don't like it maybe you do or do not that a personal preference & i'm also being nit-picky about it. Value for money!EDIT: [11/09/19] have been using it about a month & it's still fine. Also i discovered some new stuff pressing fn+1,2,3,4,5,6 changes it to pre configured lighting. try it yourself (not the numpad 123456 tho)EDIT 2: [06/01/2020] HAPPY NEW YEAR if you are reading this.Now this keyboard has been serving me well no issues what so ever!"
2,"- If you're a Mac user like me and do a lot of coding/typing then please don't buy this as there is no driver from the vendor and out of the box driver is very flakey.- The media keys are not supported as well on a Mac- Sometimes, some keys don't respond, so you will definitely miss lot of key strokes- No inbuilt memory to remember the rainbow lighting setting so everytime you disconnect everything reset to factory defaultAll in all don't buy this if you use Mac, for linux and Windows for basic testing everything just works (full testing pending yet)"
1,"You might think that their is a lot to be happy about just because a mechanical keyboard is cheap,BUT trust me their is NOTHING to be happy about, it's just one of those Chinese products which flash in people's eyes so that they buy and regret later . So lets talk about this keyboardDurability - WORST i noticed a slight input lag on day 1 and some keys delayed in registering , thought I was trippin at first or perhaps it would go over time, but it got worse over time.  Should have returned it on day 1(BAD EFFIN LUCK) , just in 3 months the keyboard is at the point where most of the keys wont register or double register. Even my membrane keyboard worked absolutely fine for 5 years,  just the rubber membranes went bad.Anti-ghosting: just a fluke, sometimes multiple key presses wont register.Wire- fine, unbraidedKey caps-fineSwitches - fine as expectedBody- metal, heavy, somehow has a cheap feel to itLighting- Not rgb, just backlit, awful predetermined key lighting which gets reset after every shutdown.Circuit- i guess the keyboard's main circuit is the problem it might be that's it build quality is poor or cosmic byte is clueless how to make a keyboard chip.I would suggest to save a little more and go with zebronics max pro, or a premium branded one if you could afford it. Coz if the keys don't register their is no point to any other feature.I regret not saving and buying this!"
4,"Don't be taken back by the reference images which make the keyboard look orders of magnitude uglier than it is. The keyboard looks okay and the typeface could definitely be improved. After all, keyboards are made to be touched, not looked at. Speaking of touches, the Outemu Browns aren't that crispy-tactile and the keys are a bit wobbly, though that doesn't deter a programmer from using this. At this price, the keyboard is worth every penny, given I'm migrating from a Logitech K380 membrane keyboard which was more expensive, had interference issues, key failures and sometimes typed by itself like it was posessed (and no, I never brought so much as a drop of water close to it). The keycaps are decent and I opened up the machine to see a beautiful circuit with very good soldering. The lack of non-volatile lighting memory is kinda annoying. After all, you need about five bits of storage and any decent microcontroller has a non-volatile store these days - meaning the manufacturer deliberately downgraded the software here to sell a pricier keyboard. I might desolder the backlight LEDs and forget that one. All to say, it'd be a fool's act to go for much pricier keyboards when they offer only slight improvements over this. The journey's only begun and I'll update in case anything relevant happens."
5,"""If you like this review please press that helpful button""Review :---------Its a Good entry level mechanical keyboard. The swiches are blue so it have that satisfying click sound. Previously i had a TVS Gold barath keyboard which came with cherry blue swiches compared to those the swiches are not as good. But cosidering the fact that the TVS  no longer comes with cherry & the cheapest  cherry switch keybord cost over 4000rs this feels like a great buy for a fraction of money.  BTW i brought this for around 1600rs during amazon shopping festival.I would say its a must buy if you are still using membrane gaming keyboards. Mechanical ones last much longer and feels way better to type on.The major con i found on this keyboard is its lighting. There are some funky lighting patterns but there is no option to keep the backlighting to a single color. We can adjust the intensity of light and can use some predefined lighting patterns. I wish there was an option to keep all the backlighting to a single collor preferably blue or white.Overall i completely recommend this keyboard if you can get this under 2000"
1,Pathetic product! Keys not working properly just within a month. Pressing them repeatedly misses every 4-5th click. What should i do now? Watch the video attached.
3,"I liked its tactical feedback anti-ghosting functions, 6 color lights and different patterns of lights but its a bit heavy and the keys are raised a bit more that can attract dust particles more and more inside it. bought it for 1749 on Amazon but available for 49 rs less on its official website for only rs 1699. overall good mechanical keyboard at its price. fast delivery by Amazon. I don't like Amazon's policy of removing negative reviews."
5,"This keyboard is pretty solid, you will need a bit of time to get used to this design. But once you do you will be greateful for making this purchase.The click feel and the sound emitted when you click it is satisfying. Highly recommend this for not just a gamer but also a typing enthusiastic like me."
1,Considering the price it's one of the cheapest mechanical keyboard available on the market buy it has some flaws. I am a programmer and gamer(mostly csgo) and this keyboard has disappointed me. I have some problems(One of them is weird).1. Sometimes some keys dont register while typing and also gaming which is not acceptable.2. My laptop goes into a bootloop if I try to boot while this keyboard is connected.... weird3. Keys are tactile and loud but the feel and actuation point is not great but for the price its acceptable.
5,"I have regularly used HP/Dell Wireless keyboards and wanted to switch to mechanical keyboard.I do casual gaming and lot of coding.This keyboard is compact and may take some time to get used to, but the typing speed is great for me with good tactile feedback.I have taken the brown switch version- I have checked by removing some keys, and it uses Outemu Brown switches.The sound is not as loud as blue switches (I am comparing with some videos I saw on Outemu blues). But if you smash the keys hard, they do make good sound.The keyboard panel is made of aluminium, cold to touch and the build quality seems excellent. Far better from all the plastic keyboard I have used. There is gold plated USB connector which seems will last long without rusting.I have checked all the keys and it is working fine. I will update the review after few weeks on my experience.The led lightings and effects are ok. I do not prefer the effects and keep all LEDs on. Though there are around 10 patterns if you prefer.ALSO, this I discovered late, there are more patterns if you press Fn+1, Fn+2 upto 6. Fn+1 lights up WASD, Esc and arrow keys so it is lights for minimalist gaming buttons. 2 through 6 lights up few more keys.The keyboard misses on few areas, but it should be no bother at this price point, but here they are:1. The lightning effect gets resetted each time you power cycle your system/ unplug and replug the keyboard. It starts with the annoying snake pattern mode. The brightness setting is also lost. So you have to set it up with Fn+Ins for effects and Fn+arrows for brightness again.2. The markings on keycaps are not too visible when leds are off. This should not be a concern for touch typists, but for me who hover their fingers on the keys, I have to keep the leds on permanently. Though on the lowest brightness."
5,"This is a fantastic mechanical keyboard which for any 1st time user or even for someone who just types out long documents. The lack of individual RGB is surely a CON, you really need to think if buying a full RGB support keyboard is worth spending another 1,000 which is almost double the cost of this keyboard.I own Cosmic Byte CB-GK-16 which are Outemu Blue Switches while these are Outemu Brown Switches. The Brown switches are quite silent and very home friendly.They do miss out on the tactile feel, but I would rather have a keyboard that is much silent than noisy.The keyboard is quite easy to recommend at the asking price of Rs. 1799 - 10% = Rs. 1619Can't really go wrong with it. Anyone who is using a membrane keyboard and wants to try a mechanical keyboard this can be a good starting point."
5,"I loved this keyboard a lot its build quality is great no flex. Has full aluminium body. The keys don't have a lot of wobble. The switches are amazing and satisfying.Rainbow look is cool and has 6 effectsThere are 2 cons thoughThe feet are not rubberised.(keyboard is heavy, not always a problem)The brightness isn't top notchAgain can't expect everything from a budget keyboard.If this your first mechanical keyboard it Is great though I would suggest to spend 700rs more and get the redgear one with kalih blue switches if it is in your budget otherwise, go for it."
4,"Here is my One month usage review. This keyboard is good and really perfect has nice design that from gamers to typewriters everyone will like. Has some led back ligthing not RGB but someone from the keyboard community named it Rainbow though I am not getting that rainbow effect, seven colors of the rainbow are not present on the keyboard :DThe keyboard has decent typing feeling that normal new mechanical keyboard lovers will like but those who are using mechanical keyboard for many years surely will get something wrong in it. Being a mechanical keyboard users for 2 years I have found some glitches here and there. Let me type down below in order.1. The keyboard has loud tactile sound that needs to be greasing for lowering it's sound.2. The keyboard may sometimes for a micro seconds does not response which should not be present in any professional keyboard which will lead typos, I know this is a known issue of the chipset it's used. It will not break the keyboard though.3. Jixian blue switches are good but it does not provide the feeling of outemu while typing.My old keyboard had outemu swithches that really given me a nice smooth typing feel of which only 50% I am getting from this keyboard.As I have to write lots of thing on my computer that's why I got those problems but normal users will never able to find such problems.But if those problems be kept aside then I can really recommend it to anyone who wants to use mechanical keyboard, at least it has solid Jixian switches not like logitech mechanical that once break you are finished.It's good keyboard for its price and nice. New users once get it hands on will never able to detect such problem at all."
4,"This is an awesome keyboard in this price range and it has no build quality issue. Its keys are nice and clicky and having good feedback as well. But there is some issue with the driver of this keyboard I think.The main issue with this keyboard is, sometimes it skips the keystrokes while typing. I am using this keyboard for 3 days and I have faced this problem at least 2 to 3 times in a single usage. It's not a hardware issue, I searched for that problem and I found that its a driver issue. So I visited the official website of Cosmic Byte and there was no driver available for any Cosmic byte keyboards. So, its a kind request from Cosmic byte to provide a proper driver for your keyboards. Thank you"
1,"This keyboard is worst,  just after the return period it has gone bad. The led light of the complete row is faulty.The light blinks continuously and it won't stop.I wanted a return but since return period is over I can't get it.If any of the cosmic byte official is reading , then please help , as i am stuck with this pathetic keyboard"
5,"This is my first mechanical gaming keyboard, used membrane keyboards earlier and was used to it but this change felt nice.About the keyboard- Sturdy heavy build, looks much better in person than in picture, chrome bezel looks nice and colour intensity is amazing. Texture and slope of keys can be worked upon by company, but that's not much of a problem. Also, there is no inbuilt memory for colour profile selected. Overall this was the best purchase at the offered price of 1575. The company doesn't have many service centres so the longetivity of the keyboard remains an issue. Will update if any problem arises."
1,"Not so great keyboard, but a basic Mechanical Keyboard. The RGB is weird, every time you restart/start, the lighting‚Äôs gets reset. Not Individually lit RGB(I don‚Äôt expect that at this pricing). Though it says anti ghosting. Its not! I faced multiple times that keys are ghosted while playing Games. Yet Value for money.Ok, adding on. Dont buy this keyboard.the Cosmic Byte support is one of the worst support team in the world. My keyboard failed to work and upon contacting the support they were like, what should one expect for 3k value product. Means, this product is supposed to for one year only. Instead of spending money on these cosmic Byte products. Add 1k more and buy a good Keyboard. Even Logitech G 413 is better than Cosmic Byte‚Äôs Crap!"
5,"This is my first mechanical keyboard and I am loving it! I was explicitly looking for ""Brown"" equivalent switches as I was not sure about the sound factor of the ""Blue"" equivalent switches, having come from the common membrane keyboards and the usual laptop ""Chicklet"" keyboards in my college and professional life so far, but I was sure that I wanted to experience the ""mechanical switch"" based keyboard, having worked with them in my school days.Thank you Cosmic Byte for making this extremely value option available for people like me, especially with the ""brown switch"", which is an absolute rarity in India at this price point. And it is an extremely well made keyboard! Remember the movie fight scenes where a keyboard is used as a weapon? Well, this keyboard can actually be used there, it is so well made! And the finishing touches and details are great too, nothing to complain about. I work in IT and I have been using this as my primary keyboard for the past 2 months, and there have been no complaints. I have also been trying to improve my typing speed and this keyboard has helped me get over my past membrane keyboard based average of 38 wpm, I am at around 45 wpm right now, and I can clearly see a lot of room for improvements, I am sure that word count is going to grow significantly in near future.I bought this from Amazon, and it was delivered quickly as promised to my address, and was even replaced once at my request within the replacement window. I had requested a replacement as there was something loose within the keyboard that was making a clinking noise when the keyboard was moved, though there was no isue with the keybpard functioning. The relacement was done without any hassle from Amazon. At around 2k INR, this is a clincher. In fact, having used it for a couple of months, I wouldn't mind buying it at the stated MRP of 2.5k if I ever have to buy it again. I would obviously advise everyone to go for it, if you want to try the mechanical keyboard as an option to see if you really enjoy the feeling of one, and if it improves your productivity significantly, this is one of the best options to begin your journey -  it is a very well made keyboard, but it does not cost a bomb and if it does not go to your liking, you can still find a use for it as it does not make an unhealthy amount of noise (think office environment or late night work from home, or even as a gift to someone deserving, like a student in your family who scored really well in the exams). However, if it does go well (the most likely scenario), you will glean many pleasurable hours (hopefully years) of usage, not to mention the admirable glances and vocal compliments of all who witness it! It sure is a treat for the eyes, if nothing else, in all its back lit, effect filled presence on your table.I have worked with membrane keyboards that cost in similar figures (1k+ INR), and I would say this one is definitely more value than those (relatively) expensive membrane keyboards, solely in terms of the typing experience and expected longevity. You have to allow for a few days to let the ""feel"" settle in to really understand and appreciate the difference a mechanical keyboard makes. Though I have not worked with the more expensive ones marketed as ""semi-mechanical"", but I would say try out a mechanical keyboard before spending a bomb on a ""semi-mechanical"", especially this one with Outemu switches, which are one of the best, if not the best, value Kailh alternatives out there. I saw a lot of Youtube video comparisons to come to that understanding, as I am sure you would too before opting for this.The only reason to go for a membrane keyboard if you are willing to spend in the vicinity of 1.5k INR would be if you are planning to carry it around a lot (even then, I would say save your money and buy something cheaper, they are not worth more than 800 INR at the most IMHO, and even then, get a back lit chicklet one, they are the most sensible portable alternative), as this one is not meant for being carried around - it is heavy (as all mechanical keyboards are) and is best used at a stationary work station, not lugged around in a back pack. You can do it, if you really want to, but I wouldn't recommend it, considering the weight, and also considering what a beauty this is, I would say it doesn't deserve that ""treatment"" of being smothered in a backpack. If that is not making sense to you, just wait till you set your eyes on this beauty, and it will!"
1,"Build quality is excellent in price range but the main fault was key prints are not clearly visible look likes faded i dont know its only in my piece.I am reviewing it again yesterday my W,A,Sand D jeys stopped working only in 2 months tume what a bad thing it is . I will not recommend it to anyone instead buy some reputed brands."
3,"This is one keyboard I have not gotten completely used to, even after almost two months of use. Not sure why. I still miss keys or press the wrong one.The keyboard gave trouble from the beginning. The comma key was mostly stuck. No amount of prodding, cleaning would help... after a few hours it would be stuck again and it got worse. I was in touch with Cosmic Byte and they promised replacement, but not after a highly annoying requirement of sending them photos as well as a video of the malfunction. I asked them to keep it on hold as the process was tedious. They asked me to use the keyboard lock and unlock button a few times, and over a period, it helped. The comma key works fine now.As far as the rest of the keyboard is concerned, I find the keys a tad too resistant. Also, the font used to display the keys is highly annoying... needlessly stylised typeface cause issues. Keyboards should have simple types, so recognition is instant.Overall, the build seems good. Package graphics are unimpressive. There was a little device (a ring with two extensions) that looked like it was placed mistakenly. Only later I realised it was to be used to pull the keys out. I wish the manufacturers had devised a method of inserting it into the keyboard body for storage.Another annoyance is the lights are not truly RGB... but each 'zone' has different colours. So, if I want the entire keyboard to show only a certain colour of backlight, it is not possible.Keep in mind I am not a gamer, just a design professional looking for a decent keyboard without paying through my nose."
5,"I purchased it when it was first available after pendamic i.e 4th Oct in Rs.2000. I am using it consistantly for above 8 hrs or more every day for my professional use. I buyed it just for typing experience and my accounts n operation work, need lots of calculation so number keys is also performing good and using it for my ofc use. I don't care about lighting effect coz i am touch typist and my avg speed is 55 wpm.I must say it is one of the best keyboard available in the market. Its also compact in size.The only Con i notices is it is slightly wobble or stabilization issue but don't spoil typing experience and keys are super soft and just need small force to register. Far better then chicklet key. Half pressed or lazily pressed also register the key.I don't like cleaky sound so i purchased brown switches which is from Outemu brand and it is also respectable brand in international market after Cherry switches. It's good over kaihl switches and can't be compared to gixian as per you tube videos and some research done about types of mechanical switches. So in short otemu is 2nd best after cherry switches. Go for it and far better typing experience than those chicklet keyboards"
5,"This the best keyboard ive ever had. It feels so smooth and premium, its really durable.Some features:1. 5-6 different lighting patterns.2. U can change the brightness levels and the lighting speed aswell.3. U can either choose no light or totally lit option.  (In no light feature the lights are totally off and when u press any key, the light below the key lits up)4. ""Mechanical keyboard"" so u dont have to worry about wasting ur keyboard while gaming.What i dont like is that THE CABLE is not braided, thats it.Just order it why are u still reading ü§®"
4,"Okay, so if you are looking to buy your first mechanical keyboard then this is one of the better options. I opted for the Outemu Brown switch variant as the blue switches are just some cheap Chinese knock-off and I prefer brown for the lower sound but similar tactile feel.If you have only used cheap membrane keyboards this is a big step up for typing alone and for gaming it's in a different league.The only con I have felt so far is the somewhat limited spacing between keys. More expensive models like the Ducky ones from meckeys or Corsair or even the Zebronics one have slightly better spacing so easier to get used to and less typos.Will update this review if any build quality issues pop up but it is built pretty well with aluminium chassis. The cable is cheap though.Anyway, hopefully this review helped and surely it is bang for the buck as an entry level mechanical keyboard, far superior to membrane keyboards at this price point."
3,"Pros -1. Best build in quality.2. Stylist good, having metallic body.3. Sleek design compare to Zeb nitro.4. Best in price range.Reason why I had returned this product because-1. Color of the Font is grey, you find difficult to recognize what's written on keys.2. Fonts of keyboard is a bit weird.3. Color of every line are fixed. We can not change color to any specific color.4. Position of keys in this keyboard is not up to the marks."
5,"The S key is broken i have to press it 3-4 times at least so it can register . so disappointing  , really cuts the gaming experience .It turns out its common issue in mechanical keyboards , u can fix it by poring rubbing alcohol into the socket ,"" u can find the fix on youtube"" . u can get rubbing alcohol from any medical store ."
4,"I received my keyboard yesterday and I love it. So far, it seems like a great deal and I'm very happy with it. I'm still getting used to a mechanical keyboard but it's not too hard. I've also come to appreciate the clicky nature of blue switches. When reading reviews, I noticed that a lot of people mentioned they received Jixian blue switches while the browns were typically always Outemu. Once I received the keyboard, I immediately took off a keycap to determine what switch I got and was surprised to see it was an Outemu switch! I checked a couple other keys and they all had Outemus. I'd assume that these Outemu switches are better than the Jixians, so keep this in mind. My only complaint with the keyboard so far is the fact that the function key symbols (such as volume up/down) are not backlit since they are painted onto the keycaps. I guess I will have to commit each function to memory if I want to use them in the dark."
4,"Hey, I got this keyboard for Rs. 1800/-.I have to say that price of the keyboard is completely justified. But few things I didnt liked in this.Firstly the print of characters. They are invisible without Backlit, even if there is ample amount of sunlight.Secondly, I feel the weight of the keyboard is bit less. It could had been somewhat heavier. While gaming intensively it tends to move or slid.Lastly, cable could had been braded.Beside these and considering the price point this is the best we can get.I'm happy"
1,"Please do not waste money on this productBuying this keyboard for this much money was a waste of money for meAfter 4-5 weeks, the RGB lights started flickering out of pattern, while typing some keys just gets missed or double typed and now it is automatically changing the cursor positions while typing.Intried to claim warranty from cosmic byte and they asked me to send the product to Pune... On my expense which they will reimburse later.I just don't have enough time to bear wirh this malfunctioning product after paying this much."
1,The product has a dent at one corner and the aluminum sheet is not at its place.
1,"I bought this because I wanted a cheap backup mechanical keyboard which looked decent. The package arrived yesterday in a taped up box. It definitely was opened and/or used before. I still gave it the benefit of the doubt and open it up. Just by looking at it I could say that it would have issues working, but still I had little hope that it might actually work.I plugged it in and it lit up fine, I noticed a cut on the ESC key, about 2 millimeters wide. The left key was stuck pressed. None of the keys worked, I tried disconnecting my other HyperX keyboard and tried this, it only lit up and nothing worked. Tried it on another PC and a laptop but still the same.If I had bought this a month earlier and if the function keys worked to change the pattern of lighting then I probably would have hung this on our Christmas tree. A decoration light which looks like keyboard, a shame that even the light pattern changing keys don't work. :-)I've asked for a replacement, will update when this review when I get my replacement."
5,1st time mechanical keyboard user. Used primarily logitech membrane wireless keyboards before. After using this keyboard I'm never gonna use membrane keybs againButtons are buttery smooth.Adjustable light brightness good feature and light at full brightness does not disturb eyes.Primary use programming n regular office workUSB cable is long but non braidedThis is a 1st day review so can't say how durable it is.At 2000 rs it's a good buy.Brown switches. Sound is extremely low and keys don't wobble like membrane keybsI own a amkette Evo fox 10keyless membrane rgb keyboard but cosmic byte keyb feel is totally smooth.
5,Bought it for my work and gaming needs. Excellent quality and tactile mechanical keys. I went with the brown outemu switches as I don't like click sound of blue switches. Overall a decently priced gaming keyboard. Don't think will ever switch back to membrane keyboard now. Only thing lacking is breathing light for the switches üò≠. CosmicByte should have given breathing light instead of so many lighting effects which would made this keyboard a killer at this price point. Also memory function should be there for the lighting effect. I just use one effect all the time and have to set it every time my system is restarted. Best one if this is your first mechanical keyboard!
5,"PROS:For those who know to type without seeing the keyboard, this keyboard is a boon. You will never miss a key. the keys are very soft and deep and actuate early, so when typing fast you dont need to hit the bottom, and also it doesn't hurt the fingers unlike a chiklet keyboard with no height at all(those that are found on most laptops).You can remove the keys safely and easily for cleaning.CONS:could have included wireless for this price,and there is option to turn off the backlights blinking serially, but it will resume again after system restart.also, the letters printed on top of the keys are too dull and not visible in low light conditions."
5,"Very sturdy, excellent build quality. Value for money. Mechanical blue switches work as they should. And the RGB is adjustable from the keyboard itself. Heavy enough and has rubber feet so that it doesn't slide. And the cable is also good quality with sufficient length. In my opinion this is the best true mechanical keyboard with a Number pad, that I could find at this price range. Would definitely recommend."
3,"Nothing to complain about at the price point! If it had remembered the light effect it would been a great keyboard. It  is annoying to reset the light effect every time :(UPDATE: After using it for some days I found that the hardware on this keyboard is incapable of handling fast key strokes. When I type over 80-90 WMP, it becomes unresponsive for some microseconds, technically it leads to typos. I'm of the type who use keyboard 10x more than mouse. This is so disturbing. I got replacement but that too have the same issue. I've never noticed such a problem in any keyboard before."
4,"Look I've been using it for like couple of months and For gaming : Fine (I play fortnite, minecraft, overwatch, GTA v and mostly Fps)The thing itself is pretty strong.The one thing I don't like even though I know it supposed to be this way is : the key's r not bright u can't see them at night or even in daylight, u have to turn on the LED lights all the time to see. Which is kinda annoying.But u know it's a mechanical keyboard with a very strong build u get what u paid for.The lights just leave them you'll get used it."
1,"Original review: Been using TVSE keyboards since 25 years (that's right!) and was justifiably frustrated with the new cramped up laptop keyboards. This one does not disappoint and has the legendary feel of a ""real keyboard"" (old timers will empathize with this feeling). All in all, a no nonsense keyboard that works exactly as expected and does not disappoint especially at this price point.Update January 2021:A few months down the line, the keys W, A, S, Z X stopped functioning. Obviously I expected to find a service center or some kind of call center number to redeem the One year warranty. Shockingly, there is no such thing where you can get it done. All they have are sales agents and the only toll free number advertised on the website was non functional despite trying it for a week. Feel extremely disappointed with a brand like TVSE not bothering with post sales. They probably think that their (once) legendary brand name will last forever and they can get away with shoddy service...On my part, I will never trust TVSE products again."
1,"The quality is very very worst, because the keyboard is very very very old and used. The keys are full of dust & rust formed in usb pin, almost used and old product. I returned back."
4,"I was expecting more from tvs. This keyboard falls in the budget category. And there are some drawback in it.1. The keyboard in itself is small, the same size you would get for a 500 rs keyboard.2. No long backspace. A keyboard and that to a tvs should not cut back in this area, when backspace is the most used key, it becomes cumbersome at the beginning to go far for reaching the backspace key esp for people with small fingers.3. No hand rest.  Make sure u have a good table to mitigate this issue.Overall the keyboard is smooth (but not butter smooth). The keys function as intended, been using it for 4 to 5 months now and no problem. Apart from the drawbacks that is what you get in a budget keyboard."
1,"üëéüëéüëéüëé don‚Äôt see the brand always see who‚Äôs the seller..,,.,After use 30 days enter button not worksService centre not support Due to product Online purchase.....So disappointed Amazon says we can‚Äôt help..."
3,"This Keyboard is not as in picture....This keyboard don't have Power, Sleep, Wakeup buttons & this keyboard's box print price is ‚Çπ418/-....but in local market this keyboard cost ‚Çπ392/- as this don't have 3 Power buttons!!!BUT WITH LAPTOP OR PC USE THIS KEYBOARD QUALITY IS VERY GOOD & QUALITY OF KEYBOARD IS 4.5 OUT OF 5 STARS...!"
1,"I bought this product on Nov 17 but not used till September 19. I just plugged in few days ago, it's recognized by computer then suddenly the power is off. I tried with another port and another machine but not yet worked. Seems it's not worked in one day. Its very poor quality."
1,Some keys are not working and sometimes if we press a key it get typed multiple times...not worth purchasing it
1,"not power button, i returned, but amazon not returned my money"
2,KB stopped working in 3 months flat. Did not expect this from TVSE keyboards. Add a bit more money and buy logitech or MS one. Dell also works just as good.
1,On the product description its written by the seller COUNTY OF ORIGN -INDIA  but in the product packaging it is written COUNTRY OF ORIGN -CHINAAnd it gives very slow input and the wire provided is too small
5,Works well and is very well made for a keyboard of this price. Go for it when you are on a budget and you still want a well made good quality keyboard.
5,Feel effort less while typing.Finger friendly Keyboards.Maintain TVS brand grade Quality.
2,"Nothing special to give extra points on review.....as usual like others in this segment......no loss no gain type item.......not to leave, not to promote after 2 months of use......ordinary like others in this price range"
3,"I've used this product for over months now and am satisfied for what it has offered to the price tag it came with. The comfort is average.It was delivered in three business days by amazon.The item is good. For what it cost, the keyboard gets the job done fine. This keyboard contains keys of the rigid-format type, especially for those who want to have the snack of the key strokes. The build quality is quite good enough.I wish the height adjustment would have been a bit higher so htat it would suffice people of all heights/short hands. Overall a Good Product."
5,Nice keyboard and value for money. Earlier I had TVS Champ Keyboard which lasted 8 years. very smooth keys and value for money.
1,"It is totally used products, usb have a rush on it , some keys are not working"
1,"I was waiting for it, it was urgent needed. But I got damaged product. And for replacement.. It is again 10 days later.What is this, they should understand the importance of the time."
5,Excellent keyboard which is value for money and working as expected.
1,"Don't buy vvc sales Pune product , they will deliver defective product. I received one defective keyboard the Amazon didn't sopport due to lock down now it's clear no one is to respond"
5,Good... has got the rupee symbol
4,The product is worth for money and while typing the letters smoothness and very comfortable feel is there.The product is fit for small table as well as big table.
5,Key stroke feel and sound are good. Sturdy keyboard.
1,Don't buy this product. You will get the product very different from what is shown in the picture.
4,Good product at affordable price
5,I hqve been using it for more than 2 months now and the user experience has been very good. Hassle-free use and  it is on par with any other keyboard in the market.
5,Very good

4,Nice  keyboard
5,Good product
4,"This keyboard is great to use. Every keystroke is confident and is really a bargain at Rs. 500. But since I use a Macbook, a lot of the buttons like the display brightness control, volume control, play-pause, command button button don't work."
5,"Perfect keyboard for heavy typing,Smooth and flawless keys....No need to look beyond this TVS champ usb keyboardIndegenous and Precisely what one requires from a keyboard, I have tried dozens of brands at this budget none stood by as TVS."
1,Old product had to Return the product
1,"A,X and tab key suddenly stopped working.."
3,Nice
4,I recommend this product
1,"USB keyboard ,Description say you have choice of interface PS2/USB ,but it comes only with USB."
3,Compare to the price we can buy it and it's not waste of money. But if you want to spend more than go for TVS GOLD. It's awesome
5,This keyboard is the perfect blend of everything you need if u r are on a tight budget and the corners cut in it are really few.... I think whoever buys this won't be dissatisfied... The tactility... Sounds... Lighting.... Keypresses... Everything is on the point
5,Best for the price product it feels nice and clucky. Braided cable is also good although the brightness of RGB could be a bit more bright but it's also your personal preference
5,"Using it since 5 days. The keyboard is really really good, the mechanical keys have the pleasant clicking noise of the blue switches and the combo with RGB lighting is perfect. The best part about buying this is its software. I can literally control Light color, speed, effects, Macros and what not using it.Just go for it value for money keyboard."
5,"This keyboard seems like pretty nice quality for the price. i don‚Äôt know much about keyboards but i just know i like clicky keyboards and this one is perfect. i play league of legends and it‚Äôs nice to play with this keyboard! it is very loud though so if you don‚Äôt want to disturb others, this one isn‚Äôt for you. the lights are pretty too! the different modes are cool."
5,Its first time that i purchased a mechanical keyboard. Coming from typical membrane key to mechanical. it feels so comfortable while typing and that clicky sound of blue switches is lit. It is budget mechanical keyboard with different led backlit modes.
5,"I wanted a mechanical clicky keyboard and this one kills it! Great construction, lots of control over the color and way it looks, the key clicks are very soothing, and very responsive. Keys have a great feel and do not need to be pushed very hard or far. Highly recommended for any PC gamers."
5,Best quality keyboard ... Very good response and the arm rest is also very useful... Instant connectivity
5,My first time using a mechanical keyboard and I have definitely enjoyed using it. The control of the lighting is easy and the responsiveness of the keyboard is phenomenal. The wrist rest is a nice touch. Something which I liked the most is keypress sound. Its so soothing while playing games.
4,"This keyboard just feels right - as long as I have the wrist rest on. The keystrokes are reliable and comfortable. After a lifetime of cheap keyboards, this is a serious upgrade at a reasonable cost."
5,It's good keyboard gives you that satisfying click of mechanical keyboards
4,Fabulous keyboard at this price
5,One of the best if not the best keyboards you can but at this price point. Will update this if anything happens.
5,I'm totally in love with this keyboard. The RGB light is just amazing. Specially the ripple effect. The keyboard overall gives clicky sound which every gamer loves. The build quality is also sturdy. So full marks on that part.The attached wrist pad gives comfort for real. I also got one Screwdriver to tighten the wrist rest manually.This is one of my best buy ever. Thanks Amkette for such masterpiece
5,This keyboard is soo awesome.  I loved it. It has 16 light combinations which look so beautiful in dark and the sound of pressung the keys is like pro. I liked it so much.
5,I love this keyboard. It's price is genuine and touches and light quality is soo awesome. It's value for money product. It's light combination is so good. It has different different light combinations which look so beautiful.
4,Product is good but enter key shown in display image is not currect. On keyboard shift and Enter key is very small which is not good and there is no Caps lock light. It just 800Rs
5,"Very smooth for typing, received a product looks like new without any scratch or any damages. Thanks to amazon."
4,It is not looking or working like renewed.. like a new one. Thank you Amazon for the good new product in a less price than the original.

5,"It's not very thick. I bought it for legion 5 and it fit perfectly. Tbh I really like it. I have used some other on my hp laptop and they were big and didn't fit well. I think it's gonna last, now that is one thing that only time can tell but my first impressions of it are pretty good. You'll not regret it if you buy it but keep in mind the layout of the keyboard."
4,1. Very Thin Cover2. Fits well on the keyboard3. Affects your typing experience but protects from dust.I think it is over priced. Try to get such covers from the market at lower price else the product is above average.
5,"Perfect fitting also for new design of IdeaPad gaming 3i . Nice , cool , classy"
4,"Fits perfectly on Legion 5Pi. Thin material allows for ease in typing. Leaves no marks on screen when the lid is closed. Buy the transparent one, don't buy the black or you will not see the alphabets even on a back-lit keyboard.Highly Recommended product!!"
1,It's the cheapest quality available in market even polythene carry bags are more durable than thisVery overpriced not worth of 20‚ÇπalsoIt just fits keys perfectlyDon't buy in hurry  try checking for other similar products
5,"I doubted it before buying... But, it's really a good product. Met my expectations. Well fitted. Not too thick to block the backlit keyboard. Not too thin to compromise on sturdiness. Perfect balance of two..."
5,It's very soft keyboard cover scene.very easy to use and washable. I used before 5 days it's very comfortable.recomonded for others.
5,"Fits properly, provides good protection. Good for typing too, doesn't make the experience particularly bad.. Go for it."
2,Didn't properly fit. There is gap between the cover and the keys. It only fit properly at the edges.
5,very useful and very good product.it fitd perfectly well for all laptops.feels good while touching the keys..its worth a buy.absolutely amazing product...
2,"Not typing friendly, if you only need cover than good. This cover make keys harder to press and u can only press key in middle only, the edge of keys cover very hard"
3,"Everything is good except its price, it is over priced"
2,Cover is ok but price is high compared to its quality!!!
1,Destroys the otherwise amazing typing experience of lenovo legion/ ideapad keyboard.

1,Very cheap quality and didn't expect  plastic material. not a value for money product.

2,"I've been using this keyboard and mouse for 5 weeks now and got to say the mouse response is really bad. If you're purchasing this keyboard and mouse for an office computer then think again, the mouse response will make you mad for sure. The keyboard works perfectly and some missing. The mouse pointer misses the target 90% of the time. Trust me :) I don't usually write a review about the product that I've purchased but this one left me no choice but to mention the experience  I had. I don't think its happening for all the mouse but you can try your luck :). I just wanted to wish you a GOOD LUCK on this purchase :D"
1,"This doesn't work properly. And, sold under non replacement condition. Customer loses, why Anazon supports this condition, disappointing and distressing."
4,I had never found complaint with Logitech product. I was using this brand from very long time. Planning to buy next model than this....
1,"Waited for almost a week and then i get tk know It doesnt work , this product comes with batteries in it but they were also missing when plugged reciever logitech's software says no reciever deteced"
1,"Been using this since Aug 2020, and here is what I have to say:I needed a compact keyboard and mouse for my workspace since I use two screens, and I did ton of research on something that is reliable and I can pack it in my bag.The keyboard layout is compact but you will get used to typing on it. so no complains about the keyboard.The Problem is the MOUSE. It is an absolute piece of GARBAGE. Does not matter if the batteries are new or old, how close you are to the transmitter. It just does not work.Problems with the mouse:It lags a ton, and I am talking a LOT! It hiccups and keeps reconnecting. why is this a huge problem? Imaging you selected some items and you are drag-and-dropping, in the middle of your tasks it just dies and your whole selection is ruined.Today another problem surfaced and I had to write a review to prevent others from buying this:Scroll wheel does not work on light press, I have to press it harder than before and with the hiccups is suddenly works 4 times at once.This might matter to you depending on the size of your hands. I have large hands and the mouse is not comfortable at all, it is way too small for meIn Conclusion: Do not waste your money on this piece of trash"
4,Its a good product...worth buying..
3,"Initially, I had several problems because the response lagged, especially when doing CPU intensive work. That seems to have resolved somewhat over time, and I have no idea how or why. I have to clarify that the reason I bought this was to have a small footprint keyboard, so that I could also accommodate a drawing tablet on the right side. For that purpose, it works fine. One feature I really miss is the ability to use a function key or moderator key to convert some keys to a numeric keypad. As I require unicode characters, this is a problem. I understand that some mini keyboards allow converting some keys to number keypad. The mouse is a bit small for my likes, but then I don't use it at all."
3,"GREAT PRICE. Typing is very comfortable. The size is very convenient for small desks. The battery lasts for a VERY LONG TIME, haven't replaced the cells in 2 years. However, sometimes suddenly stops working or keys type some other character. But the problem only occurred once and went away in 2 days."
2,Way to bulky for a mini keyboard... cheap looking ... utterly nonsense sense of color.Regretting the purchase
5,"Very good build.Soft touch keys.Easy set up, plug and play.Beautifully bright colors.Worth the price.Comes with one receiver for both mouse and keyboard and 2 sets of aaa batteries."
5,"It's a great product for home/office use. Very portable and light weight, can be carried around without any hassle. Single receiver for both keyboard and mouse so it won't use up USB slots. Keys are also positioned nicely for fast typing. Battery also lasts quite long. I've been using at for over a month now and haven't replaced them yet.Arrow keys are a little small though so for gaming it may not be the ideal choice. And multimedia keys can only be used by pressing Fn key. There is no option to change multimedia keys to primary.Overall great product."
5,"Just the way I wanted. Small, smart and a beauty. Just the write sized for a medium sized palm and for someone who is more acquainted to work on a laptop keyboard. At my home, I have my laptop hooked up to a monitor for projecting my laptop screen. And this keyboard brings in just the right comfort and handling for long office hours."
5,"I really like the build and feel of both tge keyboard and mouse. I bought this combo for use in graphic art along with display tablet. I think this is what i want.Compact and still got the look and feel. Mouse is responsive , the keyboard may lag slightly after long no press of any keys. That maybe some power saving feature. It's ok. It's fine."
5,"I have been using this pair for a month now. INSIDE BOX- so the box comes with one mouse, one keyboard, four remote batteries and one USB port(for connectivity). After one month of use I haven't change the batteries they are still going so battery backup is good all you need two batteries for each. (There's a small slot in the mouse itself to store the USB). TO CONNECT TO THE SYSTEM ALL YOU NEED IS TO INSERT THE USB AND SWITCH ON THE MOUSE. Although the keyboard connects directly with the USB.GAMING- You can do moderate gaming with this but heavy is not meant for this. Plus it's compact so you'll find difficult to find the keys while intense gaming.TYPING- This is a compact size keyboard without num pad. It's easy to carry plus takes lass space in the bag. The keys are soft to type plus they are firm.BODY- The body is made up of good plastic material. It's feels sturdy while holding in hands. It has a rubber grip in the bottom for better grip on the surface you are putting it(basically your work table).Well taking about value for money I'll say getting this quality + connectivity+ wireless system. It'll be best offer to buy a compact size mouse keyboard set under ‚Çπ1500."
3,"I have been using this Logitech mouse and keyboard combo for 20 days now.Keyboard :-Keyboard is just amazing.if you want a keyboard which is small in size and looks good then go for it. The design of the keyboard is very nice. Keys press experience is also good.Mouse :-Mouse is not at all good. On continuous use of mouse for 10, it freezes. I replaced once but the replaced mouse is the same. Very bad experience with the mouse. Currently I am using another mouse and this won't work at all."
4,"I've used Ant Esports MK1000 for about 1 year or so after that some keys start ghosting & I think this ghosting issue is like a curse to almost every budget / midrange mechanical keyboards, that's why I switched to this Logitech MK240 NANO.Pros:- good battery life- typing experience is fairly good as well- media keys- very compact, even more compact than any regular TLK keyboard- comes with a mouse which is fairly good as well- wireless receiver can be inserted into mouse itself so while travelling with this keyboard & mouse there are less chances of losing that receiverNote: if coming from mechanical keyboard or some other keyboard you might have wrist pain for some days using this keyboard which will go away after some time"
5,"I am a space conscious person. I want everything neat and also fitting the space.I found this budget friendly keyboard and mouse, thought give it a try.Bit worried about negative reviews. But after I got it, I tried and found it really worthy.Build quality is superb. The key play is also adequate. Not too noisy and at the same time doesn't feel dead.Mouse is also very handy. The only thing I may not like is the jazzy color. But I might put a sticker of some sort to hide the graffiti on the keyboard. Overall I am happy with the purchase.Seller shipped it in a day. Kudos to him/her."
5,"I got this as a WFH replacement for my Mac Pro keyboard since the butterfly switches felt like they were dying. The key placement is identical to the Mac's and even if you're a Windows user, you'd be right at home. The keys however, are a little too close to each other and sometimes that causes problems in touch typing and also, this KBM is expensive during this time ( I got it for 1.7k, even though I see people getting it for around 1k). The mouse is utilitarian.The size is very, very compact (again, like the 13 inch mac pro, so I felt right at home). So you shouldn't have any problems in portability."
1,"Very bad product. Do not buy this product . I thought that I never got faulty products from Amazon ever I ordered it . But it is very bad product . Keyboard only few keys working.

2,"I have purchased Keyboard and Mouse from amazon on Date 20.05.2020.Unfortunately It is started malfunctioning [if i am pressing key its giving different output]I have tried contacting Amazon but since 10 days are already passed and there return policy got closed .I see there is 3 years warranty for these products so i would like to replace them OR REFUND for them .let us know procedure for sameKEYBOARD S/N : 1952SY01SBF8 ,  MOUSE  S/N :  1952SY01R9S8i am not happy"
5,Works well with laptops or desktops. There is absolutely no lag. May not be best for gaming as not all direct buttons are available and some features like page up and page down may have to be accessed by pressing combination keys. My recommendation for gamers is to check the layout and then buy.
5,"A very good bulild Quality , smooth clicking buttons , a good range for connectivity .Best thing about it is , its a small key board with big buttons , and all the keys including short cut keys e.g page up ,page down ,home, end also funtion keys like calculator ,search ,volum up/down , music play pause ,volume mute and all.Though I am using it for work from home for programing and development , its very comfortable and usefull for that .Thank you amazon for doing one day delivery in this Covid situation ."
1,"I had high expectations from the product but to my dismay I had a bad experience with the keyboard. The keys in the keyboard are very stiff and there is malfunction of the space bar button. When i press the space bar it doesn't comes back up, due to which while typing I get a very big gap in my sentences. The mouse that came with it has nice grip and the screen pointer sensitivity is good but the scroller is very slow and feels too mechanical. Overall not a good product. Won't recommend it."
5,"Lasts long. I own two sets, one is five years old and still works almost like brand new.I am writing this review on the second one I bought.This Keyboard has many things going for it.Its form-factor is small, but not too small. The key travel is not too less, which is a problem with smaller keyboards.Most buttons are not obnoxiously small, unlike some other keyboards.The wireless ""Just Works"". I've never had issues with it.Battery life is easily six months for the mouse (heavy use daily), more than a year for the keyboard.The scrollwheel also has great tactile feel and is ""clicky"" as it should be.The mouse is also exactly the right size, fits right within the palm of my hands.The black and yellow provides enough contrast, so you'll never have visibility in most cases unless you're typing in complete darkness.Both the keyboard mouse will trivially fit within most backpacks without a hassle, so can be easily carried around.If you get an USB OTG cable, will work well with phones/tablets as well (though you'll have to figure out where to mount the device)."
5,"the product looks durable and I trust Logitech in durability dept.Keys are well placed and easily reachable.Battery backup is alright. Still running on stock batteries.Bluetooth connectivity is perfect. No issues until.I didn't like the design at all. In photos it looks alright but the graphics work on keyboard is ughhh.. Mouse alone, looks fabulous.It is not meant for gaming and I think you guys already know that, I'm using it for coding and for that kind of functions, it is a no brainer; quality, size, backup, weight, everything suits the commuting, allergic to laptop keyboard guys."
4,"I am typing this review out from the new keyboard and i must say i really like it for the money spent. The only two cons i see are:1. The mouse seems cheap and not very good at connectivity2. The keyboard is a little noisy when i compare it to my dell wireless keyboard, but overall it makes up for good typing experience and space management on the desk as compared to a typical wireless keyboard.A decent deal for this price range, else you can try the Artek ones starting at 4-4.5k"
5,"The key response is very sensitive, which would have been a great thing had it not been for my huge hands invariably pressing several keys on each keystroke. Guess I should have researched it better before buying. No complaints with the product as such."
1,Some buttons stopped working after half year. Sometimes keyboard doesn't work at all for a half a minute. Mouse is ok.
4,"I do not game, No gamer should look for such products.for general use the keyboard is small which is good for me. It is quiet responsive.Key travel is also good.At times the mouse pointer is frozen so you have to turn off the mouse and turn it on again for it to work lagfree."
2,"I'M TOTALLY UNHAPPY WITH THE MOUSE AS IT WORKS TOO SLOW AND AT TIME DOESN'T WORK AT ALL. I DESPERATELY NEED A REPLACEMENT, HOWEVER WHEN I NOTICED THE RETURN OR REPLACEMENT SECTION IT WAS VERY SHORT AND THE DAY HAS ELAPSED. ONLY OPTION LEFT WITH ME IS TO THROUGH THE MOUSE AWAY AND BUY A WIRED MOUSE WHICH TOTALLY DISRUPTS THE NEED FOR AN BLUETOOTH KEYBOARD AND MOUSE. UNHAPPY CUSTOMER."
5,I have been using the Logitech bluetooth speaker and I know it is a brand we can trust. This product is also pretty good. The keyboard and mouse are easy to carry around and are light weight. They are well built using good quality plastic. Keyboard has good key travel and it gives a nice typing experience. Only con I noticed is there is no turn off key for keyboard.
5,"The is best keyboard for your traveling. You can easily Carey it with your lapor  or tab.It has a good battery life, build quality and tacktile. If you want a wireless keyboard umder 3000rs these is the best one,"
5,"Easy to carry in your laptop bag, very light. Nice colour design, no sharp edges, super easy to install on windows 10, took like 2 minutes to get it working. Comes with battery for keyboard and mouse."
1,this is the second time i bought this combo...once the keyboard stopped working.this time the mouse.not a trustworthy product.try something else
4,"I purchased the same product two years back from Thailand, the mouse went off in two years, I approached Logitech but they refused to provide a Warranty on the international product. Then I ordered a new one in India., I received the product, but when I compared the quality of Thailand product v/s what I received in India, there is a huge difference in finishing of the product. Almighty knows... what is the reason?????"
5,Best keyboard that you can get in this price range.The key travel is just perfect..The quality is awesome and the best part is that the size of keyboard is small....it has all the essential keys that you need and is also good in looks. Cherry on the top is the mouse which is also really good...its just a little small but u get used to it and its not a problem.....Overall the best keyboard combo !!!
1,"Usb receiver is of bad quality stop working after some time , and very poor performance when you work from small distance , so no use of it to be wireless .‡§®‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ú‡§¨ ‡§§‡§ï ‡§π‡•à ‡§†‡•Ä‡§ï ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§ó‡§æ ‡§™‡§∞‡§Ç‡§§‡•Å ‡§è‡§ï ‡§Æ‡§π‡•Ä‡§®‡•á ‡§¨‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§§‡§∞‡§π ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§ï‡§§ ‡§Ü‡§®‡•á ‡§≤‡§ó ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à ‡•§ ‡§á‡§®‡§ï‡§æ ‡§∏‡§π‡§æ‡§Ø‡§§‡§æ ‡§ï‡•á‡§Ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§†‡•Ä‡§ï ‡§∏‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ  ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§® ‡§´‡•ã‡§® ‡§â‡§†‡§æ‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§® ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•ã‡§à ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ß‡§æ‡§® ‡§π‡•ã‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡•§ ‡§§‡•ã ‡§ú‡•ã ‡§ó‡§æ‡§∞‡§Ç‡§ü‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§æ‡§§ ‡§π‡•à ‡§â‡§∏‡§ï‡§æ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•ã‡§à ‡§´‡§æ‡§Ø‡§¶‡§æ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§π‡•à ‡•§"
5,I have been using this product for few months. Found it to be very good. Highly recommended for laptop users to protect the laptop keyboard while gaming.
5,All about this tiny Keyboard and mouse is full recomend for travelling and simple use ..size of mouse is quite small .. if you r using gaming keyboard than you will face some difficulties bt after all this is the best keyboard ai this price range..
4,One Star deducted for not providing On / Off switch on the key board!Funky art lines make it attractive. Right size - easy to hold! Overall Nice!!Can't comment on battery as its just been 2 weeks.
1,"This product was good at this price but unfortunately it didn't work when plugged into USB..The seller needs to test the product before shipping else it will be waste of time of seller, as well as customer. Amazon must keep a tab on such sellers."

4,It's good at this price. Happy with purchase.
2,material is good but the ipad just slips when i try to support it with cover stand..a bad deal
1,"The bought item was not accepting return dur to size issues, and no window link was getting comnected after repeated attempts.  Finally the order day for return also closed."
5,Nice product worth of money
5,Cool color and look üëç
1,"The size was inappropriate, specific measurements of length and width should be added in the description to help in choosing a correct size"
4,Good product but catches dust quickly
4,Cover is too large ours is ipadmini2. Please replace with iPad mini 2
3,No honeycomb grid design. Just plain. Light weight.
5,Prettty cute luv it
5,color of the product and texture
3,No honecom pattern at all fake discription and fake product
3,Does not fit properly on the keyboard.  The last row is not aligned to the keyboard
5,"Look it fits perfectly for Asus Vivobook Model X412FAC Notebook PC .Tip : If you don't know the exact model of your pc then there is a branding of ""Sonic Master"" on the bottom right side of the keyboard . That branding must be 1-1.5 cm below the right arrow button . If the branding is very very close to the arrow buttons then there is chance that the skin will not fit perfectly on the buttons .Also , the model of the PC is always written on the back of it .Hope my review will help you all !!"
5,Perfect... Go for it...
5,Fists very well to asus vivobook 14
4,fits perfectly for vivibook 14 ryzen 5
3,it's pretty good in the backlit too not much brightness little low cost would be nice for it.
1,Pathetic
3,liked it but it could be more adhesive and value for money
3,Incompatible (top and bottom area not matched)
1,Not properly fitted for Asus vivobook 14 laptop
1,Very expensiveToo much costNo perfect fit available
5,Good activ he.
1,Horrible brush. So many brush hair fall out the moment u touch it. Black side of brush is ok but Pink filaments are BAD.
5,This is my second order. First one was taken by friend after seeing the quality.
5,Easy to use. Recommended for purchase.
2,Just ok
1,Very bad product
5,Good very useful
4,The bristles on one side are so soft that you can simply brush it on your keyboard and it is free from any dust without being irritated. But the other side is really hard. I will never clean my keyboard with it. Maybe use it for the window sill.
1,The keyboard and mouse is absolutely faulty. Please dont buy from Aamzon. The caps lock key is not working and the left key of the mouse stops working abruptly. Please do not buy this product. The scroll on the mouse has also stopped working. Worst quailty.
1,"Don't buy this product, look wise it is good and you will feel strong material as well, but performance wise very bad,1. Very lag and some key's will not work unless you hit many times.2. I have seen this performance issue within a month. In fact I have seen this problem in few reviews before I bought it, but I thought that could be a usage issue or defect. Now I realized the product itself has issue, because I have received the product in good condition and worked fine for the first 15-20 days, there after it has started giving troubles. I feel myself bad for not valuing the other customer reviews and end up in buying this product.3. It's very pathetic/shame when you have typo's while chatting with your colleagues/higher management, this keyboard will give you such kind troubles for sure.Didn't expect this kind of product from Dell, the mouse is working very good though."
5,"I have been using the keyboard and mouse since three days.1. Keyboard is compact and the keys are very nice.2. There are LED indicators for Num-Lock, Caps-Lock and Scroll-Lock3. When we click on Caps lock or any other key locks, the LED indicator will glow for 5 to 6 seconds and turns off automatically.., which will save the battery life of keyboard.4. Functional keys are working as expected.5. No lag when we type in the keyboard and works like a wired keyboard.6. Mouse is fully adjusted in my palm and comfortable to use.7. Mouse does not have the tracking light which is good to save the battery life.8. One Bluetooth receiver for both Keyboard and mouse making me to save the USB slots on my Laptop.9. No back light for the keyboard (Not a draw back as it will kill the battery life of keyboard)10. Small LED indicator on the power on/off button for both mouse and keyboard (Turns on when the keyboard or mouse is turned on and which will turn off after 5 to 6 seconds the keyboard/mouse is switched on)11. There are no adjustable clips to set the keyboard height, but it has some default height which is comfortable to use.12. Easy to carry the keyboard13. Not useful for gaming purpose.14. Keyboard is Light weight.15. The only thing is, it is made in china and need to see the life of the product. Other than that I didn't find any cons.After researching for most of the time, I found this Keyboard and mouse combo is the best one."
4,"One of the best keyboard. Keys are very good. 1 star is reduced due to mouse. Mouse is big, feels heavy and not comfortable to operate."
5,I am using it for the 2nd day.Pros:- Price is cheap when compared to stores (dell authorized dealer)- Sturdy and Material is in good quality- Both Mouse and Keyboard connected by using a single adaptor which saves a USB portCons:- If the USB receiver is lost both mouse and keyboard will not work (keep it safe)
4,"Pros* Have been using KB216 wired KB for more than a year. This one is a wireless version of it.* The key board layout is convenient. Chicklet keys* Very minimum typing noise* LEDs for capslock, numlock and power on.* Power on off switch* Mouse is awesome. Very ergonomic and soft.Cons* Not sure about battery life. Should try* Some people may find the keys a bit sticky. I am ok with it."
4,"Got delivered today, overall I found it very good, it would've been The Best if backlit was providedIf I'll find any problem I'll update this review."
2,"Has no tilting option to raise the front and no space for palm rest.  Causes pain in the fingers while typing.  If you are normal user and not needed for gaming, then MK540 is the best option for double the cost OR around the same price range, Mk345 is available with better Ergonomics"
5,"If you're short on desk space you'll like this keyboard. It is also better quality compared to similar sized keyboards, produces a lot less noise when typing. The mouse is ok (not bad but nothing special)."
1,"So, it reads as wireless keyboard and mouse... but actually it has a dongle which connects the devices to your system.. now the dongle is a small USB life device which is very easily lost if unplugged.. once that happens then you cannot connect the keyboard and mouse to the system,,,.. the systems internal bluetooth will not recognize this at all.. you would have to take this to a near computer shop and match it with another universal receiver and then only use.. unfortunately it is not informed during purchase... waste of 2000/-."
3,For no reason it is overpriced.KEYBOARD REVIEW: Keypad keys are soft and good. But the biggest disadvantage is u can not make it flat. All the time it will be inclined typing. Paying so much seriously they Missed out that option.MOUSE REVIEW: The mouse is quite heavy and the click sound is very loud. Sometimes it is annoying. Definitely not for long hours usage as you will get bad wrist pain.
1,"The Keyboard malfunctioning  after 25 days of use. Respond time is too big, Sometime even I press a key, after 5 seconds it appear on the output device or display."
1,"Mouse is malfunctioning after few days, it's just 60days since I am bought and using. But mouse get get stuck while it using. I have to power off or remove USB and replug then it starts working. I am frustrating with this numerous actions (remove USB and replug/ power Off/ON the mouse."
3,"Main Drawbacks of this keyboards are1) No light indicators on the actual key (Capslock, Numlock)2)This Keyboard isn‚Äôt backlitOther wise it‚Äôs just a fine keyboard and mouse combo ."
5,This is the second keyboard I‚Äôve bought and I‚Äôm absolutely happy to have this to type away! Reason for 2nd is that I work out of 2 locations and so you can see I didn‚Äôt go for another option. Think for some you may feel this is slightly expensive compared to the options but this won‚Äôt disappoint you I can tell you that.
4,"Nice product, keyboard is a bit bigger in size, but works very well. Mouse is working swiftly, the shape is nice.The power on-off button could have been better. It's not a problem although."
3,"The operational functioning of the product looks fine... There has been no issue in terms of the work efficiency... the battery life of the mouse does not stand for long... I use a new battery a month for my mouse.. Although the keyboard is fine... Its been 4 months and the same old two batteries, works fine."
5,Good purchase...value for moneysmooth functioningQuick response
4,After 10 days: good for short rangeLagy on long range but this keyboard best this one issue i had.First expration:This the super premium keyboard and mouse for professional use this is the best not for gaming and rugged usesKeys quality are the best and this the dell so trust worthy productThis is firat impressionI will review soon.
1,Don't fall for the reviews. Keys are really hard to press! Using that mouse feels like a stone attached to the back of the mouse!
2,"Overall quality & sturdiness would have been improved.The Keys are not that firm & tend to shake, looks almost like coming out from the board."
5,Very  good product  nice working
4,Power on off button can be bigger and more accessible. Keys little hard to press than earlier version
5,Good performance quality productMouse easy on the hands stress free
1,"Don‚Äôt recommend this for its sturdy keys and design. Not useful for any kind of purpose, don‚Äôt go by hyped positive reviews. I recommend to buy more Logitech where keys are smooth unlike the this dell key board the keys are very hard and nightmare while typing."
3,"Keyboard is ok, mouse consum more power, and need to replace battery every month. use of mouse is about 10 hours per day."
1,There is a massive lag between motions (like typing and scrolling) and the resulting actions on screen. The lag is so significant that it makes it impossible to use.
3,"Don't why, lights of num lock goes of in few seconds despite it being ON. Keyboard and mouse is good and soft."
2,"Not worthy for the price 2k. Keys are not smooth and low vertical spacing between the keys.When you type fast, this keyboard will not help. I had expectation for dell under this price. Disappointed."
5,i am so happy with first look and usage. its really good and impressive.
4,"If you use Lenovo ThinkPad, you wont be satisfied with the keys, you need to put in little bit extra pressure."
5,"Nice product, works smoothly, keyboard and mouse both are good, seamless to operate. Key board is also not that bulky"
4,Value for money.  Build quality is good.Got complimentary batteries with product which is a plus point. It is working fine in initial testing.I will put more reviews after considerable usage.
4,"Mouse can be a little better, I liked all aspects of wireless keyboard and mouse except the mouse is a little flat . I would prefer it to be more curvy for better grip"
2,Keys wouldn't work at all.... i thought they were my typos.... but i realized that the keyboard is the issue when i used other keyboard today.... such a waste of money
5,Very nice must buy product
5,Good key pressure and response
5,A very nice keyboard!!!!
4,As expected the keyboard and mouse are very cool. There is no lag and works pretty amazing.
4,"Overall this product is upto the mark. Quality is good, it could be more better"
5,"I've only ever used Logitech keyboards and I gotta say, it doesn't get any better than this. The design is sleek, not as ergonomic as I would prefer but it gets the job done in the budget."
4,"I recently bought this for my work laptop. The keys feel good, but make a bit of clackety noise. I will require a keyboard wrist pad to be really comfortable with this one, but no complains about this. Works as expected."
1,Shift key not working properly.not press smoothly. Dives not working good.
2,The space bar doesn't work properly.
5,good
2,"The keyboard isn't worth the money. It's made of cheap plastic. While the keys are of low quality membrance, the picturesportrays a far more superior quality product which is far apart from the actual product.The only good thing is the free mouse which comes along with it, the mouse is of decent quality build with a slight weight to it."
4,The keyboard has been made thinking of gamers in their mindPros :1. Easy functionality2. Using keys for gamers will be easy3. Cant be used for business useCons :1. Keyboard is quite big (takes up a little space)2. Mouse is quite heavy3. back light is fixed and cant be changed4. The illumination is not uniform throughout the keyboardBest keyboard and mouse you can have at this range
4,Good Product üëçPor's1. Backlight on off switch2. Back stank is very good quality.3. RGB colors are good brightness.4. Mouse extra 2 buttons is very good.5. Cabel quality and length is very good.6. Keyboard letter lighting also cool.Con's1. RGB coloring not change this static color only.I am buying this keyboard and mouse in offer so 699 Rs this seriously worth for money.I am loving it
4,"UpdateReceived the product and is functional properly. This product isn't listed on company website and there are no specific drivers for it.  They have fixed lighting and  non custom lightingThe MouseIt is a decent size mouse but if you have big hands consider a proper mouse. It is a standard mouse with no setting and hence shouldn't consider it for gaming at allThe keyboardIt is just you normal membrane keyboard with raised keys. You dont get clicky key feel like with mechanical keys. The lights on this can only be switched on if the SCROLL LOCK is on which is a pain if you work with excel and word.Conclusion. If you want for office work your better with a non light keyboard. If you are going to start gaming then spend a bit more and get a better keyboard and mouse.Received a faulty piece where the F11,F12,part and the pause button were already pressed in and had no spring action. Asked for replacement its been 5 days and yet to receive the replacement product. Will update review if receive the product."
5,"Superb purchass at 790 Rs.Strong build mouse and keyboard, easy to press keys, threaded wires, easy connection.Decent backlit in keyword, easy to identify and press keys in dark.Mouse dpi and clicks are cool.It has only one light mode only switch it off or ONBetter than zebro zeb war and transformer combo."
5,"I AM VERY HAPPY THIS PRODUCT AND I THING THIS IS THE BEST GAMING KEYBOARD AND MOUSE IN THIS PRICE.IT,S ALUMINIUM BODY KEYBOARD GIVES IT A VERY PREMIUM LOOK . AND IT,S MOUSE IS ALSO GOOD.I AM SATISFIED WITH BOTH THE KEYBOARD AND MOUSE.IF YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR A KEYBOARD AND MOUSE COMBO IN THIS BUDGET SEGMENT AND YOU ARE SO CONFUSED TO BUY WHICH ONE.....DON,T THING JUST GO FOR THIS ONE!!!!!!!!VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY PREMIUM KEYBOARD AND MOUSE COMBO!!!!!!"
5,"It is exactly as advertised good responsiveness, can be used for gaming as well as regular day to day work.  One of the best budget rgb keyboard and mouse combo. It is a membrane keyboard but. It gives the feel of a mechanical keyboard RGB is fixed. But it is sufficient.  It‚Äôs has lights for the keys as well not just backlight.  Mouse is sensitive.  And requires a proper surface. Or a mouse pad.  Mouse has a breathing rgb effect.  Although the settings cannot be changed  both have braided cable for enhanced safety"
4,"I dont know much about keyboard keys. So i wil nt talk bot it. Keyboard is having backlit led with breathing keys. Led is constant and no other light setting available other than blue on left, red on mid and green on right side. Keyboard light can be turned On/Off. Mouse has 4 adjustable dpi - low, medium, high, very high with led light. Mouse has no light settings. Its worth buying for 899/- or less."
1,"never complained about any product purchased from Amazonbut the live tech keyboard is pathetic. it just took 2 months for the product to go wrong. the ergonomics is decent. but the product is really bad. there is a problem in the keyboard due to which whenever you press a key, the keystroke continues to get registered unless you press another key. sometimes pressing another key doesnt fix the problem. the first product that i received had some manufacturing issue. that was replaced by amazon within 3 days. no complaints against amazon. but the product itself is really bad. just a waste of money"
3,Product is good if you want to use in dark but brightness is low some keys not visible in the dark like ESC and some multimedia keys but the main keys like all alphabets and other keys are visible. I recommend you to buy if you want a keyboard to use in dark and if you have low budget. Mouse is awesome its rgb looks cool. If you can spend more than thousand then you can go to buy cosmic byte GK its cost is 1200 approx.
5,"It's really an awesome product at this price.I was in a doubt as for the first time I purchased any Live Tech product but after getting this I liked almost everything of it.From packing to the quality this product. Frankly, I'm more than happy to buy this product at Rs. 999."
2,"The product is good but a big disappointment on the keyboard, it's not having a dedicated led backlight on off switch, instaid they have provided the led backlight on off switch on the Scroll Lock button, and due to it one can't at all work in excell or any other platform where we make use of arrow keys to move the Excell cell up down. That's really very annoying. Very very bad work and due to this I give it 2 star's only."
5,Awsome build quality.... Very durable... Also hav a great aesthetic... Thought tht would be a chiklet keyboard.... But its fully mechanical... Only thing is the the rgb is only one mode u can't change it... But kya fark parta hai... üòÇ.. U won't get regret if u buy this.... And special mention best gaming mouse combo u will get in this price
3,Keyboard is not worth the money at all the good thing is it looks good and you will find nothing great in usage the keys are not at all superior to use it's so noisy and loosely fittedI will recommend to send rs200 more and go for the hp gaming keyboard which actually a value for money and really superior keyboard for gaming as well as productivity
5,"it's a decent keyboard for gaming,typing and general purpose. i got it at rs599. Go for It, you won't regret..."
5,Awosome product..bt the keyboard light brightness is low and the rgb light is fixed mode..
4,"Good product at this price range, everything is workin fine yet"
3,Here is my experience! Its a good keyboard for it's price! And my mouse had a sharpe edged one which damaged my mousepad!And the led light on the keyboard are not at all good.
5,Well.. for a Price of 899. its fine. The Combo is good. The RGB keyboard light is fixed but the mouse light changes. Quality is good. Rest working fine.
1,This is the worst keyboard I ever used in lifeWhen ordered this product I received damaged product and after replacement keyboard worked for 20 days only and after 20 days it stopped working. I will strongly recommend you to not buy this keyboard
3,"Not support on linux , led not working on linux. White light not glow constant light colour"
4,"Keyboard is very super and easy to type ita same like mechanicap keyboard and if anyone has used a normal mouse this mouse is also good for them, i suggests to buy this sure i am not lie, goooo for itttt"
3,It is working properly.Buttons are normal feel like a Normal keyboard.Mouse is smooth to move and click.Paint on the space bar is removing a little bit.For the money it was great combo for Rgb lighting.
5,This product is awsome...I really Loved it...This product is very helpfull for gaming useBut only the thing is that Keyboard back light brightness is low..Otherwise the product is awsome and Price is also cheap for those who can buy under 800-900/-
3,Its perfectly amazing but the only problem is when u connect keyboard and turn off Pc and again when u start u need to re insert in port as it wont work
5,I bought it for 790 it's real value for money aluminium frame and its RGB colour is superb mouse changes it's colour and it looks awesome while gaming or doing anything

5,"Before was skeptical in buying the product but given the price it was a good deal. After receiving the product, I was indeed satisfied. Given it's price, the product is worth buying."

1,Don't purchase this product.  Keys are very hard to press . Backlight of this keyboard is very low brightness and you can't control it's brightness.

5,"Iam searching from many days for this, many of the keyboard protectors aren't compatible with my dell inspiron 3501. New inspiron 3501 comes with 6 navigation keys.Quality: It is very thin but give original look of your keyboard.If it is thin we may face problems like keyboard marks on screen after closing."
5,Awesome product..perfect key locations.doesnt fell like it is put on..i was worried about the shutting the laptop but it is so thin that it closes without any contact with the screen.
5,More than the product which fits perfectly for my laptop. The note sent by the seller was something made me a loyal customer. I will also share your products with family n friends. My laptop is DELL inspiron 3505..
5,More than the product which fits perfectly for my laptop. The note sent by the seller was something made me a loyal customer . Have been sharing your products with family n friends.  My laptop is DELL  inspiron 3501.
5,Perfectly fit my dell vostro 15 3500 model. Good silicon rubber
5,As expected
5,Excellent
4,Good
5,Overall it's good and worth of money
4,I like the product.. but cost is soo heavy
1,It is not transparent through the keyboard keys. Not much as expected. Not worth for this money. Don't like this product..
2,"Arrived cover is of good quality, no complaints about that but the size of the cover is not aligning my omen, I think this cover is sized according to the older model, not the newer one."
4,Great keyboard cover.....premium look... Protects from water splashes... Reduced 1star bcz bought a black one not recommended if u use it in dark.
5,Fit exactly on keyboard while typing gives proper grip and protects from dust.
5,Perfectly fits üëå. Bought it to avoid dust accumulation near the keys.best choice.
5,The quality of the product is good and strong
5,Perfect fit...coudnt have been better.. üòÅ
3,Qulity is good but it's not a transparent you cannot see letter with backlight.
1,The keys are not see through. It covers the glowing alphabets. Only the light at the bottom of the keys can be seen after applying this product
3,product fits perfectly on hp omen bt hides keyboard backlight visibility should be more transparent
1,Not good at allIt was wrong one
5,Perfect fit for OMEN
5,I used this on my recently purchased MacBook Air M1. I got a minor scratch on the lid and so started looking for cases. This one fit the bill. It was selling for 1300 and with few cash backs that was on offer by Amazon for I was able to get it for around 1100. I received it nicely packaged next day and it fit the MacBook Air M1 perfectly. I had to push a bit for the snap but nothing alarming. The golden colour is nicely visible through the clear case. They had also provided keyboard cover which is good if you are going to use it open in dusty environment. Also supplied was the trackpad protective layer and some plugs for the USB-C and headphone sockets. Nice touch. I mostly use my setup closed like Clamshell and this is very useful to keep the setup safe.
3,"Overall a decent product with a good build.Pros:1. Good build quality.2. The "" World Map"" pattern on the case is beautiful and gives the laptop a funky look.Cons:1. Once the screen and base cases are fixed, the screen can't be taken all the way back due to the thickness of the cases. This is especially a pain when keeping the laptop on your thighs while sitting on a sofa/bean bag and working as the screen doesn't have the mobility to go right back.2. The base case clips the body only on one side (either left of right) and not both sides.3. The keypad silicon is meant for the 2019 air book model, not for the 2020 model. Another problem with the keypad silicon is the back light can't be seen once the silicon is placed on the keypad."
4,"At the first glance I thought that this might ruin my MacBook but it turns out it fits well. I don't liked the keyboard cover to be honest as you can read from the title & apart from that lid cover makes it heavy so you will notice your screen sliding down backwards. This might damage device so use it at your own risk. Otherwise at Rs.1299 you can't go wrong with this as there is all sort of protection stuff provided like trackpad protector, keyboard cover, port protector, lids."
4,The keypad shown in the pics  resembles the colour of the case but I received a plain black colour keypad which was crushed between the two panels thus making it useless.Otherwise the colour and finish of the product is flawless. Fits fine but a bit more loose than it should be. I don't think it'll be durable for more than 6-8 months again depends upon the kind of a user you are.It is absolutely easy to remove. No hassles what so ever. Colour looks really good on the new MacBook Air.
5,"So when i ordered this, i didn't know that i'l also get free keypad, touch pad etc guards along with the macbook cover.I am a using these macbook pads n covers from last 7 years.. Compared to the previous one which i got at 999, this one is a better deal coz i got extra safety pads too, which will cost you extra Rs 1000 if you'l buy it separately.Definitely a 5 star."
2,"The product is made in China and its fitting is awful the sides doesnt fit at all with macbook air 2020, keypad skin is a film which falls while using. Design is not upto the mark at all.The left side hinge missing which causing the cover to come out. Keyboard skin blows away with slight air.Ended up damaging my Mac air while fitting this"
4,"Pros:1. Case fits the MacBook Air 2020 Intel Model A2179 perfectly. Compact case and offers good protection. I have noticed that the Space Grey A2179 model unlike previous models scratches pretty easily, so this case will definitely prevent further minor scratches.2. Also comes with the keyboard protector, trackpad protector and port plugs which is useful.Cons:1. Matt Black variant leaves many fingerprints which are difficult to remove.2. Trackpad protector doesn't come with instructions and leaves lot of bubbles if applied incorrectly.3. Packaging was bad, could've been better."
2,"Not worth it AT ALL and here‚Äôs why:1. I got this product a few hours ago and have barely used my Mac since I put it on and you can already see finger print marks2. The material is cheap plastic - was expecting some rubbery texture for grip but well. Failed.3. The bottom lid is flimsy - if you pick up your Mac aggressively, it‚Äôll come off slightly. It doesn‚Äôt fit well at all (I use the M1)4. Look at the keyboard guard - it‚Äôs a JOKE. The space key on the guard doesn‚Äôt consider that the actual space key on the M1 is HALF the size. So the space key on the guard covers the key adjacent to the space key as well.Won‚Äôt recommend you to burn 1300 bucks on this ridiculous product. Skip it."
5,"It fits amazingly and is a sturdy cover. The keypad and touchpad covers are superb, it doesn't feel that there's another layer on top of the original thing and it functions smoothly."
4,"Reduced two stars since the case is a fingerprint magnet, and the keyboard cover that came with it isn‚Äôt great quality - it stretched near frequently used keys within a few weeks.Otherwise, the case fits well for my 2018 MacBook Air and protects it well. Opening up the screen beyond a certain angle will face extra friction though."
5,"Price is on higher side.But No compromise on quality. An amazing purchase, but could have been better if range was kept b/w 800-1000 max.Rest keyboard guard, laptop plug covers and mouse guard excited the most as I didn't expected this in box.Thanks amazon"
2,"The product in the ""ADs"" looks very appealing, but isn't worth buying. The images uploaded are from the 2nd day of using my device. I am not a rigorous laptop freak. so imagine what happens with people who are on their laptop for 10-12 hours daily.Rather buy the transparent version, or laptop skins (dbrand, etc.) are recommended for anyone who doesn't like to see fingerprints at all."
5,"Lovely product , came with matt covers , mouse pad shield , rubber pligs for the opening and keyboard guard......its slim and nice!P.s- its for only 2019 / 2018 mac book air"
4,It is a perfect fit for A2179 model. However the trackpad skin was bent and so the sticker keeps coming off.  The thickness of the case is sleek and does not make the laptop heavier.
2,"Well quite disappointed with the product, Product was shown something else on the site, Apple logo was quite visible on the item shown, but when I got the product it's hard plastic material through which apple logo isn't visible at all.It's hard plastic so I guess durability will be there but not happy with what I got.As you can see in the picture, the fitment is also a problem. From the back side of laptop it is not get properly fitting the macbook main body."
4,"I have a Mac Book Air  A2337 (M1), the cover fits very well.I personally did not like the colour that I ordered which is 'Airy Blue'. The products representative image shows a bit of a translucent  sleeve, which I wanted, but this is a solid pastel shade -_-."
4,"Overall the product looks sturdy. But I received it in a bad condition, it was too dusty and the package was in a miserable condition. Including there were scratches on the top cover also with some mark on it but that‚Äôs not visible after application, Can manage tho but the keyboard skin is not worth your penny, it gives a weird look to the laptop and won‚Äôt stick properly. Looking for a replacement."
5,"It is an absolute stunner. My 7 yo daughter using her MacBook Air extensively for her online classes these days, has fallen in love with her Mac after putting up this cover. Looks quite safe too."
1,Pretty much useless. The back cover did not fit my mac a1932 Model 2019. Sheer waste of money. It is strange as to how Amazon has quoted the defective brand as 'bestseller'. Supremely misleading. Avoid wasting time and money on this.
3,"The case is good and durable and cools nice as well. But there are flaws as well. The keyboard cover provided with it doesn‚Äôt fit the macbook. Also the case doesn‚Äôt fit the macbook perfectly from the sides near the speakers, it fit perfectly only on one side and not both the sides at the same time."
2,Brought on september 2019Photo taken August 2020Defect: the Matt lamination on the case started ripping off after two months of use. A good scratch with your nail itself will rip the lamination.Material is good incase of protection.
5,"The packaging was good!the Cover is a beauty, looks stunning and feels so good. When you run your hand over it you can feel the engraving on it. Loving this... Gives an even classier and personalised feel to my MacBook Air.Loved it and it is very useful.the only demerit is, the keyboard cover which fits on the keyboard but some key are not corresponding to the actual keyboard keys.But overall it's all good."
5,"Extremely satisfied with the product. 1 day delivery with prime. you get a keyboard and trackpad protector with it. a good thought is to provide the USB C closing lid with it. minimal use of it but a good thought. overall, the cover is extremely hardy, easy to install (with the guide provided). 10* if I could."
2,The give keyboard silicon is for the older version of MacBook pro .so kindly i need a replacement . Ok the silicon
5,Excellent Product. Fits perfectly. Has rubber studs to fix on female Jack's of MacBook.Has a nice screen guard and mouse guard
5,Awesome perfect fit comes with keyboard cover and cover for all the ports I want to give it 100 stars. Just buy it
5,Fits Macbook perfectly. Good all round protection.Keyboard skin is good but You can't use backlighting of keyboard. Touch pad protector is good
3,The case for lid does not fit well. Bottom case fits perfect. Keyboard cover cuts are perfect but it spoils the aesthetics. The case came with a lot of scratches on it. Not very happy with the product and I am back in the market looking for a case that will protect my mac and not spoil the looks.
2,"Writing this review after 4 month of use. Product quality is not good as per price. Not worth for money it didn‚Äôt last for 2 month n started breaking from corners. No free movement, screen stop at 90degree angle. Once corner breaks you can move screen backward. Not worth more then 3-4 hundred."
5,Perfectly fits the Macbook air 13inch 2019 model. Upper case is too tight to fit though. Macbook becomes little heavy with shell case. Good product with few add ons. But it highly overpriced I feel. If you search in local market you might get it for a better deal
5,"I am happy with the product. Fits well to my Macbook Air 2019 version. Important to check you mac series number before ordering as it is very size specific. Came in good packaging. I have not added the keypad over, only the outer cover, and happy with the results."
3,"I bought this after heavy research and when it came, the top part fit perfectly (and quite beautifully) but the bottom part didn't fit at all. If it locked into place from one side, it wouldn't lock into place at the other side. I'm giving it three stars because if the bottom part had fit, it would have been perfect."
1,Worst case dont waste your money on it it doesn‚Äôt fit the 2020 MacBook properly even if it fits it wont come off i am not able to remove the top and it just looks bad and attracts fingers and the keypad protector also doesn‚Äôt fit properly
4,Fit and finish is okay. It MIGHT protect the MacBook in case you accidentally drop it but will definitely protects from scratch and stain. I haven‚Äôt received the trackpad cover.
4,"The product as such is very good. Value for money. The packaging, however,  was a little crumpled. Even though efforts were taken to ensure that the product stays intact, my cover had a little scratch on it. The silicon keyboard cover is not up to the mark. However, it does its job and does protect my laptop from harm beautifully."
5,"It is a perfect case for Macbook, where we can see the Macbook exterior and get good protection."
5,"Very happy with the product, comes with keyboard protector and touch pad protector too. Very good quality, since it is new I cannot comment on longevity but it looks neat and not too heavy as well"
4,durable product
1,product has factory effect as its one of the corner is going to fit properly by any mean. my product got cracked while doing so. bought it again but different brand
4,"Apart from keyboard cover rest everything was fine. The keyboard cover didn't rest properly, there was no adhesive and it kept moving"
5,"This is such a nice product. I was skeptical choosing the green colour, but it turned out to be even better than the pictures. I am using it with my Macbook Pro and connecting it was seamless. Mac will ask your help to setup this keyboard and once done, you can use it like a normal keyboard. The Windows button on this keyboard will be mapped to the Command key of the mac.In terms of design & aesthetics, it's just stunning. The keystrokes are lovely, there is good enough sound (not too loud) and the overall experience is very good. I type a lot and it doesn't hurt my hands after long typing sessions. You can remove the keys and clean them. It's a beautiful mech keyboard. If you want something different which will not be primarily for gaming, this is your thing. The mouse is good as well, nothing special though.Overall, highly recommend."
5,"I ordered this keyboard because I was in great need of one. It‚Äôs pretty cute and the colours fit perfectly with each other. The green colour scheme coupled with a few white ones make the mechanical key caps pop! It‚Äôs very satisfying to type on and if you‚Äôre looking for a mechanical keyboard with a spunky colour scheme as well as an aesthetic piece of hardware for your computer, go for it. This is the cheapest keyboard (of great quality) available on the market today and I loved this product so much that I simply had to write a review. It‚Äôs a one time investment that‚Äôll last seemingly forever if you look after it and works on batteries which are replaceable.GO FOR IT!!"
5,"I've wanted a fancy mechanical keyboard for so long. This one works just fine. The keys sound amazing. The colors are so pretty in real. The photos couldn't do justice. I actually wanted blue & green versions of this keyboard too but settled on this one cuz they look like yummy candies. Enough about the looks, this actually works pretty well. The mouse is perfectly sized and snug in your hands. It was a bit fast in the start but then I adjusted the settings in my laptop now it works just like how I wanted it to. The keys are a bit closely set together but you'll eventually get used to it. I mean this is my third day and (I write a hell lot of essays) I'm already used to it. I play a decent amount of RPG games too and I love using this keyboard for light gaming. One suggestion I have for the manufacturers is about the indicator lights.  They are placed on the slope of the rounded edge of the keyboard and I can't really sometimes see if the caps lock is on or not. But that's just a minor issue. Really love this product and highly recommend it. If i find anything I don't like about it in the future I will update the review.p.s forgive my lq grainy pics."
5,Satisfied is an understatement for this keyboard. It hits the mechanical type satisfaction to a 100%
1,"Hi,Here I will try to type my feedback with this keyboard, with my regular typing speed. You may guess how busy the keys are in the keyboard.Very cluttered, here is the typing without correcting them:I was impress witgh the desigbn abd thought it could be a very good kjeytboard for mne, but aftewr getting it, I am trying to type with my regular spoeed anbd you can judge ghow vbad the key arrangements are in this keyboiard.The same pareagraph if I type with my old keytbopard, I will not have these many mistakes for suyre. as the keys are well arranfged there.overall, not happy with the keyboard. also overpriced.Thanks,"
1,"Ohh..my...godd.. looking at the previous reviews and all, I thought it'd be great to own this keyboard, but in all honesty, it looks like something an 11 yr old kid would own. It's just not suited to anything I can imagine owning.Secondly, it doesn't fit the Mac environment. The keys for volume controls don't work, and the brightness settings are set on num lock and the next key.I could recommend this to people who like owning candy themed accessories, that they hardly use. For everyone else, I'd strongly recommend against this purchase."
5,"I love the keyboard! The quality is great and looks very aesthetic. The sound of the keys is veryy satisfying and I definately recomment buying it! Was delivered within 2 days which was really quick! And it is worth the cost. By looking at the photos I thought that the keyboard and mouse would be a little smaller in size but its perfect! And also I faced this problem so here is a little tip - There will be a Protective film on all the batteries so remove that and there will also be a film on the mouse on the white part (Look in the photo) remove that film its very thin so might be hard to remove. It might prevent you from smoothly run the cursor so removing that helps. And yes, Batteries ARE included!"
4,"If you're planning to buy this considering it has mechanical keys type , then it's strict no no . Otherwise the product looks good in terms of appearance. The letters are printed without proper alignment. It's a little bulky-feel keyboard with thick round edges. Overall It does justice to the retro keyboard style."
5,Excellent colours and amazing typing experience
4,"It's a nice looking keyboard with good build quality. One issue is since it has round keys as compared to square that we are generally accustomed of, it takes time to adjust and very often it leads to mistypes.Mouse is also quite ergonomic and respond nicely on any surface"
4,"I have been using them 2-3 dats max and believe me i am impressed with their looks , functionality. Operating with this keyboard/mouse combo is not problematic. It is very easy to get them setup ising the nano receiver within the mouse . All in all nice product but yes price can be a little less ."
4,Look wise it's a beauty. It's truly a novelty item. You will take some time to operate it as comfortable as your old keyboard. Function wise there is a room for improvement. Missing the mechanical sound experience. Mouse is bit big in size which makes it less convenient.
5,~Its produces sound which is relaxing and looks exactly as shown in the picture...connects to usb port dongle given in the mouse's battery section~using it for a month now no issues faced!~nice alternative for those very costly typewriter keyboards and is aesthetic looking!
5,"We all remember the old school key boards and mouse. This feels exactly the same. Both the keyboard and mouse are good. No lags detected so far. I use it for office purpose. If you're looking for gaming , this isn't for you."
5,"I was very skeptical about buying this product but it‚Äôs one of my best purchases. I was very confused between the pink and the green, n I‚Äôm glad I choose the green. It‚Äôs very soothing on the eye compared to the to pink one. It‚Äôs worth buying if u want to feel the nostalgia of typewriters."
1,"Contrary to the positive reviews which led me to try this out, keyboard is not comfortable to type on. I spend > 8hrs a day typing/coding. The fingers don't rest comfortably and it's difficult to type fast. I'm using a Thinkpad T460s and I'm back to it's keyboard."
5,"On time delivery, key board is same as expected,colour is also same as display in picture, use keyboard sice 1 months,no problem till the date,keys are very smooth and typing noise is osum. Mouse also looks good,works smooth and hold in Pam perfectly... overall happy with performance ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
4,"Nice, feels like type writer.Work efficiently.Mouse is super cute.Sounds like a normal keyboard typewriter type.But overall super cute.Not for gaming"
5,I bought this Product for personal use and office use for my huawei t5 tab and the quality plus delivery service and packaging was great. As the product got delivered today so this is my review for now. After 1month of usage I'll share my experience too
1,few keys are not working. please help to get it replace. i bought it on 2 may 2021 from amazon.
4,Cute design..works well!!
2,"The keys are placed very close to each other, found this extremely difficult to type on"
5,Both keyboard and mouse are great. The look is also great.
4,Good quality. Exactly same as shown in pictures.
4,Aesthetic looks..works fine but my upper most keywords are not working...
5,Very very good. Working as expected.
4,Good built in awesome colour really love it üòä
5,If you haven't used it than you hane seen nothing
4,Good Quality product. Easy to use
4,"Pretty cute! Love the light build, doesn't give too much of a plasticy feel, even the mouse is really nice to hold and the clacky sounds are just gorgeous! Like ASMR while working, it's so satisfying to work on! Only problem is it'll take a while to adjust to. The keys are closer together so I end up pressing the wrong ones or two at once. It's gonna take a while, but it'll be good practice. Overall it's worth it!"
5,Awesome product must buy it
4,Good product and easy to use. Quality might be a bit better
4,"Useful product to avoid wrist pain and provides good elbow support while working long hours using monitors, keyboard and mouse. It helps maintaining posture. I have attached it to my chair armrest, which is much more comfortable. I didn't find it that comportable while attaching it to the table and it cannot support your body weight while leaning your hands on it without any support at the bottom. Hence if you handle it carefully it is a good and useful product."
5,"Finish and fitting of this product is great. Is also waterproof if in case the liquid is spilled on the cover, but if on your laptop or sides of cover then maybe the liquid will find its way and can damage your keyboard but dust will not bother the keyboard.This is definitely for the Acer Nitro 5 and 7 as I'm using it on the 7 series and go for the black keyboard not for transparent one.Also i have uploaded some pics to show the working of keyboard cover in day and night. During day time it is 5/5 stars. But for the text on the keyboard disappears when lights are off and the keyboard light will not penetrate through the texts. Also when the lights are off your have to use the screen brightness to lowest and for this there are 2 pics where the brightness is lowest and 10% ( at 10% the text is somewhat visible on phone camera but not with naked eyes ). Only this is the thing when i find difficult to use keyboard and had to remove the cover or brighten the screen."
5,I love keyboard protectors made by this company.This is my third purchase.They look so sophisticated and  feel good too. Very well crafted to fit the keys perfectly. Good grip and no issues with number and letter visibility as well.The last one which I bought still has not been completely rendered useless after so many years of usage.
4,"Amazing product, it fits perfectly for my Acer pradator hilios 300 (17.3 inch Display). After 3 days of continuous search, I made a right choice.Guys, trust me best product and just 350 Rs. ( Value for money and ur gaming laptop for its pant üòâ).Please don't think, just go for it blindly ...One thing is very clear the key travel migh reduce a bit however doesn't take ur gaming experience!"
4,Great product.Fits perfect for acer nitro 5 2020 model(i5 10th gen).Nice and smooth key finish far better than ‚Çπ50 skin.slightly overpriced but its not easily available in local markets so no other option.Only downside is usage at night. The backlit led cannot be seen on keys.
4,"It's a perfect fit for acer nitro-5 (2019,i5-9th gen).. model... Just loved the fitting n design..I brought black one..its much better den transparent..go for black..Though there is ONE MISTAKE that they have printed upper arrow 'triangle symbol ""  in downwards direction..even there sample photo they have same mistake.. .. -1 star for that MISTAKE..But it covers the keyboard, so thats kool..!!So Overall great product...!Thank u seller & Amazon..!!"
4,Product is good but the stick/ fit is not the strong.
3,"The function keys and numeric pad on left side doesn't fit. Although, I does covers all the alphabet keys. I am keeping it cuz I don't thing there are better options out there for nitro series laptop. Also, it sticks with the keyboard and no dust can enter inside keys. It just can do the work."
3,"Not compatable for my laptop keyboard. My keyboard calculator ""+"" is bigger and this cover ""+"" is very small. I requested for returning the product 2 weeks back. No one came to pick that and no refund initiated.Bad customer service."
5,Good looking slim and soft material used and feel soft while typing
5,Cover provided exactly matched my keys and no gap.Got black with clear model.Backlight of keyboard also optimum.
5,Good protector
3,"Quality is good, fits perfectly well the only con is it defeats the purpose of backlit keyboard. Keys are fully covered so that you can't see them in dark correctly."
3,its nice but surface gets finger impressions and dust adhesion
2,The product I received is neither ultra thin nor transparent. But the quality is good.
5,Must buy if you are in search of a long lasting keyboard cover.
2,"After placing this protection cover, i see that keyboard keys are not visible in the night even the backlight is on"
3,The keys are not visible in dark room even after the backlight keyboard. See the photo that i have submitted. You'll notice.
1,"This is absurd product, although it fits perfectly it kills your backlit , if you work in dark dont buy .."
4,This product should have transparent keys other than that it's super
5,The best keyboard skin u can get for acer nitro 5 i5 10th gen.
4,Overall nice product but expected the product to a bit more transparent in quality
1,vest of money i purchased it but stickiness is not good.
1,product specifications are misleading. It does not fit on Acer Nitro 5 AN-515
5,I got what I wanted
4,Good product
1,We can't see the key letters in the dark
4,Good quality keyboard Protector.....Fits Perfectly.....
5,it is very useful
5,Overpriced.. But serves the purpose
5,It is a perfect fit for AN515-43
3,Thick and sheerness
1,Not as per keyboard standard
1,It doesn't fit
4,Good
4,Its good one.
5,It's good!!
4,Way too expensive
5,Good product. Perfectly fits Acer Nitro 5. But keyboard is not that visible.
5,Nice and best fit for Acer predator Helios 300 17.3 inch laptop
3,The skin look good so far. Fits perfectly on my Dell Inspiron 15 5509 keyboard. The only issue is that it dims the lighting of the back lit keyboard.
4,"It is Goid fits accurately to my keyboard. The cost is bit Higher but the cheap ones do not offer any quality near the price u pay for them. This one is better only minor issue is some buttons have bit puffed up due to daily use, but yes really minor issue."
5,The product is very good and it is(transparent skin) good for backlit keyboard and dosent dim it.
1,It is useless as we cannot see the backlit keys through this.
5,Nice
4,Value for money
5,Good product
3,One problem is it hides any light from original keyboard. Example caps lock button has a small indicator which glows when caps lock is turned on but in this case since the cover is black everytime it has to be lifted ro see the indicator.....bit irritating
5,"I wrote a review for the Black one, which wasn‚Äôt compatible with backlit keyboard. But then I opted for a replacement with clear one. And voila, this feels great. As you can see in the image the fit and flare and compatibility with the backlit is absolutely great. Saco has got this one done perfectly. Wish they rectify the issue with color versions soon."
2,"Like me many customers are facing the same issue... Since the difference is too minute to be noticed while online purchase. They are buying round edge keyboard skin instead of square.. I think this can be replaced by the Amazon, atleast with a delivery charge.. This skin is completely waste for the customer since skin will be compressed by the screen while closing the lid. So can't use."
4,"It's really thin as promised, and sticks in its place. The fit is almost perfect. The keyboard edges are straight and the cover are curved but that's not an issue."
3,"While they have mentioned it that this skin fits keyboard with straight corners not the rounded ones, the one I received is with rounded corners that doesn't fit perfectly over the straight corners of my hp dk0093au. Also, I had opted for black with clear back, but recieved an all translucent one. On top of it, it took some 10 days to reach me. Disappointed with the seller. Having said that, product seems good in all other aspects. I'll have to return it nevertheless. Bummer :("
5,"Product is of good quality fits good firmly but only thing is that u can‚Äôt see the back light of ur keyboard if it‚Äôs available and the caps key light followed by airplane key, etc u can‚Äôt see the on /off light of those keys"
4,"Nice product, value for money  ,without any gumming or sticker based glue etc.  Fit on Laptop key board for HP 360 laptop . You can keep this all the time over key board for any dust protection also."
2,Incompatible with HP pavilion x360 Ba075tx 14inch bcoz of edge button curve
5,I am surprised / more happy that it fits very smooth to my14inch hp laptop that look like the keyboard is part of laptop itself.....Fantastic super mind blowing product......A must purchase product ..blindly go for it .....value for money üí∞.Thanks Amazon ..you made me more happy-go-lucky....!!!
4,keyboard skin is perfectly suitable for my HP Pavilion x360 14 cd0087TU Laptop. Only minor problem is backlight keyboard is useless once skin is applied as all letter are covered by skin and it will be slightly difficult to use keyboard at night time.
5,Amazing product from saco .durability of product is good and keep your keyboard dust free and also increase the shinning of keyboard (black colour).
3,The caps lock light as well as the sound light cannot be seen and has visibility issues for tying in low light as well. Would recommend you to go for the transparent one instead of the black colour.
5,"Perfect fit for the laptop keyboard and hence good protection from dirt, dust and wear & tear of buttons due to usage."
4,"The keyguard  fits properly on the laptop. It feels like a part of the laptop when placed on the keyboard. Only drawback is, since it is black color, the backlit keyboard is helpful as it blocks the light. I was expecting the skin to be a little transparent. The product works good."
3,"It suddenly falls down when I turn the laptop into tablet mode. Also, keypad lights aren't effective when this skin is placed on the keypad."
5,"It fits perfectly to 14 inch HP Pavilion. Doesn't slip or move at all. No problem with typing also. Only con is the price. Personally I feel the price is a bit more, but then no issues with the production quality. Perfect!"
1,"Problem with the product is it comes out while typing, it does not stick to keys properly. And also surely its not comfortable for typing also. It does not stick to key board,  not even at ends. PRODUCT IS WAY OVERLY CHARGED."
3,Good for the price point. however to minor issues.Check if the function keys map properly.The caps lock led is blocked and you cant tell without typing if its on or not.
4,Good protection to the laptop keyboard. And its perfectly fitting to my HP Pavilion x360 14 cd0087TU Laptop. But I feel the gap between the keyboard & this cover when typing. That only has to be improved by manufacturer.
2,"Backlight of the keyboard can't be seen since no transparent material is used on white markings its all black plastic behind.Caps lock - is on or off, can't say since it blocks the light Although fits the keyboard."
5,It exactly fits for hp pavlion x360 which I bought in usa and indian piece
3,Adhesion is good but dust still gets through to laptop interiors. Gets stuck with the keys and malfunctions. Okay product I would say.
5,"Nice material, look wise very nice, and perfectly fitted on my 14 inch hp laptop.Go for it"
3,Wheb i received the cover and applied it over the keyboard it was good as it cover whole keyboard and no gap between them. But within a week it started expanding and then there is noticable gap between some of the places.
5,"MUST BUT PRODUCTS,ON WILL GET USED TO IT ONCE ATTCHED ON KEYBOARD ,BUY DIFFERNET COLOURS FOR DIFFENRENT LOOKS, COMPANY SHOULD MAKE MORE COLOURS FOR 7 DAYS LOOK EACH DAY DIFFERNT FEEL ."
4,"perfect one to the 14"" laptop keyboard. Instead of black and clear color, full clear color will be better why because keypad light option become worth less by the black color of buttons."
5,"Value for money,all the features are okay but only thing is not up to mark i.e it is not fully transparent.but you may use USB light for lighting...."
3,Letters have no visibility for backlit. Should be priced lower.
2,Keyboard cover is not in proper size the corner button as u can see in the cover is rounded but in laptop its sharp.
5,Nice product and perfect for 10th gen i7 x360 model.
1,Poor quality product. Does not fit with the size of of the keyboard. Waste of money! Requested for return within ten minutes after receiving the product. Would not recommend it at all...!!!
3,"I cannot work in the dark with it on. Also, after a few months of use, it has stretched up because of the heat. So, it doesn't fit snugly anymore. It's a bummer."
4,Good quality producd. Does it's work. But the edges are rounded whereas my laptop hp pavallion x360 keys are squarish so it does not have snug fit but it's ok
4,Perfect fit . I have HP 14s CF 3028 and its fits perfectly for every 14 in hp laptop. But at caps lock and mute button there is only print for on amd off . There is not hole made so it's an issue .
5,must go for it..thank u dealer and amazon
3,"Does not stick too well. Within a few days started coming off the stickyness.Otherwise, still working."
5,A perfect fitNice lookProtection from dustCovered by broken popped up key
3,It's not a good product as expected as it not fits up properly and also slides away Everytime front my intact keyboard . It was protection I think and it also ruins my show of backlit keyboard which are great when they are switched on but it is opaque It doesn't let the light come
5,"THIS IS BLACK AND WORTH USING, PROTECTS YOUR KEYBOARD FROM YOUR DIRTY HANDS,MUST BUY"
5,Very good for my x360 hp laptop
5,Good
5,"Its just wonderful.Amazing performance , and typing experience is unbeleivable."
2,It turned out to be faulty as many letter buttons are not functioning.Therefore I request you to either replace with a  good item or return my money.Early response to this is greatly appreciated
4,"This is one of the best combo of keyboard and mouse. I am using it over a long time and have no issues.Pros-1. long and strong wires which have tough insulation.2. hard USB plug don't become loose soon.3. standard size and easy to clean4. mostly keyboard has problem that wire become loose and get damage from where it comes out from keyboard, but not in with this.5. mouse is very fine quality left-right clicks are very responsive even after one year of heavy use.6. best for desktop usecons.1. because of wired not useful for laptops which have only 2-3 USB ports even long wires make it mess.2. dust attractive plastic3. not for heavy gaming"
5,"- Both K&M are great. The typing experience on the keyboard is great. My hand tends towards larger size still the mouse fits perfectly under the palm with comfortable grip. The best thing about wired K/M is that they never glitch/lag and you don't have to worry about battery draining quickly.- I primarily use it for coding and other light office work and for light gaming.- The extra function keys at the top of the keyboard provide convenient way of playback controls which laptops provide with an extra ""Fn"" key, settings of which can be quite irritating.Overall, pretty happy with the quality of Logitech. The price point of 1099 seems just about right as well."
5,"Extremely delightful keyboard.I might be biased towards Logitech, then again there is a reason for it.For many years, Logitech has been consistently providing me with quality products and never left anything missing for complaint.Keyboard, mouse and other such personal interaction devices are matter of personal choice. Someone the ergonomics and product usability of Logitech is extremely suitable for me.Wonderful product and I would suggest / recommend this to anyone who wishes to have something worthwhile, longer lasting a fair price."
2,"I majorly ordered this because of the keyboard. The keyboard is made up of very low-quality plastic. Not a good typing experience if you are planning for long hours of typing on this. For playing games, it will require more pressure on typing then the regular ones. It registers keystroke slow as compared to its competitors.Mouse if okay. Not so great and not so bad. Its an average. It gets the work done."
4,Got on time. Typing from the same keyboard. Its good one. Keys are smooth and not getting stuck. Just feel that menu button beside right control key is a slightly bigger which sometimes presses while typing. Rest everything is fine....bought it at Rs.907 with mouse so for me value for money at this price. Go for it.
5,Got m100 b100r etc. Mouse before none worked for gaming purpose the mouse that comes with this combo works always like a charm for gaming but you have to buy this combo as mouse is not available seperately go for it have been using it for 4 years to play battlefield 3
5,"I am in fact typing this with the same keyboard. It is a great combo, I must say. The mouse is sharp and has a nice design. I already had this product a few years ago. It has been in the market for a few years. But it is still purchased a lot. I would really recommend it to anyone. I am a student who has to type things a lot. It really is a comfort for me to type now. It really has a FEATHER TOUCH"
2,"The keyboard was okay when I bought back in 2016 and after a year the keyboard keys are not working properly, it is like having dust in your food while eating. Frustration starts from second year but some how managed to use it for 4 years. Previously had internet pro keyboard and it works still great with my old PC from 2004. This product is waste of money and you will get frustrated as time passes. Mouse is okay till now."
4,"So far both have been working smoothly and it's been a few months since it was purchased. I originally had an old TVS keyboard and nothing comes even close to it in terms of durability. But the keys in this keyboard don't make that annoying clicking sound while typing, so all's fine."
5,Keyboard and Mouse working as expected. INR sign added on Keyboard is good feature. I'm using Logitek keyboard for last 10 years and I can say this keyboard is heavily improved.Mouse is little heavy as compared to Wireless Mouse which I'm using for last couple of years.Go for it without any hesitation.
2,"It turned out to be faulty as many letter buttons are not functioning like d, k, shift+).Therefore I request you to either replace with a good item or return my money.Early response to this is greatly appreciated. This was purchased on 3rd July 2020. It's not expected from Amazon. Please do your needful unless we will lost faith to order on Amazon."
4,"I am a programmer and I am using this combo for 1 month now, initially I faced difficulties typing faster but after 1 week or so I got used to it and now I am much faster. Although I prefer mechanical but this will also do your job. It's not very sound making keyboard. The other functions keys are really helpful like mute, volume up etc. Mouse is a bit big and little heavy but I am ok with it, intact I like it very much."
3,The only problem in this otherwise good keyboard is that the USB receiver is too large. It does not fit into the mouse and is separate so has to be taken care of since it can get lost. All wireless mouses now have a small usb receiver that fits in the back next to the batteries. This is not designed well.
5,"The keyboard is nice, has a good feel and just the right tactical feedback (and click sound). It is a simple keyboard so not much to write/review, just looks fine and works fine. Was plug-and-play with a Windows 10 system and no complaints. I was using a nearly identical (wireless, this is cord) keyboard so feels right as it was before. Good product, nothing fancy, I recommend it."
5,"The product is excellent. I am fully satisfied with the product. In key board, almost no sound on typing and mouse is good."
5,"Both the keyboard and mouse received in well packed condition.  The keyboard is however troublesome.  Right now letter ""S""  is not very easy to use.  I feel cheated.  As business ethics demand Amazon please get me replacement."
4,"Good for productive work, gamers please stay away.. but its also not that bad for gaming but not that good too.. its sleek,light weight and those multifunctional keys come very handy. The mouse came with it is also good fits properly in the hand Also I have notice the red light on the grey part of the mouse coming from side to back its not that noticeable you have to look but close activates once you move the mouse same time as the sensor lights up"
1,"The keys have become very hard to use in just 2 months of using.  There is no dirt on the keyboard, so it looks like a design problem.Half the times the letters don't appear on the screen because the key is hard to press.  It was fine when it arrived."
5,Earlier was use a wireless keys and mouse however due to lockdown the batteries kept running out very fast so decided to have a wired keyboard and mouse.Keyboard and mouse quality is really good
5,"Great keyboard and mouse combination from Logitech! The keys are soft to press and the response is good. Both are plug'n'play and get detected easily. Suitable for general computer use, coding and casual gaming. Not suitable for games which require multiple key press combinations."
5,"Bought it for Rs 770/-  to replace my beaten down HP keyboard and half working Dragon War Leviathon mouse.Keyboard is simply awesome while the mouse isn't too bad.Pros :1. Play,Pause,Volume UP,DOWN and MUTE keys are given in the keyboard for easy access2. calculator option is the most useful for me3. Keys are soft to pressCons :1. Keyboard surface is rough and attracts dust."
5,"Nice keyboard and mouse combo. The main advantage of this keyboard is its having multimedia keys like play pause, mute, volume up and down which are very handy. The keys are pretty good for fast typing."
5,"There are gaming series like Steel, there are ergonomic ones but the best of both worlds for just the apt price is Logitech.It's actually Logical to buy tech of this brand"
4,"This is probably the best combination available at this price. It's really cheap and it gets the job done.The keyboard isn't quite good enough if you type really fast (like me), but you can't expect it at this price range.The mouse works for about 18 months before it's likely to fail - under regular usage.I'd recommend it for anyone with a budget under Rs. 1000."
1,"Within 3 months of purchase the keys are not working trying to toggle between program shuts down the entire system.  If pressed some keys double entry happens.  I've used Logitech keyboard earlier and was very amazed at its performance, but really disappointed with this one"
5,"Both the products work smoothly. Keypads are easily pressable & well separated. This combination is worth buying in this price range. No harm in buying, value for money."
1,"I have noticed many times that randomly keys stop working. I had purchased two keyboards during lockdown, logitech and hp. HP price is even less, but it is working fine. I would not recommend logitech based on my experience. Right now, even after multiple restart of my computer, same keys are not working. One rating is given because, even if some keys are not working, keyboard is of no use."
4,"The keyboard is holding up well so far - standard Logitech quality. Some amount of squeak and wobble in the keys, but not unbearable. I am a fairly heavy typist, so it could be just me.The mouse is also a standard Logitech mouse. I have large hands, so it lets me down from an ergonomics point of view."
1,Hardly a month since purchase and buttons do not work properly. I have to punch it like Mike Tyson first a few times and it suddenly starts working. Better to avoid.
5,"Keys are very soft and quality material, design is very slim and good, keys are working like charm and like key shortcuts for mail, music and etc.,"
5,I was Facing latency issue with Bluetooth keyboard and mouse so I bought this and I am totally happy with its quality with respect to price
5,"Been using it for 7 months now. I do programming and type whole day. I think for the price, it is really very good combo. I will buy it again if I need to."
5,Using this model for many yearsNow I ordered same for AmazonThis keyboard and mouse are very good quality and have comfortable to uesFor heavy work load
4,"I have used couple of Y-SZ49 model in the past and they are undoubtedly great. This one seems a bit downgraded version but not in terms of quality, only in terms of overall shape, design and size. It is little bit smaller then the old model but that does not create any problem as such.At the end of the day, A true Logitech Quality product."
4,When it's logistics you can't complain so 5star for Logitech but the packing from the seller was really poor so one star less.Product is really cool keys are soft that's what I always wanted and the size is total perfect. Mouse is good to compare to price can't complain
4,"Good design and timely delivery from amazon and very fast.. nicely packed and specifications were clear on what we are getting. For the asking price compared to other wired keyboards, key board build quality can be better."
2,Product is not good as per Logitech standards as mouse is very rough to move keyboard is ok. Better go for wireless version as previous I had wireless version it was awesome.I bought wired because I wanted to avoid battery usage
1,"I raised the warranty nobody minded it, now am searching for valid customer service to go and repair there, this is all happening within 30days"
5,Bought this second time. purchased logitech wireless keyboard and mouse and was not satisfied with the product quality ( bought it from different seller) This seller is awesome. No complaints at all. logitech brand is good as they provide 3 years of warranty. writing this review after using this product for 2 months.
4,>All the markings are correct.>The keys have good contrast.>Does allow backlight to pass through from the gaps between the keys.>But keys aren't distinguishable in the dark as their material is fully opaque
3,Don't buy if the letters on the keyboard has light! the cover will block that light. We can get only light of keyboard from the surroundings of the keys
4,Has a snug fit on My Predator Helios300  2020 .. could be around 250 inr but ok ... Bought it as only option present currently ...
5,budget friendly fits well for acer  nitro 5 and looks premium unlike the regular covers
2,the thickness not upto the mark that they shownbut better than other products
1,Really poor visibility of keyboard lights in dark.Adhesion not good enough.I'd suggest for any other brand.
3,It was okay product.
1,Very poor quality...worthless
5,Good product
4,Nice
5,"Generally this k4000m device is a slim thin form factor model. I will consider this as a good choice for professionals in typing. Silent usage and no issues with the typing and USB connectivity of the keyboard. I read that the keys are chiclet and laser printed, both doing a good job, just best at their part. Almost 2 meter cable with thick outer braids, integrated multimedia is real help when you want to save time. Best buy after an overall usage review."
5,"Consider me a worker who doesn't wanna annoy ppl around me with loud and noisy keyboard clicks. After returning multiple keyboards which were to work silent didn‚Äôt do so, i chose  K4000M and now i would say with full hope on the brand, this is the chosen one. Overall silent operation with the keys, just pushing your fingers out once it clicks on it. Feather-like feel and no noise at all. Apart from this, the printing on keys looks good quality and the USB is so quick it reads the keyboard very fast."
5,"Simple and well structured design for a full sized keyboard. The key spacing is exact without much gaps, the fingers are well reachable. Braided cable looks and feels rigid, with a well mouled USB connector. Key press feel with the chiclet feel is real add on value, soft on finger tips. Easy connectivity with your PC or Laptop directly without USB hubs, coz the cable is of 2 mtrs. Approx. Multimedia keys are of good use, helpful at times. 5star rated keyboard for sure."
5,"Quick review for looking out to buy soft feel keyboards, this one is a gem. Zebronics IT goods are famous for ages, this one's a keeper of it. Light feel, good design and the blackness of the keyboard is so eye-catching. Multimedia controls, Braided cable and chiclet keys all features set the bar high by this keyboard. No clicking noise trouble, comfortable without finger fatigue and design is flaw free, with a pretty long braided cable."
5,"I did a lot of research to buy the best keyboard for Office and Casual Gaming like CSGO etc.I had used multiple keyboards(Dell wireless, Logitech) including Logitech MX keyboards which is priced around 13k.The Build quality, smooth keyboard surface, and Chiclet sound key typing experience are same compared to Logitech MX, the best things is the price, which is obsoletely un believable  for such build quality.If you are looking minimal key travel like MAC BOOK PRO or ANY Lenovo/Dell Laptop kind of experience I would gladly inform you to go to a head without any further Research. which is a GEM for this price.I hope this helps some one."
1,Ok product not good for everyone. Specially space key is very uncomfortable while typing.
1,Disappointed.
3,Keyboard has ghosting issue serious one. You cant press s d and i at the same time. Other than that there is no problem. My Rs. 300 keyboard works fine. What a waste. I dont know why the S D I press at once when holding won't register as an button input. The uneven back lighting I can live with that.Delivery of package was good. I recieved the box a bit crumpled. I am giving it a 3 star
5,"Writing this review is very emotional for me as I had to bid goodbye to it today. It was like an extension of my body for over 2 YEARS. It was one of the best keyboards I have used.I bought it in January of 2017 for ‚Çπ2000. Since then this keyboard has gone through a lot of torture. I play games a lot and many times I would hit the keys brutally during intense moments (READ RAGING). Nothing happened to it though. During it's service, it had tea/water/cold drinks spilled on it multiple times. Cleaning the keyboard and drying it was more than enough to get back at playing. The RGB Light intensity didn't reduce over the years. The Blue light is exactly the same as that of Logitech so it paired well with my G300S and G402. The Red is the same as that of the fans of my case so it was a match there too.Here are some of the PROSThe FN Keys are really handy along with swappable ""WASD"" and ARROW KEYS.The Wristrest is big enough and although made of plastic does not irritate the skin.It's a silent,""laptop like"" keys. Great for late night gaming.The keys are spaced apart perfectly FOR MY HAND SIZE. So no fatigue over long durations.But it has a few CONS too.Some of the keys (Spacebar, Backspace, etc) are not completely lit and it looks kind of bad but they are not easily noticeable.The RED BAND along the bottom stands out when the keyboard lights up in some other color.The Numbers in the NUMPAD never worked for me. Might be a software problem.To conclude, I would say that if you are not head over heels for Mechanical or ""Mechanical Feel"" keyboards, this is a good and durable keyboard."
1,"Positive:1. RGB works2. Keyboard has a nice matte finish3. The keys are soft to press and overall responsive4. The logo is nice addition5. Price - and it was a lesson (dont buy cheap)Cons:1. The size of the keys is unconventional, i play CS GO and when replacing my lenovo keyboard assumed that the manufacturer will follow standards prevalent. But herein the keys are larger than normal which resulted in me having to change my game play (cannot duck anymore or in the middle of a busy firefight i end up on my windows desktop page!)2. Return policy of Amazon requires the product to be defective, damaged or not functioning. Hence i cannot replace this useless piece of junk because Amazon is more than happy to ship this back to me, albeit in a new packaging. When your product isnt in line with the prevalent manufacturing standards you (Amazon) need to have an option to return the product and for pete's sake just provide store credit if not a refund.Very disappointed Amazon.3."
5,My first gaming keyboard very good experience this keyboard thanks Amazon and redragon i love you
5,"I bought this keyboard for my second computer, which I use for typing. My main computer already has a Razer Huntsman Mini. I do a lot of typing and I have a high speed of about 110WPM(Words per minute) I know that I should have bought a Mechanical keyboard because they are fast at typing, But I just found this Shiva keyboard and I bought it because I have used Redragon's Phaser mouse as a budget temporary mouse so I thought let's buy a budget gaming membrane keyboard that also has macro keys. Even though it only cost me only about Rs2000 which compared to the Huntsman which cost over Rs14000 this keyboard exactly felt like I was typing in a Huntsman this is so good. It even has a consistent clear RGB that most of the budget gaming keyboard doesn't have. Most of the budget gaming keyboard has RGB that shines at some point and then there will be a part where there is no RGB. Love it"
1,The product is not good for gaming...u cannot use multiple keys at the same time...i was playing cod and pubg...its the worst experience u can't peek while sprinting...while i m playing cod. Cant use socrestreaks when i press something not working in a way it should be...irrtating...the only thing good about this rgb lighting...worst buying experience..by time realised where was the problem..the return window time closed...to this product...ita a shame..
4,"Upgrading from a mechanical Dragonwar keyboard in a pandemic lockdown.I chose The Redragon Karura K502 as it was affordable and I love a good matt finish on keyboards although it is very difficult to keep it dust and stain free.Also, I've never done serious gaming (FPS games) with a membrane keyboard which has island style chicklet type keys. It looks very sophisticated. It is one of the quietest keyboards I've used come across and would highly recommend it for someone who has to type a lot and does not quite like the clickety-clack sound of keys. As of now I don't find any issues with the space bar key not registering or the enter key being too small or far away for the right pinky finger as noted by some fellow owners of this keyboard.It does take some time to get used to typing on it as the keys are spaced out (low profile membrane keyboard, much like them Apple Macbooks) but i believe that happens with every time one changes keyboards.Backlight on the lazer engraved letters on the key caps is not uniform but its definitely better than what I was using, so no complaints there for me. Font could have been better.I received the keyboard one day earlier than its scheduled delivery. Thank you Amazon India."
4,"UPDATE ( after 3 months of use)I made it 4 start instead of 5. My reasons are:1. few keys started giving trouble ( which are bigger in size, like backspace keys, alt keys, ctrl keys)2. one clip/stand is broken without any reason. ( i care of my belonging, this was super surprise to me. i don't have any pets who could broke it.)3. its very inconvenient for me as this keyboard don't have a ""scroll lock"" indicator) instead a win lock indicator which is not of any use.Final Verdict, this is still a decent keboard with back-light and worth the money.----------------------------------------------------original review:This is one of the best membrane keyboard available. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you are a gamer or not. If you are looking for silent keyboard with backlight, go for this one. Build quality is very good.This similar to a keyboard by Razer - DeathStalker which is almost 3 times the price of this, plus redragon‚Äôs build quality is better than razer. So don‚Äôt get fooled by razer and get this one."
5,"Man, for real this keyboard is so good. It has everything said on the description and the rgb lighting is really cool. This is my first rgb mechanical keyboard and I really love it. No problems so far and I would recommend this keyboard to all. For real tho, the name of this keyboard read with the brand name is the best way to flex haha"
3,"update :left ctrl+shift developed ghosting issue. Those keys works individually but failed to execute any shortcut together. Awful experience while coding :(================A great RGB backlit keyboard with soft chiklet feeling.You get lot of keyboard lighting options including different color combination static as well as breathing style. You can increase or decrease frequency of backlit flashing.Typing is comfortable and have good feedback.cons:Little time to get used to small '\' button.will attract dust, cover it whenever possible"
5,The only proper RGB gamming keyboard at this price.Value for money decent built quality no complaints.The palmrest feels better when compared to laptopsWell placed. I would have preferred the keyboard ergonomic to be a bit curved which would have made the product ideally perfect none the less great keyboard.
5,I wanted to get a mechanical onebut decide to go for membrane onethere are 6 setting for rgb but it goes to its default setting every time you start your computeror unplug itso keep that in mind before buyingstealth clicks for night gaming that's how i would put it.no one will know your gaming in the night :Dif your working from home this keyboard would be a best choice since it doesn't make sound when clicking buttons no one gets disturbed.mechanical ones make too much noisethere isn't any software from redragon to control the lights for this model.using it for 7 months with no issues.
1,Please do not order this product as the seller is displaying the version 2 of the keyboard which has the backspace and spacebar buttons changed and the also has a rainbow light mode...whereas they are shipping out the older version which is way dimmer than the new one. Had to return the product as it was not what i expected for my pc setup. Very disappointed.
5,"I had surfed the net for a good gaming keyboard within a budget limit of INR1500 (because I am not a pro gamer, I just use for coding and mid-level gaming). To my luck, I got the Redragon Karura K502 in the set limit (Festive offer). Came in good packaged condition, bubble wrapped, a user manual and a Redragon sticker.Pro-1. Has all the customizable RGB functions as specified in the description, the keys sound pretty decent and are very responsive, delivering good feedback that is satisfying during gaming sessions.2. The braided cable and gold plated USB pin is to be mentioned as a very good option to be included as none of its other competing counterparts offer them.3. The wrist rest is also to be highlighted because no other keyboard in this range offers a good space that supports wrists during longer usage periods.4. The undersurface has three rubber grips for arresting any sort of keyboard movement against the table or wherever it is placed.My overall rating for the keyboard is a 5/5. I wouldn't spend a lot going for high end stuff and this keyboard has covered all of my expectations. All I would be worried (if I have to be) is the key life, but I've known it to be a durable product as a person has been using it for 2 years and still going strong. Recommended product."
5,"This is a gorgeous keyboard! I haven't tested it completely, but preliminary use was very good. The switchable backlight feature is great! The different colors are amazing. Plus I wanted a low profile keyboard to relieve pain while typing with a traditional keyboard. The only thing missing are the right Windows key and the context menu button (the one that appears as a list next to the right Windows key on a traditional keyboard). I'll provide an update later."
4,"When I was left with my earlier keyboard not working..i found this on amazon and this is first backlighted keyboard. Delivery services and packaging was okay. When i opened the box i instantly liked this keyboard. The first thing you will notice is its looks and build quality. Looks better in hand. It has good rgb lighting pattern and can be changed easily....though can give you a bit of confusion but the manual will come to rescue then. It has some matte finish but can get easy scratches with very sharp objects. So i recommend you to use carefully. Typing is easy with this but if a key is pressed too long the key gets struck in that pressed condition. And same goes for gaming like A,S,D,E keys gets struck. Otherwise it is a very beautiful keyboard but is a bit tough"
3,the price can be a bit less.  there are number of keyboards lower price than this which have keys softer than this....betters its price reduced in the 1200 to 1300 range
2,"The backlighting of the keys are not uniform. Some keys are partially lit. I wish i could have paid attention to the detailed reviews in this section prior to purchasing. And now i can only replace but not get a refund. Already initiated replacement process; hope they ship a better product this time.Also, the packaging was damaged and all seals broken."
1,"Absolute garbage. The first time I ordered it, many of the keys weren't backlit properly, as shown in the photo. The f1 and all f keys were not working. On replacement I was facing the exact same issue. My refund process took more than a month. Very disappointed in Amazon and Redragon. This retailer has no ethics and made my purchase a miserable one. My order went out on 20th December 2017, I got my refund on 9th February 2018. Don't go for this garbage chicklet keyboard."
4,"Lighting - Amazing. (Especially in the dark)Keys - All functional. No issues found.Typing Speed - Need time to get used to it.Design - Too Good.Weight - LightUSB cord - one of the best, if not the best wiring that I have seen.Only issue I found is that due to sweat, hand print comes on the key board mostly the palms. So those areas will be a slightly blacker. Its not so visible always unless you see it in certain angles."
4,"Good priceReally worth the valueNice feelPalm rest is amazingNice back lit and key lit ledNice colorsBuilt is good tooDetachable keys, easy to clean"
4,"I received my order today and was very disappointed.Firstly the Keyboard is silent AF, but it does take time getting used to. There are 7 backlight colors which are good overall but on keys like space bar and the backspace, it fails to illuminate the complete button.I could have rated it 5, but as the subject line says it differs from the original product, as per the video reviews and photos posted on Amazon, it should have a few lighting effects like rainbow lights, running lights, but the delivered keyboard has everything except the extra effect for which the keyboard is popular in a budget gaming range.I suggest waiting for it to drop down by Rs 200- Rs 300 to compensate for the missing functions, I am still unclear if the Reddragon decided to remove it or if the retailer imported the wrong model of this key board.Also, Avoid using the quick function while playing games as most of them dont support these features.Edit 2: Received a Karura 1 instead of 2, why amazon why?"
5,"This is my first gaming key board and trust me its worth it. if u want a mechanical keyboard with rgb and of a good brand but u dont have the budget, then this is for you,  the rgb is absolutely magnificent , this is a semi mechanical key board , it does not have that much of sound but the feeling is of a mechanical keyboard. this is very good for late night gaming if u dont want your key board to make a lot of noise. another good thing is that it has a hand rest which again improves the look. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT."
5,It's good just go for it good wrist rest which is deatchable and this is more than u expect if ur lokking for a memebrane keyboard which is fells like mechanical one and is way quiter that it just go for it it's extremely good
5,"There are hundreds of -ve reviews about it. But still i bought this because it like simplicity, yet lively with RGB and a must have wrist support.Cant comment about durability. Will Play BF1, BF5, Fortnite, TC: Wildlands and update later."
4,It is very good for typing and gaming but if you game on it extensively it will clear the paint off the keycaps as they're not black keycaps but clear ones painted black and my A key has a small hole in it after daily use of 2 years and my s key has small dent in it overall the quality of the keycaps is decent but not good if you're going to use it 3hrs on a daily basis
3,First impressions give off a premium feel & keyboard looks excellent to eyes but keys could have been more evenly lit along with more vibrant printing to give a more premium feel (maybe due to its price). The keyboard material attracts lots of dirt especially oil based from hands & get very harder to clean & maybe never same the same look as untouched after usage. But overall it is fine.
5,"Amazing Gaming keyboard with ""best in class Rgb""Really handy and smooth Chiklet keysButton Precision is Good7 Rgb colours with 6 different Modes to choose withGot this for ‚Çπ1399Multimedia Keys"
4,"The keyboard has a very good mechanical feeling to its keys. Rubberised texture truly elevates the look. RGB is really great. Looks really good, evenly distributed and has a lot of modes to play with. It even has a dedicated software. The arm rest is easily detachable and is also good looking. The only caveat is that the spring in the space bar really does make a racket, although I'm willing to put up with that, since I really like everything about this Keyboard."
4,"I have been using the Redragon Karura K502 keyboard for a year now. I bought this for 1249 rupees. This seems like a copy of Razor Death Stalker keyboard which is more expensive one.So they made two version of this keyboard. The one which I got is the new version. I will tell you what they improved in the new version, you can watch reviews on youtube for the old and new one. To distinguish the new one is the see the transparent stripe on the space bar. The new version of the keyboard has a short stripe on space bar as compared to the long stripe.In the older version , keys were mushy and inconsistent. Like for example , keys were hard to press and the space bar was not uniform ( if the press keys from the end point , they might work , you had to press in the middle). The new version improved on this one. It seems they added some reinforcement down there so if I press the space from the end point , the whole thing goes down and work.Using for a year , a key started to malfunction. For me the right arrow key registers more input even if I press it ones. I will press the right arrow key one time and it will register like 15 or 20 key strokes which is definitely very annoying sometimes. Sometimes this issues resolves itself and sometimes this issues comes back. So I never thought of complaining to support service. Other than that all keys works fine.One things I noticed , I used the Dell chiclet style keyboard and the keys over there are hard to press. while on redragon keyboard , I really like the keys on this one , atleast on the new version. They are soft to press and It gives me pleasure of some sort typing on this thing right now.For me , this keyboard is really good typing, it takes a while to get it used to as the never used a chiclet style keyboard. This keyboard is silent but not that silent , over the year keys are making more sound , my space bar makes a buzzing sound idk why , maybe the spring or the enforcement down there.Some of the cons I noticed are :if your device loosed power , it will go back to the original lightning effect , the rainbow flashing one which i am not a fan of . So everytime when I trun on the pc , I have to cycle through the color which I like.If your keyboard is provided power if the pc is in sleep mode , the color will not change.One major con is the back light on this keyboard.  Light Color are not accurate, if the put it on the yellow light effect , some keys are not yellow but reddish and it is issues with most color. the red , blue and green does not have this problem but other color especially if you want to use white color only, some keys , like left most or arrow keys lookes  red which really bothers me. I think this is the deal with every model out there.If someon1e out there is thinking that this keyboard will not acquire dust , maybe you are right but dust can definitely get under the keys , but the thing I like is that dust will not get under the actual circuit board as there is some leverage under the keys.I love this keyboard except that malfunctional key and the inconsistent light on this . Other than that I love typing on the keyboard and palm rest is quite good too.PS : I not a big gamer , I don't know much and test that gaming functions but I don't care about those things."
2,"Others have already listed the pros of it, so I will not go into that.My primary concern with this keyboard is that the CTRL+L-SHIFT combinations did not work.The first time I received this keyboard, I thought this might be a fault in the unit itself, replaced it, got the same defect once again.Looking up online, this seems to be a common issue with this keyboard (might be an inherent defect itself).For me, most of my work revolves around keyboard-shortcuts, many of which are CTRL+SHIFT combinations (I am a programmer).  Yes, you can circumvent this issue by using the R-Shift button, but I do not want to change my habits because of this one single model.Even the cheapest keyboard I have used so far (350‚Çπ) supports these combinations."
3,"This is nice keyboard according to its built quality, keys, lightning and at this price race, this keyboard is not so bad. But there are some usability issues and some good qualities of Keyboard listed below:Issues:1. Some keys are tight while some are not. So it need extra pressure as compare to other keys. For example in my keyboard, Shift key need more pressure than other while Esc. key is too sensitive to press.2. Some keys are noisy while others are not. Here same, shift key is more noisy and other are silent.3. Lighting brightness is not enough. In daytime the lights look diminish due to low intensity.Good Features:1. Slim keys: Which make it compatible with both gaming and programming purpose.2. There are 7 colour and so many lighting modes available in this keyboard which make it appear nice and attractive at this price range.3. It's builtin Palmrest is very nice and satisfactory.4. Windows key lock feature available which is rarely found in this price range5. Doesn't require any driver, just Plug and Play!If you will tolerate the issues(however they are not too much irritating, I am ok ok satisfied), you can go for this Keyboard because it's giving you many features at this price range.And finally IRONY is: I am typing Demerits of Karura 502 using Karura 502 !"
1,"First of all the delivery was really bad, the outside box was damaged and the keyboard box seemed like it was opened by someone else. The tape was cut and the inside keyboard cover was messep up. It also does not contain any user manual as mentioned above. When i pulled the keyboard out of the box the F9 button cap was missing, it was inside the keyboard box. Also the spacebar button is really bad. It doesn't work unless you press it quite hard. In games spacebar button is really significant and if the spacebar button is not working properly then it's useless.I wouldn't recomment this keyboard at all. It's very dissappointing that the gaming keyboard itself is bad for gaming. And you also don't have an option of returning the item which also triggered the flag for me. In the end what i mean is this keyboard is bad for gaming and you can't even return it and get a refund."
3,"I had to return the product.Being a mac book pro user, i am used to it's key distance, key travel, and softness.This keyboard was rough on my palms. While pressing a key, the edges of other keys were touch the palm and fingers, wearing the palm out in a few hours.Although, the build quality of product was very good. It just didn't fit my use case. Might work for you if your use case is gaming."
5,"I prefer this keyboard over a mechanical keyboard because this one doesn't make any noise and i can play peacefully late at night.RGB is beautiful, feel and weight of the keyboard is very good. I play fps games ans this keyboard did improve my peeking as well crouch spamming abilities. Won a lot of 1v1 situations in the game."
2,"I got the Keyboard by suggestion of my friend.Its looks cool,have some cool feature,but it is not cool in real,its pretty poor in quality.1.When i got this keyborad 1st time its SPACE key was not working properly,Amazon[cloudtail] was unable to replace that so they gave me refund2.After few days i got another one this time everything was fine,but after 2 month i was feeling Input lag,unresponsive input,suddenly fully stop working while in gaming.3.So i contact Reddragon support,they reffer me the seller to replace the product.4.I try to contact seller Cloudtail[Amazon],it was a long story,after a long run i sent a e-mail to the seller yesterday,they didnt reply yet,lets see what they do..SO I THINK THIS IS A POOR PRODUCT,SO I WAS WASTING MY TIME TO REVIEW THIS PRODUCT.by the way i m giving 2 star for its cool feature,its cool at that price"
5,Its been 1 month i have been using the keybord . No issues till now . The keys r soft n does not make too much sound while pressing and its good to work at night without  distrubing others at home . it has 7 rgb colours . The colours can be set acording to u . it has breathing mode colours n other features . u can go for it if u want a  good keybord at this price point . most important it has a hand rest space on it so u can  work on ur bed with comfort.
5,I like the overall look and feel of the keyboard looks nice and performance is also goodThe only thing i find less is brightness of keyboard its good for dark room but in day light it hardly visible but if it is no issue for you then go for it the palm rest feels very comfortable the keyboard gives premium feel under a budgetI give the product 5 starsAnd for seller 1 the seller gives me refurbished product the box condition is very bad theres scratches on the palm  rest i am saying it refurbished as look at the box there is a delivery sticker teared down and also the seal the box is seal by a cello tape
1,"I bought the keyboard 3 times and I had to return it all the times just because it was defective. Keys don't work. Very cheap quality keys and build material. I won't suggest this keyboard to anyone, not for this price. This keyboard isn't even worth 1000/- . Total waste, if you are thinking for the long term, I would suggest you to extend your budget a bit and go for Corsair K55 RGB keyboard. You won't regret it."
3,"cons- ""Anti Ghosting Keyboard; 19 conflict free keys"" - all left ctrl+left shift key combos are ghosted. huge PITA while programming- softness of key press are wildly inconsistent. especially space bar is too soft- notches on F, J and 5 on numpad can be barely felt. should've been made a lot more prominent- color profile is not saved- oil magnet- ""4 backlight brightness levels"" - only 3. 4th is offpros- backlit with chiclet keys. only characters are lit, no annoying bleeding light- sturdy. negligible body flexing- good wire- quiet keys for late night coding- windows key lock for gaming. NICE- wrist rest"
5,"I bought the portronics one it cost around 1000 rupeesIt's far better than that oneTrust me guys, slim and compact designSUPER LARGE LCD DISPLAYAnd, the interesting thing is.. The stylus/pen can be attached with this writing padSo, I am not worried to loose itThere might be other optionsbut, TRUST ME JUST BUY ITTHIS IS THE BEST ONE"
5,"Very durable, nor problem so far. Love that the pen is attachable so it doesn‚Äôt get lost. Its lightweight thats good for kids its ultra thin and writing is actually quite satisfying"
5,"Really impressive,  value for money, Go ahead guys, just buy it. üëçüëç"
2,"As the title stated, the lines are SO thick. It might be fine for a child to use it for drawing and coloring but if you are a student who requires it for writing down formulae/sums, I definitely would advise you to look for a better alternatives. The stylus is flat and makes holding it a pain, and the brightness is very dim. Better buy portronics, I had one before and it works 100 times better than this."
5,Very useful for kids. Easy to use
5,Good For ChildEasy to useInteresting üëçüëç
5,Easy to use for kids Supperb Quality. Very Smooth to move pen Easy to delete. Highly recommend.
1,Screen damage and delete key not working highly dispointed
5,Best product in this price
3,Third grade product . Stopped working in an hour.
2,See the pic
5,"I think, It's a good product according to price and specifications. I would suggest others to buy it and use it."
5,My baby like to use this. Electric slide and pencil. It is easy to use and light weight.
2,I think its overpriced but as there's no alternative available for the lenovo model so they are overcharging. Otherwise fit and finish is good
5,It is perfectly fitted to keyboard nice product
1,Not suitable for lenova idea pad slim 5
5,"The keyboard protector works as advertised. It's great to block out dust particles from entering the keyboard, it has a soft touch and it cancels out the typing noise of the keyboard. The transparent protector which I purchased is also good for the backlit keyboard of the HP Pavilion x360 14-ba073tx for which also it fits perfectly. The only difference between 14-ba075tx and 14-ba073tx is the CPU, rest everything is same. I've been using this product for almost 2 weeks now and I am quite satisfied with it. I purchased this from Amazon at Rs. 355. I'm sure it might be available in local shops for a cheaper price but Amazon provides service and replacement (in case of wrong product, etc) which local shop owners are not able to provide. Also, almost every time I enquired locally, it was not available in shops and they advised me to buy it online."
5,"My Problem;Actually speakers were just above keyboard (1 cm) and same with the trackpad. That's why a standard silicon cover was not suitable; which was either covering speakers or half of my trackpad. It's a great product if you have the same problem.For quality;I'll say you'll like naked keyboard instead of the cover, but any cover has the same problem. Overall it's awesome as my first impressions.My Review ?? Why;Actually wrote this review for typing test with cover, I'll say pretty impressive. :)Scope of Improvement;If touch experience could have been better I would 4x the amount of my purchase but sadly only 1 quality is available.I'm having a 14"" hp dk00093."
5,"Pretty good. It will fit all Pavilion x360 14inch laptops and also 14inch HP notebooks.I liked it. It fits ON the keys, and stays there. Good adhesion. But I'm not sure how it will stay if you fold your laptop and then use it roughly. It will stay stuck, but due to rough use, it might not stay for long. I have put tapes on the short sides of it. But It should have at least sticky/adhesive corners."
4,Its design is super fit.Great visibility of keys.Never interact (press) with other keys while typing.Moreover good product for this price.You can check my photos I fixed with it.
3,It is as good as plastic if i would put plastic instead of it than it will be same not adhesive as should be and it is not fit as it should be it is coming out again and again .And I have sat this again and again . Not satisfied at all. Tad it is soft but in case of protection you can just put plastic wrap instead of it.
5,"Perfect fit. Does the job well. Had got the black one sent by mistake , requested for the transparent one. Replaced promptly. Maybe I Will update review after a few months..."
5,"Worth it. There's no dust that can go between the keys, which saves us a lot of issues. This is highly recommended for people that sweat on their palms as it provides great friction. Ensure to clean it often."
1,After 4 months button C and V are out of fit now it causing issue in eyes when seeing these numbersSo surely it is not a good product.
5,Good quality and fits exactly as described.Before buying please go through the instructions

5,Very good and perfect fit for HP X360 pavilion 14 inches laptop
5,Amazing keyboard skin. Perfectly fit with my HP - 14 ba152tx. Transparent and fit.
4,"I think this company is selling laptop accessories with a sheer hike in price that is not at all justified, I think the company needs to reduce the price of these products, the product i have purchased is not at all worth more than 150 Rs but still they are charging 370 Rs for it. Although the product is good."
5,Perfect fit. Thank you.
4,"Adhesion isn't the best, but the keyboard skin is reusable. Although, be careful how you wash and dry it, otherwise water droplets cause some issue with visibility. Fits the newer keyboard layout of HP Pavilion 14 dv0054tu. Overall, a good product, gives you good value for money."
3,It is a good product &  infact it is very thin and just feels like as if it is not present and I love it but it is not value for money price should be around 200-250 . But since it is the only available option I bought it and you can buy it too. It is a satisfactory product. Definately you can try it.
1,Product aacha hai.. perfect hai.. but 50 rupee ka cheej ko Amazon 370 ka sold kar raha hai..bahut galat baat hai.. customer ko luut raha hai ye loog.. local market is best for these types of products.
5,"perfect for my HP pavilion 14 inch laptop, clear tranparency. I can not talk about durability. Until now it is fulfilling the purpose. I think cost rs.355 is bit high."
5,A perfectly engineered piece of work nice fit just perfect no dust inlet. The silicon material is washable  and the person who has designed it deserves a salute. He has shown a perfect work  its just soooo perfect as fit
4,This product is really worth the priceüëçI love it...if I could leave one feedback for thr future of this product I would say that the product should have a little more glue beneatg so tht it fits well to the keyboard and doesn‚Äôt keep moving....
5,It's good...the keys are clear but it doesn't stay in place easily moves away but that's probably because it's just fits on the keys..
4,"Very useful for laptops and quality is also decent, you can definitely give a try this product, i am little bit disappointed with price ( little higher ), otherwise its very goid product,  its fit on my hp pavilion x360 dw0068tu."

1,Very Poor Quality don't buy this product but no response seller to Amazon bed bed bed quality and castomar service
1,The size is much bigger than I ordered... And it was too old and not good in quality for use
3,"At first I received a broken keyboard. But I was replaced with a better one within few days. Packaging was better too...And the MRP is 400. ‚Çπ , so please don't think that u got it on an attractive offer üòÇ (where the product price is 799‚Çπ and you got it for 380‚Çπ)ü§∑"
5,I would give 5* for its low price and also it fits the purpose as mentioned in the description
5,Nice
5,Good
5,Great keyboard.Enough Quality as per price.
4,Nice product.... Very smooth key and light weight key board
1,Become defective with in 2 months
4,Working fine
1,Keypad is broken. Will initiate return
2,Good
5,Super product everyone can buy it is very expensive everyone can buy I am very happy buy it is useful
3,Hard keys
1,"I had initially given this 5 star rating but after a month of use, the keyboard has started giving me problems, the keys just remains pressed and the letters keep getting typed at random, say I press letter 'a' once but on the screen it will change to something like 'aaaaaaaaaaaa' and so on. It is become difficult to use the keyboard. I visited the HP website to register the product and enforce the one year warranty that apparently came with the product, but after several attempts all I get is a message that ""Invalid Product Code"" or invalid ""Product Serial No."" which means it is probably not a genuine HP product either"
4,Its look too big and requires lot of space.Apart from that everything is great its looks slim and mouse is perfect fit in hand.Always buy combo because one USB socket required for both keyboard and mouseIf you buy separate then you need teo USB port for both keyboard and mouse.Go with this HP keyboard and mouse combo
3,"Pros:- a good deal- BT connectivity is good- easy to set up- mouse is okay and ergonomically feels good- keys are smoothCons- battery that was provided with the purchase was dead and the battery indicator on the keyboard didn't pick it up. I was thinking something was wrong with the connection as the keyboard showed up as connected but wasn't able to connect anything. It took me so much time to figure this out- the top row keys are pretty much useless since the markings are in black, it is really hard to see what is what until you flex your eyes- keyboard feels very compact and most of the times, I mistype. May be I was used to a much broader keyboardNo indicator of number lock and caps lock whatsoever. This leads to lots of mistyping"
1,Looking at the box made me realise that it's quite old and poorly shipped. Later I checked and could see the side of key board broken.
2,"The Keyboard was really very good, apparently the mouse that came along with this product did not work at all. The Right click was completely out of order. Although I tried to change the settings, only left click was working.Finally within few hours of receiving this product, I had to initiate a return process.HP products are loosing their momentum .... Looks like they have almost run out of steam without much innovations happening."
2,"I would recommend dont buy this product. I was not impressed with the keyboard as the keys are short (though the layout is big) and you don't feel of using the key board. The mouse stopped working and now I need to take it to service centre. In Bangalore, there is only one Service Centre (at Jayanagar) and unfortunately, I have travelled all the way there. I do not recommend this... Prefer to buy these products from some other manufacturer."
5,This is the best keyboard and mouse. I love it üòòüòªüòò If you want to buy slim keyboard and mouse just order this.Mouse is suitable for gaming and normal use and keyboard is awesomeüòçüòç
4,"Had purchased a Dell KM117 wireless keyboard+mouse combo last year. So this is a review comparing both.Keyboard* The keyboard is not exactly compact, but hey, it's a full layout with the number pad, so it's expected to be big.* Keys itself feel like cheap plastic, and a bit wobbly. Can hear kind of a rolling dice sound while lifting the keyboard up! :) Compared to an old HP PS/2 keyboard, these keys feel cheap.* No capslock/scrolllock/numlock LEDs.* People who love a standard QWERTY US-EN layout should be okay with this one. The Dell KM117 keyboard had a better feel to the keys, however it didn't have the right click menu key, Print Screen only with Fn etc.Mouse* Mouse is a decent one - considering the price range. Comparing the Dell/Logitech mice I had used over years, the movement is very smooth.* It also has a CPI button for adjusting the sensitivity.  Could be useful for gamers.* What appeared to be side grips on the photograps are not rubber, it's plastic again.All in all. 4/5. Go for it if you'r looking for a cheap keyboard/mouse combo."
1,"It's the worst piece of keyboard, I have to press so hard a button so that a word gets typed on screen, sometimes it if it gets press easily, it prints the word several times the same letter. Overall the keyboard is not even useful for simple typing. If we perform ctrl+any key (operation) then the keyboard doesn't work at all. I didn't expect this from HP!!! Talking about mouse it's better."
5,I was looking for a wireless keyboard and mouse combo for mainly my office work. And I've found the perfect product. This was the only product listed that had a full size chiclet keyboard and mouse with different dpi. This combo jas helped my work desk being less cluttered with cables and the look of both devices is very subtle.Only two things I was not a fan of were that first the scroll wheel could have been a little free and it would be better if the mouse didn't have any light feels gimmicky to me.Otherwise an excellent product.
2,Bought this unit in Sept 2020. The mouse stopped working and did not connect after 1 month of use and the keyboard also developed a manufacturing defect and the hyphen key (not used often) is getting pressed on its own. The product is useless and has a cheap design and feel. Not recommended.
1,"Ctrl key stop working after 9 days of purchase, I am looking for replacement of the product but the replacement time period (which is very limited 10 days) has expired. @Amazon please stop selling #Fake products, if it is not Fake give me #Replacement. If i don't get replacement i will stop using Amazon and will start with Flipcart."
1,The combo is just perfect. Only thing missing is backlight option on keyboard.STOPPED WORKING AFTER WITHIN 4 MONTHS. BETTER BUY WIRED MOUSE KEYBOARD COMBO. ANY WIRELESS ONES ARE UNSTABLE AND SHORT LIFE SPAN.
3,"Does the job. Works with both mac and windows, although you need to remember key combinations for mac. It is more of a looker than a productive/functional device.Caps lock indiacator would've be perfect but again, does the job. Keys are okay.Mouse too is okay, but I occassionally face issues with reception when I have other bluetooth or metal surfaces on the desk.Haven't found anything else at this price point that works with both mac and windows."
2,Although the keyboard is of good quality I had a hard time with the mouse. If it goes to sleep and you try to use it again there seems to be an issue. To resolve this I have to remove the batteries and put it back. Even that doesn't work sometime and I have to repeat it until you see the light fully come on.I would not recommend this product for the price point it is at currently. Really disappointed by the poor quality from HP
2,Keys are having some issues. It gets stuck in pressed position which affects duplicate characters in your documents and code. With this price and with this defect its not worth buying. Thickness is comfortable to use.
1,"TOTAL WASTE1. Keyboard doesn't have any LED indication for Caps Lock, Num Pad or Scroll Lock2. It interfers with 2.4GHz WiFi. Have to get another wired keyboard and mouse.Feel cheated, as there was no disclaimer about the possible interference."
1,Battery life is just 24 hours and your battery will die. I have used nippo which was used by me for 3 working days (8hour shift) and in Duracell it's 5 days max.Don't buy the product supplier won't reply you.
2,Mouse : Silent and smooth .Key board : Average. No indicators provided for CapsLock and NumLock. Multimedia buttons may be little larger.  Battery indicator is not working.
1,"Ordered two for my daughters, one was faulty and mouse was not working, ordered for replacement, looks like vendour is still not giving a new delivery date, if not interested please refund and take the return."
1,"Mouse was not supplied with keyboard, neither the USB..."
5,"Im full fledge software engineer heavy duty on keyboards and mouse, so it may be an reason it only took 3 months to replace keyboard and mouse battery.But as far as confort and way this keyboard is designed is awesome.Its a complete value for money, I recommand this keyboard only thing is battery backup.Company please look into this issue, either make extra battries for keyboard and mouse find another solutions. Thanks"
5,Product is okay and fantastic. But i can't use it in my pc so i have to return it. In my laptop working fine but it stop working in my pc. I update my os and then reflash my windows but unfortunately results is nothing. So its my bad luck that i can't use this and have to return now
5,Its nice. Everready 2 AAA in mouse and 1AAA in keyboard lasts for around 1 month. So my biggest fear is gone.Hp keyboard‚Äôs are best dont go for other brands.
2,Cheap plastic finish. Not worthy of brand hp. Expected a much better finish product. Extremely disappointed.
5,For Ergonomic use very good. Compact and also feel free to move it around
1,"Product is faulty.. calling customer care but ten day exchange window is closed ,so can't help, calling hp but no response... pathetic service and product both.."
1,Not working keyboard not supporting with the usb receiver and no indication in the keyboard to know if it's connected or not....Don't buy these.  Not worth the money
1,The finish of the product is average. The mouse which came along with the keyboard stopped working on the second day. I will not at all recommend this product.
1,"Doesn‚Äôt work for 10 days. After few days of working. Some of the key are not working. Unable to return or refund due to return policy is completed Amazon said. Have to contact HP customer care.

5,"Having used professional graphics drawing pen tablets at work for image manipulation and for free hand drawings, I wanted to buy one for home use to complete assignments and work on my hobby projects. My considerations were that the tablet should not need repeated charging and should be packed with all the professional features i could get in my budget. After careful consideration and research on numerous brands and models and comparing features I shortlisted and purchased the Huion H610 Pro V2 from the renowned Huion stable. I've worked on Huion tablet models before and have found them to be good. I've received, configured and used the product for a few days and my research and decision have paid off and below are my observations and review for it.Looks, Feel and Functionality:‚óè The Huion Inspiroy H610 Pro V2 came in a professional branded box with the Tablet and all the accessories neatly packed and organised. The box top is foam cushion lined on the inside for protection and contents include the Huion H610 Pro V2 tablet, the Battery-Free pen PW100, the mini USB cable, the pen holder and the 8 pen nibs cleverly housed inside the screw open pen holder and the quick start guide.‚óè The Tablet looks sleek, smart and stylish. I feel that the working area is really good and is ample space to work on, for any creative project. The soft pad below the tab gives it an anti-slip strong grip on any surface and keeps it fixed to assigned spot. The last thing you want is for the tablet to move or shift while doing delicate work. The tablet itself is really lightweight making it portable. There is a green indication light above the 8 vertical express key shortcut console. On the top horizontally are the 16 Hot cell soft keys which can be configured for ease of use. Connectivity is using the Mini-USB that is provided and the tablet draws power from the connected laptop/desktop and there is no charging of tablet required separately. I really appreciate that the slot for the Min-Usb cable is shouldered by the device itself creating a immovable connection with the cable and protects both the slot and the cable from damage. Durability ensured for a long time.‚óè It took me just around 10-15 minutes to get used to the pen and start using it creatively as an extension of my hand. Pen movement is smooth and gliding without any jitters or disconnects and the movement is very smoothly translated to the screen with no perceptible lag. The pen features double customisable press keys for switch brush and right click button. One of my requirements and favourite features is the fact there is no charging required. It can frustrating to be in the mood to work and then waiting hours for devices to charge, so that problem is totally resolved for me. Just connect and get to work. Although I don't see the nibs wearing out frequently, they have provided 8 additional nibs so that it takes care of replacement requirement for many years as per my estimation. They're neatly arranged and hidden inside the pen holder which can be screwed open to access them. The bottom of the pen holder also has the provision to properly remove and replace the nibs and there are small neat diagrams on the bottom of the pen holder illustrating the exact process to follow.‚óè Configuration is easy and convenient. I'm using a Macbook pro on MacOS Sierra 10.12.6 so I could use even without downloading the drivers. However I will upgrade OS and the device drivers soon. Currently they need to be download from the Huion website (link to download is provided on quick start guide) and I feel that Huion could have provided the drivers on CD/DVD for quick access. However I'm only saying this as my Macbook Pro features a DVD slot and I see how pointless it would be for the Mac Air models which don't have a DVD slot or for the latest PC versions which don't either. With the all systems online with high speed internet and huge data limits, I don't see this as a big problem.‚óè This Review would be incomplete without mentioning the 2 big features that make this tablet tower head and shoulders above other brands and models. The ¬±60-Degree pen tilt function is uncommon in other tablets and the latest in the cutting edge technology which Huion has incorporated in their latest offering. This product comes with tilt recognition function on the pen which is the key in providing better pressure detection and accurate cursor position depending on the different angles you're positioning the pen at. Excellent for free hand drawings and art work. Creatively, it is bang on target giving enhanced control and gives you more accurate drawing experience as per your liking. I am also pleasantly surprised with the 8192 pressure sensitivity which is almost double of other normal tablets and is highly responsive and feels very natural. The combination of the tilt function and the 8192 sensitivity gives you control over the greatest artistic expression you could have on a digital input device. I'm simply blown away by the functionality this brings to my artistic work.‚óè I am regularly using the tab now with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator effortlessly. It is also compatible with numerous other software including Corel painter, Manga studio, clip studio, Zbrush, Krita, Gimp to name a few. The Huion Tablet comes with a 1 year warranty and a renowned customer care acclaimed for their quick and reliable support, for peace of mind.Verdict:With a reasonable price range when compared with other tablets and models, the latest features functioning in tandem with some great hardware, this professional graphics drawing pen tablet holds it own against some of the best names in the business. Needless to say, I'm very impressed with the looks, multi-functionality and great artistic licence this device provides. I'm really enjoying working on this and will recommend this without hesitation. Go for it."
5,"I'm a digital marketer and a part-time doodler and I've to conduct several presentations for my company. I got my hand on this new range of Huion H610 of version2.; that remarkably defines my presentation with ease. With PowerPoint to taking quick annotation is a great time saver with using this tablet.I got my tablet in prompt delivery and installed latest Huion driver from their website, as box consists one battery-free pen; which has 8192 pressure sensitivity that is excellent to use with lightweight ergonomic design and tablet itself has robust built quality and premium finish that features 8 customizable express buttons on the side and on the top it has 16 hot cells for more advanced user. The drawing area of 10""x6"" gives extensive drawing space to work; also the cool pen holder which comes with 8-extra nibs; that's kind of sweet from the Huion brand.This newer iteration of H610; has OTG functionality, but package includes no OTG dongle inside as you can buy it separately as I did, bought it outside to connect it easily via my phone. I use Android device of Android 8.1(Oreo) version; as no more hitch in connecting via Pc or laptop; as I can go light with this tablet; that makes it portable-friendly. As its support, great drawing app like Sketchbook, Medibeng, Photoshop sketch, Bamboo paper, and Pen Up to name a few.In my field of expertise,¬† I do have to use lots of Infographics and design in Photoshop for a quick mockup for the ads. Also evaluating the designs and making speedy amendments is speedier than ever with having this tablet. With this tablet, I can select a faster image selection within Photoshop. The¬† Powerpoint slideshows and animations are faster to execute too.In a nutshell, this tablet has extremely practical usability that is available in the genuine rate at the market over the other counterpart available in the market. It certainly defines the work process into a whole new horizon; I'm truly content as I own this tablet; I truly recommend to you all."
4,"Disclaimer! This is my first drawing tablet so cannot really claim it to be the best. The tablet has some nice features, like chargeless stylus. The pen holder is also very nice. Would have loved if this had a usb-c cable, which are more common nowadays. The tablet surface is smooth, I tape a A4 sheet of paper to get the right feeling.  The plastic nibs wear out very fast, but if you keep rotating them while drawing, they will work fine. At Aliexpress you can get a bunch of these nibs for a 100 bucks. make sure to download the appropriate drivers before using the tablet. I particularly love the size of the tablet since it perfectly replicates the 14 inch laptop that i use along with it. If you are like me and want to test out drawing tablets, you can give this brand a try."
5,"This is a very good product from Huion. Finish is good. Working area is quite big and good for use it for PC or Laptop and even Mobile. The pen doesn't reuire any charge, so there is no need to worry. The tilt feature is also handy and the pen runs smooth on the working area. Good craftmanship, good functionality and ease of operation. The pen holder is also uniquely designed to keep the extra nibs inside with a nib extraction hole. This Graphic Dwarong Tablet is a very good start for the graphic designers. Works flawlessly with vast Drawing programs in various OS. No doubt a Value for money product.Update: Wow, even while in Phone mode, you can use the entire area of this Graphic Tablet in 'Samsung Notes' App for drawing and even handwriting."
5,"This is my first tab and I was looking for something good and comfortable. I was looking for other big brands however those were out of my budget. Then I found this one from Huion and it has been a great experience so far. It has been over a week I have been using this tab and I must say it is very good. It is light weight but sturdy. It is a smooth experience for working with the pen and the working area on the tab. Pressure sensitivity is also very good. As I am a beginner, I can say it is a very good tab to start your journey in digital arts. All in all, very happy with the product. Two thumbs up from me. :)"
3,"Overall very nice to use...Pen ergonomics, pressure sensitivity,no jitter, .. slightly textured surface helps with control...Everything is on point but the surface scratches up very easily...and i barely put any pressure on it..(relatively soft pressure curve)...i tried looking for replacement surfaces or atleast good screen protectors but in vain....That's the only thing that bothers me."
5,"This is my first drawing tablet and its only been a week since I got this. But still, from the first impression this product is everything I could ever need.Affordably priced, this tablet has good features for both beginners. Although not mentioned, this tablet too supports android devices. And hence, it also comes with OTG support for both Type B and Type C android users. So it is good not only for pc users, but also for Android users as well. The tablet is light weight and well designed to be less tiresome for beginners to get a hang of it. The stylus is light too and has a good rubber grip.These features altogether lessens the initial difficulty in learning how to use these graphic tablets.I have also attached my first digital art here, which I drew within 2 days of receiving the product, for a quick reference.This product is really value for money, and worth recommending for trying out!"
5,"I have ordered the HuionH610ProV2 for online teaching. I received the packet in good condition and the installation process was easy. I could use it for writing in One Note , Word , Powerpoint , Paint etc. I am still trying to improve my hand eye coordination . The writing surface is smooth and extra nibs are provided . Its a lightweight tab with adequate space for writing. I am writing this review after few days of use and will update the review if required.I would recommend it for Online Teaching."
5,"So , basically if you are looking for teaching purpose , this is no doubt a good option. The pen works smooth. Even if you are a beginner after some practice you'll write fuently.Build quality of tablet is nice , using it from almost a month. No issues till date.Go for it if you are having a limited budget to spend on this. Solves the purpose nicely."
5,"As I am Professional trainer, i was looking for Digital Notepad, i have gone through various product.At last i found Huion H610 Pro V, it was very smooth and easy to handle the product.Becasue of this product i can do various activity like demonstrating, designing etc. You get so many programmable buttons,they are more than you need.its very lightweight,almost like a drawing book.previous versions had a scratchy sound,I heard those rumors.But this doesn't make any scratchy sounds.For Me this product gave me value of my money."
5,"Positive- Wants to TEACH ONLINE or GRAPHICS DESIGNER . GO FOR IT. high-built quality.10 inch * 6 inch big screenCan also connect to androids Consume negligible power ( connect to laptop and you are done).Light weight with strong material. 8 Buttons (8 WITH 16 SOFT KEYS) have mirror like shine.Non rechargeable and battery less styles or pen.8 replaceable nibs.Wire, 2 usb including c type, pen stand all stuffs looks of high built quality.Safe delivery from Amazon.GO FOR IT."
5,Loved it. Already I had used Huion HS 64 pen tablet. From there I got a confidence to go for higher range pen tablet. The board is very smooth and after 2 months of usage I can say it's really value for money. I take 2-3 classes per day and still using the same first nib. Great for drawing diagram and writing equations
4,"The graphic tablet works well on pc , but I'm really disappointed beacause it does not work with android. Why put wrong information and description? Please don't make a fool out of the customers, Amazon says that it supports Android too but that's not the case..."
5,"1. I just got my product, and the package came is great condition all items in good condition no missing items.2. I asked the company if the phone I use is supported to which they replied that it may not work but it runs fine with my phone when I got it, which I really loved.3. The button function and pressure sensor works fine on phone (not the tablet buttons)4. The drawing surface is smooth and feels good to draw onAnd other function for PC I will add later, so far everything is good."
5,I have other huion tablets with battery pen and the pens are heavy. but this one is the right weightthe same day prime delivery was great as well.
3,"Its not small. Especially compared to the bamboo variants at this price range. The pen feels good enough in your hands. Its light, but not too light either.The product advertised some sort of carry bag in the order (its literally there in the title), but either they don't ship the carry bag, or at least I never received one."
5,"The best thing about this tablet - Connect it to your android phone and start using it.  Connecters included in box. Usb to c type and usb to micro usb both . No need to have a computer etc . Plug n play . START DRAWING , TEACHING RIGHT AWAY. Would recommend this to artist and online teachers . Only downside i feel is a pen cover or case should have been provided. Otherwise all good."
4,You have to get used to it if you are using pentab for the first time.Nice built quality.Writing area is large.It would have been awesome it a glove was provided because if you get a little bit of sweat then your hand will start sticking on the surface and it will cause a problem to draw or write.Pen has very good quality build.
3,"The controls don't work, and on top of it the nib on the pen is a little loose so it feels weird to draw with it."
2,"After chasing 2 weeks finally i got the refund of pen, as the  product(pen) has been out of stock so they are not able exchange it. Thanx janice from. Huion for helping it out.Thanx  amazon team for helping it out"
5,I wan not a big pan of this Huion because I was used wacom for several years...but after using this for a week I would say great sensitivity and pen pressure.
5,"It is very good product for online teaching, most suitable for zoom classes and google meet classes, dont have any problem, pen is so amazing, very smooth and lightweight,it's size 10*5 inch is most suitable for writing on full screen, it is most usefull when you use it with microsoft whiteboard app for online teaching, thanks huion for this amazing product,."
5,I wanted to buy graphics tablet with a pen for a long time but was not sure which one to buy. In one of the user group on FB mentioned about Huion graphics tablet. I compared a few of them and decided to buy Huion H610 Pro V2 Graphics Drawing Pen Tablet 8192 Pressure Sensitivity with Battery-Free Stylus.Value for money...
5,The most important product In my life. It's great for beginners. Buy it ASAP and I learnt digital art over a one year period. There are no scratches and the pen quality still remains the same. Had a problem with configuration to my laptop besides that simply best.
5,"1. minimal response time2. a range of angles is supported3. 8k pressure levelsall three points are essential for that pen-like feel.You might have to give it a week or two but after that, it's a beast. It won't bottleneck your skills, If you can't draw good with this one, you just have to git gud."
5,It has curved hand rests which allows for longer working durations without any discomfort. Beginners may need to practice a bit for using it. Good for online discussions and graphical work.
5,I am a traditional artist. And I draw portraits. But wanted to try digital art. And this one was recommended by many as great for any beginner. Hope that I can improve my skill with the help of it.
4,I received the product in perfect condition.. Best for beginners who want to draw digitally. The best thing is you can connect this with phone too.. Loving it..

5,"Product is great and all, but I can't register it for warranty on huion's official website. It asks to login through huion account to register for warranty, but once I press login, it takes to their home page. Huion! Please look into this."
1,"I RECEIVED A BROKEN PRODUCT. THE PEN WASN'T WORKING AT ALL NO MATTER WHAT DRIVER I INSTALL. I hope they replace this product quick. And, please check the box of the product before opening it as it may be used or old one."

5,"I have received the order just one hour before writing this review. The package was nicely handled by the Amazon and I am impressed with the quality of service they are offering their customers.Talking about the need for a mechanical keyboard would be like I am a professional content writer and work most of the time writing contents for clients as well as for myself. I do have a blog and around 10-12 hours are spent on writing and editing things.I have used membrane keywords before having this Zebronics max plus mechanical keyboard and upgrading with a mechanical keyboard suffice my need for my content writing works.The first unboxing experience was splendid and spending 2.5k for a keyboard is huge for me. Anyways, I did not have any mechanical keyboard before but this time I have thought to buy one because the Membrane keyboards are not that fit for writing an intensive work.Like, I said I can't STOP writing with the keyboard. I really don't know about the keys but it feels so awesome. They are soft, delicate and require a minimal amount of force to register any letter pressed on the keyboard.The RGB lighting effects are good and but one thing that I did not like about this keyboard was the Printing on the KeyCaps. I am not complaining about the keyboard but its just a suggestion to Zebronics to make the prints on the keyboard more appreciable.Other than this the keyboard has an awesome built quality regardless of plastic built didn't seem to have compromise on the quality of switches or feel in any way.Above all the Quality is top notch with that said I just need it to work for few years as typical mechanical keyboards seem to work for few years in general.I will also see if any issues used over the time and I will continue to update the review as per my time frame. Till then, I find this useful to Typists, writers, Bloggers or Programmers.I can say Zebronics is one of the leading Tech Manufacturers here in India. And, if anything goes wrong you can simply move to them with the keyboard, a standard 1-warranty is specified as per my opinion.--------------------------------------UPDATE AFTER A MONTH------------------------------------------------------------ I am updating the review after a month of rigorous usage of this keyboard. This is to know that I am absolutely loving this keyboard and its typing experience. Well, I need to speak to all the peoples thinking to buy this keyboard from amazon.I guess the height of this Mechanical Keyboard is high enough if you're having short hands, there may be issues to reach out to the top of the keyboard. Now, this has been has been a real pain for me for few days but I ignore it completely because of awesome typing experience.Even after writing millions of words in a month or so.. I did not feel any depression on keys. I do like the tactile feel that it offers through out the session. Not only that it's my first mechanical keyboard so hardly knows about other ones priced higher than this.Zebronics offer good back-lighting that does not hit the eye more of a sober to eye. I bet you will never return to usual keyboard after having used to Zebronics keyboard.That's the saddest part because I have to carry this keyboard along with my laptop just because I don't like membrane keyboards.The only thing could make this keyboard a big big hit is including a palm rest with it.Yes! It does feel little pain after being used to this keyboard. The keys are little raised but offers nice tactile feedback that's what a user expect from a mechanical keyboard.----------------------------UPDATE AFTER 4 MONTHS OF USAGE------------------------------------------Now, when I say things are pretty good with this keyboard even typing was the only purpose for me that insisted me to grab this keyboard. Despite of heard lot of good stuffs about TVS GOLD I did not like over all look and who don't want a back-lit LED. If I am paying the same price for both. Shouldn't I use pick Zebronics?Coming to feel and typing experience after 4 months of usage. It's still feel the same no matter how much you type through out the day. The only thing I want Zebronics to include is a palm rest or make one for separate purchase. I couldn't find one in the market.The typing experience and the sound steals everyone heart. With accurate and precise typing I am glad that Zebronics made such a low cost mechanical keyboard within a budget.I am extremely happy with the keyboard. Just not I want myself to be happy with a mechanical keyboard. For me (a content writer) knows how difficult it is to go beyond 2k in a membrane keyboard.Your hands feel much of strain and as a result you'll feel fatigue after sometime. The reason behind buying a mechanical keyboard was to let my fingers can take rest without the fatigue.Gaming is super fine with the keyboard with precise tap gets registered very easily no issues with Anti-ghosting I have even tried checking this from Google and It came to notice it can register more than 20 key press at a time. I have played PUBG and few other and used the Fn+windows to lock the windows key while gaming."
5,"Hey All,I have been using logitech Bluetooth keyboard for last one year but off late I longed for a mechanical keyboard.And my dream to own one, came true recently. So, here's the first impression.DESIGN:-It is a full fledged keyboard with 104 keys and 12 additional multimedia keys.-It has bright LED RGB backlit keys which look so elegant and so energetic and fun to work with.-It comes with outemu blue switches which means that with less efforts you will be able to write with much accuracy and halfway through the keys are pressed making your typing faster.-These keys produce clicky sounds that most software engineers/coders/programmers and Gamers love.BUILT QUALITY :-It wieghs 1.5 kgs which means that the keyboard is heavy and it will not be moved from its place easily. You can type as fast as you want without any worry of being disturbed.-Cable length is super long 1.9 meters. You will see the cable same as electric  iron cable that we usually have at our homes.-So, overall my experience with this keyboard is extremely good.All I can say is if you are looking for affordable yet an expensive looking keyboard under INR2500 just go ahead.Please vote helpful if you liked my review.Stay happy keep smiling :)"
5,"This product I bought for 2k around. the keys are Kailh - Chinese version of cherry blue.Do it creates a difference? No . The other mechanical keyboards are of 5k to 10k. This one is bang for the buck.Membrane Keyboard < Laptop Keyboard < Mechanical KeyboardNow when  I have to type on laptop keyboard, I feel like why this is not getting pressed more. The feeling and joy of typing on this keyboard is amazing. I can type many pages easily with this.The Back Kick Stand on the back broke out while being used, this keyboard is very heavy and solid so they are not able to handle it. It happened within my warranty. Did I replaced it? No, I closed the kick stand and worked without it. after some days another one broke too - Now both are opened up and lifted my keyboard firmly.Why I didn't replaced? that was not a big issue to me and I was lazy to wait for the next one to come and return this one just for a kick stand. all the keys were working fine for me and the sound is like WOW. so Skipped replacement and kept working on it. 5 months have gone. Still its my best purchase as a developer- next is iPad to it.Thanks for reading. Hope it helps"
1,Extremely disappointed by this purchase. Barely 2 months in the keys started repeating letters. I‚Äôm not a gamer and I only bought the keyboard for the light effects. So I was very happy for a month and then the repeating keys started. Do you have ANY IDEA HOW LONG IT TAKES to type an email when one alphabet randomly repeats? I used to own a Zebronics keyboard earlier and that never gave me any trouble. I guess times have changed. I will not buy anything from these guys again. Might as well risk it with a buy from Logitech or whatever. At least they‚Äôre cheaper.
5,"I have had bad experience with Zebronics earlier, especially with their frequently failing SMPS and some cheaply made speakers. I had decided not to buy this brand until I read several good reviews on this keyboard, and took the plunge.I wanted a good mechanical keyboard and didn‚Äôt want to buy the TVSE Gold as it is huge and would occupy more table space. Moreover with this keyboard you are getting all the lighting effects for the same price. After using it for more than a month, I am satisfied with the keyboard. My typing speed and accuracy has improved due to the satisfying feedback each key press provides.The longevity and reliability is something that needs to be seen.I would recommend this for anyone spending long hours working on a computer. Well done Zebronics, hope this kind of quality reflects in each of the product you make in future."
5,"Wonderfull keyboard. I had only been using membrane keyboards, and this is a wonderful upgrade and best bang for the buck. Top-notch quality, wonderful to type on. My hands aren't very big and this keyboard layout makes are it very easy to reach all the parts of the keyboard easily. Even light strokes register the key. Absolutely wonderful must-have keyboard on every computer."
2,"It's not as noisy as i thought. It has a clicky sound to it. It is so much better to type on than regular keyboards and not to mention, it has anti ghosting which will really helps in gaming. The windows key lock is pretty good too. i wish it had macros or independent keys for volume +-.  You can set the keys that you want to glow as well. A good upgrade from 500rs keyboard. Will update this review with a video soon.Update --- From 5 star to 2 starKeyboard has double pressing issue. Multiple keys in the keyboard. Sad investment. My advise is to go for better branded keyboards. I don't see any service centers near my house. Need to check regarding warranty."
5,"Just got the keyboard and first impression is WOW. At this price point, the keyboard provides full RGB options as seen in high end mechanical keyboads which cost a fortune if you are on a tight budget. I was a little concerned about the quality as this is a local brand, but trust me its superb. The keys feels sturdy and clicky, all RGB modes working fine. Keyboards itself is durable, you can feel it when you touch it. Was going for Redgraon vara, but settled on this as the vara dosent provide RGB effects at this price. This is an absolute bang for buck product. Kudos for Zebronics."
5,good.....but its tough call to return the product...no doubt keyboard is good but if u are rubberpad keyboard user then u can't type on mechanical keyboard in ur regular speed.......may be possible after lots of practice... keep it in mind..... overall good for gamers ....
5,This is a really solid keyboard it has outemu blue switches inside and it is very tactile. It is really good for typing but it would do for gaming also. The switches are really lound and it could be annoying if using it for overnight work or something . Anyhow a really nice keyboard. Ergo wise I would suggest a wrist rest cause the bezels could give a pain in your wrist.
5,Solid build quality. Keys feel really close to the feel of TVS Gold. RGB works like a charm. Really nice feedback from keys while gaming and typing.
5,The keyboard is perfect for mechanical keyboard lovers. The switches are very nice with great feedback and lovely sound. The led lights are useful in the dark if u work in the night and dont want to disturb others. Overall a very good keyboard. I got a broken keyboard first and after i submitted a return request i was given a replacement in 2 days. Being a prime member is a privilege indeed:)
5,It's an awesome product. Frist of all thanks to amazon which delivered it to me before the expected deliveryAnd also I will strongly recommend any one how is seeing this review if it's your frist gaming keyboard then you can buy it  undoubtedly to enhance your experience
5,The keyboard stand needs to be improved. It is quite fragile and needs to be handled with care or else it just breaks. Other than this one factor..the keyboard is more than satisfying.. it's an absolute gem..a treat for your gaming and typing needs..and a true mechanical delight..!
5,"If you are looking for RGB Mechanical keyboard under 3000, then go for it.Although it doesn't have Cherry MX switches, but the feedback from keys is excellent. You will love typing on this keyboard.Only problem I found on this keyboard is retractable stand. One retractable stand of my keyboard broke on 1st day itself. Overall, the quality of keyboard is very well especially of braided USB cable."
5,Good clicky responsive keyboard for affordable price . It has blue mechanical switches and RGB is really good . For the price it's amazing for gaming especially jiggle peeking in FPS games . Amazing product.
5,"The light animation is good. I was hesitating before ordering because it's not full RGB, but the looks and animation of it didn't let me regret. The click sound is so satisfying. It's totally value for money."
5,Perfect for type and code. Previously I was used Redgear Kailh brown switches.This is too soft keys. No fingers fatigue at all. I just loved it.
5,"Good product, it is budget gaming mechanical keyboard, but working very nice, I'm using this from one month. No issues appears.Excellent experience"
5,A good affordable entry level mechanical keyboard.Pros:- Good Tactile Keys. Clicky (I love that).- Responsive- Good Build Quality. Heavy and feels Durable.- LED effects are cool. (But unnecessary)Cons- Not very ergonomic. Keyboard is tall. That platform by itself adds 1.5 inches. Misses out on a wrist pad.
5,"If you're looking for a Budget Mechanical Keyboard under 3K INR, you should definitely go with this one :)"
5,This is a great keyboard. You can do typing and gaming on these. The included led modes are awesome and you can control the speed also. There is just one con that you cannot change the color of each lane. But it is totally worth it and I don't even mind that for the price
5,IN THIS PRICE THIS IS a GREAT DEAL.PROS-1. COOL LEDS SETTINGS.2. CLICKY WITH GOOD FEEDBACK.3  LOW-PRESSURE INTENSITY OF KEYS WHERE IT GETS REGISTERED.4. HEAVY BUILT.5. IT IS SLIPPERY AS IT REQUIRED FOR ADJUSTMENTS.CONS-1 KEYSCAP COULD HAVE BEEN MORE RIGID AND TACTILE.2 KEYS WOBBLES WHEN YOU MOVE THEM (IT NOT A BIG ISSUE BUT ANNOYS SOME PEOPLE).
5,"It's beautiful. The keys feel very tactile, and the overall quality and looks is awesome. It's a little heavy though, so that might hamper portability. Overall a brilliant product."
5,It's definitely worth the money....if the lighting could've been a bit more brighter it would've been good
5,Very good budget mechancial keyboards!! Guys don't doubt this entry level keyboard !! Just go for it it will make u happy !!
5,"The mechanical keys sound really nice for my liking, and they feel good. The overall design is sleek. Only complaint i have is about the different light strips for each row rather than a single light throughout the keyboard, but that's so trivial that i am gonna let it go."
5,Great product. Completely worth the price. Build quality is great for this price. Has a nice and satisfying keypress sound.
5,Great product just arrived looks good feels premium go for it.The packing was good.Edit: It works fine after 1 month of use it was the right decision to buy this one
5,Feels awesome to type on as its a real mechanical keyboard. Very responsive and feels durable.
5,Wonderful Keyboard.. It's a definite buy.I love this keyboard. It triggers me to type more.
4,"I have no complaint against the product, I am completely satisfied with it ( although I would have loved if they had provided some extra keys).But, the packaging was worst I have ever seen.There was literally no protection provided for the keyboard due to which the box got damaged but luckily no damage to the product except some minor scratches.The seller has to make sure that the product reaches the customer without any damage in the way.If only there were an option to rate the delivery and packaging of the product I would have given it a 0 star without any doubt."
5,"The keyboard proved to be a completely different experience!! I am pleased overall by the novelty I had somewhat known but not experienced before.On the functional side, the keyboard feels good to type on, comfortable and as easy as it can get. The keys are wide apart, and the heaviness of MaxPlus ensures it does not shake or move around.The 6 different LED effects provide jazz and fizz that is dazzling even for adults, definitely more for children and gamers. The cost is more than what I would have paid for a normal keyboard but this gaming keyboard provides bang for the buck. The clickety-clack noise can be a distraction especially if you have people around who want quietude."
5,Couldn't ask for anything better. The sound it gives out gives a very great feeling. The smoothness with which each keys gets pressed is unbelievable.
5,keys are very comfortable for long time use...and must important thing is keyboard is made in india prodect... proud to buy..zeba.....(y) go for it....
5,"Build is solid, like the typing feel, lighting modes are also good. Value for money."
5,Good mechanical keyboard using for 2 months working nice
5,Simply Superb... Good Heavy keyboard... Awsum light effects... Amazing clicky sound... Tough braided wireI have used TVS Gold... no significant difference in typing experience. TVS Gold is a bit bigger but a bigger backspace is a saviour.Missing few dedicated multemedia keys. and no product brochure in box.I am typing this review on Max plus and really want to keep going...
5,"For 20 years, I had been banging away on chiclet keyboards, feeling all useless. Then came the mechanical buzzword. And then I spotted the Zebronics tenkeyless mechanically-switched keyboard. And I tell you what - this is the biggest favour you can do yourself if you type a lot (and I type a LOT). My computer feels a real computer now because of my keyboard."
5,"Please add the user manual too in the box.It has many features for the led light pattern, seems amazing!"
1,Pls do not buy for surface laptop.This product is plastic and don‚Äôt suits any surface. Pls don‚Äôt but it.Return policy is bad you have to return to china.This product is from china.
1,"I bought this keyboard just because of its small design and normal keys. The reason is every other brand's keyboard that are compact in design comes with flat keys which are hard for me to type.Suree I wasn't expecting the best quality but it should atleast function properly. Maybe it's just a defective item or brand. Even after replacement I'm facing the same issue.Shift+spacebar+W is just not working.""See the clip"""
3,"Excellent keyboard. I love that it's got a large ENTER key and BACKSPACE too. I have been using a gaming keyboard all this while and switching to the new keyboard wasn't a problem at all.The only thing I didn't like is the size of the 'function' keys. They are small. Also, getting used to the new DELETE key will take some time. It's located to the left of the LEFT ARROW key. Otherwise it's a great product.EDITThe left SHIFT key isn't working. It's going to be a pain for me since I am so used to using keyboard shortcuts. Very disappointing."
4,"For those having limited desk space a full sized keyboard is a big problem. 10 keyless type of keyboards are much better as they a at least 4-6 inches less wide. This is a small sized keyboard and is extremely cheap. It works as advertised. The weight is very less, perhaps because of thinner plastics used. The tactile feel is OK. The keys are bit too close to each other; takes some time getting used to. However for the price, this keyboard is great specially as a backup keyboard."
2,"I bought this keyboard after saw the picture on Amazon. I felt the keyboard will be sturdy and compact, but it's not sturdy at all ( though we don't don't expect more in ‚Çπ250/- ). But after received the keyboard I discovered it doesn't comes with ""HOME"" and ""END"" keys ( see in my listed picture) . Received keyboard was completely different from listed product picture on Amazon description page. This keyboard comes with dedicated Indian rupee symbol key which also doesn't work and manufacture company ( Live Tech ) helper don't have any idea how to use this rupee symbol key in any writing applications like MS Word, Excel, Notepad etc. I don't recommend to buy this keyboard because it doesn't has 2 major keys like Home and End."
4,"Fewer of us now require a dedicated number-pad on our keyboard, and more of us are operating in tight-cramped spaces. I have always used external keyboards with my Laptops, not just to reduce the wear and tear, but also for reasons of ergonomics.I have shifted to using Laptops instead of Desktop computers at my SOHO, simply because a) they take less space, b) they can be shifted around and even locked up, c) they take less power, less air-conditioning, and generate less noise.Adding an external keyboard helps me a) save the life of the keyboard on the laptop, b) position the keyboard below the laptop in a more ergonomic manner. After all, replacing the keyboard on my Acer Laptop costs Rs.4500/- and this keyboard costs 450/-. The math is simple. In fact, this keyboard is compact enough to be put into the laptop bag just in case I have to work on client site for a few days.Entirely made of plastic, featuring rubber/silicone key-press mechanism, don't expect the keyboard to generate soft clicks and gentle feedback. It feels mushy to type, and the keycaps are clackety. But they get the job done without any fuss.The keyboard comes with a range of multimedia keys which I use rarer than rarely. Unfortunately, the keyboard is missing the 'Home' and 'End' keys which I use frequently. The keyboard also comes with a 'Num Lock' and 'Scroll Lock' key which defies logic. I used the excellent freeware 'SharpKeys' to simply map the useless keys into more useful keys on Windows 10 and solved my problem.Unlike some of the other models of similar compact keyboard, this model has full-sized Arrow keys and this was the primary reason why I opted for this model. After using it for a few months, the writing on the keycaps tends to get rubbed off and the key-tops tend to erode a bit. The keyboard itself works faultlessly though, becoming quieter and smoother.Let me know if this was helpful."
5,As expected premium feel budget keyboard with inr ‚Çπ rupee symbol integration. Completely satisfied with the purchase and the on time amazon delivery ü§ó. GO for itüëå
1,Why did I think I'll get anything else at this price point! It is a cheap keyboard. It works but at times the latency is just bad. The plastics are scratchy. Key travel is okay. But what kills it for me is that the darn thing keeps slipping around! It has no rubber feet and are so lightweight that it just slips on any surface you put it in and is really annoying when you are typing on it. I have to put it in a cloth to even remotely start using it. By far the worst purchase I have ever made. Please stay clear of this.
3,"First seller had sent used item, but as such it was working didn't complaint and was needed urgent.The item has keys distributed little differently. I had habit of typing without looking at keyboard but for this keyboard it is different.Keys are hard to press unlike HP but cheaper so can't be considered a problem when it comes to comparing with money.Worth for those whose keyboard use is minimal."
1,i yping this review witth thhe same kkebord. not working .
5,Vary cost effective product for normal use.I am using it at my home to do office work and sometimes carry it to work sites. It is very compact and fits in backpack and occupies less space on the table so that mouse also can be accomodated near to keyboard. It means mouse will be very near to the keyboard as there is no num lock pad. So we don't need to stretch hands too much to operate both mouse and keyboard.This way it provides good ergonomics.Keys are also soft and operating well. Too mich pressure is not required.
1,"I bought this keyboard in a hurry, at that time it cost me something around 499 and when I got the keyboard, I saw that the plastic used in it feels very cheap, the keys are not lifted as much shown in the image. On it after a week of usage, I found my space bar broken and when I turn on my pc I needed to unplug and replug the keyboards usb many times and then only it responds.*just within a week of use these happened*This company sells products with low price and good catchy images and all the customers like me are attracted and when we receive the products they are of very poor quality, no where near the picture so pls don't waste money here go for something else :(I have no personal aggression for this company but this level of product quality triggers me while and on it while I am in an emergency situation !!"
4,"This is a great product. Fit for a laptop, if your laptop keyboards is gone and you dont want to spend more / much on the laptop any more. Then book this keyboard and get it. This is best for your laptop and can work well as the size is also compact. Reasonably priced, and compact in size."
4,"It is a simple keyboard that is very good for the price. I needed to use it for a laptop.  It is small so it is very good for the use i need. For gaming,  i don't think it may resist long but for office work,  perfect."
4,Go for it.Compact ( no number keys on keyboard ) and cheap .You just have to hope for good and carefull delivery or else you might have to place a replacement ahhaha.What else do you expect in 300-350 /-  ?Best for office work .Not for gaming ! Go for Evofox or redgear for budget friendly gaming keyboards.
3,It's an average keyboard... But because of the price you can't complain... This keyboard is good for those who wants to type (not heavy typing)... This keyboard is not for gaming... If you press multiple keys at one time it won't work...And don't expect too much typing experience... It's a low range membrane keyboard...
2,Some of the buttons specially backspace and enter are hard to press..and to( / ) key right to shift key is annoying as it completely changes the layout of qwerty keyboard.Definitely not for a good typing experience.
3,"For 350 rupees, the keyboard is good if these two defects that I noticed are not present:1. Received keyboard with broken F8 key cap2. ""|"" key should have been near to ""}"" key as in standard model for easy to use ""enter"" key"
1,Not even lasted for a week... if u press a letter it appears twice...You get what u pay for... better go for branded  items
5,"Good product üëçüôÇAwesome cute,stylish and the letters are dark if you don't have caps lock indicator in your laptop so you must buy it.....But don't know is it for gaming....."
2,For emergency situation where u absolutely need a cheap keyboard. Dont expect it to last more than 6 monthsUpdate :Died under 2 months.. I mean I didn't know what to expect
1,"If you plan to use this as a regular keyboard, please go for something better. I ordered this for my son to use during online classes. It would have been ideal given it's compact size. The keys are too hard to use it as a qwerty keyboard. He gave on trying to use it and passed it back to me.  I attempted to use it for a day. Gave up due to pay in my hands from the hard strokes needed."
4,"this key board is very good in service,smal size as my 14 inch laptop. not found any problem since purchase., it will last long like desk top key board. excellent product. any one can purchase ."
5,A small size keyboard suitable for tablet and small laptop for occasional use. but found to be little uncomfortable for desktop.
1,"I bought this on urgent basis as this was the only keyboard deliverable within one day at that time. Keyboard built quality is extremely poor not worth 300 rupees.One big flaw is misplaced enter key, if you do touch typing you endup pressing / key instead of enter.Rest features are ok."
2,Defect product delivers
2,One wud buy it for the price but the problem is the keyboard cable wire .It snaps very easily & renders the keyboard useless .
4,"Very good item. It is better then other mini keyboard. Best for gaming and writing in low space. I love this product... be careful when you connect to pc first download plugins from link in box, then will work all multimedia key. Can you use otg for connecting with android but multimedia key will not work... So good.  I love too..."
5,All good size keys yet overall compact. Exactly what I wanted. Using it for last 3 month so without any issues.
5,"Good product and very easy to carry, consumes very less space. Recommended for those who don't use the Numeric keypad.The best thing I liked in this product is it is very easy to carry as like laptop."
5,Is working perfectly.Though not smooth but it's of good quality and IAM able to survive though this.It's ok to go
1,I need HOME and END keys to edit my documents and code a lot but as shown in product picture there are no HOME and END keys.
3,"Product is good built in quality, easy to setup and easy to use. if you are fast typing speed it fast then you will be annoyed with some keys being really hard to press. feel like manufacture defect. In my case its ""backspace"" button.Missing Home and End keys on the Keyboard."
4,"This keyboard is wonderful for basic use and typing but I would not recommend it for gaming. Sometimes, the key I type does not get detected and I have to retype the word carefully again üòí. Gaming requires a sensitive keyboard so I won't recommended this for it."
1,Useless. sustandard product . dont buy anything from this supplier. He is not loyal to Amazon. Most of the keys are not working on a normal click. If press hard eeeeeeee......... lllllll will happen. So I loss my money.
3,Keys are really hard and not very good for daily use. Will always ask others to spend little more and go for a good one but don‚Äôt waste money on this.
5,It is good to use. Soft keys.Delivered on time.Good for this money.Thank you
1,Waste of money.Keyboard not working correctly.Same problem 2 timeUseless keyboard.
2,I want to replace this product as cause due to delivery the keyboard had some moisture on it and after using it for laptop it was slow in functioning.
1,Very worst product for the price range. Very very low quality plastic and very light. In all worst product. For this price u can buy a new better keyboard than this.In case worst product. Don't waste your money in this please.
5,Everything is good except it can't register more than 2 key presses at a time
4,The last similar mini key board I purchased on Amazon failed within a very short time and I had to return it. Incidentally I had given it 5 Stars when received. So I am being a bit cautious this time around and giving only 4 stars. I will review this after a few weeks. The key board is otherwise an excellent device.
5,"Gr8 product...Made life really easy for me . I am using it my laptop connected to 42inch tv.Battery is great .... havent charged it even once since it came.Its steardy as well, i dropped it by mistake from a good height but no issues so far. Good helpful gadget"
5,"Great product I use it for android stick connected to my tv - it‚Äôs fantastic, just that it had backlit keyboard it would be the best as I could use it in dark - but still it very very good - if you want one get it without thinking twice."
5,"Amazing product, it comes with its battery which is rechargable Li-ion battery from a nokia 3310 (BL5C battery, I have 2 more bigger capacity ones, so I use my older batteries inside this, the battery that came with this one lasts for 1 whole week around total of 5hrs, now using my old batteries double the capacity with 10 hrs)Feels great in-hand, perfect for couch operated Home Theater PCs, very comfortable to use. The touchpad is flawless for its size, has multiple gestures for scrolling, has 2 DPI modes for faster mouse movement.- Tactile clicky key button that are awesome to use.- good print quality on keys, that don't wear off easily, been using for 2-3months now , wrk greate.- amazing array of extra function buttons, that don't make u get up and need a full size keyboard, or adjust goinging into windows menus, works through the dedicate macro keys flawlessly.Cons:- does not support windows precison touchpad gestures.- lack of dedicated a numpad is definitely something I did miss.- Build quality is plastic, can break the screw joints if dropped from even a low waist height."
5,"Pros: Very easy to handle due to shape, size and weight. Chargeable battery with high charge holding capacity for prolonged periods. Led indicator is an add on advantage. Touchpad is an awesome utility. Auto power off makes the battery life even longer. One can control almost all the possible utilities using dedicate buttons like home, volume up/down ok, previous/next.Cons: Nothing as such. But please make a note this keyboard will not work properly in non anroid TV. May be only 50% functionality will be working."
1,"The product that I received at first came in a packaging which was already opened. Moreover the remote came with a battery BL-5C, but even after charging for an hour it did not charge. So basically to use this new remote it has to be plugged in all the time, not very much of a remote."
1,"The item (sold by Lavitra) definitely not a new one. The keyboard itself having lots of dust, finger prints on the touchpad and the Nokia battery inside is a used, very old, and defective (already fully bulged, so difficult to close the back cover). Above all the keyboard not at all working (Maybe the battery already dead).Worst experience with this seller.Already applied for returning the item."
5,"Cool design, touch pad & keyboard experience is very nice while using Android TV box or any other device. Shortcut buttons helps a lot. Its has rechargeable battery & battery backup is so amazing. One full recharge work upto approx 10 days or more depends upon the usage. Its get inactive when not touch for 2-3 mints in order to save the battery. Im sooo happy with the performance."
1,"Pathetic...I got this delivered on 29th July and it stopped working on 23rd Aug, that‚Äôs like literally not even a month. I request Amazon to refund my money as this is really not acceptable. I have already raised a complain and I‚Äôm waiting for Amazon‚Äôs response. Request Amazon to get the seller checked. I have been a very frequent customer of Amazon and have not faced such issues in the past. Request resolution as soon as possible."
1,"Do not purchase this product. Battery faulty. To use this device you need to connect it to power always. Also incorrectly mentioned on website that "" Come with EVERSTAR Microfiber Cleaning Cloths"". There is no cloth."
5,Highly recommended.Handy and easy to use
1,"No battery, no charging wire, no bluetooth as shown on site. Misguiding details."
1,"No battery included, not even options to add cell, this is a toy not a working remote, don't buy"
2,USB sensor does not fit easily in the slot. It has to be pushed forcefully. It 'll hamper the USB slot of the computer.
5,Initially I was worried to buy this coz It may work or not. Finally I got the product and working like champ. It has Old nokia kind of battery where you can recharge and use it. alternatively u can use with batteries. I'm using for my Android TV.
1,Don't buyGot replacement twice and still not provided with the lithium batteries and also the slot is missingPoor quality and worthless product
3,Woooww.... They send me duplicate Nokia battery... That doesn't work even for one time ... Its really bad for there product... Otherwise product is quite nice ... One button not working properly ... I have to press 2-3 time to make it work....
5,Great Product with recharge able battery easy to operate. Nice .. must buy product if you have smart box or Tv to save the original remote....
1,There are two power options 1. Two AAA size batteries and 2. Built-in rechargeable polymer Lithium-ion battery which support USB charge. I dis not receives Built-in rechargeable polymer Lithium-ion battery when I received my product.
5,I am using this with my BPL vivid smart TV. Makes navigation and search very easy. Touch pad is nice and the keys are well placed for one finger operation. The product has a sturdy feel and did not require any effort in terms of configuration before use.
2,"This is lovely... The best budget keyboard... Easy to handle, very Light, and user friendly... But the price was too high it was 1000 when I bought it"
5,Good thing is the print hasn't faded after long use. Have sat on it a few times but fortunately nothing went wrong.
5,"best buy for this price, can be used with smart tv, play station, laptop, really handy for presentations"
5,This is a crazy stuffYou will how important the more you use itAnd for a small buck it's amazingYour friend who see this will also get crazyBuy it with closed eyesIts an amazing tool if you don't have. A smart tv
5,Great product for the price point. Only issue I faced is that it sometimes looses connectivity

1,Track pad doesn‚Äôt workRange very poorBuild quality bad
1,"6 axis remote, Air mouse and IR Remote functions not there in this keyboard . False specifications mentioned on Amazon.in website.... first-class cheating by seller."
3,"super easy to use... although i have been using it for a very short while. IMPORTANT POINT TO KNOW before buying this is that despite of all claims, batteries ARE NOT included in the package and you have to BUY them SEPARATELY."
1,Not working after three days use. Battery provided in product not able to charge not able to use AAA batteries but vendor suggested to use AAA batteries.
1,Worst product ever..Worked for 3 weeks and just stopped working.Dont waste your money.Kindly provide cash back if possible
2,I bought this for my MI tv.But it works only for some apps.Touch pad was the worst sometimes worked sometimes didn't even move.Had to return it.

1,This is the only product with which i was not comfortable to useAnd only product which doesnt satisfied me since all the purchases i made with amazon so sorry for this
5,Great simple product that works easily with diff TV system
3,"Size is too small, less than palm .when conneted with tv it's not selecting file/ item even by double cliking and pressing ok button. NOT suitable for laptop or gaming bcs keys are small .but for this prize good enough."
4,great quality and rechargeable battery option is good and nice product . though some times it lags few words but its okayesh
5,Awesome.. Works wonders for attaching pc to big Tv.
1,Didn't last more than a week this time. Last time when I bought it was excellent and lasted for more than a year before battery  was lost
5,"Easy to use, value for money, it's working perfectly"
3,Good product. I'm using it on hp 14s cf3028tu. It fits perfectly. One thing i didn't not like in this is that caps lock and mute button light is not visible through it.
5,Perfectly matches with the keyboard of 14 inch HP Laptop
5,Great product
5,Perfect. Doesnt feel like you are using a keyboard protector
5,Perfect....
5,Good
4,Although the thickness of the product is bit thin but it works.. and fits perfectly to my 14 inch HP laptop... i would definitely suggest to buy.
2,"Bought this combo after watching review on youtube channel. I am sure that review was (paid). Got this combo for just 500 rs. First impression was good. Overall product looked good, even buttons material and feel is good. Mouse is kind of OK. After using it for six months, mouse right clicked button died. Keyboard is still working fine, but looks like it is about to give up. I would suggest buyers to spend little more money and prefer Logitech or Dell keyboard mouse combo."
1,"Pros- Looks good- Keys are softCons- Too noisy- Terrible after sales service by amkette. The keyboard stopped working in a few months. After a long follow-up through emails and calls, was given address of repair centre. Took more than a week to get repaired. After spending half the keyoboard price to give and fetch it from the repair centre, it still wasn't repaired. Had to throw it away as e-waste."
5,"Great one, have been using it since almost 6 months now and no problems whatsoever... I'm completely satisfied. Since this is an electronic product I restrained myself from uploading my feedback till it is well used! I am now confident of the product's reliability... Go for it!"
5,"Been using this for over a year now. The keyboard is great, the mouse is below average to average, the left-click (I use it left handed, so use the right button more) became a little hard to press after a year of usage.Definitely not for gaming, but a good functional keyboard/mouse combo, for office and everyday general use."
5,"I ordered the product without any expectations but surprisingly with the build quality and plug n play , smooth keyboard functionality impresses. Highly recommend the product @ ‚Çπ 598 really worth it"
2,"I got faulty product and the delivery time was too much. I am not happy with the quality and keys, one of the back space key was not working properly also. I think I got the duplicate product not the original amkette product."
1,It is one of the worst keyboard I have used till now. the letters on the keys started fading from 2nd month onwards and by the end of 4 months most of the important letters had disappeared from keys. Now the keyboard is dead and I have to get new replacement. Never buy Amkette products
1,"Got the faulty keyboard where third row alphabet keys are not working. Delivered from app√†rio. Well you got a sell. I assembled a new pc, first got the wrong CPU I ordered and the return took 10 days and when I assembled return date of keyboard expired. So overall pc assemble experience is poor because of delivered devices."
3,"For a price of around 500 Rs, this wired keyboard and mouse combo is one of the best for windows. But if you are a mac user and you will face difficulty working with this keyboard because of the travel between keys and the windows key placement.  Otherwise, it is a good one which works well."
3,"Great value for money product. Only thing is for few days the escape key was not working properly. I checked and found that the screw is loose at the top left of the keyboard, so the escape key doesn't press properly. But can't risk exchanging and another visit in times of covid19"
2,"Keyboard is low quality.Mouse buttons started giving problems after normal use, within a year.Pleade upgrade the quality.Other reputed companies products are better as quality is concerned."
5,Very good keyboard for my pc all keys are working properly. Wire length is also good for me and very nice product with in this price range.
2,"I noticed after using couple of days that keyboard multimedia keys(one side) are wrong printed.I am using this same keyboard for my home, office and also recommended to all my known people but I am disappointed with such issue this time."
1,I NEEDED ITTL URGENTLY SO ORDERED THIS ONE PLUS IT PRICED WELL IN BUDGET... SHOCKINGLY LEFT KEY OF MOUSE WAS NOT WORKING.... INFERIOR QUALITY... POOR FINISH... LOW PRICE IS A TRAP... DO NOT BUY... AMAZON PLEASE RETURN IT AND REFUND OR REPLACE IT WITH AMAZON BASIC KEYBOARD MOUSE COMBO... THANKS!
4,Great for gaming and in the budget also. I bought it in combo and happy i took the decision.
5,GoodEdit: I didnot check the mouse when I received it . After 3 weeks I opened it and found mouse is not working. This is my second order. First order is ok.Edit: contacted amkette and they repaired the fault on warranty. Now works well.
1,the most pathetic product. i purchased it on may19 and now it stoped working. ghatiya product.
2,One key alt key of left side is half faulty buyer know it even then sent and sold this to me. Amazon should take care of this kind od buyers for Amazon's image. Other product is ok. Thanks
5,"Great product. Feels like genuine gaming keyboard. excellent type response. Awesome for casual typers, regular programmers. Mouse is great, excellent for designing too. Reached my expectations on Adobe Illustrator and photoshop in case of conveniency. Fits perfectly in hand at least for me. Scroll wheel works well but its just little light to use. Otherwise excellent."
5,one week of usage.. its pretty nice product at this range along wut the mouse its awesome....mouse middle button little hard to press....but still its wrkn fine....
5,Haven't expected such a great keyboard &  mouse under 0.5k...key strokes is really soft... And the keyboard design  looks &  feels great..... üòä
3,A mediocre product with some downs. My first order (which was faulty) was replaced by this. Still I don't find this great for the price. Standard of quality was not maintained. Membrane for the keys are not smooth. Feedback is very average.
5,"It's a compact keyboard with all the useful keys for gaming. It's spill-proof  and keys give a  very comfy  feelings, whilst typing.The mouse üñ± is  also  quite good.Highly recommended this  combo, against this  price.Thanks Amazon !"
3,"The overall product design is good. The keyboard is really good, very easy and comfortable to type. But the mouse stopped working very soon. Specifically the scroll function of the mouse is not working any more. But I loved the keyboard, that's why I am giving it 3 star."
4,"Product is Good And Working But Quality is Not Very Good.. Price is Little High For Product Like it.. Anyways, it is Ok Product.."
3,It is an average keyboard. Do not expect great performance. Definitely a no-no for gaming. Keys lag a lot and gets stuck many a times.Mouse is of better quality than the keyboard. So far no complaints for the mouse.
4,Key board  is good. Looks also good. I brought  3 set but unfortunately one moise was borken. Other 2 keyboard  working properly. All keys are wotking good conditions
5,"No words to explain, its best best best for this price, especially the keyboard ,its looks cool and good performance,Keys are best qualityLetters aren't fades Multimedia buttonsLooking goodOverall got more than expected..."
3,Overall look is good. Keys are bit hard & key travel is too much to use for fast typing. As I don't play any game can't say how the keyboard is in that respect.Over all not too bad not too good.
5,"Happy to own this KB. Good responsive keys, perfect size and elevations. Good set of multimedia keys f you are into those things.The KB has quite light build and will bend while pressing keys if not placed on uniform surface."
3,Keyboard and mouse are working fine except one issue with mouse as below.Mouse provided with this keyboard sometimes stop working. I need to remove it from computer and then re-insert it and then it start working again.
1,"Quality is average.Its not working after 4 month used, for repairing, it is need to send kit to service center via Currier at own expenditure."
2,This keyboard died (shorted) in a very low use environment. Barely used and have one of the worst life when considered usefulness and value. I have now bought a replacement keyboard.
5,Very nice quality at price. Tho the mouse is quite light but not necessarily fragile.
5,Excellent keyboard with great tactile feedback on keys. Keys are thoughtfully spaced out and typing position feels great on the wrists. Mouse works just as well as any mouse I've ever used.
2,Product is good but was bit damage in corner due to bad packing
4,"This product is good in that price range, cannot get any other offer like this at this price I changed mine because I wanted stroke less keyboards but it's good except spacebar key it really make noise still product is of good quality."
5,Typing is very comfortable with this keyboard. Hats off to Amkette.
2,"I have experienced certain problems like it's disconnected randomly and I have to reconnect it to work again, I have replaced it then also same problem, so I opted for refund. It might be my motherboard compatibility issue.."
5,"Amazing purchase at such a low price. The combo of mouse and keyboard is really good. It comes under 1 year warranty also. I've been using this combo for nearly a year now, just no issues and problems, awesome product."
5,"Look at the photo. Can you see the cover? Ya that's how nicely it fits on the keyboard, a complete value for money investment. Hopefully it will be around for a while.There is one thing though, the tactile feel that you get from a Scissor Keyboard is somewhat lost, but then you get used to it.I recommend it to all those who are working from home and want a good level of protection against those cookies bits, splash of coffee every now and then and ya it does a good job in keeping that dirt away as well ;). Cheers"
3,This is a good product. Your keyboard can be saved from dust. I liked the quality. But it would be better if this could cover little more area till the edge.
1,Very bad
4,"Every mac user should have this, good matt finish surface, perfectly fits on the surface, feels like nothing on the keyboard, protect from liquid splash, spill & dust."
1,"The tactile feel of the keyboard will be sacrificed. Use it as cover when not is use. Not very comfy for long regular use, you might have to get used to the feeling and feedback."
5,Fits really well
5,Excellent quality. Fits perfectly.
5,As advertised
5,Happy with the purchase. Good quality product
5,Good skin!
5,"Liking the product so far, sits well with the keyboard"
4,Good product
1,it is not good for typing it is very light
5,I like it.
5,Fits perfectly
5,Nice quality
5,Good product
5,Good product
2,This product is of cheap quality and utterly disappointing and I deeply regret not returning it as it‚Äôs a waste of money. Amazon‚Äôs policy of not taking return of tech stuff in the first go is a terrible idea because you tend to get stuck with a tedious process of return. It‚Äôs so thin that I wonder if it‚Äôs silicone. Just a wee bit thicker than paper. The free keyboard cover I got for my laptop keyboard along with its cover is way better than this paper like cover under which typing is difficult and it is not a soft snug fit. It will only be used as a cover now to protect my keyboard from dust. No use while typing.
2,"Writing a review after using it for a week or so. The cover is nice at the start - feels nice and sticks. However, after few days, It turned hard. Due to its hardness - the pleasure and ease of writing disappeared and I choose to use the keyboard without the cover now. sad."
4,Long Hua Switches..
1,Lung Hua switches not Cheery MX Blue FAKE
5,"Check the images I uploaded, especially the comparison with HP K100. In fact, there is no comparison of HP 100 with this keyboard. Because that is of 500 bucks and this one is five times costlier than that. The size of TVS Gold Bharat USB wired is big enough. More than it would have been awkward and uncomfortable.In looks, the keyboard is sturdy, solid and strong and in operation, it is soft and melodic key typing sounds. It is not noise if one likes the keyboard and if not then the sound is noise and size is absurd.I urge the sellers to upload the product images so that the customer could have a good look of product from angles to make the decision to buy. I also urge my fellow customers to please upload product images for being helpful to others. Hope mine will help someone else.The keyboard is as good as shown on the webpage in the product image. I thought the model must be older. But to my surprise, it is manufactured in Feb. 2020. Above all TVS electronics is Karnataka based company which make this keyboard an Indian product so on that count also I feel good to have this.It is with a USB keyboard. MRP is Rs. 2770 and I got at Rs. 2568/- as Appario Retail was selling more than it.Only thing i fear is that the colour of keywords on keys is less bright compared to other but that do not affect it's working.My views are that the product must go on for years and for such a product some cost has to be paid. I have two other regular mechanical keyboards lighter in weight and good performance, but this one has no comparison. This keyboard is not a 'use and throw' hardware. As I said it will get old with me. Hopefully I will need another mechanical keyboard in year 2030. Get it and forget to purchase any keyboards for years to come."
1,"I wish to return the item as it is a low quality item and nothing close to what a ""classic"" original TVS Mechanical keyboard should be. It has some inferior quality switches (Lung Hua make) and not the Cherry MX Switches that the original classic make used. This item was delivered on 22 June but I could check the item only today as I was out of town and due to COVID lockdown there were no options to reach home earlier. I reached home today in the morning and today in the afternoon I opened the item and I am not happy with the product and hence want to return. But unfortunately the return window closed yesterday and Amazon would not allow me to return the item. I request the seller to take a note and help me with a possible return."
4,"I had to return this keyboard.Just for context I use a CoolerMaster keyboard with cherry MX brown switches. I needed another keyboard for office but was looking for a cheaper alternatives with mechanical switches.This keyboard provided a great typing experience given the price point but I had to return it because it didn't matched three of my usecases.1. It's very big and bulky, it takes up a lot of real estate on my table where i keep dozen other things.2. The Chinese blue switches were pretty awesome in typing but very loud for my office use.3. The backspace button was small, I use it a lot and prefer it wider like in other standard layouts.Although the built quality is not that sturdy and can easily flex but i felt pretty confident that it would last long.Overall i would suggest to give this keyboard a try as it provides great typing experience with good tactile feedback without burning a hole in your pocket. It just didn't workout for my usecase."
2,"I was bit apprehensive since the key switches are not from original cherry mx manufacturers. However it turns out that the keys do have good tactile feedback and true mechanical feel. Happy with the purchase. Feels solid and durable.The only thing which bothers me is the missing Fn key. It should be possible to map the ""Menu"" key to ""Fn"" key using OS specific key mapping software ... but that will be a hassle. That is the only reason it has lost 1 star.EDITED ON 9 Feb 2021The key ""R"" was giving problems for past few months, I had to apply extra pressure to make it work and today it stopped working completely! I bought this on 12 Feb 2020, so I have 3 more days to claim 1 year manufacturer warranty but there is no TVS service center in my town and not sure if it is even worth it. The cherry MX like keyswitches are not user replaceable and local shop could not repair it. Though there is no issue with all other keys, I was hoping to replace the defective key with one of the number pad keyswitch but it is not designed that way. One important reason to buy mechanical keyboard is it's reliability too but looks like the keyswitches used are not high quality cherry MX switches but of some low quality. So I have reduced my rating to 2 stars."
5,"You will not get disappointed with this product ever. It has the best keys with a spring action. If you are a stock market trader or have a habit of pressing the keyboard with a heavy hand, you will love this product. I have been using TVS key board for the last 10 years and they simple awesome.  The Millenials may not like it as they are used to laptop keyboard which are soft."
5,"I was bought this for my employees. I thought it is a budget keyboard nothing fancy.But the performance is truly amazing. I never expected this much smooth. It is looks like old IBM keyboard.Previously I tried Redgear brown switch Kailh, Zebronics max pro blue - outemu switch.This TVS gold is absolutely fantastic.The design of the keyboard slightly curved in the middle is so good to type.I recommend for who used to coding a lot & typing large amount of text everyday.  I am enjoyed so much."
5,"One of the best mechanical keyboards at the price. It is clickety / clackly - ma not be great for really quiet offices, but just right for home use, the tactile response is just amazing. This is my second TVSE keyboard, the controller chip died on the previous one, and buying a new one is simpler than getting the controller chip replaced - AND yes, it will end up either in the plastic recycle bin or on a landfill somewhere.For the moment, am holding on to the old one, to see if I can replace the chip, when I have some time on my hands.Great for casual gaming as well !"
1,"There is no serial number mention in bill copy, Now the one Keyboard got errors, in service centre they asking for serial number In bill without that you cannot claim warranty like wise it comingI need solution"
5,"I was doing good research on keyboard for my mac However among all others options and choices my decisions were turning towards this keyboard only.. reason were, i have used it personally 10 yrs back, smooth cherrymax and click sound and long lasting it is.The challenge was, how will i use it with my Mac.  Since there are not much reviews around mac usage and secondly it is already popular for windows among others mechanical keyboards. So i did bit more digging, bought 2 connecters 1st for multi usb purpose and 2nd with type c port to connect to mac... And voilla this approch worked. Once arrived, have connected without any issue and it worked like charm for me. Additionally have changed windows key to cmd key which let me use it like normal mac keyboard. I am happy and feel comfortable in using the same.Thanks!"
1,"Duplicate product received, this is not cherry me blue product. This is Long Hua keys product which means clone of Cherry MX blue... Please Amazon sell only original genuine product. We trust you..."
4,NOT COMPARABLE  TO ALL SYSTEMS SOME KEYS DOES NOT WORK  AND OLD PATTERN DOES NOT WORK ON NEW SYSTEMS
5,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AT AMAZON IN 3 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ORDER. PACKING IS NOT GOOD FROM THE CONCERN. BUT THE PRODUCT IS GOOD AND NEW ONE. IAM A PROFESSIONAL TYPE WRITER. WORKING IN SYSTEM FOR LONG TIME IN EVERY DAY. MEMB' KEYBOARDS ARE NOT GOOD FOR TYPING. SO I SEARCH A GOOD MECHANICAL KEYBOARD FROM LONG TIME. FINALLY I FOUND THIS KEYBOARD RECENTLY. TYPING EXPERIENCE IS SO GOOD, KEYS ARE VERY STRONG. BUT ONLY THE PROBLEM, BACKSPACE KEY IS VERY SMALL. IT'S LOOKS LIKE A 90s KEYBOARDS LIKE IBM. OVER ALL I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. THANKS TO TVS"
5,"I have two of these. The first one I bought many years ago and it is my primary keyboard and comes with the original blue Cherry MX switches.The second one I purchased for my parent's house when I am visiting and need to work from there. These are the Long switches and some folks have complained but I haven't been able to make out any difference in normal use.The keyboard is very clickety and works really well. Rugged. The original TVS gold keyboard I am using I purchased in 2016.For this price point, this is a solid, mechanical keyboard with made-in-india to boot. Will recommend it."
5,"The TVS box packing looked little a bit beaten up but the keyboard itself looks like unused. Coming from a membrane keyboard, the feeling is amazing. My typing speed has improved by at least 10% compared to the membrane keyboard verified by typing speed test. This is the Long Hua blue switches.Works good on Mac but the numlock, printscreen, left click buttons doesn't seem to do anything on Mac. Scrolllock acts as screen brightness down, pause acts as brightness up. Maybe we can remap using USB Overdrive app in Mac. The backspace button is a bit smallIt is a joy to type on but might be noisy while typing in Zoom, Google Meets.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT: Found Karabiner which remaps the unused keys in Mac and setting noise cancellation to max in zoom actually cancels all keyboard sounds"
5,"Hello Friends ,I tried 3 keyboards before settling down on this one.1. Zebronics max pro :2. Cosmic byte - CB-GK-13 brown switch .3. TVS gold bharat :out of three, tvs is just the best .I was looking for keyboard only for work purpose i.e coding/programming.This keyboard is just best. don't think, just go for it. you won't regret it."
2,Received a used product. Warranty sticker was removed and the body looked used and damaged. I had ordered the same product before and was satisfied with it. However for the second order received a probably used one. The keys do not make a clicking sound. I wouldn't recommend.
5,"I am using this key board for a couple of weeks and it is ok ; only with a longer use can I give a proper review. But the reason why I bought this, is because my dad uses a similar TVS Gold keyboard, which he bought in 1996 and it is still working perfectly fine. That‚Äôs 24 years! Made in India rocks!"
5,"My father is using this keyboards for years and so I also replaced my new keyboard with this very expensive TVS Gold. To be honest, you will notuse ANY keyboard once you will try this. This is almost immortal and amazing keyboard for extensive users. Highly recommend."
1,"Within six months keys stop working. It's not doing any action on keypress. After spending Rs 2675, working like this then it's not value for money. Very disappointed by TVS Gold :("
1,"I have used this product earlier. The keyboard itself works fine. But there is a catch. TVS has shipped a warranty registration card along with the product. To claim warranty, you have to post this card after writing your address and contact number.I am least interested in providing my contact details to TVS just to use the product. Also, TVS may reject warranty claims if this card is not posted. If the seller had written about it prominently on Amazon page, I would not buy the product at all."
1,"Don‚Äôt buy this compromised product. I had requested for return and refund, but Amazon did a replacement. I am not going to use it just because amazon thinks my problem was with the particular piece. These are made from substandard materials."
1,"I am utterly disappointed by the product. There is no click on the P key and the print is wearing off on frequently used keys after just ~20 days of use.I paid ~2700+ for this keyboard when cheaper keyboards were available, and didn't deserve this."
2,"It should not be called TVS Gold Bharat as they are using Chinese switches.Keys are comfortable, keyboard is ergonomical, good for long typing sessions.I expected original Cherry MX blue keyboard."
4,Good quality keyboard. Definitely the you can get at this price point. The only problem I faced is that is layout is different than most laptop keyboards these days. In particular the \ key and Ctrl key are placed to differently that I keep hitting the wrong keys. Also it is a bit too big.
5,"buyed this for working with zbrush software.there is no ghosting issues.keys are soft,and you can hear a clicky satisfying sound like the sound from we click on mouse.i also wanted the numberpad,because in blender,i can rotate the viewport,so it comes handy.i also found that they test every single keyboard and add a sticker on the back of the keyboard,and tick it with a pen.nice build quality also.the problem i faced that my desk tray doesn't fit this keyboard.so i rebuild my desk for this keyboard to fit in.and this keyboard also have a classic vibe and aesthetically pleasing.i hope my review is helpful to youüòá"
5,Keys are very soft now I can type more than 50 wpm I do typing daily for more than 3 hrs. I would recommend for those who wants to type faster and for thosewho types daily for  more than 1 hour
3,"TVS Gold is always all-time favorite KB for developers, yes the quality is not that good compare to what TVS used to produce in older times. But in the current market TVS KB is the best option.only one issue from the amazon supplier, I got the physical GST bill of someone else in package."
4,Nothing can beat the clippity clappity of a mech keyboard and this one does that just fine. The keyboard is however very clunky. I was surprised with the size of the kb when I opened the packing to be honest. I would have preferred something much too smaller but I couldn't find any tkl at that price. Overall a good buy.
5,"Yet, I find it costlier than what I think should be the price of it with 15-20% overvaluation."
4,"Excellent build. Small backspace key, adopted to it quickly, it didn't matter to me as it would. It was a negatives before buying.Typing this review with same keyboard 3 months of use. clicks are like music."
4,"Nice to use. Can type with consistent speed.Solid build although not super heavy like expensive mech kB from overseas brands. Can be improved even if it adds a bit to price.Bit noisy but I've used much costlier keyboards like Corsair that's also noisy. No complaints but beware!Couldn't figure out how to enable the rupee symbol. No docs, no website help nothing!TVS please create a useful website!"
5,"Compared to membrane keyboards, this one has some weight to it. And is robust in terms of appearance and usage. The packaging was amazing for an Indian product.The typing is somehow sped up due to the mechanical switches and the sound is music to the ears. If backlighting isn‚Äôt a concern, this is the Mechanical Keyboard you should g for."
5,This should be the classical example of what a mechanical keyboard should be like. Ergonomic design and very easy to operate.
5,I know many folks says its long hua keys and blah blah blah. But look at the price and compare the quality. Its epic . Love coding with it. Its perfect height with and without the adjustable rear stand. Never enjoyed using a keyboard more and didnt feel like it burnt a hole in my pocket.
5,Thanks TVS Bharat ‚ô•Ô∏èBest quality keys and keyboard.Really light in weight.Keys are really smooth. Excited to do code.
5,"People of 80s 90s know it very well the awesomeness of this keyboard. Those don't please be sure .. you will not regret buying this product. If you are looking for an super smooth, sturdy, efficient, easy to type, keyboard just go for this one .. it has that awesome sound of a typewriter, but smooth. I have used this in my school / college days and now bought this again .. 5 Start from my side. No issues. All fun!"
4,Definitely hands down the best budget mechanical keyboard in the market. It's really good for its price. The typing feels awesome and can't stop till fingers hurt. Not a great one for gaming but purely for typing.
5,"Best keyboard for this price, crisp clicks and comfortable buttons. Gives feedback of a typewriter. Just big enter key and couple of bigger keys feel little loose."
5,"Most importantly- IT IS NOT MECHANICAL KEYBOARD, it is a membrane keyboard.......still it is of very good quality, smooth to type but typing may be a bit difficult at starting , becomes smooth over time,* 5 modes of lighting* Good for gaming* Mouse is very comfortable to use* Rgb looks very attractive# colours may not look good on n the video due to low camera specs of my phone......"
1,Keys are not working üòµüòµüòµüòµüòµ
4,I received really early from the expected date due to lockdown. The packaging wasn't up to the mark but that didn't matter. The quality of keyboard and mouse is really good.I have had good experience with both so far however it's only the first week. Will update my review in 6 months. Good quality based on the budget as I got it under discount.
5,"I am writing this review after usage of 6 months, no problem occurred till now.Pros:-1. Looks are really superb.2. 3 RGB color combination options on the keyboard (interchangeable), The mouse has breathing RGB.3. The built quality of both mouse and keyboard is more than average.4. The typing feels really smooth.5. Perfect for casual gamers and beginners.6. Nicely braided wires excellent built quality with gold plated USB.7. The mouse sensor is really good.8. Does not feels cheap.9. Nice Packaging10. Appropriate sizeCons:-1. Not a mechanical keyboard2. No manual or guide for ""how to use integrated function keys?"".3. Gets dusted fast & it's really hard to clean.4. Lacks physical utility keys but utilities are integrated with the function keys.In all best keyboard to buy at this price rangeEXTREMELY SORRY FOR NO PHOTO ATTACHMENT."
5,"Best on budget gaming mouse-keyboard combo for gamers who like minimal design.Used it for about a month and I haven't found any defects in my piece.Connectivity ,latency issues,DPI, keystroke sensitivity everything is perfectly fine.Note that this is NOT A MECHANICAL KEYBOARD, its a membrane keyboard , but not that bad . Actually its too good !! ‚ù§Ô∏èGood for typing (presence of num pad) , gaming and also for editing .This impresses me each time i look at it . I heartfully love the design of the keyboard and mouse .I personally am not interested in gaming mice with cool looking graphics , lot of LED streaks and stuff like that. For gamers like me , this combo amazes with its looks.Forward and backward button feels a bit clicky and sometimes cheap too but it doesnt malfunction.Presence of 4 levels of DPI is really useful from accurate sniper shots to close range head on combat !!The braided cables do lift up the looks of the keyboard and mouse, making it look not so cheap.~~~But one thing i should mention is the rgb lights in the keyboard DO NOT LIGHT UP KEY LABELS , but thats not something we can complain about in this price range . Sometimes i find it difficult to type even small phrases when the room light goes off.But again , this piece offers more features than its value.Overall this is the BEST BUY in this price range.Dont overthink JUST GO FOR IT .For gamers unlike me who like the ""catchy"" gaming designs , ZEB TRANSFORMER is one best choice , i bought that too and it is exactly the same as this except for the cool graphics on the design.The forward and backward buttons in zeb transformer feels different and more comfortable than this."
4,"The product was at first a faulty one, but got quickly replaced by Amazon and sent me a brand new one, worked like charm. Some points to be noted that it isn't exactly for gaming but for more casual gamer's, the mouse is heavy Which is good for me as I am used to more heavy mouse, the buttons feels Heavy and responsive so not exactly for gaming but more for user feedback. It's a semi-mechanical keyboard so mix response but not bad though. A particular line of customers will enjoy this keyboard but nonetheless it won't disappoint anyone even as a regular keyboard. A special mention here in mouse that it is more to a gamer type then keyboard and has multi-functionality, so not bad as a deal..."
5,"First of all i just bought it because i feel that it is cheap, but when i started using it i think i got lottery in 720 rsüòç.Mouse is way good for gaming as it comes with 5 buttons(6th one is only for changing DPI).  But it is good that i think i purchased mouse in 720 and got keyboard free.When comes to keyboard it is only value for money nothing more than that. The rgb light is not under the keys, it is only for show. And also it is static. At night if you are thinking that rgb will let you see the keys then you are wrong.Overall it is totally value for money under 750 rs."
5,"Really good products, the keyboard is really high from the base so gives a clicky and same feeling, it is NOT backlit , you cannot see the letters in the dark. The mouse is really good. Both of them can be changed for colours both have separate wires. Too cheap price for this beauty, way too worth for the price. Has a 2 types of length stand in the back. Have keys for all the options. Braided cable(hard to tear or break). Mouse has 6 buttons (DPI switch, 2 thumb buttons the normal right and left buttons and wheel click). Overall a good product and a professional product! Just one thing make the keyboard back-lit by letting us see the letters in the dark by letting the light to through the letters! So good"
5,High quality semi Mechananical keyboardWith smooth keys.Premium keyboard for such a low price.Mouse is simply awesome..Except the 4th and 5th key..which is very hard to operate..Left click and right click are functioning well.Breathing LED of mouse is nice.But keyboard LED is jst for show..No backlitOverall I am impressed with it..Great combo for gaming at such a low priceThanks.
5,Bought for 720Rs. Amazing value for money.Looks more like a professional Mechanical gaming keyboard.The only thing i miss is keyboard is not illuminated. But for this price can't complain.Terrific purchase.Will surely buy more from seller when building more pc for others.
4,"The keyboard and mouse combo is good for general use. Got the combo for 727. The side button of the mouse don't give a very tactile feedback, there will a few accidental clicks. The clicks and weight of the mouse feels good and solid. The keyboard is not backlit, so in the dark you will not see the keys but only the back light LED. Also the keyboard in not actually mechanical but membrane type with spring type buttons. Over all good for general use (haven't tried with gaming yet)."
5,Using it for atleast 1.5 months its perfectly working and it looks awsm it has many shortcut keys and i like the colours of it and its ha n option ( set the brightness of light ) by clicking FN key and PAGE UP PAGE DOWN button if u r thinking for a budget keyboard tn go for it its damm awsm tnq zebronics fr this awsm product
1,Half of the keys are not working it got stuck up within a month and the lockdown started so I can't give it back it's not at all good quality
5,"First, zebronics is indian brand. It is sturdy keyboard made with tough material. U can't customize light but several preset modes are given and u can change lights. Keys are really good  for a gaming keyboard.Total value of money. I got it only for Rs727."
4,Great product i was confused between this and cosmic byte combo  but chosed this as it is an insian brand and the mouse style i was looking was for basic one i really liked it the dpi was verry much noticible wen switched with the dpi butto good i have give 1 star leaa bcoz of pacakage no good seal i felt that it was already opened and some one applied the tape again  and the second thing a mouse is little heavy and the click is a little bit soft but it depends upon your preference so on one star deducted should improve the box seal.
5,"I bought these combo products at 760rs at offer price. So much satisfied. Keyboard consists of RGB lights with different light modes. Only minus is there is no seperate multimedia keys in keyboard and keys are not properly visibile in night mode. But in this budget, this can be negligible."
5,everything is perfect for this money .. but i think the responce time of keyboard is little bit slower(only very little bit)... but im not sure because it can be because of my laptop..... GUYZ ITS THE BEST COMBO FOR THIS PRICE RANGE
5,Over all value for money. Working after 1 month with no issue. But light will no make  key visible at night it is just for looking cool. Keys will be tight at early but after some time using it will make it comfort. Recommended for buy
5,"Value for money, pretty pleased with the purchase.Cons + can't figure out a way to activate breathing lights Pros + worth every penny"
5,This keyboard and mouse I have been using has been very good for about six more months. I bought it from Amazon using this product for 727 rupees.
5,This zebronics product is probably the most budget friendly combo ever. The rgb is extremely satisfying and looks awesome.The keycaps are very premiumquality.The mouse is also very exquisite but may feel heavy and big for those who are going for the first time but it will be ok after few days usage. Highly recommended for those who are thinking to buy.
5,Awesome product.....At this price point this is the best keyboard. But You are not expected too high RGB keyboard at these price. Its a good value for money product. All modes are are working but my complain is that no instruction manual in the keyboard boxüòî.
5,"Bohot best quality as in this price range if u have a tight budget of around 1200 go for it , its mouse is beeter than transformer mouse"
5,Zebronics Zeb war is a very nice for overall performance. I am using it since one month so performance is good.If you want to buy it go for it!!!
5,Really good at this price band... Awesome performance.... Quality also good... Below 1200/- just go for it...
5,Best product in price range zebronics always provide best products. I started with this combo and my experience go in entery level.
5,okk okkk
4,Keyboard is good but it would have been best is the light passes through the keys highlighting the letters. Also the key hight needs to be little less to function smoothly. It would be difficult for person to type if he is habitual of typing in a flat keyboard (like the laptop has). The key hight is more and doesnt have covering around which makes other keys to press. Mouse is best with breathing light.
5,This product is good no doubt but there was a minor problem in mouse in the scrolling button but else was working very good
5,Works like a charm. Amazing quality.
5,"Well built, awesome rgb lights, wire are breaded"
5,this is one of the cheapest gaming keyboard and mouse combo but it's worth every single rupeethe keys feel like mechanical and also the mouse is of high quality
5,"very efficient and value for money product, happy to purchase."
5,"Amazing LED RGB lighting at a budget price range. The keys are not backlit so that might be an issue for some while typing in dark but you get habituated to that too soon.. Amazing product, Good Metalic build. Would surely recommend it!"
5,good
5,Very good product...keys r soft and dnt make noise
5,Bought this for 720/- and worth for every inch of it . Looks premium for its cost too. Don't believe any average or bad reviews . Just go for it
5,7 colour lighting change any time and manual on off very nice gaming keyboard and mouse.
5,Nothing to say
5,"I am socked when I see the product in this price it,s best product in price it,s deserve 5.99999 star rating"
5,"Looks amazing. Colors are nice and bright. Software takes around 2 seconds to register the changes. The only major concern about the keyboard is that the Spacebar key need to be hit harder for it to register. And the buttons are gloss plastic with the inside of the keys visible. Rest everything is as expected and better.Will give it a 4.5/5.These are initial thoughts.. Will give a full review as time passesEdit-Been using the keyboard for almost 10 months now. Following are the observations.If you are using a programmable mouse along with this programmable keyboard. There are chances that the drivers may interfere with other devices causing in very bad ghosting. Some keys pretend to be held even if they are not. For example if you are typing a sentence and press a letter ""M"" for a split second it will consider as if you were holding ""M"" and give you ""mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"" until you press the key M again.Sometimes the button 6 just doesn't register after being it.Sometimes the Keys ""WASD"" stop functioning all of a sudden.The issue for the above problems is due to the software and specifically the ""gaming mode"" feature in it. The shortcut for which is ""Fn + M"".If you hit the combo of the keys Fn + M, all the above issues get resolved for a good amount of time. They reoccur with frequent use.There needs to be a major software update to resolve this.Ghosting of keys also occurs if you game using the num pad on the right side. I use a laptop so I'm assuming it may be because the laptop keyboard stays on along with this keyboard as well. It may be happening on Desktop as well.Buttons get dirty if you use it in moist/hot weather after some months. A lot of dirt gets collected in between the keys and the led sheet. Which is not possible to clean off without opening the keyboard.Button quality is still stable even though it's a coating of plastic. I assumed it would wear off overtime, but that is not the case.The led lights are helpful when using the keyboard in the dark.Although the programmable buttons do not share the led light. I do not understand why it was left out.Braided cable is an advantage since even after rough moves, it won't break.Above were the major points highlighted in the usage of this keyboard. I will give this a final rating of 4/5.Considering I was one of the first people to buy the keyboard when it launched and got it for a lesser price of 980rs. I am more than contended with the purchase."
4,Pros-1.It has smooth keys. Great for typing.2.It has 6 macro keys which is awesome.3.It looks nice.4.It has nice media buttons.5.Good for gaming.6.Tons of led light patterns.Cons-1.Personally im coming from an office keyboard so its a little hard to adjust to this as it has spaced out keys but that is just a personal problem im loving the keyboard.Overall- I would recommend it i got it for 1150/- and it was well worth it. The keys are neither too big or too small and its perfect. The cons are not game breaking and i would recommend getting this keyboard.I will update if i come across any issues.UPDATE : After 12 days of use I found that the right shift key gets jammed sometimes which is an inconvenience as i type fast. It shouldn't be an issue for anyone who doesn't use all 10 of their fingers.Changed rating from 5 to 4 stars.
5,"This is one of the most underrated Keyboard at this price segment.I have been using this keyboard for a while now and let me tell you the pros and cons of this keyboard.‚Ä¢First Pros:1) This has a full RGB backlit setup which has 8 different modes which you can toggle between. These 8 modes are further customizable using the driver software.2) Dedicated Macro Keys. This is a really useful feature if you are into gaming or editing.( But there is a small short term con in this, will explain this below)3) Dedicated media Keys. I don't use this that often.. but it's a really useful feature to have.4) The typing experience is average. There is proper key travel.5) It has a dedicated driver software from which you can customise the functions of each and every individual keys, change the lighting effects and add macros to the keyboard.‚Ä¢Now for some cons:1) There is minor light bleeding through some keys (I will attach some pics). These are not easily noticeable but yeah.2) Sometimes if you press a key it does multiple entry( For eg:- if you are trying to type ""Hello"" it turns into ""Hellllllllllllll"" for that 2-3 second it does not take any other input) It happens really rarely But yeah it is annoying while gaming or typing.3) The body is really sturdy but the keys feel a little cheep.4) The short term con of the macro keys is that. At starting when you are gaming you might press the macro button instead of the Ctrl or Esc key. This won't happen ones you get used to the keyboard.Overall the Keyboard is really good. And I would really recommend it.Hope this was useful."
5,"Great product. Slightly overpriced I would say by 200-300‚Çπ. Please cosmicbyte sitefor price before ordering.The keys are membrane I guys. Keys press are softs better for writing/programming.The rgb lighting is great and bright. Over-all build quality is acceptable for the pricing.The software is also good but it takes 2sec to update the changes, which is acceptable.The usb cable is also soft braided which is a plus."
5,"This is a membrane keyboard which is soft to touch and kinda sloppy but for the price i think its ok.It supports 6 macro keys which can be edited via software.It also supports antighosting in 26 specific keys.(Specific keys are : Q, A, Z, W, S, X, E, D, C, B, R, F, V, T, G, M, ""SPACE"", ""FOUR ARROW KEYS"", TAB , ""ALT-L"", ""CTRL-L"", ""SHIFT-L"", CAPSLOCK.)The RGB is nice having 8 working modes and have 7 colours.You can turn on the backlight, change modes, increase/ decrease brightness, increase/ decrease the transition speeds via the keyboard shortcut keys.(The default colours can be changed via software).You can adjust the brightness and frequency of some modes via the keyboard shortcuts or from the software.RGB LED transition at very low speeds are kinda stuttering but at medium speeds its smooth.The software is not signed, hence windows may block the installation (if that happens click ""learnmore"" and then you'll see the installation button).Macro keys can be recorded fairly easy.Keyboard build quality is not that premium looking. The keys are aligned quite well for gaming.USB cables are braided and has a length of 1.8Meters."
1,"I saw that it has a software and is full RGB. Let's buy this.So the product came. The logo was upside down. I did not want to change it immediately. Cause it did not bother me as much. As long as the keyboard serves the purpose. Soon, some of the keys started getting jammed. After only 1 week of use. So I ordered for a replacement (as anyone of you would do).Today the replacement has arrived. Now it has a damaged packaging. Also, when you handle the keyboard, there seems to be a loose piece just running around the base when you twist and turn it. To my amazement, I found a screw in the packaging and not on the keyboard.I am typing this review from the very damaged keyboard you guys had sent over. The keys feel unlike the previous one. Clearly this is a refurbished one that was given to me. But hey, this time you guys got the logo correct. Kudos !So guys, lesson learnt. It may look cheap but never go for these brands. They may look lucrative but if you are looking for BANG FOR THE BUCK ? Look somewhere else !"
3,"its a good product in this price range, the feature it offers are awesome. But there is some glitch in its rgb lights, when a certain combination of keys is pressed the light effect does some malfunctioning like the part where is should display green has partial green and partial some of other colour, same happens with other colours too. Other than that, I have been using this keyboard for approximately 45days and black coating on its key have started fading, and not just few keys that I regularly use, but even the keys which are not used regularly.Other than these issues it is a nice product."
5,Best keyboard so far at this price range.Everything is working perfectlyFirst i thought that it would be a cheap product with other problems but ones i received it i was so happy that the product is best in class with rgb lighting working perfectly and support software and keys are also good and it also has color variations anyone who wants to spend less and get more then go fot it.
5,"If you want a keyboard where you can type fast and also use for gaming, look no further. Great quality and design. There is no gaps between keys where stuff can get stuck. Typing speed is great and also gives a good mechanical feel even though it's not. Worth the money"
5,A good keyboard at this price range for all purposes . Tge keys are anti ghosting and has rgb which is a bit hard at this point though I am a bit disappointed with the brightness cause it seems that it is running like a 70 watts bulb . But I hope this is more than sufficient also it has a application of it's own for light control and key assignment which is unbelievable at this price point . It is nevertheless good for gaming but as goes . Gaming always with mechanical.Still being a membrane keyboard it didn't disappointed me .
5,You can buy it without thinking any thing this is a excellent keyboard it is beyond expectation just there is one problem software is not included it can be installed by downloading rgb 10/10 thickness 8/10 wrist rest 10/10 and you also get a braided cable
5,Really product quantity is awesome then expected in this priceNo other products has such features and quality as compare to other in this price ü§©
4,the keyboards is good but ive been using it foe just over a month but some of the keys are mildly infuriation for theyve been sprayed black at an angle. which makes the keys behind have sort of an glowy edge that looks cool but not all which is no pleasing. the cosmicbyte aplication helps u control the lighting on ur keyboard and assign the macro keys their functions which is handy. for gaming its alright. but for being a membrane keyboard its pretty good for its price
4,A good keyboard for gaming obviously not mechanical so that's the drawback only otherwise it's amazing.Brightness of rgb in this keyboard was amazing but ya the software of it is it a lil bit laggy I dnt knw why it isn't optimized.But ya its a value for money deal.I like the product and recommend to those who want a rgb gaming keyboard with good brightness and gaming experience (keep in mind good not best) and have a limited budget...üëç
5,First impression:Fabulous keyboard ..You get  8 rgb effects and 8 levels of brightness control.(and their is per key rgb and 26 anti ghosting keys)..the delivery was pretty good too
3,It's an okay product if you know where your keys are! I'm writing this review after one month and from my experience I'm saying that the feel is like a basic membrane keyboard.its kind of a dust magnet and the keys were wearing out.the armrest is short and keys get scratched easily when removing.the multimedia buttons and gaming buttons have RGB below them but their keys are black which blocks the RGB.
5,"This is simply the best budget keyboard that you can get in this price segment, the usp of this keyboard is that it has per key rgb which is indeed eye-candy. Overall I feel this is a great non-mechanical keyboard. Haven't faced any issue till date, working like a charm."
5,"Its an amazing keyboard, some of the best rubber domes and per-key rgb with millions of shades and so many animation albeit you need the software for that. If your thinking about it get it its huge and hardy with no deck flex, even has brightness control."
3,"Overall a very sturdy and heavy keyboard. LED effects are cool.But it misses out on few essential things:1. Keys are very hard, not a great fun for fast typing.2. Keys are laid out spaciously but keys aren't responsive, leading to a lot of typos3. Some keys are sticky, once pressed they don't pop up back."
5,Key board is superb at price of 1300 you will get RGB back-lit software support and micro keyboard.
4,"Product is good as per budget. RBG is ok ok, not so bright but will do the work, also the keyboard is big in size so make sure u hv space ."
4,I am using this keyboard for last 1month.keyboard backlight is asome and light effects are really coolüòéAnd the cons is1.height of the keyboard is light bit heavy2.colour will shade out after one month not all keysBut specially keys like w s a d spacebar
5,Now this is the best keyboard for budget gamers . 8 RGB modes with softwareAnd keyboard sound's lil bit to mechanical keyboard and gives feel like a mechanical keyboard .
1,"Don't bother buying this. The keyboard packaging was half torn. I accepted it since earlier keyboards I got were defective and this one seemed to be in working condition.Now in less than 2 months, the 'h' and '9' key stopped working."
5,"Buttons fill bit small but it's my personal issue. Ovar all the quality is awesome. You can controller light for keyboard it self without any software. It has easy access buttons for volume, music emails"
1,"First, it has no mechanical keys. So if you want that then it's not for you. Also, it is a Chinese product so be aware."
5,"Great product, I like the way we can change the pattern easily... More than 6-7 moods to change according to vibe"
5,The keyboard is pretty good at this price. Led doesn't work on extra keys like on left pane keys with G and separate function keys given in keyboard. Check images attached. I'd still give 5 stars because of price and quality.
1,Seller keep on sending defective products.....they just try to sell their left over defective stock....try to buy when new stock arrived.I got my keyboard used ...badly packed along with 4-5 keys are not working.
4,"The product is good.Good built.About the RGB light, some mentioned features like gaming mode (FN+M), Normal mode (FN+R) & reducing or increasing the brightness isn't working.Else a decent gaming keyboard."
1,Keys dont work after few months of purchase and the customer service is too poor Worst customer service ever seen.
5,"Brightness is little less...just little, nothing to bother"
5,"Best product...value for money for budget gammers ..one thing wrost on that product is ""size""its take lots of space in my pc desk & brightness of LED is also less."
5,Awesome keyboard at this price. Login itü•∞
4,Key print will go with time and not printed very well.
5,Overall nice iam happyüòäüòä8 level of brightnessProgrammable extra keysMultimedia keysWindows key lock options during gamingLot of functions
2,"first day it worked excellent, but the next day, it stopped"
1,This keyboard is best for the people who just started gaming and also it's value is worth because the RGB and the mechanical fell is very goodGood for starters
4,as this money this very good product good rgb good keys but not machanical but its ok at 1500 rupees you dont get an machanical good yhanks
1,"Don't buy Cosmic Byte keyboards,i still don't have a working keyboard.Customer service is slow"
4,"This is a long term review and I am doing it since Amazon asked me. Bottom line is for the price it is one of the best ""gaming"" keyboards you can buy. I bought this keyboard around 2 months ago and it's still working fine with few minor or negligible problems.For detailed information keep readingFirst of all, the keys are not mechanical as they might seem. The actuation force is a bit high for a gaming keyboard, which means the keys need to be pressed a bit hard to register. Typing is fine, but could've been better since I've worked on more affordable keyboards and they type better. And also I would like to point out that the keys are painted and the paint is fading off (I've attached a picture, check it out). This has brought me down because now the keyboard looks cheap and shabby. I use the keyboard for gaming, so the keys I pressed the most are WASD, LShift, Ctrl, Space bar, and Tab. In one of the pictures that I attached, you can see 'A' and 'D' are already faded like they've been scrape out.Now the lighting effect. The lighting effects are good. There is quite a number of modes you can switch to (video attached). However, the keyboard is base lit and not key lit, which means the lights are not inside each key but is placed in the base of the keyboard and spread out throughout the keyboard. Key lit keyboards are better for readability in low light condition but you will not have a hard time using this keyboard in the same condition, either.Lastly, the build quality. The keyboard is completely made of plastic. Not too bad, but there is a lot of flex which makes it easy to break if you put some force to it. But I know you're not looking forward to put pressure on the keyboard with your dumbbells or any thing that's heavy, and since you're gonna be using it for gaming, the build quality should bother neither me nor you.Here's my verdict, for a thousand bucks you can't go wrong with this keyboard. It has decent keys, pretty good lighting effects, decent build quality, and oh I forgot to mention one more important thing, some of the keys have anti-ghosting feature which means if you press them all simultaneously, they will all register which is very important in gaming and you do not find this feature in conventional keyboards. This is a deal maker for me. However, I am not sure which all keys support this, but the keys I use most often which I mentioned above support anti-ghosting so I have no complaint and neither will you."
4,"1st review (the day of the delivery)I'm going to be honest; I was kind of scared when I read the reviews because most of the people were giving negative and bad reviews about it.Those who gave negative reviews had one of these problems -1) Improper packaging and wrapping2) Bad handling by the delivery executive3) Damaged/removed keys4) Lighting options not working5) Broken base/ some of the keys not workingNow, if you're reading through the reviews and are about to move on to the next keyboard then wait and read this one.I'm going to talk about the keyboard in detail, including all the features, it's pros and cons.The first thing I did as I got the keyboard was to check every key if it's working correctly or not, and they all were (sigh of relief).First, the delivery and service :The order arrived two days early, thanks to the Amazon team. I bought the keyboard in a lightning deal (Rs. 880), which was even more reason to be scared because the lightning deals are infamous for delivering defected and used products. But mine looked good as new and felt terrific. I got the hang of it quickly.Second, the packaging :The packaging was intact and adequate. There was a cardboard covering on the outside and then the box of keyboard itself.Inside the box, the keyboard was covered and protected safely and adequately. So overall, the packaging was fine.Third, the feel and build quality :The keys are lifted, as mentioned in the description, and require less pressure to press them (it being a membrane keyboard and all). The keys do make a clickity sound, but it will not be even close to a mechanical keyboard sound, so don't keep your expectations too high.The build quality is where the keyboard loses points. The plastic used to make the keys and the body feels cheap and not premium at all.Also, talking about sturdiness, the keyboard is NOT as sturdy as mentioned in the description. It has a lot of flex in it, and the whole seems weak in terms of toughness and durability. But if you don't have a lot of traveling to do with the keyboard (in which the keyboard might break or something), then you don't have a lot to worry about since the keyboard will sit there with your system.The rubber feet under the keyboard hold it in place and it also has a kind of flippable stand under which can be used to lift the keyboard from behind.Fourth, the lighting modes :It has nine lighting modes that are bright enough to look cool even in daylight and the brightness can be changed.They can be changed by pressing Fn+(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). I will include images and videos for each lighting mode.You can change the speed of transitions by Fn+(-,+) and the level of brightness by Fn+(page up, page down).It has one unique feature, which I liked - the sound-sensitive lighting, which can be activated by Fn+9. It has a built-in microphone that picks up the sound in its surroundings, and the keyboard reacts accordingly. This effect looks really cool and is just amazing.Lastly, the multimedia keys :Fn+(F1-F12) Include - one media key (opens the music app), 3 volume keys (up, down and mute), 4 music control keys (play/pause, stop, previous and next), one button to open mail app, one home button (works differently depending on the app open), one lock key (locks the PC), and last calculator button.The description says that it has a 19-key rollover, which I tested and it IS true and they claim to be having 10M keypresses, so let's hope that turns out to be true as well.Overall the keyboard is a steal for Rs. 880, with the only drawback being the negligible sturdiness. If you want to buy a cheap RGB keyboard with lots of fun lighting modes, then go for it, it even has a one year warranty, so if anything goes wrong, you can always contact the manufacturer.Sorry if the review got a bit too long, but I was very confused when I wanted to buy it and I want to help others to clear out their doubts about this keyboard.This is a really early review and I will update it if I notice any changes in it.Peace ‚òÆThree months update-The keyboard is working fine. There are a few cons I discovered after the prolonged use.-It catches dust like a lot of it. So it requires cleaning the keys every week.-One of the letter (D) is starting to fade. The printing is not very good, and it's only after three months, so I'm guessing it's going to get much worse after this.Other than that, everything seems fine and the keyboard is working like it's supposed to. All the lighting modes are functioning well."
2,This keyboard not a good quality. In my case after 3 months keyboard is not working properly and I am very thankful for cosmic byte team. I am call the customer service of Amazon and they are give me a contact number of cosmic byte team. I am calling them to ask if my problem with this keyboard. The customer service is very good. Customer service will return this keyboard and they said it was faulty ic or circuit them afterthe 15 days he is replaced the keyboard but the in my case this keyboard is not available in India. I am change the keyboard to another keyboard for cosmic byte the model no is CB-GK 03 Black Eye to cut my old keyboard price and after paying amount to pay on the delivery. I have 2 star of the keyboard but I'm give it 5 Star for cosmic byte service center team. Good work.
5,"I'm using the keyboard since near 2 months . I'm running on windows 10 . The picture i uploaded is in the broad day light . so , i hope the people who's gonna purchase this keyboard does't have to worry about in the night time . The working conditions of my key board are , when it's not using the back light turn's off , when the system is in snooze or paused in gaming time's key board blinks and light's are stable while using . These are the things i felt using the product.  Now i'm only looking forward to the durability of the key board. I paid 812 Rs/- for this product. Comparatively cheaper with the competitor's in the market also. :-)"
2,"I liked the RGB effect when it worked that is, which it didn't half the time as the lights kept turning off for hours. Very unreliable product received. The front panel was damaged and numpad delete key was missing the membrane support. Otherwise the keys are nice and soft. Its a good cheap rgb keyboard if everything worked. But I won't recommend buying this at all."
4,"I did not buy this keyboard for gaming. I am a programmer and I have to write thousands of lines of codes at a go. Previously, I used the keypad of my laptop for typing but I wasn't feeling comfortable using the inbuilt keypad because I could not type very fast on the laptop as I always had a fear of jamming any key of the keypad. And you may know that replacing a laptop's keypad is very expensive. Hence, I decided to buy an external keyboard. While buying the keyboard, I considered mainly three points which were 1) the keyboard must have back-lit keys so that i can type in the night without turning the room lights on and disturbing others sleep,  2) the keyboard needed to be sturdy and 3) it must have adjustable height. At first, I decided to consider keyboards from reputed brands like Logitech but I realized that they were extremely expensive and would be an overkill for my needs. After that I came to know about this keyboard from CosmicByte. It had all the features which I had been looking for and luckily it wasn't expensive at all ! That's why I purchased this keyboard from Amazon at about 1.2k and after using it for some days, I must say it is quite good. I am listing down the pros and drawbacks of this keyboard below,> Pros1. It has 7 different LED colours and nine different modes ! You can even adjust the brightness of the LEDs and customize the illumination pattern. The LEDs are very bright and I can assure you that even reputed and expensive brands like HyperX, Corsair, Kingston do not have higher brightness than this one. Clearly, LED back-lighting is its biggest plus point.2. The height of the keyboard is adjustable and that's a good thing. It has four rubber pads on its back side to keep it firmly fixed on its place.3. The keys are scratch resistant.4. The cable is braided and super sturdy hence no chance of getting torn down due to folding.>Now, let's talk about its drawbacks,1. The keys are not that sturdy. It is still okay for typing but I seriously doubt about gaming. Although the keys look like mechanical ones but they aren't. if you are considering this keyboard for gaming then I would suggest you to avoid this.2. No dedicated media playback buttons.So the bottom-line is this is really a great, value for money keyboard if and only if you want super duper LED back lighting effect and comfortable typing for long sessions. However, this isn't a good gaming keyboard as the keys are not that sturdy and I seriously doubt how long it can last with heavy gaming.One last point, although this isn't about this keyboard. This is about packaging from Amazon. Amazon packed the product very poorly. They didn't wrap it with any bubble wrap or air pillows and shipped it directly within a plastic sack ! This type of poor packaging from Amazon is really a bad thing. I hope they improve their shipping standards."
1,"This keyboard advertises 19 anti ghosting keys but it is just sweet talk to point towards the fact that not ALL keys work.For all you gamers out there, please note that that this keyboard will not register the W,Q and A keys together. Which basically means that you will NOT BE ABLE TO PEEK WHILE MOVING DIAGONALLY. Similarly, W, E and D will not be registered together. For a keyboard which advertises itself as a gaming keyboard with N-key rollover, this was a HUGE disappointment. Suggest you to spend a little more money and go for actual well-known vendors because cosmic-byte is only here to fool you all."
4,"I got the keyboard replaced with a another brand new one by amazon & seller - thanks for that. Previous keyboard had issue with W & Shift key it was hard to press.Pros:Rgb lightning, with 7 color different color option, various light effects is a +, feels solid while press which is good for gaming, build is tough & not flimsyBetter than redgear keyboards in this budget. Even its the only good option in this budget.Cons:Keys are hard to press & painful while playing for long hours.Hand rest is not there so no place to rest your palm while typing or gaming for long time"
1,"So I bought this product since my previous keyboard was also from cosmic byte and I was pretty comfortable with it. I was very comfortable with this product, the lighting was also pretty and except the space bar, every key was sturdy. However, after 2 months of use the keyboard stopped working randomly. I tried to claim the warranty but they replied by saying that they cant do anything since the product is out of stock and will not be available until the end of September. Fraud for money, 0/10 Customer Service and reliability. Would not recommend this keyboard at any possibility."
2,"Dont buy if you are a coder/type a lot.It was my experience after one month of 9 hours a day using it.This keyboard is nice looking like a truck in RGB mode.but on reality side you will hate it using in rainbow mode. It irritates while working. I used the static color blue or white while working in dark room.But after 1 month. I am done with it. That rgb thing is just a fancy thing which you will not use until you are recording video or posting instagram snap or some friends are with you in the room to boast it. Else üò∂Its waste. Atleast I didnt use RGB ever.Talking about typing experience. I am a professional developer and I have to type a lot. Using this keyboard initially was okay, I tried to adjust myself. But after a month fingers started paining. Keys are hard to press. Membrane keyboard is not made for coders. Go for a mechanical keyboard if you use keyboard to type more than 5 hours a day. Else this keyboard is fine for excel and basic stuff ( gaming too).Cant use it or return it anymore. It will go in cupboard nothing else. üòä Wasted but learnt a lesson. Will use it maybe in future when mechanical keyboard sound is not required. Thanks for reading"
5,I was looking for a budget keyboard with RGB backlight to step up my setup and then I came across this product. In my view this keyboard is very close to perfect (for the price).PROS-1.Highly customisable RGB lighting which no other keyboard offers at this price range!2.Good click feeling..even though not mechanical.3.Long braided usb cable.CONS-1.Keyboard should have been working raised at angle to make it more ergonomic.2.The red back looks really cheap!CONCLUSIONI would definitely recommend this keyboard
5,First of all to cosmic byte plese make specific area to get reviews  in Amazon all of keyboards reviews are mixed up..And to you who is reading cb gk 02 corona is a great keyboard with engraved letters and good rgb for price..If you don't have budget to buy more than 1200 then this keyboard is for you.And if you are buying this for traveling plese don't this keyboard could  break under 5-10kg load so take one cheap keyboard which is unbrekble..
5,"The keyboard is certainly good looking and as shown in th images.Pros: Bright lit and readable keys.-Accurate key stroke are registered-I would say when it comes to gaming this is at par with some of the expensive keyboards.- Multi Color LEDs with 9 preset modes- Braided cables which is a only available on premium keyboard. It's a mark of a quality keyboard.Cons: No arm rest which makes it a pain to use this for longer hours.- The Led modes are preset and they cannot be saved so each time you turn on your PC you have to select your previously set mode again.- Prone to collecting lot of dirt as there is log of gap between the keys.But despite the cons I love the keyboard. It's one sturdy keyboard. If you are on a budget, but want to have a premium keyboard experience then go for this one."
3,"My cousin bought this keyboard and i tested his out its RGB colors look very pretty and was convinced to buy it, but when it arrived the box was damaged and when i saw the keyboard, it was opening even though the screws were there, had it replaced and even the replaced version of the keyboard was damaged, this shows how well they handle the package, i'm returning the product as of now, guys if you want to buy this keyboard I recommend to buy it on their website which is cosmic byte, the guys in amazon do not know how to handle the product, this is the first time i've had a bad experience with amazon through may years as being a regular customer."
1,The back lit leds seemed pretty good....Just then my eyes fel in the bottom part of the keyboard...The screw joints were broken... Ya that's right... I egarly waited for this keyboard to be delivered.... But I had nothing but a handfull of disappointment... I don't know who's fault is this is that the courier service or the product was damaged from the first... But I'm very disappointed.... üòë
5,"after a month of use i can say it's just awesome, too good.. key travel is more than my old intex one which is actually good, it is somewhat prone to catching dust under the keys, not too big of a deal since it's fairly easy to clean blowing air or using tweezers or removing the keys.. i would have liked a computer sleep hotkey but no big deal, can still use the windows shortcuts but they are like 4 key presses.. windows+D then alt+f4 then arrow up then enter.. love the lighting and control options.. it doesn't remember the light settings once the computer is turned back on that might be good actually.. takes anywhere from 1 to few keystrokes to get to the desired setting. this is in no way a mechanical keyboard but it's far better than the membrane keyboards we typically use.. sits somewhere in the middle.. spillproof too, there are 3 water drain holes at the bottom, you can see right through them. i didn't have any issues with the key prints fading off yet and it feels like the paint layer is substantial when i touch trying to feel how thick the paint is, quiet thick i would say.. having said all this, it still gets no less than 5 stars from me.. there is no other keyboard even close to the price with backlit rgb and this many lighting options that looks so dam cool.. nothing beats it.. I'd say go for it!"
1,"I received the product on time.Keys are soft & good.Backlighting is amazing, with multiple options.So far working good.Wouldn't say it's the best choice for gaming, but it isn't the worst @ this price rangeupdate after 45 daysKeys y-p, alt stopped working.Disappointed"
4,"this is just an attempt to find out what typing on this thing feels like.The tactile feedback is pretty good, however the end is a bit soft. So it's good-bad.The overall feel of typing is pretty good though.The keys aren't too hard to press, they are spaced well enough.The shape of the enter key is a bit different from what I'm habituated to, but that's not an issue.The backlighting is pretty good. It comes with a direct on-off switch, and has 3 levels of intensity adjustment.Note: this is a blue LED only model. The direct LED on-off key is very handy instead of having to toggle through the settings.The risers on the bottom aren't too tall, so they don't give the keyboard much of an angle.Overall, it's a very good keyboard, but not one particularly aimed at gamers.It's essentially just a normal keyboard with some backlit keys."
5,"The most best keyboard in the price range. The build quality is good not the great. And it has 9 lighting RGB effects which is eye-catching. I love this keyboard. And some reviews says that the text is fading after long use that is totally wrong. I am using for 3-4 months and i plays always fps games like pubg , call of duty , counter strike. Etc. In this case i use W A S D SHIFT keys offen in my case it long lasting and the test not faded. The best keyboard under rs1200 and you can go for it.  Now it is currently unavailable in Amazon but you can try in cosmic Byte website. Best buy for my PC upgrade."
4,"I  typed for long time with this and yes I feel real comfort. I don't need press hard which cause hand pain for long time typing. Also the backlit effect helps a lot to work at night at office. At this price plastics quality is not that good, if I press hard at middle sometimes it bends. Also the shape of enter key little bit troubling me but as a whole worth buying it."
4,"I bought the red variant for 1139‚Çπ on 12.08.2020.First impressions :Built quality:Average, but not a concern for most of them. There is little to no flex while typing. Back red casing looks cheap, but rest are OK. Keys print quality also seems ok, but the plastic keys feel cheap compared to my previous logitech keyboard priced around 1000‚Çπ.Gaming:Played pubg for 1hr, no ghosting issues found, also responsive. Lighting is good and keys also get lit up. Only 2 color modes for the single colour variant: normal and breathing.Productivity and general usage :Here is where this keyboard falls behind. Since it is marketed as a gaming keyboard, it's OK but the typing experience is not that great. You will take some time to get used to it. On my first day of usage, i felt myself making more errors while typing. This all accounts on the key shape and feel. I felt the keys where quite boxy and slippery compared to my old logitech one.Packaging and delivery:This is the worst part. The product packaging was bad and dusty.No date of manufacture printed on the box. Also no serial number printed on the box to identify the product's genuineness. Also the amazon box was torn open and the keyboard box could be seen through when it arrived. Thankfully the keyboard was OK and no minor scratches or defects were found. Disappointed with amazon delivery and seller in this part.This was my first impressions on this keyboard. I felt it is slightly overpriced. Should have been around 800-1000rs.Will update my review after 1 week of extensive usage"
4,"Warnings!!!!!.Cb-gk-08...This keyboard has only rainbow effect only,no other color effects...Brought it on: 29/12/2019Pro:Sturdy buildGood key press( sound not as much as a mechanical but it will do the job)Good rgb brightnessGood packagingBraided cablePrice is low (799)Con:Only rainbow effect(i thought it was full rgb but only Rainbow effect .One key combination swap the aswd keys to arrow keys(haven't found what key combination to undo it)"
5,"Everything Is Perfect So Good For The Money. Lighting is so awesome you can see in my video. Braided Cable for More Durability. Feels like mechanical keyboard but won't hear that much ""tak tak"" sound. You have to press Keyboard keys are little bit harder because if you don't then it will send 2 or 3 signal at a time happens with every membrane keyboard. 7 color RGB light 10 Themes with Frequency Changing and Brightness Control. That more than enough good.Only complain is that the Keyboard key printing is average like normal cheap keyboards."
3,Pro:1.Brought form 716 RS2.Only keyboard with decent backlights3. ALPHABET are visible at nights BIG DEAL4. Doesn't gives a cheap look of rgb colour mix5. Good side protection and red light at edges.6. 3 variable brightness adjustmentsCons:1. Single colour2. A bit costlier for single colourOver all better than RGB as pink and green or red are not that good as per my preference  or the combination of those neither breathing lights are useful but just marketing stuntQUITE WORTH !!
3,"The keyboard is good and all, but the keys won't last very long... Its a membrane keyboard, so the keys will get softer as time passes. But after lightly using it for around a month, the keys are already very soft... If you like soft keyboards then you may not face a problem. But for those who like tactile keyboards, just get a mechanical keyboard or get a different membrane keyboard. This keyboard is good for typing, but not good for gaming.."
3,"Alright I'll be honest. When the delivery guy first delivered it, the package was kind of ""squished"" and dented near the lower left corner (depends on how you see it) but the keyboard box was still in shape so it was only the external packaging. Lucky :v. It kinda looked like they just picked it up from their store room as if it was sitting there since like 3 or 4 months getting all dusted because I could notice the settled dust on the keyboard box. The keyboard works just fine anyway tho it's only been 2 days since I am using it. Tried all the RGB effects and it is just as mentioned in the user manual or description. The Del key on the numeric keypad looks 3% faded just 3% :v. Tho I hope the other keys don't start fading after heavy usage hmmm. That's all for now."
1,"One of the worst keyboards ever. The antighost keys never register properly. Dont ever use it for gaming. When you are using mutliple keys (for a game like fifa), all the keys wont register properly and you can certainly feel the lag. Have to press the keys years before to get the proper move. Only the lights in the keyboard are as advertised. I have used a no. of keyboards (wired and wireless) and even if this is a wired one, it dont have the response of a bluetooth keyboard."
1,All the lighting effects are working fine but the keys are not working didn't expect this from cosmic byte worst feeling everüò¢üòî. The main box had tape on top of the seal not the Amazon box but the keyboard's box. Very disappointed. Inside it even had a old bill.
3,"packaging was damaged. But keyboard was ok.Backlit are fine and bright enough.You can control brightness, color and other functions of backlit.Lights also can be reactivate according to sound.But major problem i am facing is that with keystrokes,Back key and some other key r jamming. You need to press back key from center otherwise you will face jamming while you pressing the key.Btw its my 1st rgb keyboard with gaming look.I used to use simple 500rs keyboards.In future will try to use mechanical."
5,"It's a must have keyboard, Love it's various modes & is useful in no-light conditions. Always wanted to have a back-lit keyboard for my laptop; wonderful to program various colours & speeds of lighting."
5,"Bought it 2 days ago and so far I'm impressed with the keyboard. At this price the features are pretty great. The keys are elevated and some of you might take a few days adjusting to it. The anti ghosting feature is also present which is a must if you play games. Regarding the build, so far it appears to be sturdy. I'll update the review in a few months if any issue comes up.P.S.: if it has been a few months since this review was written, there has been no issue at all. (12 July 2020)"
5,"I'm alot happy since I got this product. I won't say this best in this price range cause if you spend nearly 2-3K you've still not close to get this kind of product.Pros.7 Color backlit with effectsYou can select any of color as constant to work on.You can select different rgb patternsin different part of keyboard.The amazing thing is you can set your own color from given 7 in any of keyboard part which is user defined mode provided by this keyboard.Voice control over backlit works more accurate.Functions given with short cut like calc, mail etc.No need of install any driverConsI haven't found any cons but a plastic body and not of aluminium needs more care to be taken since it is obvious in this price range.Go for it. Will worth your single penny."
4,"Best keyboard I have ever used , not recommended for people who want mechanical keys, because it is totally different from mechanical keyboard and membrane keyboards, it gives some different feel while gaming, it's response time is very good, and the brightness of RGB is good not very much bright. It has voice detection RGB mode which is a good feature in this keyboard which is present in ‚Çπ3000 and above keyboard. I only recommend thes IF YOU HAVE LOW BUDGET FOR BUYING KEYBOARD (BELOW ‚Çπ 1500) otherwise u can buy cb-gk-12 which is little bit expensive but it is worthy ü§óü§ó"
5,"The reason I bought this was for programming and gaming. This has sufficed my expectations. RGB isn't one of the best features of the keyboard. But let's face it, the only time it is used is when you take a picture or to show-off to people. Otherwise, personally, it is more of a disturbance rather than an interesting feature of the keyboard. But you can always turn it off. So that's a win-win.The overall key handling, typing experience, mechanical feel, gaming experience, sensitivity is so damn perfect for the price especially. Got it for 700 bucks. It is really a good purchase if your budget is low and you are not looking into using it that heavily. Once you get the hang of it, you will stick to it. Go for it then?"
5,Good product considering the price. Gives a mechanical feel when you type on it. In my opion an average user can also buy it. Not sure about gaming cause I am not that much into gaming. Overall a good package.I got it around 700 rupees. If you are getting it in that price point then it's a steal....The only con that I have is that you can't change the colors....which is annoying sometime....also I feel the default brightness is too harsh..... Although you can change the brightness levels...
3,using this keyboard for almost 1 year. my use is heavy and for gaming only. the keyboard is of good quality but the lettering on some buttons are faded after 1 year of use. I had some issue within 6 months of use. some keys were stopped working so I gave it to repair to cosmic byte repair center under warranty. service was good and fast. they did something I don't know what but it's ok now. so service is good. its good product but not perfect its good for its cost.update : used this for 1 year and 4 months of regular heavy gaming use and its dead now. some keys are not working. and base broke in half all attached screws are broke. quality issue.
4,"Been using this keyboard for a while now and I have not faced any issues with this for now.However, The only thing annoys me is that the the flippable stand on back of the keyboard does not stay in place. so you have to adjust it every time to lift the keyboard a little up or down.Apart from this go for this"
3,I have used this keyboard for a total of 5 days and my experience went from good to eh.Below I'm mentioning my experienceThe RGB would look great in beginning till you won't habitual to it.The keys become wobbly after heaving usage like typing and gaming and make noise even on light touches.Doesn't have gold plated usb.Has braided cable!The keyboard appears great online but the plastic is weak and keys may stop working if pressed hard enough.The only point of buying it is the RGB keys that's allReturning it
5,Best keyboard in this budget... There are more expensive keyboard than this keyboard.. But this one is a lot better than them... Key pressing feedback is awesome.. Customizable light.. 9 types of default lighting effect... Build quality is also very good and strong..
4,"its is not the old version,its the new version of keyboard,and doesnot have the lightning features like it used to have in older ones.Overall agood keyboard for normal usage and can do casual gaming's  not hardcore. Also membrane keyboard cant give u the feel of mechanical keyboard,but gets the work done.It look nice at night and also keys can be removed and cleaned.I dont prefer it to be take along when u travel.keyboard has 3 zone lightning, but no extra effects with brightness controls, plastic body so not very rigid,to be true it doesnt feel like premium, got it for 900 rupees so no complain u cant expect much more in this price range,pretty much job done,decent look at night,bought it cause cosmic byte service is good,,hope it works fine with me also.braided cable is present.Dont get confused like me its a new version,older version used to have fancy lightning with effects.working for me for almost 1 and half month....hopefully last longer."
4,"The cover is fits perfectly, the only con is that backlit keyboard is not that visible and the caps lock light, num lock light and fn lock light is not visible,I dont use backlit keyboard so it dosent matter to me as the light is dim but if the cover was less thicker it would come off the keyboard easily"
3,Quality is goog but whole cover should be transparent as black area is blocking the rgb and the keypad is not visible when lights are turn off
5,Awesome product and value for money üí∞
5,superb quality ... fitting is just asowem but the keyboard lighting is low visible can be better ü§û
1,Looks like a used product. it is loose on keys also backlit is not clearly visible.
5,1) Price is little bit high.2) Perfect Fit.3) Good Quality.
4,Should be more transparent for keyboard RGB.
4,value for money
5,It's better than ifyx Keyboard Skin.Very Good Quality.Perfectly Fitted to the Keyboard.No Stain on my legion's Screen.
3,"It stays on well over the keypad. The color black is really good. As u can see in the video, the lights that glow when u press the caps lock or mute button is covered. I have no idea why they didn't think of that. It's not altogether comfortable to type with the cover laid over the keypad. The cover folds a bit every time u press a key. It's a bit overpriced for this quality."
4,Nice product. Except the left below corner comes out occasionally with use.
1,No caps lock backlight cutout as shown in picture.....also for f6 backlight....Very disappointed....
5,Product is mind blowing but we need still more thickness that's all
5,Nice product... worth it
4,good...
5,Awesome productperfectly suited forHP 15S00096TU
5,Value for money
4,"Sleek. Lightweight. Bang for buck.No one would argue on the fact that Logitech products have degraded their quality in last decade and they do not last as long as they used to, the usability their products provide for the cost we as a consumer pay are still unbeatable.This keyboard (which comes with a mouse) have smooth and soft to press switches, which would get rougher eventually as dust settles in it.I had logitech K120 previously. A couple of switches went out after few years of use. Knowing the fact that logitech is not as reliable as it used to be, I doubt it would last ""5 Million keystrokes"" as it suggests on the packaging.It feels easy to type though I would have loved a bigger ""Enter"" key rather than a slim key.  Space key is huge and more than comfortable to continually press it with thumb. The keys have different sounds which is a nice engineering touch. Overall, Good keyboard for the money.Mouse on the other hand felt on the cheaper side. Clicks are way to soft. Scrolling has sufficient and good feedback but the clicks feel a little too softer than it should. I've had multiple cheaper mouse of some random companies that felt more ergonomic, comfortable and good to click.Thats just my honest opinion. Overall, a good combo for the price of 799 Indian rupees for daily use. I would not recommend it for gaming. Choose a good mechanical keyboard for gaming instead of this."
4,"Good Product, Easy to use. But when i recieve the product Alt and space button was broken. But i fixed it. But keyboard is very soft when we type. Value for money"
4,I liked the product but the only doubt I have is that serial number mention on packaging and serial number on the back side of keyboard does not match which makes me think that it is not genuine. Not sure if this is normal !!
5,"I bought this Logitech MK120 Keyboard Mouse set in offer. Here I would like to review it in points-1] Quality: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖBuild Quality of this Logitech MK120 is brilliant. Key press is soft and quick. Made of high quality plastic material.2] Brand: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖI've used Intex, Frontech keyboard/mouse but there is no match to this keyboard mouse. Logitech been trusted brand for me since 13 years. Loved it's products.3] Price: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖI got it in offer and current price is 900 which is absolutely worth it.4] Inside Box:There is Logitech Keyboard and Mouse in this Box.5] Warranty: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖComes with 3 year manufacturer warranty. Which is absolutely brilliant. (Water spill, physical damage doesn't cover the warranty)"
3,"I bought this in emergency because my Apple Keyboard went bad and I wanted a replacement ASAP and next day delivery was possible for this product. I expected a normal keyboard/mouse without bells and whistles that would get the job done. What I did not expect was to get a broken mouse out of the box.The mouse came assembled wrong in the box and it's wire hanging out from its side. Upon further inspection, it seems like it was also forced closed when being packed which broke one of its clip. I did not want to be left without a keyboard so return is out of question. I'm just keeping the combo for its keyboard."
5,"The packaging was worst , also the mouse were disassembled , But the main Part the Products are excellent.. the Logitech B100 is famous mouse and we we get the same mouse deer but with different colour also you can check Logitech b100 on Amazon overall it's a perfect choice under 700 or 800 rupees just go for it...."
2,Its a value for money product if you get all in one piece. Very Poor quality control. So on your luck.(1) Seals are broken for the box. Other customer pointed the same. Though product seems new or like new.(2) Mouse is delivered broken. Similar issue reported by many other users.(3) A large package housed a small product box. Keyboard was outside the box when it was delivered.
4,"It's been almost 4 months since i bought them and if i say they are one of the best. i won't hesitate. if you are low on budget and want the best combo here you go. i got it for 550 which was a pretty good deal and mainly what attracted me was the goodwill of the brand logitech and the 3 year warranty which we get with this product, i compared it with many other reputed brands but i was not satisfied until i found them."
5,"I liked the prompt delivery even in this situation of COVID. The product delivered is genuine and contains the mouse and  keyboard in very good condition. Logitech is a very nice brand so you can close your eyes and purchase it. The smoothness of the keyboard is what I like most.It creates the typing sound a little more than normal , so if you dont want to disturb others around then this can be a problem. This is the only flaw"
5,"You basically get everything you ask for , a great high quality keyboard and mouse combo which are simply plug and play. All keys are great and have very low actuation force . Mouse is great too with an amazing ergonomic design . I have a big palm and it fits really nicely into my hands. No issues while using . And afterall , it's Logitech ! It will work for years ! Must buy."
4,Nice key board and mouse at 800 rupees  .It is connected to my smart tv and it is very use full you can blindly buy this at this price..but mouse quality should be little bit improved and both keys and mouse are very soft to use .. over all i liked it..üòäüòç
5,"I got this combo for my sons online school. The keyboard is a gratifying soft click and mouse is simple and decent. Most mouse scroll wheels give in under a few month, I don‚Äôt know if it happen to this mouse. I‚Äôll give an update after a few months.Most importantly the quality that one expected when buying Logitech is there and that‚Äôs what matters."
5,"This keyboard is a absolute workhorse. The keys are a little clacky which is fine by me, I actually kind of like it. It's comfortable to type on. Keys don't get stuck as on some mechanical keyboards. The mouse is light, quite silent and gets the job done. Well worth the cost."
4,"It's a decent set of Keyboard and mouse; given the price. I bought it for 750inr during the diwali sale.There is no problem with the set i received and its working fine.( After 2weeks)I would say if you want a basic keyboard and mouse, then go for it. ( ***Don't buy it for gaming)It might seem a bit cheap in the begining(especially the mouse)  but its a decent product ,it works fine and you will get adjusted to it in 3-4 days.As far as i have used it: i have had no problems."
5,"Perfact product, good seller, recommend this keyboard & mouse. Fast delivery. Good packing. Genuine seller. Good product. I personally like this deal."
3,"I only use key board for a month, two keys Left Side Shift and Space bar are having problem.Some times it is not working, need to press very hard to work.I wished i brought some other keyboard.Thanks"
5,"Used for daily office work. Doesn't look like a good opi for gaming. But for every day work, it's perfect. Had used Logitech mouse and keyboard before and they are really good in quality. Keyboard feels good in hand and keystrokes are very comfortable. Mouse is very light in weight and clicks are accurate too.I recommend this product."
5,Keyboard provides good feedback but the wire is too thin and looks weak. Mouse feels cheap and scroll wheel feels flimsy. Wire is also very fragile and looks like it can break easily. But it is working fine for me since 1 month.
4,"Good keyboard with nice comfortable keys not very soft and still with good robust feedback. Not very cheap or expensive, good for regular use"
4,"Writing review after 2+ months of use.+Points . Keys are good , they dont make tak tak sound.. looks sturdy. No keys are loose yet. Mouse is good size.- points. The stand keeps comming out. Wire quality seems to be thin compared to my company provided lenovo keyboard mouse."
3,"After a month sometimes left mouse button works as right mouse button it becomes irritating as when you click the left button right click option pops up, trying to figure out how to apply for warranty.Keyboard is fine."
4,The build quality of Logitech keyboard mouse combo is superior.its worth spending few hundred bucks more for quality.Sturdy build . Using with laptop for office use.
1,Useless product from Longitech . Mouse Is not working properly after 1 month of use
1,"I received a used/opened product, however, I do not want to return it as I have a lot of office work and dont have enough time. This time I really not happy for this order."
5,Got it in a lighting deal just few days before lock down. It helped me boost my productivity while working from home.
5,First impressions are too good...keys are really very soft. In wired keyboard I found it one of the best available keyboards right now..keys are very smooth..you are definitely going to love it
5,Yes definitely value for money.. as my requirements of typing its softness suits me very well. I am  comfortable with this stready keyboard and light weight mouse..
4,The product is simple and it is easy to use. I won't say it is dedicated for gaming but it does a decent job while gaming. Other than gaming i would always prefer this.
5,One of the best combo keyboard and mouse in market. Don't go for others cheap price. Though this are on high on cost for some people but the comfort to use is awesome.
5,One of the best purchase I had...Work fine..And the packing was excellent...
4,Product is overall fine but Amazon logistics packaging & handling is horrible. I ordered it then replaced is but both times product box seal was opened & box was horribly damaged & The product too had scratches & dent
5,Very comfortable to write codes hours after hours with these smooth keys of the keyboard. Using this combo gives me significant sense of difference with any other keyboards. Higher price than other products is in that sense justified.
5,Ordered 2nd for another PC. Very good keys and long lasting.
5,I purchased this keyboard and mouse. Its working fine and with best quality.
1,Iam not satisfied with the product mouse his working but keyboard is showing drive path error I think I received damaged product of keyboard and I tried changing installing usb drivers till now it is not working
3,Click of mouse wasn't working so i got it fixed by opening and refixing as the wire was stuck in it . But overall its working fine and seems a good deal value for money
4,Its better you offen clean the keyboard dust gets accumulated between the keys this may reduce the key strokes registered.Overall good quality product Logitech product.
5,Good product and smooth to use
2,Keyboard was good but mouse damaged. I think seller intentionally shipping damaged mouse.
3,Package delivered like  a second hand product. Used it for only 1-2hr and it seems good .  let's see.. what happen.. normal keys... not good for gaming and heavy use.... .  go for it.. if you're a regular user.
5,"Fits perfectly on HP envy 360x 13. Only thing, finger print will not be recognize when using this over the keyboard."
5,The skin sits perfectly on the key board. Does not look clumsy. This would help in protecting the key board from tea coffee spliIllages and dirt not getting inside the key board.
4,Pefect fit for my hp laptop. Just a normal silicon keyboard cover with key mapping. Designed only for envy series. Not sure of pavilion series.Only downside is unjustifiable cost. Thats why reducing a star.
3,Does the job I bought it for but it doesn't fit on my laptop as it should. But I am satisfied because it protects my keyboard and screen when my laptop has been flipped.
5,Amazig fit fir my laptop thanks a lot
4,Fits perfectly fit my HP Envy 13 x360 .. it‚Äôs semi transparent hence backlit keyboard is easily visible
4,User friendly and comfortable to use.
5,Good product
1,Very thin and already ripped to shreds - but certainly does the trick if it were stronger!
5,Superb quality and it's transparent its not looking like skin cover and perfect fit for Hp envy 13 for 13.3 inch screen
5,Fits perfectly on the HP Envy (13-aq1020tx).
5,Good quality n fits well.
5,JUST PERFECT ...........  LOOKS AWESOME ON KEYBOARD.

1,The worst product i ever come across...
5,Good product for my hp 13.3 inch lapi...
5,Perfect
4,not as expected.
4,Nice
5,Perfect
2,Fits fine with keyboard but too much of shearness.
4,Very satisfied with the overall quality and the fit of the product.An issue: The capslock key should have had a hole for the led to pass through. It has a white printed hole which fooled me at first.A suggestion: find a way to make this black print skin cover to be compatible with backlit keyboards and power button integrated fingerprint sensor.
4,"The fit and the quality of the product is overall satisfying and good. Just faced 2 issues, one is with the caps lock led button indication provision is not given and the other is with the power on fingerprint button access is not available as the complete rubber casing covering the whole keyboard"
4,Precise fit for dell 15.6 inch. Good design and material.But diffuses backlight on keys due to black coating. Difficult to type in the dark.
5,I took it for my Dell XPS and it fits perfectly and has a smooth grip. It will be for long term and you won't be feel good while typing. Best one to buy. Easy to clean and wash.
5,Excellent except there is no proper provision for touch off/ on button
4,Happy with this keyboard skin. Although it covers the fingerprint scanner but that's a minor issue. Overall it feels soft to the fingers and goes perfectly with my laptop skin color.
4,Very gud but two issue one is caps lock light and second is finger print sensor
5,Protects the keyboard and value for money
5,Nice

4,"I am using latest Dell Inspiron 5593 15.6"" laptop.Pros:1. The keyboard skin perfectly fits my laptop.2. Backlit of the Keyboard is clearly visblie even with the skin applied.3. The skin donot move since the skin is miniaturised according to the keys in the laptop.4. Skin is ultra thin.Cons:1. You cannot use fingerprint scanner since it is covered by the skin. A hole provided in the skin at the fingerprint scanner which is embedded in the keyboard would have solved the issue. But, it has its own con of allowing dust to get inside the keyboard.2. I bought it for ‚Çπ373, which I think is high for a keyboard skin. But you will not disappoint with the product except the price.Giving 4 stars because of the high price."
5,"I am having Dell Inspiron 5502 laptop and this product has a decent fit on this laptop. This product is having a nice grip on the keyboard as it is having popup space for every key. Moreover, there are certain problems as well but which are not deal-breaker, it can be more transparent and it covers the fingerprint sensor. However, I have cut the top portion of the fingerprint sensor cover and now it is working well. I have assigned certain images so that they will be more beneficial."
5,This is an amazing product. It fits so well and the backlight shines through perfectly. Without any adhesive it sticks so well on all keys and i tried dropping it by moving my laptop but it sticks well! Perfect worth of money.. Go for it like right now. It fits all 15.6 inch laptops with the mentioned keys. Protects well from dust and grime from daily typing as i code.It just doesn't let you use the fingerprint reader but that's okay its a given with any keyboard skin.
5,Really loved the product. Quality is really good and the best part is that it moulded to fit each key and is also transparent which allows the back light keys to be visible. 5 stars for the Saco keyboard skin
4,"every thing about this is excellent on a short term use, except the fingerprint reader.The cover fits well and doesn't come off often, but very easy to lift.correct design for dell 15"" models with larger version of the keyboard (number pad inclusive)but now the fingerprint reader is useless, unless you lift the cover every time to login."
1,Extremely weird. I tried to fit it on THREE laptops but the keys and the notches on this cover just don't align
5,It is worth buying. The protector is of good  quality and perfectly fit for the keyboard (Dell Inspiron 5501). Only issue is that one can't use fingerprint sensor as there is no opening in the protector. Otherwise it is cool.
3,Fits fine on my laptop but it is little overpriced product. The stickyness was gone once i removed to reposition the skin. Now its coming off very easily.
4,Before considering going to transparent one... Remember that after few days the transparency will go unless you wash it weekly
5,Good product. Fits well with my dell inspiron 15
2,"After few days of usage, few keys are puffy."
5,"It fits perfect, not a inch less or more."
5,"Very thin transparent , fits well , good quality , worth for money"
1,"the pic shows a transparent cover but I received a black cover with keys printed on it, even the backlit also do not work after applying the cover"
3,Good product but not fit in function keys see the above photo üì∑
5,This is really niceProduct is exactly what I was looking for.it sticks quite well on the floor and does not sleep
5,Fit as expected
5,Fit for purpose.
5,Really nice to feel the material used and snuggly fits to the keyboard.
2,Within a month this is the condition. The fingerprint reader doesn't work at all.
5,Best product in this price range. Must buy.
4,Quality is too good nce product... I'm satisfied with thisBut finger print is not working on this
5,Perfectly fits in dell Inspiron 5509
5,Awesome.Con- you can't use fingerprint sensor in your dell inspiron
5,"Perfect fit for my dell inspiron 5502,but  now my finger print button become useless."
5,Good quality
5,Awesome
5,It is good productPerfectly fit to my laptopDell 5502
1,"Very bad, cover nit perfect for laptop keyboard. Do not but it."
5,Super product backlight avaiable and fit for 15 5000 series nice product
4,Good but not delivered on time.
4,Good product...
5,Good
1,This is a useless product with poor quality. Better don't buy this product. Absolutely waste of money. Please don't buy.
4,It fits really well and is definitely helping to keep my dell inspiron 5402 keyboard safe. Only challenge i find is the illumination of backlight is not as bright and bit difficult to read characters. But overall it definitely protects the original keyboard
3,Fits well...Good materialbut don't stick with laptop firmly.Worst part is that by using this one can't use laptop in dark as back light of keys restricted by it as its keys text is not transparent.
1,"I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT, AFTER HAVING HAD A BETTER EXPERIENCE WITH AN HP 14S LAPTOP. BUT THIS NEW ONE FOR DELL 14 INCH 34XX STARTED TO EXPAND AND DID NOT FIT INTO THE KEY LAYOUT.i DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. WASTE OF MONEY"
3,"Skin fits into keyboard and it doesn't seems like that we are using any skin but This skin is not transparent so if you want to use your laptop with backlit, you have to remove it first and than use your keyboard. Which i don't like."
5,It's better than the one which has keys writeen on it. The one with the keys written on it would be good had they left it transparent instead of painting the texts in white.
5,"Perfect product, exactly as expected"
1,Every time I need to pull and strech to fix to fit on keyboard. It get loose and do not hold key position which make very hard to work on loose protector.
5,Very nice
5,Excellent fit and quality.
3,I purchased this for my Dell Inspiron 5408.Though it perfectly matches the size of the keyboard but it doesn't stick to it.
5,Perfect match for Dell Vostro 3405 model.
5,Too good
4,Not Amazing.. Okay..
4,"Product is genuine,good quality, packaging was good.I bought the transparent one."
1,Poor quality
5,"Wasn't expecting this product to be so good. Sturdy, Fancy RGB, Blue switch and multimedia keys. Instantly fall in love with this keyboard"
5,"I purchased the model having Blue MX keys which are preferred for touch typing purposes. You can type on this whole day and not get tired. The feel of PBT keycaps and and cherry MX blue keys is unique.However, do note that cherry MX blue keys are not for gaming for that low profile cherry MX red keys are used or better use a controller."
5,"So I got this keyboard today , the switches are very nice, it was packed very nicely , , you can customise almost every thing, I have a Corsair mice so I can sync he both with the icue software,and the rgb is bright.I love it go for itüî•üî•."
5,One of the best keyboard I have ever used. Best for Gaming and RGB Lovers.Typing experience is amazing with Cherry MX Blue Keys.Outstanding build quality with metal plate. Letters may be bit big for some users but keys are thick and well built. Non standard bottom row. Easy to use media controls. Comfortable wrist pad.
5,this keyboard is just great!! the click keys and the custom ice software is great!! it's cherry mx blue!! so what more could you ask for!! it's nice and I bought it for 17k!
5,"Best for beginners and its value for money!Couldn't ask for a better graphic tablet for this price range.Pros:1. Have a large(not the biggest)  surface area, i can assure you that you will not have shortage of drawing area.2.Comes with 8 extra nibs(not that you actually need them alot, one could last for months)3. Installations and Driver download are very easy. (just go to Huion official website and click driver, search the model and you are done)4.8000+ pressure sensitivity,from fine line to brick size brush, you have them all.5.Compitible with most drawing software from free to paid. (i have tried using it on krita, PS, autodesk sketchbook. It works like butter)6.Tilt recognition: it will depend on the software you use as not all support one. Its handy in sketching.7.A cool looking tablet. Even if you dont draw, you can just place it as a furniture and mesmerise your guests. Lol8.Budget friendly. I bought it at 5300 INR. Gosh i was lucky with the sale.9.The tablet has a matt like sureface, its smooth but have ample amount of friction to draw on10.I could go on. But you get the point.Cons:1. Gloves and surface cleaner cloth not included. Not that i was expecting.2.The pen holder could  have been havier. A little pressure could make it fall.3.I have used it for only one months and i can not say anything about the durability. (quick fact: You could kill a lion with a wacom tablet and still work fine,but this huion tablet feels like it will not survive the night if you dont handle with care. )Dont worry as there are no complaints yet from other customers worldwide about its durability.4.The double click seems to fail sometime(of the button on the pen). You can get used to it.5.There is no touch feature,most wacom tablets have one. Its another point to be noted. Which means you cannot use your hand gesture like pinch in for zoom in and pinch out for zoom out.NOTE: i will give another review after using for a year. Peace out"
5,I'm not an artist and I mostly use it to edit photos/videos and sculpt in Blender. I upgraded from the one by wacom as nibs were impossible to find in India.I can definitely say that it feels excellent. It has great tracking and pressure sensitivity. Tilt is a bit hit or miss in my experience.  But I don't really use it anyway so not a big deal for me. It also may have been user error on my end.The only thing that bothered me is that the pen doesn't support click and drag. So you can't press one button on the pen and then drag the pen to scroll/zoom etc. Also the surface is prone to scratches and it's a fingerprint magnet. That's really a bummer but not a deal breaker.Overall highly recommended.
5,"This tablet is really nice to work with! The pen moves smoothly across the surface and doesn't make much noise at all. The design of the tablet is also very space economic--it doesn't take up more space on your desk than it has to. My last tablet took up more space even though it's surface area was smaller!Installing the drivers was easy, although at first it seemed to not click properly so I uninstalled and reinstalled it and now it works great.I feel like I notice the high pen pressure levels in that it makes lines very smooth and extremely controlled.I would for sure recommend this to any digital artist. It's a lovely size, works smoothly, and feels like great quality. I love the battery-free pen too."
3,"I have been using Huion H 950 P for over a month. Not only it looks great, it also is quite a responsive piece of hardware. But despite all the the facilities it has brought to my video editing and image editing experience, I cannot claim it to be the most professional thing in the market. I have several complaints with this Tab. the first being the driver software. Despite several efforts, I could not update it. It has some very weird interface in the form of mouse mode and Ink mode. if I choose ink mode for the pen button, selecting the text becomes very very difficult and if I choose Mouse mode then all the texts are getting selected at the slightest touch of the pen and scrolling the page becomes a nightmare. I had to opt for both the ink mode and mouse mode. But then it is not responding well while I am using Premiere Pro. Then once again I had to revert back to the mouse mode to have a smooth experience in video editing. So far I had to switch between the modes several times for different applications. And the switches on the left hand side are the worst part of this tablet none of whom works smoothly, sometimes I had to press the switches more than one time to make them perform the assigned tasks.My overall assessment is that - it might be a good pen tablet for the beginners, but the professionals and the semi professionals would not like it much. I will continue to use it, because I cannot afford another tablet at this point of time. I will recommend it only for the price point at which it is providing a medium size tablet with functioning buttons. But anyone who want to do some serious stuffs, must consider shelling out big bucks which will stand them in good stead in the long run."
5,"Have been using the HUION H950p for about 2 weeks. The tablet is lightweight and thin, yet so sturdy. The workspace is just big enough for a beginner myself. Although you will want to adjust the pressure sensitivity of the pen (Just YouTube how) to your comfort and this process is common for all tablets. The driver installation as well as warranty registration wasn't that hard.You have 6 customizable keys. The keys are not wobbly. I did notice the left side of the keys are softer to press than their right. I prefer left side more. Now, coming to the surface texture, it feels like any tablet  when touching with your hand. But, using the pen it feels like writing on paper placed on a writing pad. For me, I like the feel.The pen body isn't too big and has a good grip. Comes with tilt support(Which I have used only for testing). It fits without a wobble into the pen holder(The holder has 8 extra nibs). It says a nib last for months.Yes, It's supported by majority of the software. But, I do advise you... When you first get a drawing software, do configure the pen settings!! Krita had some pen pressure issue, the pen strokes were horribly light. But, after watching YouTube tutorials and adjusting Krita. It was good as new.I'd recommend buying this as a beginner. Personally the hand and eye coordination stuff ain't difficult. If you wanna go for animation, online teaching, digital art and so on. This is more than enough and worth investing. (I bought this at Rs. 4100)"
5,"I'm editing my review here:So I have contracted many associates in Amazon to check this product they gave me was new or not...finally my issue has been solved...So the thing is when I received my product, the box was damaged so I thought they gave me an old product. But no, this tablet is working just amazingly great! Nothing really issues with that...I suggest everyone to buy this tablet cus it's actually amazing and it's capable for Android,Mac and windows! Bad news for iOS users cus it's not available for that! :("
5,"If you are interested in broadening up your art skills from the paper to the virtual world, then Huion H950p is the best product out there to start with, even it's quite applicable to the professionals who travel a lot.With its lightweight and a lot of features included, there's no way looking at the other products within this price point.Thank you."
5,"This product is for beginners as well as for professionals. It supports for android platform also which is amazing that too at ‚Çπ 4700/-. You won't regret buying it. Exploring different apps to draw pictures and writing notes. About size, i think i ordered a large one for me. But with a few minutes you can be master of mapping your computer with this device. Pen is amazing. No need to charge any of them. Just plug n play like a earphone. Buy any of them you will enjoy it."
1,"After one month usage, it stopped working. No help from Amazon and you don't have options to contact Huion Customer service in India. I don't know how to claim the warranty."
5,"I am not able to figure out the use of the buttons given. It is my first writing pad ever , and I could use it with much ease. The software could be installed easily.. Again, much thanks to Amazon. Deliver in 16 hrs."
4,"Good one for beginners. Sensitivity is a bit high out of the box. But you can  adjust it with the app. Size is good. Not too large, not too small. Build quality is good. Texture and feel of the drawing area is also good. Worth the money spend."
5,I have used many drawing tablets before but this is the first one which I felt comfortable with. It's so smooth and the pressure sensitivity is off the charts. I didn't really think it'd be this good. This is the best budget graphic tablet you can find and I recommend this especially for beginners
5,This product is too good for digital artist and this one is cheap. The pressure sensitivity works very well. and this tablet is very handy.
5,My first expression after i got this tablet is it soo lightweight so its quite applicable to the professional who travel a lot. And it's price is so cheap.The pen moves smoothly across the surface and don't feel uncomfortable while using it. The pressure sensitivity works very well.
5,"The drawing area is very adequate and the stylus is the most comfortable i have ever used. The tilt functionality makes it even comfortable and gives the proper feel of drawing on paper, the pressure sensitivity is very accurate and works perfectly."
3,I had tried to set the shortcut keys but it still not working and now neither its pen working properly. Sorry but i want to replace this product or i want refund.
5,Perfect for beginners and intermediate artists. Its easy to use and extremely light weight. Ideal for any artist who wasnts to travel light üëç And the best part is the price. You actually get more than what you paid for.
4,cheap and best
5,its Working .Very nice product.
5,Very good quality product. I found better performance then xp pen tablet. pen comes with 8 extra nibs. built quality is also good along with performance.
5,Nice product.... value for money buy it
5,It's perfectly matching my requirements and I am using it happily and it functions excellent.  It's an amazing drawing tablet.

5,Have been using this for over 3 weeks now. No complaints and great product for a very competitive price.

5,Very nice product for taking online classes
5,Nice.
5,I like its lightness..
5,Easy to handle
5,"Love it,"
5,Very good for hand sketchSmooth feel
5,"This tablet is good to work with, If you are thinking about building up your art skills, you are good to go for this tablet."
5,Easy to use
5,"Got it for ‚Çπ3,900. Best Product for Begginners. Value for money."
1,I don't recommend this product.
5,"Best for beginnersPros:-Good pressure sensitivityLight weight penPen glides over tab surface but u won't get a pen on paper feelAndorid support &  no extra software neededPen stand with 8 extra nibsShortcut keysEasy to install driversConsNo Bluetooth supportNote :-For samsung users the cursor won't display in most phones,  in such case u can download huion sketch app which has cursor optionPlz don't go for xp pen deco its not good at allIf u want a much better experience with touch support then go for wacom Intuos pro models but it's price is high"
5,"I have intuos small, xp pen deco pro and an I pad air.  I use graphic tablet generally for animation and photoshop and sometimes on my Android smartphone.Build quality :Huion has overall good build quality it's not upto wacom standard but it's good it's certainly quite thin and stylish.Writting experience : Writting experience was great it wad better than my Wacom intuos small or xp pen. It was neither super smooth nor super rough it was just perfect.Comparison with wacom in similar price segment: At similar price segment Wacom has few products to compete, but still huion drawing impression was quite great overall it was a bit better than intuos. The only thing it's lacking is a universal driver like wacom.Comparison with XP Pen Deco series: Deco series is great not gonna lie but still for the similar price range I found huion to be great it has better surface feel, better drawing experience less wabble, almost no smoothing effect and more frequent driver updates.Short and simple answer :1) If you're a beginner or intermediate and are in learning stage than this is the perfect choice.2) If you're an advanced person using different pens and tablets at different times amd are making money from your work you might go for Wacom.3) If you're willing to buy an XP Pen then I would suggest not to because specially in country like India Huion providing the best drawing experience at minimal cost also Huion has only a few models in this prive range and they're genuinely getting frequent updates, unlike XP Pen that have thousands of models on same peice range and even a bit overpriced but still not giving frequent updates and bug fixes.So if you wanna start out this is the way to go."
4,"Huion tablet has an overall good build quality and is an excellent experience. The tablet is well designed and easy to use. I bought the coral red variant of the HS611 tablet. It's certainly stylish.It's best for beginners. Certainly a worthy purchase for under $100 ""best pen tablets"".Pros:Good pressure sensitivityLightweight and battery-free StylusThe pen glides over tab surfacePen stand with 8 extra nibsShortcut keys can be set according to one's own convenienceDot grid working area is supportiveEasy to install driversMultimedia and press keys are functional and effectiveUSB-C Data Socket is an advantage for Android usersHuion sketch app available for free download on phone to get you started"
5,"Does exactly what you intend to do. The drawing surface is proportionately mapped to the screen, where ever you take the pen it proportionately and aptly travels with it. There is a very very minor lag which is only noticable when you intend to find it, it may be a 100 or 200 millisecond. Which is completely normal and acceptable."
5,"Pros :-Good quality, Light weight, easy to use, nice packagingCons :-Less number or pressing keys than other models, which is not a problem for me but might be of use to someone.The the driver is okayish, not great."
4,I have been using huion pen tablet for past 5 years. i buyed new model because its pen is battery free and tablet is slim and has buttons for some fixed and customizable functions. Pen quality too improved a lot along with its holder.
5,"Easy to use, key binding is a bit edgy: unable to rewrite the bindings with necessary likes of key bonds; otherwise it's amazing..."
5,"Its very easy to setup just install driver, connect and work. It will take a while for you to adjust with the pad surface and pen after that you will love the outcome it is giving. It is definetly a right investment to boost my editing skills. i recommend this product"
5,Excellent
4,ok
5,Everthing good
3,Although i don't have experience in other gadgets so can't compare but it's good for beginners to learn n create
5,Very good product. Best softwares for writing purpose are one note and xornal++. Best suited for teaching and sketching.
4,Perfectly well made product for beginners who loves drawing.
5,Works absolutely fine with no delays and pen quality is also good at this price point
5,Really easy to use. Really really good for its price and the quality is amazing! Works really smoothly as well.
5,"At first I got a unsealed box , but it was easily replaced by AmazonTablet is a fantastic gadget"
5,Works amazing just needs a little bit practice of eye hand co-ordination
4,good for beginners but in my experience the pen nip is not stable
5,I‚Äôm using so many tablets but huion hs611 is very handy and easy to use
5,Value for moneyEasy to usePremium quality
5,Really loving it so far!
5,For beginners it's very easy to use..
4,it is a good product
5,Best buy!
1,Bakbas product
4,I've been using it since 2 monthA very good deal according to feature packed inside this tabletTouch enabled multimedia keys8 shortcut keys with a touch enabled sliderWork area is really very big and good for beginners as well as professional.It comes with plug and play Android support and comes with type c and micro usb adaptors.Also it's TypeC which is really good.I use it for sculpting and drawing gesture figures for my animation and it works pretty good and serves my purpose.I sometimes do digital painting and the shortcut keys comes really handy at that time. i don't need to go back to keyboard to press keys. I have customised the shortcut keys according to my requirements.
5,It's great .Nice and helpful for developing my career in art üñ§It'll be useful if it was wireless üôÇ
5,buiild qualityu is really great and i perosnally loved the touch bar and the shortcut buttons can be easily customisable using the huion software.
1,"This product is definitely not worth 400 rs. The seller is basically looting everyone. Its not clear cover as shown in the pictures,I would happily provide 200 for this, but the seller is selling it too high."
5,"I saw this in my friends house.It looks good, and doesn't mess with the look of the laptop unlike other that would look ugly when placed on keyboard..It's easy use and clean . as in you just place it over the keyboard and it pretty much fits like a glove.and you can work for long hours and it doesn't hurt your fingers..even if water spill on it you can wipe it .."
5,Fit & finish are excellent must buy I personally recommend for MSI GF63.  Keyboard have minute spaces some dust particle can go inside and settle down it can cause any kind of defects to our laptop so applying skin we can protect it.
4,It's too costly.But safety providing level high sir.You will not regret before buying.Very comfortable to use laptop with using this cover .It helps too much to donot go dust inside the product.
5,This is a must buyThere are slight gaps in the keys due to which dust enters inside the keyboard but this cover exactly fits my gf63 thinIt is premium quality and also it is sturdy the cover does not move while typingIn short it is just great !!!
3,Product fits perfectly! But its way too much overpriced.. Definitely not worth ‚Çπ399
2,Doesn't worth 400 rs for this product..though it fits well with slight play within surfaces. Very thin and delicate to use.
5,Fits perfectly üëç
4,Not what I expected but not bad either. Fits MSI keyboards nicely. Priced a little higher than it should be.
1,The quality is not that good as it is listed for 399... I am disappointed with its Quality and its worth...
1,The item cost is too high and the quality is also not that good. Don't go for it.
5,Good product for laptop keyboard it protect form dust and water. But the price is little expensive.
5,Reasonable price. Excellent quality. Super experience while using.
4,Good quality... But very mild... Not so good for typing... For provide dust it's good...
5,Best fit for gf65 thin
4,I have MSI GF63. It fits perfectly on keys. Thinner than other similar products. üëç
5,Nice
4,good
4,Good
5,"Firstly, this review is not for customer, it is meant for manufacture and seller, too. Secondly,I am using a laptop keyboard skin/cover from last 8 years. The first question is why we use a keyboard skin. As a user, we do not want dust go to keyboard. This particular skin cover is too fit to the keyboard (Thinkpad 14 inch). It still leaves outer edge of the keyboard. Henceforth, some dust will go to keyboard automatically. Further, we won‚Äôt get 100 percent protection from dust, water, etc.Therefore, I request to manufacture that please increase to size of keyboard skin/cover, so that, it can completely cover the keyboard."
5,This fits the key board appropriately. My laptop is lenovo ThinkPad L490. The material type is good .Cons: the material doesn't stick to keys properly.It does fall off sometimes because of the red button.
4,Should have an extra .5cm extension on all sides for better protection
1,This is not for 14 inch laptop.
2,The keyboard cover deformed after a couple of weeks and it does not fit the keyboard anymore.
1,"It's gum is soo bad, it came off after some time. I clean my keyboard many times before sticking it, so it is not because of dust or something."
4,I write these words after using one month of this product. It is exactly suitable for Lenovo ThinkPad E14 model. Quality also very good as shown  in the picture.
5,"Good quality and perfect fit for the model Lenovo E470, 480, 490 models.."
2,Doesn't fit the keyboard perfectly... After a few weeks it bulges out in some areas
2,It doesn't stick with keyboard and already torned out
5,Value for money
5,Worth buying
5,Exactly matching Lenovo E14
3,It will cover all the keyboard... But quality is not good ...
2,too much costly and not cover whole keypad...
5,great quality product
5,"Working with Toshiba TV which has Vidaa OS& Windows 10 seamlessly. It has backlight function & does what it says on the box. Brilliant product. Don't go by negative reviews they don't even mention the problem they are facing with the product, probably competitors trying to pull them down. It is a china made product but it works great & it is a superb value for money you spend."
4,"For 550Rs. This has a fully functional mini keyboard and a decent enough trackpad. I would give it 5 stars, but I haven't used it much yet. I want to use it for my PC for remote viewing as the PC is connected to a TV. Unfortunately I got a returned piece and the there were scratches all over the item. This uses a 300mah old nokia type battery. Its rechargable. The dongle is also placed inside the battery section. I made sure the version I got was with back light. it has three lights. Red Green and blue. you can also switch it off to save power. Be warned this is a MINI keyboard not a gamepad!"
5,"I just loved this product. Build quality is good and delivery and packaging is also good. Go for it if you are looking for mini wireless keyboard. It works perfectly with Android, Windows and Android TV"
5,"Its a very useful and attractive remote. I use it with MI Tv works perfectly fine, except prime video where mouse clicks dont work.Some tips:1. use mouse right click button for going back once from screen.2. Fn+enter key restarts the TV3. Fn+swipe right on touch ad slowly to get more shades of colour (7 colors) see the attached video."
3,If you want a spare keyboard for emergency. Go for it. The red green blue led are bright enough. But not for long hours use. The battery that comes in is a BL5c {which use to come in Nokia 3310 phones}. The battery can last for hours if no light is used.
1,"The mouse trackpad has started doing ghost touches. As this is an integrated Keyboard + Mouse, I'm unable to use the Keyboard because the cursor randomly clicks and scrolls anywhere on the screen. The product started Malfunctioning right 3 days after the return period was over. Very clever tactics indeed."
5,"Very nice product  go for it . üëç I liked it very much as it has RGB and rubber keys and have touchpad mouse . And have accurate 10 metres range. Works very well . Impressed with the product üëå nice quality. üòÉ it has a good battery üîã backup.  It's battery after full charging lasts for 2 days . Satisfied with product.  Works fine with tablet, android and its mobiles , laptops and all Android TV.  Good for gaming too. üëç"
5,Beautiful product and sales after service is more best.i got first pic which not working so I complaint on Amazon and return after sometime got call from seller too within 4 days I got new one and it's working very nicely.
5,Great product. & Price. Fully working QWERTY mini keyboard with RGB backlight. Soft rubber keys. Trackpad works awesome like laptop. Best for Android TV Box & USB input devices. Thanks.Only one thing missing is A Microphone inbuilt.That should have been given.
1,It a wost Chinese product with no pre dispatch quality checks and no concern to the dispatch standards as per Amazon's image. Deep regrets how amazon is not allowing this kind of product to be  immediately refunded against replacing.
5,This is not for gaming but for daily use. I connect with my TV setup and it works like charm. Battery backup and rbg light with battery saver mode is perfect combination and compliment eveything.
5,Works ssuper welll. For mobile use a OTG.  Its a value product
2,I am not able to use it in my smart TV and I bought it for that purpose only
2,Mousepad stopped working after use of 4-5 days with nominal use of around 1-2 hrs per day
5,Worth for money... Very good product....working fine...
5,Battery life is awesomeRange is flawlessHandy and works smoothly.Must buy for TV box and Android TV
1,Stopped working within 2 months ... Not able to get it repaired from outside as well ... Please don't buy this product
5,Very nice I am satisfied.. ..
5,"Product is good, usb charging cabel not included"
4,the keyboard is good quality.
1,the trackpad malfunctions.
5,I like the product.
5,Working very nice with my Shinco Smart TV.It's superb.
5,Used in all type of appliances mentioned very easily .like plug and play
5,"Best Product for Android TV all in one solution for keyboard, mouse and Remote üòÄ"
4,Amazing purchase. Just go for it. No problem till now.
4,Little difficult to play games.
5,Very good quality product
1,"Bakwas, 1 week bhi nhi tika"
5,works fine. worth for money
5,useful product
4,Osm Product
5,"THE LIGHTS ARE LIT AMAZING LOOK, AND QUALITY IS FABULOUS. THE WORTHFUL PRODUCT AND SELLER IS VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU"
5,Great productBest performanceAnd back light is amazingWorking very smoothlyAnd  there are many colorsTo change backlight
5,"This product is just amazing... It's design is compact and attractive.. Don't think twice, just buy it.. it's very reliable and worth for money..."
5,"Product is handy, mouse is awesome and above all the back light is superb. Finally a must have product"
5,"The keyboard is efficiently designed to get connected easily just by plugging the USB connector in the system. The USB cord works as an easy input connector, which you can just plugin and use. Moreover, the keyboard is compatible with Windows, Mac, Linux OS, and Android TV."
5,"I have already bought Saco transparent cover for my 3 year old laptop and just loved it for its softness and light weight.Now I wanted another cover for my newer laptop and decided to buy the ""BLACK"" version - BIG MISTAKE! The black cover COMPLETELY blocks the keyboard's backlight. You won't be able to see the which key is which, you just have light emitting from the key borders. Hence the laptop's backlight feature is rendered useless by the black version.Oh and you CAN'T return this item, Amazon only allows replacement, they will send exactly the same model as a replacement. So make sure you buy the TRANSPARENT version for your backlit keyboard."
4,"It looks good, and doesn't mess with the look of the laptop unlike older skins that would look ugly when applied. It's easy to install, as in you just place it over the keyboard and it pretty much fits like a glove.That makes it great for dust protection, but I'm not sure it will be spill proof, especially if the spill happens around the edges, because it's not sealed completely at the edges. When you type or when you look at it from the side, there are tiny gapsbthat appear to be present which is enough for a liquid to get through. It's like an umbrella. Your head remains dry because it's directly under it, but your shoulders/back are gonna get slightly wet.I basically need it for dust protection, so I'm all good, but whoever is buying for spill protection need to keep this in mind."
5,Perfectly fit to my hp laptop 15.6 inch
5,"I could've put up photos but that wouldn't help one bit.Let me instead describe how amazing of a product this is, at least it's first impressions.IT IS THINIT IS CRAZY THINI was truly amazed at how thin and flexible it was!It fits my hp pavilion 16 keyboard perfectly. The shallow key cut-outs fit the keycaps absolutely perfectly! Although originally designed for the hp pavilion 15, both laptops have the same keyboard.When you first open it, it feels slightly tacky on the underside, giving it a phenomenal grip on your keys. It just stays there unless you try to pick at it and pry it away. It comes off effortlessly when you want it to give it a quick wash.When you type with this cover in place, it's a really nice soft touch feel while typing, honestly I love the silicone feel while typing as compared to the stock plastic keyboard feel.Well done Saco! Hands down the best 370 rupees I've ever spent on a computer accessory."
4,"Great for protection from tiny things and dust entering into the keyboard.I use it with pavillion gaming and it makes my keyboard look visually appealing and better. As the original keyboard is black with violet backlight lettering.It isn't quite appealing and eye friendly while the backlight is off.But you cannot use this keyboard in pitch dark as after turning the backlight on especially the violet on pavillion gaming, this turns visibility into zero. You just can't read any letteing."
5,"Check the images shown in Amazon precisely and choose which type of skin do you need. The main difference is the corner shape of keys. Check on your laptop whether the key is sharp cornered or curved and select what you need.I wonder how Saco made this fantastic product fits this much perfectly. That skin gives the incredible aesthetic look to my laptop.PROS1. Keenly detailed key corners.2. Very fast delivery.3. Good material Quality.4. Perfect lettering5. Allignment with the keys are just mindblowing.CONS1. Adhesion property is average,  mainly near space bar,  but it is ok.2. We have to look sharply to find whether the caps lock light is on or not.I recommend all to buy this one for protecting your laptop with awesome looks. Because its worth for the money we are giving."
5,My laptop model HP 15- bs662TU wasn't listed in the description but looking at the pictures i thot it will fit and it did perfectly. Quality too is good.Only problem was the on/off light indicator for Caps lock and F6 Mute key was not visible at all in case of black cover. Otherwise its awesome.
4,"I replaced my 10 yr old regular silicon keyboard cover with this.  Also, I liked the the high degree of care the company has put in to make the product. the cover is as thin as possible making it not to touch the screen when the lid is closed. The keys printed on the cover is slippery enough to match the texture of the original keys on the keyboard that the difference can only be felt by a high speed typing person."
5,"Fits perfectly in my 16"" laptop but price could have been on the lower side a bit. Thickness is good, key press feels soft and easy, quality is good. Adhesion is good as long as you dont pluck it out."
4,"Product is awesome, i bought this one earlier in the year of 2017. So i bought it for my friend too, but the quality a bit differs than mine. My earlier quality of product is much better than this new one but yes product is awesome and fit it accurately.Thanks for this product, i will suggest others too but make sure the quality keep in that way.. :)"
5,The product quality is very good. If you see the picture you one can't make the difference. It's a perfect fit for my HP 15inch laptop. Only drawback is it doesn't have a self adhesive so have to just place it on the keyboard. Self adhesive would have been a added advantage.
5,Pros:1. Thin film but sturdy2. Adhesion is good. It will not fall off even if you tilt your laptop.3. Fit is almost perfect.Cons:1. High price2. Capslock and mute key alignment is not perfect but it will not affect your typing performance.
5,Adhesion is great with static hold. Looks and feels durable. Nice raised edges lets you type very fast without slip and double key press errors. Only gripe being the caps lock LED window does not line up accurately. Otherwise fantastic product. Full value for money.
5,Perfect fit for my HP 15s-eq0144AU...Material is sleek and it's a snug fit.On a grey color keyboard black protector gives more visibility of keys....overall happy with the products.
4,"The keyboard cover is expensive, but is a perfect fit for the HP 15.6"" laptop with a separate number keyboard. Will recommend if price is not an issue. I think it actually costs 50/- to make."
5,"Key fitting and quality is very good. I never feel that i am using cover on my keyboard, it is very smooth and exactly replica of keyboard. Very good product. I used this product from last 4 years. Then again i purchased this product for my second laptop."
5,Perfect fit for my Laptop.( HP 15-DA1058TU)  .You will not even feel that there is a cover  on your keyboard. Quality seems to be good too.I feel the  Price is little higher  since for this price you can get a key board itself .
5,"HP probably uses the same keyboard mold for their 15 inch laptops, so if your laptop has a full size keyboard and squared keycaps it will most likely fit it"
5,It does give protection to my keyboard as I was worried that too much dust was entering through it. Fits perfectly fine on my HP Laptop. Typing through this is also working fine. Overall no complaints regarding the purchase.
4,I ordered it for my HP Spectre 15.6 inches and it fits perfectly well. Does not let dust particles penetrate through and gives a smooth typing experience. The only drawback is the keys are not visible at night when you use a back-lit keyboard.
4,I received the product before the estimated date I‚Äôm happy for thatProduct perfectly suitable for 15.6 inc laptop keyboards the product quality above average and  cost is little high. This product will not allow keyboard backlight to project outside you can‚Äôt identify which key is that.? Better buy transparent
5,"It is a great purchase, adhesion is a little weak but fits perfect and looks awesome. ""Tell you what it is better than a plain and ugly silicone covers you get. And I had to get this causes it's a very durable product"" and it even won't fall off the keyboard."
5,I bought it for my HP Laptop 15s-gr0010AU.It fits on the keypad like a skin .Had made my operations much easier and safe.It is a value product.Would definitely recommend it.
5,"It's perfect for my HP Notebook 15S DU0121TU Laptop, it looks like a new skin to my keyboard and matches perfectly with the dark screen ‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,"Wonderful product, exactly fits for HP Laptop - 15s-gr0007au. Thank you to seller SACO, also thank you AMAZON."
1,Is not suitable for HP ProBook G6 15.6 inch. The pad is bigger and the letters are not correct. There is no option for refund only exchange is available!
2,I am facing the problem of mismatch as shown in the picture. Is it problem with this unit i received or with all units of this type? Please see it carefully the white print on this skin mismatches with my hp da1074tx keyboard keys (red and white color light of both keys).  seller is not replying to this now.
5,Product fits exactly and its a must buy for HP 15 Bs145tu owners. And thanks to amazon for making this kinds of unique items availabe at reasonable cost and swift delivery.
5,"A perfect fit. When placed, it doesn't look like a cover but it appears like the actual keys are black. (My laptop keys are silver). Gives a great look and also protects from dust filling in. Worth the purchase. üëç"
5,The print of the letters and symbols is really good. The cover hugs the keys really well. Perfect fit. The lights will not be visible under the black cover.(HP 15bs637tu)
4,If You will compromise with your backlit keyboard then go for it .. the light didn't pass through the words .. order wise good cover for day use not for night.. light is only visible at the sides
5,"This product is best of best as compared to other products of keyboard protection and with its price . The product is light weight , soft , grippy , and have a bold look ."
5,"Its a good product which suites well to my laptop.Nice colour and letters.Also fit perfectly to the key slots ..No wrinkles or folds..The delivery was early than expected..5 star for all that..""But the only thing that upset me is the capslock and mute led's"" .Its not visible clearly .."
4,keyboard cover is of good quality. it suits my hp 15s du.. laptop.. it gives a stylish look to laptop and protects the keyboard..  genuine products like this  need to be admired..
4,Best product for Hp laptops keyboard which is having not properly visible letters on it. I'm happy with this product. Thank you Amazon for ur services üòä
5,A very perfectly designed product. The designers have done a marvellous job. The dimensions and letters are perfectly crafted and the keyboard cover fits like a glove on the keyboard. I make it a policy to appreciate a well crafted product when I come across one. Thanks Saco for a well engineered product.
4,"I brought it for HP 15Q BU107TX laptop and it fits neatly.  Having 0.1mm depth, covering all the keys and the black imprint keys are visible and i think it will work for some years . Gentle clean/wash will b good enough. Overall I can recommend it on this budget!"
3,Dont expect great things ... it fits but still gets bit uncomfortable for my HP pavilion laptop
5,This product fits well into my hp laptop &  since then it has been serving the purpose of using it . It's till this time very useful but very difficult to mention anything about it's durability without using it 1year minimum ....
1,I have ordered black coloured sheet having qwerty keypad as per image shown while selling.I have received transparent white sheet without qwerty key printed.Wrong product delivered by seller.
5,"This product is excellent . Only problem is that when caps is turned ON , that indicator is hard to see as this product is good thick .  Will be a great but for below Rs.300"
5,Very good product. It is a perfect fit for my keyboard and looks very neat. The material is also good as compared to the normal skin.
4,The product is just superb but the only problem is that it does not allow the backlit light to passwhich means in night you cannot comfortabally see the buttons.
5,Perfect fit. Key were not visible as the keys were silver in my Asus laptop. Value for money product.
4,It Is perfectly fit for my Asus vivoboojk x512daPros:Premium lookProduct our keypad from dust and waterCons:No typing comfortMy chicklet keybord light is not visible in night works
5,Needs caps lock to be clearly visible to enter right passwords
5,Exact fit to my laptop
5,Perfect for ASUS
3,"The product is good and perfect fit, but the skin is contacting with display while it is in closeI think is there any issue of lining appears on display in future"
5,"Saco is very good, you can take it, you can use it with transplant as well as this useful which is very much."
1,Very loose fit dont like it
5,Perfect fit For asus vivobook 15...  Good quality
5,Really good perfect fit.
2,Good but does not let the laptop to close completely.
5,Perfect fit for asus vivobook 15 x512fa looking very premium
5,Not visible backlight of key.
5,Vera level üí•üî•
5,Nice quality and fits perfectly
1,Size is very Short .Not fit in Keyboard. Top switch size And Caps lock bottom size is short than keyboard.
4,Got it replaced now works okDetailed review of the product:1) it has wireless connectivity2) Delivery was fast (Credit goes to amazon)3)product packaging is absolutely pathetic. Product is cheap looking has very basic feedback when you press the key.4)Battery didn't last longer days so very costly. I might need 20+ Batteries for a year (cost of the batteries will be more than this numpad)5) Warranty  didn't make any sense.My suggestion stay away if you can get some other and better product.**My logitech mouse runs AA battery for more than a year with normal to high use.I used this num pad once a day to enter the password and it is out of battery within very few days.800 wasted.
1,Some of the keys like 4 and 7 stopped working after a few times of use.  Don't buy it. Its very delicate and not good for regular use.  Complete disappointment.
5,"I am loving this numeric pad, They are incredibly silent and ensures taht you wont disturb anyone like your partners and your parents while you are using it. It is also very well made and is very responsive and packs ample length of wire for easy reachability. I recommend this to everyone who is looking for num pad for laptop or a stand alone numpad for your desktop."
2,"No.1 key was not working. Requested for support and received replacement in a timely manner. 22-Aug-2019 : I have received replacement, however #9 key is not working now.. Let's see what happens further..."
5,"It works really well with my laptop, i had difficulty typing the numbers hence brought this since i was used to the normal keypad! just make sure u have small battery for emeegency just in case if the battery is low"
5,"Serves the purpose, only problem is the storage of the USB adapter. No space or slot provided for storing the dongle, tend to get lost is not stored properly."
4,Overall is good but no button for on/off otherwise good
4,Product is good also seller response for any query is good. So trust is build up with seller as well as Amazon
5,Smooth keys.... Perfect for small screen laptops.... Easy to carry
5,I love the product. Makes it easier for me to enter numbers on my Macbook Pro 13‚ÄùGood enough built. Solves the problem and worth the money.Really happy
4,"Lacks on and off switch, consumes battery rapidly. Medium quality."
5,Very useful for those working with Numbers.  Worth buying
2,"The product is good but the battery drains out in just a week, from 30th Dec till date I have changed 6 batteries which is not at all acceptable. I am disappointed with this reason only rest the product is good."
5,Numeric keyboard is easy to use n it is easily connect... It's utility is more in tally work... Increase speed while working
1,Very low quality product I would suggest clients not to buy this product.Received first piece and it broke after 2 days then received a replacement for it and it stopped working after 30 days
1,Numerical keys are not working and no clear idea whom to contact for get it rectified. Better don't purchase uncertain products.
5,Very easy to use and efficient. Very helpful in calculation. Value for money. Best product within this range.
5,Meets the purpose of having a clutter free desk and is a very much responsive keypad with good durability. So far it has been working fine with no complaints.
5,Easy to operate and buttons are also free to use. One can go for it. It's kind of cute product
5,Very gud product I am fully satisfied with this product thank you Amazon and seller
5,Good Product... Value for money...
5,Works like a an absolute gem with Macbook and iPad.Connects in few seconds
5,saves me time now.
1,"Plastic quality is very poor, sensation action is slow"
1,Do not buy the keys are not working
5,"It was nice to use while only figures typed as 14"" lappy do not have number key pad this is very help ful for me.."
1,Key stopped working in 20 days.
5,Build quality good very easy to use
5,Awesome
5,Worked well
5,Easy to use. Smoothly work. 3 months using. Good work
4,Good for financial purpose
1,Was broken when it arrived
5,Nice product
1,Low Quality China Item
4,ok
1,Product is not gud atall very waste
5,like
1,Defective...
1,Highly overpriced.No branding. Not sure if warranty will be entertained.Build quility worse than my calculator.Does the work tho.
2,You get Dell KB 216 keyboard only and this is a good to use keyboard. The reason of rating it low is the reason that by naming it KB 216P it was made to look like a different keyboard with image made to look a bit different. But the parcel that came had KB216 only. This is fooling!
5,Good for programming purpose. Soft keys enspire me. Easier to see alphabets. Easy to type fast complex proramming. Easier to press with a little depth of keys.
2,"Surprised as I found several flaws in this product. No led indicator in keyboard ie. Caps lock, Numlock etc. Since it is wireless, need to have On/Off switch to conserve battery.. missing in both keyboard and mouse.Edit on 04-Aug-2020 :Space Key gets stuck in keyboard and space character gets repeated.. unable to use at all."
1,"Low quality build for keyboard and mouse. Indicators are not working for Num, CAPS lock.Design of Keys are not good!Not worthy to buy !"
1,"Utter waste of money.  Both the key board and mouse started malfunctioning after just three weeks of use. Bought this thinking that HP is a reputed brand, and can be trusted.  Now I understand that HP is a brand that cannot be trusted any more. and I see that many of my friends are of same opinion. What they say is that, now a days HP has became an untrustworthy brand."
5,"This is a very good basic keyboard, keys are sturdy and very comfortable to write for long duration. The overall size of the keyboard is compact and ideal for smaller workstations. The wi-fi receiver is plug & play and very responsive. Mouse is bit flimsy but works very well. At its price point it is value for money. The only drawback is lack of Back-lit Keys but I can live without it as I use it only when I am working with my laptop at my workstation."
1,My mouse started malfunctioning after using a month. The right-click button triggers wheel functionality and the left click triggers right-click functionality. It feels impossible to contact the service center and after continuously trying for an hour the customer care suggested me to go to a service center as online support for accessories is not provided. I REGRET BUYING THIS PRODUCT
5,Keyboard and mouse works perfectly fine. Finger impression on the keys makes typing comfortable. CAPS key indicator not required since laptop has CAPS LOCK light indication. Mouse is super smooth and efficient.
4,"Very Comfortable, Mouse was Smooth Handling, No Sounds In keyboard Press. nice product, ""But delivery Boy was Asked Me for extra Money For Shipping the Product Its Rude Act. He's Like:-Delivery Boy: Mister give extra Amount for Shipping this Product.Me: why Sir I Seen Already The Amount, its Shown me all  including Delivery Charges, taxes, GST+ & more , why even you asking me extra Money.Delivery Boy: No No Sir Give Some Extra Money, its showing me more in our website.Me: No I am not  giving you more money, i readied  all terms & conditions why should i give more money.delivery Boy: Its Ok Then, Give me How Much You Think, like Rs.30 Or Rs.50.Me: they are not paying You salary Or what, why are you wasting my time.Delivery Boy: its Ok then Its your Choice Mister.(Conversation END )Its Such a weird Act. Please Guys Give Such Attentions to This Conditions."
1,Worst keyboard money can buy. They even sent me a used one.Lot of good keyboards available this is not one of them
1,Low rating for ridiculous services from HP.1st they send defective mouse.In replacement they sent broker key board with no battery cover backside.Wasted lot of time & looks like selling used product.
1,The keyboard looks and feel cheap (almost like a duplicate). The plastic finish is not smooth at all. Anyways started using it but to my horror the functionality was even worse. Few keys won't respond on single hit and few registers twice or thrice on single hit. Such a huge disappointment. Finally decided to change the keyboard but to my shock there is only a replacement option. I will have to find out if the replacement is better if not this item could get stuck in replacement request loop forever.
5,"Keys are smooth, Low sound clicks. Mouse clicks are irritating usually but this one had it's own mechanism not to play any sound with mouse clicks. you'll love it when you use it.The best option i loved it auto power of, to save battery, you need to press a key to wake it up as simple as that...Awesome benefit with battery indicator just above the number key padImprovement, It's better to Numlock, Caps lock & Scroll lock indicators on Keyboard"
4,I‚Äôm writing this review after 3 weeks of usage. My work involves an extensive usage of mouse and few keyboard taps. So after 3 weeks of usage I find the mouse scroll has a squeaky noise when in scroll up or down. This kind of noise is usually expected may be after 6-7 months of heavy usage.Pros:1. Comfortable grip on holding the mouse and keyboard taps.2. No lagCons:1. Mouse scroll is squeaking2. Not value for the money3. Not a good build quality
5,With work from home in full effect I needed dual screens and it was necessary to use the laptop as a screen. With this combo I was able to do that and have the freedom to use the keyboard and mouse free from the laptop. The keyboard is smooth and responsive and the mouse is small but powerful and responsive. The best part is that the mouse shuts off if not used for a certain period of time.
1,"I purchased this some 6 weeks back. It suddenly stopped working. My laptop ( even tried with other laptops) is not detected it now. For last 1 week , it was disconnecting  frequently now it completely stopped.Now sure how to fix issue ."
5,I read few negative comments regarding the product. I find it to be awesome till now. If there be any negative finding i will update my review. till date it works fine without any flaw. For notification of CAPS LOCK and NUM Lock i use a software called 'TrayStatus' it works for me
5,Gud product
5,Pros:Sturdy KB and mouseNo click sound for mouseAuto off feature works well (for conserving energy); Just scroll the mouse button to reactivateCons:No inidcators for Capslock/Numlock
1,"Quality not good, no value for moneyBoth mouse and keyboard do not have On/Off switches which makes it difficult. Keypad sensitivity is not great. Mouse scroll wheel got busted within two months. Overall not a quality product"
4,Both keyboard and mouse have a soft feel when using. The mouse buttons are exceptionally buttery and feels good to use.Grooves in keyboard reduce typos but it could have used a palm rest
4,Good combo with affordable pricing. One observation was sometimes the click is not responding for our actions
4,Keyboard seems to be slow in communicating with the laptop. Battery in keyboard drains very fast  but mouse doesn't drain the battery fast.
5,Good keyboard and mouse with automatic power on and off
2,Absolutely worthless product to buy.Although delivered within 24hrs of ordering. The product had innumerous glitches and software problems right from the time it was attached with the laptop. The cursor started malfunctioning and draining the batteries within blink of an eye.DO NOT GO WITH THIS PRODUCT.
1,"Within 3 months my mouse's scroller stopped working.Customer service response was as cheap as it can be.Service centres denied accepting product through courier, where I am ready to bear courier expense too.I don't recommend this product to anyone especially online."
4,Keyboard and mouse is good quality and responsive. You will feel while pressing the keys of the keyboard. The only demerit I noticed is lack of indicators for Caps Lock and other locks.
5,Very nice product at this price Must buy for gaming and work form home purpose
5,Just got the product delivered today. It really feels great in typing and also has a premium look the mouse is also great. Responses really fast and the chords are also quite long. But now i got disappointed by seeing the price today it dropped by almost Rs. 70..
5,I purchased to handle my smart TV and it is perfect for same. I am happy with item price and perfectness.
5,Wonderful product cheaper than what you get in park lane Hyderabad and many places here . Go for it.
1,What I did not like about the purchase is the package condition. The seal was open and the box was in a torn condition. I am giving 1 star for this purchase only because of the seller's attitude not because of the poor quality of the product.
4,Good sturdy and perfect with MAC as well.Only fault is that there r  NO LED indicators to know if caps or scroll is ON.
2,Very poor range for the setup.. the transmitter dongle has to be set in front of desktop to have seamless connectivity
1,"Would not recommend to go for this combo as keyboard died after 1month, although tried replacing battery.It gives weird error, like if you press 's' or 'a' , it types 'as' and it is happening for multiple combinations.Waste of money product"
1,"Packaging was worst, seal was open and again pasted keyboard was perfectly fine but mouse one side is not working I think the mouse was accidentally damaged due to worst packaging"
1,Stopped working after one month.. consumes lots of battery
5,Bought it with a lot of overthinking. When got the keyboard and mouse in it was working beautifully. Solved problem of my 2007 purchased hp laptop broken keyboard keys.
3,We bought this but the mouse is faulty and so we asked for a replacement - still waiting for it.
1,"this product is faulty and not usable at all , since i think i crossed the time limit of changing it  i have to look for some thing newworst product i have ever got from amazon .of they change it , it will be great help."
5,Fantastic keyboard...seamless and smooth.. anybody looking to buy. Keyboard should go for this one.
1,Poor build quantity. Too much lag. Intermittent operation.
1,"*** One and half year review ***Multiple key failure. Keyboard totally useless. Ordering an new keyboard to replace this one.Product NOT recommend for long term usage due to quality issues.*** One year review ***Now after 1 year and 3 months of usage across two keyboards (including replacement), I am facing contact errors with the keys. Last month Numpad-5 key started showing contact error. Now numeric-1 key is showing serious coontact errors. I have to bang the key very hard to register a hit.Reducing my previous rating of 2 to . (yes, the one key didn't register).*** Six month review ***I highlightedt faulty back-lights in my six month usage review last year. I raised the matter with the seller and my faulty keyboard was promptly replaced."
5,Much better than expected... Wow. Everything working perfectly for now .... Will update my review after a month. One thing i need to mention to all future buyers is that ... It need usb 3.0 to work... It will not work in 2.0 ... My own experience. Anyway the product is really good for the price right now... I recommend to go for it . And also ... Nice packaging + delevery before expected date...thanks amazon..‚ò∫Ô∏èüòä
3,"build quality is awesomemetal bodyclicky keyboard sound,,,//// not for silent gamerbike light effectdont waste ur time..... just buy itprice worth it....worst customer experience ever"
5,"Got the brown switch version at 3k.It's a steal.Pros- price- Good RGB (I usually keep it turned off)- the design is very classy. No kiddish extra cheap branding and all.- its still makes some noise, and I feel the fun of typing.- cable is braided (quality stuff)Cons- the keys might be too soft for some people.- selected keys like backspace, shifts, etc make a little different noise. Might be on purpose, or might be loose.- Love the handrest.Mann ki Baat- I am writing this review coz am loving typing on this.- Don't through away the manual as the backlight key combinations are written there, and it's hard to find it online.- excise duty proper hoti to foreign se yahi price pe bluetooth wala mangwata. (fadu looks k saath)"
1,"The keycaps broke and i can't use this cheap keyboard anymore, waste of money! WORST QUALITY"
5,"A bit heavy keyboard, because of the aluminium body. 13 backlight patterns. Awesome to use while gaming. Wrist resting plate provides comfort. Compared to Redgear and other same range keyboards its stands out a bit with some extra features. If anyone looking for the 1st gaming mechanical keyboard, close your eyes and go with this product. Given it 5star as i was looking to cut a star but it haven't given a single chance to do that... Thumbs up from me."
4,"In the beginning I was unsure if this was a good purchase, but after typing on in for a long period of time and gaming I realized my wrists or my hands weren't paining as they usually do. It takes time to get adjusted to the caps and shift buttons though (Important for Moba gamers and csgo players) but overall this Keyboard fairs well with good feedback little heavy but if you've been using a membrane keyboard you'll probably just ignore it and its easy to clean the keys them selves don't catch any dust or sticky dirt but the aluminum plate will. A small soft brush should do the trick to keep it clean. Just a reminder go on their official website and sign up for an extended warranty of another year giving you 2 yrs of a warranty period. Have a nice day :)"
5,Great Mechanical Keyboard for budget.And the JIXIAN Blue switches are just awesome.
3,Good budget mechanical gaming keyboard. The switches are a chinese version of the cheery mx brown keys. Not too bad to be honest. Good tactile response and silent as compared to blue switches. Absolutely ideal for day to day usage and occasional gaming.Overall satisfied with the purchase. My only gripe is the red colored wrist rest/hand rest. It doesn't look bad but a black colored one would've been better.Will update review after long term usage.
2,"I bought this keyboard in July 2019. It has 1-year warranty provided by the manufacturer. The keyboard itself is very good, the lights are bright and feels good to type on.  But keys stopped working after 1 year.I suggest getting a non Mechanical keyboard from a good brand like corsair. Or get the cheapest but proper mechanical keyboard from Gigabyte that costs around the same money as this one, it won't have RGB or any backlight but they are good reliable keyboards that come with 3 years of warranty."
1,"i will never buy cosmic byte products , their terms and conditions are not user friendly. their returns policy is most worst, product  quality is weak.Pros :-Keys are very , have good feedback.lot of RGB options.COns:-big in sizekeys makes lot of noisekeyboard build is not sturdy and very fragile to use.the metal cover where are keys are placed is thin sheet of aluminum very cheap and easier to get dents. (as per policy you cannot get replacement for genuine problem if its dented)if you see pics uploaded RDB stopped working for few keys after infrequent use of just 6 months.there was no keyboard replacement as stock was not available. below are some  terms and condition you need to read before purchasing.Kindly note -  The product needs to be properly packed ensuring the product is intact and shouldn't get damaged during transit.Cosmic byte will not be liable in case of any damage caused to the product in transit.Upon receiving the product, if the service team does not find any issue with the product, the return courier charges will have to be borne by the customer.Warranty will be void if the product is any physically damaged, caused by neglect, misuse, abuse, and unauthorized modifications that are done on the product."
5,"I bought this keyboard about 7 months ago. It was a great keyboard until the point when my main key for gaming, ""W"" key suddenly stopped working. I really love this keyboard. They replaced my unit with a new one as it was within the warranty period. If you want a blue switch mechanical gaming keyboard at an affordable price, this is the go-to choice!"
4,"All I can say is this feels very good in terms of Price, Quality & Experience. Good work to Cosmic Bytes.generally outemu, kailh are good products. Kailh is a bit superior & close to Cherry MX. Beside being cheap they deliver good experience. I've used a few for years.Their blue switches are very clicky.But this brown swtich pretty quiet. I think this is linear with no tactile feedback. And it's really amazing, my typing speed have improved by atleast 5 wpm within a day.Large keys like space bar, backspace, shift & enter make some spring noise, which is quite normal, but considering the silence of other keys, they are a bit disturbing.Other than that this keyboard won't disappoint any mech switch lovers."
4,"Does have some issues but overall for this price it's pretty good.Only cons:Keys stroke sound is inconsistent with some keys and the feel is even more inconsistent. Pressing the key like ""w"" for prolongated period of time broke the key, now the mechanical click isn't clicky enough as the other keys.But overall. I love it."
5,"Pros:1. Value for Money.2. Keys feels very sturdy.3. Brown switches makes less sound than the blue ones.4. Multiple lighting mode, specially the gaming mode lighting is best while you play games. Also, there is a Gaming mode where you can modify the lights in the switches for specific games when needed.5. Build quality is more than satisfying in regards with the price point.6. There are three levels of brightness.7. Wrist rest in a good add-on.Cons:1. Wrist rest is not much comfortable, but again, the price matters and its good for me."
5,I Purchased Cosmic Byte CB Gk11(Outemu Brown) in the deal.My First Impression...... My Opinions* The Packaging was great no tear/damage.* Manufactured and Imported in Dec20.* It came with a wrist pad & a Key remover tool.* It felt quiet sturdy and durable.* It also looked semi premium as compared to others brands in the market.* Cable Quality was also good in the price range.* RGB effects are amazing never seen this type of RGB effects.**The Feedback was Above Average. But in this price it's great.***The Price of this Keyboard was shockingly amazing.......2.2k.These are my first 3 days impressions.If you want a great RGB Gaming mechanical keyboard with a wrist pad under 2.5k. I blindly suggesting you to buy this one.But Before Buying this Please Check the Switches that you want. I prefer Brown switches because these are silent/linear as compared to blue switches.
3,"INITIAL REACTION: This is the best product you can get in this price bracket, very good but little bit noisy switched but it is responsive and very very easy to use and hand rest will not hamper long usage as it sturdy and well built.Edit: it's been 16 month since I'm using this keyboard and it required RMA in 8th month due to ghosting keys and now again started to stop working on few keys for sometimes and work smoothly later so I think it's life span is nearing to the end and it served me well but this is why people spend more money on pricey Keyboard because they last long.My initial reaction was amazing but I went through difficult RMA process which wasn't easy as I had to courier it to Bangalore to get it replaced and it was not delievery at home but I had to visit courier office to collect it. If you do want to spend too much then go for it but it won't last long as you expect."
3,"There is a thing with the keys.... eg: key 1 has 2 symbols... '1' and '!'. So the lights are placed in such a way that only '!' symbol get illuminated properly... and '1' symbol gets less illumination... and its problem all keys that have 2 symbols... the top symbol illuminates correctly... but the bottom one hardly gets any light...(shown in image)nitpick: the wrist rest is difficult to attach as no instructions are given and I had to search a video on how to do that...Keyboard looks good with good brightness at max level(esp. Red key... its bright enough to like the color) the click are there...Also, the space key and enter key has different feel and sound to it while typing...(not sure if intended or bad design)... but this is my first Mechanical keyboard and excited to use it :DAlso, giving it 3 stars coz it arrived late(didn't dispatched for a whole week and dispatched at the date it was supposed to arrive)...Also, DON'T THROW AWAY THE MANUAL... The key combinations are given on that and there is no software for color coding keys...And the in-built pre game modes are sh*t... but some combinations are good and tou can color code your keyboard however you like"
1,"Bought this keyboard in January 2019 and it worked flawlessly for about 15 months. Then problems began with keys not working and even after a thorough but gentle cleaning with compressed air after removing all the keys, several keys are not working. In addition, the illumination for some keys has failed.At this time, the 'w' key isn't working at all and several other keys have a mind of their own, they come and go as they please. I'm having to paste the letter 'w' from the clipboard each time!Dust is the likely reason for the keys failing and I do keep the keyboard covered most of the time when not in use. It perhaps extended the life a little.At this rather high price point, it simply isn't recommended."
2,"The build quality is just okay. I don't know why I feel like the reviews are exaggerated. On an other note if you come from a cooler master keyboard, you'll find this keyboard pretty cheaply built. The keys are okay but too loud. I'd suggest the brown one. The keycaps look really really cheap with the matt black finish."
1,"1 month after purchase, my spacebar and ""T"" stopped working, tried every solution didnt work. 2 month later, almost all keys don't respond 10% of the time, especially during gaming when it most count. I mean, it shouldwork fine atleast 6 months after the purchase given the 4.5K price, no? Rather go for Ant PC MK3400 cheaper & better... -_-"
3,"You are on budget and want a mechanical keyboard, Yes go for it. But if you are not on budget but still want a mechanical keyboard, please please please go and buy an expensive one.Pros:The built is good. it doesn't move or tilt while typing.The RGB effect is great and is pretty bright even in sunlight.Has dedicated multi-media keysNice packing and looks premium.Cons:-Only looks premium but one hand on the laptop and you will understand.-The keys are wobbly as ****. I bought mechanical keyboard for fun of tactile pressing. Instead I am more of wobbly keys than the tactile sound.-If you want to feel that awesome mechanical keyboard sound, don't go for brown switches. Go for blue one.  I know whole world is saying that brown are silent and yes they are. Very silent. its only the sound of keycaps hitting the base of the keyboard what you will hear . hence, you want that chirpy sound buy blue switches.-Backspace and space bar sound are so so bad it seems I am using a normal keyboard.Overall I am bit sad as I had budget but i went on reviews. I believe most of the people didn't buy a mechanical keyboard or are just over joyous on spending Rs. 2,000 and getting a keyboard with all Diwali light options.Go for a better and expensive one if you can. Else, go for this one as it won't disappoint you much. It has keys and they press and when they press they type :)"
1,I liked the keyboard. It's everything the reviews say it is. But I have a problem with this culture of sending a mildly defective product and hoping the customer won't notice. This is becoming quite prevalent with Amazon. So only 1 star.. the space-bar led doesn't work!
4,This is an affordable full RGB keyboard. I opted for a blue switch variant.  Build quality is good. The keyboard looks better in reality than shown in the images. There is LED logo on side also which looks cool. Jixian  keys on this are heavier than my redgear invader keyboard which comes with Kailh blue switches. If you are buying mainly for typing I would suggest you better go for redgear invader.
1,this keyboard worked well for 3-4 months and then the space bar stopped working i have to press it 5 times to work oncei never mentioned that i bought this keyboard 3 times 1 of them is working till now the others don'ti've wasted 6k on this keyboard when i could've bought something that has quality and durability DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
5,"mild metallic clingy noise on hard key press mostly space barBut otherwise a really really nice blue switch keyboard for the price. Nice build, nice effects and custom options, no software to control but has media switches.worth the price I would say10/10 hope it lasts at least 2 years now"
1,"Very cheap quality keycaps and gets broken with normal use, worst sturdiness. Its only for the very delicate use. A big NO for gaming. Also one of the led (alt key) stopped working."
5,"Very very sturdy built and heavy too and cable is braidedEach key is 7 colour customisable, but no software provided, you have to record each key in colours you want and then save it.But the keycaps are very bad in design as the bottom portion letter doesn't lights up(see the above photo to understand), so there's that you have to keep in mind.And for information it don't have outemu switches but xixian switches, they're of lower quality than outemu ones, but I don't felt the difference personally speaking."
4,"I got my product delivered today Cosmic Byte CB-GK-11 Black Eye (Brown Switches). Packaging by amazon was great, no  damages on the box. First impressions, it feels cheap tbh and also there is a lot of wobble and cheap plastic springy sound while pressing the bigger keys. Mine comes with brown switches, if you are switching from a membrane keyboard to this the typing experience is really different. There are lot of RBG effect modes and also lights are vibrant. Don't expect any high feedback from the key presses as these are Chinese brown switches, but what u are getting for the price is pretty decent. I'll be updating my review according to my experience with this keyboard."
3,If you are a gamer you will know the pain when the W key starts giving you problems. I was using it for both gaming and for my office work. The W key started having issues within 6 months. Now when I say what it becomes hat. It is no doubt the cheapest mechanical keyboard but the keys that I use often have slowly started becoming unresponsive. Go for it if you are using as a temporary one till you get a good mechanical keyboard.
1,"Defective product is delivered. Unfortunately I was went on out of station becuase of personal reason. After a week when I came back & unboxed the key board with excitement.Same way I have disappointed becuase the product has manufacturing defect. The space bar switch lights are not switching on.I have paid huge amount of 3769 rupees. By believed that the cosmicbyte is the best brand. Unfortunately my belief was wrong. The cosmicbyte product are not the good quality products.Also trying contacting customer support. They just playing email game. Not calling, when I am calling not picking the call."
1,back light stoping to work one by one after 4 months 10 keys stops working.Update after 7 months. 40% lights stoped working. And some keys dont respond always.Update after year 70% lights stopped working
5,"This is my very first mechanical keyboard. I have bought the blue switch version of this keyboard and the experience is just superb. The feel, click sounds take it to next level. The lighting is per key RGB, which I don't think that there is any keyboard that offers this feature at this price point. There are static RGB effect and some preset patterns and also the lights can be turned off. Although there is no software to change the lighting effect, it can be changed in the keyboard itself. I live closer to coastal region, so the USB ports in my PC tend to rust due to this weather; The gold plated USB connector comes very handy. I will update on the durability of the keyboard after some months of usage. Overall a nice and satisfactory purchase. I regret that I did not purchase this keyboard earlier."
5,"Best Gaming mechanical keyboard you can buy, if you want more noise of key caps then go for blue switches, if you want for gaming i suggest go for brown they are bit more responsive than blue and moderate noise then go for brown switches, just for your info red and black switches are best for gaming but they are bit expensive compared to blue and brown. Built quality is awesome made of metal.."
5,"I am going to write a review at different timelaps.  Now forst impressions then 6 months later , 1 year lator and then a final review.First impressions :- pakaging from amazon was so so . expected better.  The box was a little damaged at corner but thats due to shipping and kb was all good.  Kb was awesome . build quality was so good . you can hurt somebody badly if you hit em with this.  Keys were good.  Rgb was great . a good purchase as of now.  I Will try to find some cons after some time of use."
5,Amazing keyboard at this price rangeBrown switch has low sound than blue switch13 rgb effects are amazingwin lock key feature is very useful while gamingthe fonts on the keyboard are not good but keys are greatu can use it with your android phone alsorgb brightness are very good
5,"So i have been using it for the past month delivered (28.11.19)So far so good.No misclicksNo ghostingGood feedback.Just want it to last,Paid 6k for Logitech g613, lasted for 6 months. I was furious by thatThis keyboard feels good to type on."
3,"this keyboard is really good, but not that great for long term use, you can get a replacement for free if your keys suddenly stop working, but this is my experience with the keyboard.After 6 months of use, the favorite key of gamers, W key started to not respond, out of 7 clicks, it will respond only once. I tried resetting the keyboard using fn + esc key, and it worked, but for only 3 days, again it started to not respond. cosmic byte, improve your qualitypros are:Sturdy and heavyBrown outemu switches give a good feeling while gaming and typing.aluminium finish on the upper body, plastic body beneath.Wrist rest is good, but a cushion on it would be better.of course, the rgb, everyone's favorite, top class rgb and its  effectsCons:key caps are not good quality, they shake even with lightest force.otherwise, the keyboard is very good,."
5,(i have the blue keys version)its just amazing for the price probably the best mechanical keyboard in the budget range the sound is great the feel is premium also the per key RGB lights are great u get enough combinations....you also get the hand rest with it so its helpful for coders also how type for long time.....and it is very durable the lower is plastic but its sturdy and upper is alluminium which has a good feel and it feels strong and durable also just a small suggestion also visit cosmic byte official website you might get better deal there sometimes but sometime Amazon also gives better price so better look both ways
5,"Save some money and go but the updated version of this keyboard this is old shiz have a look atcbgk -16 firefly by cosmic byte, it's perkey RGB is ok but they're are very less animations, not to mention the RGB resets every time you turn on your PC EVERY TIME but typing is kinda ok but you need time to get used to the layout."
4,Product is good and all key works properly.. Excellent packing..
2,"(Note: I'm a hardcore gamer, not a casual gamer, so these points, though they seem silly, are very important for my gaming).I have these primary problems:Keyboard:1. Key rollover doesn't work for Numpad keys. When I press Up-Arrow, Left-Arrow and Numpad-0 keys simultaneously, the Numpad-0 functionality doesn't work. This is a deal-breaker for gamers who don't use WASD, and still use the old Arrow keys for movement. Come on RedGear, even the basic Logitech K270 keyboard handles this properly, even though that is not a gaming keyboard.2. The Numpad/Caps Lock/Windows Lock lights are ridiculously bright, and for some reason are angled to hit you directly under your eyes. Why?? There is a white coating on that LED cover, facing away from the user, covering the LED up completely would have been much easier on the eyes.3. The keys are raised far too high. Again, probably a problem only for the Arrrow-key users, you will by mistake press the Ledt-Arrow while pressing the Up-Arrow.Mouse:The mouse is uncomfortable (maybe it's just me), my hand is hurting, something that many other mice have not done.Headphone:The headphone (as others have mentioned) isn't great at bass, but if I increase the volume to double the usual level I set it to, it seems fine. The over-head band however, is way too tight (there are two bands, the lower band is the problem). I had a headache the first day I used it, seems to be getting better the more my head is getting used to it.I really wanted to like this product, given the good ratings, but sadly, some of us will be better off using a basic Logitech keyboard/mouse, rather than this supposedly 'gaming' gear. The fact that this is a budget gaming gear is very evident.To make matters worse, apparently, I can't return this, I can only get this exchanged. That's 2.5k gone down the drain."
1,"The headphones have stopped working in 10 days, how can i claim warrenty."
5,Its has been 3months since i bought this combo. Got it for 1500. Till now it's working fine... Will post detailed review later. Keyboard body is made out of aluminum... It's just like that old tvs mechanical keyboard except that it's not mechanical but membrane one. Mouse is made out of hard plastic (better than the cheaper ones like the basic 500 bucks dragon war mice) and the bottom is made out of stainless steel)
5,Probably the best gaming keyboard mouse headphone combo in such an affordable price.....I am totally satisfied....The sound of headphones is crisp and bass is damn good...Keyboard is also good but my spacebar key has some problems..... Because I dropped the keyboard by mistake.....Mouse is damn amazing.....The response time is good....The mouse mat is also very good in quality.... Although I didn't expect it to be... üòäIf you're looking for a gaming set combo.... It is the best in this price range.....
4,"Keyboard:Build quality: 10/10Look: 10/10When backlight is off I cannot read the letters from the keys.Even if backlight is on, some keys are hard to read(since it's not printed correctly)I love the tap sound.Mouse:Build Quality: 7/10Look: 9/10Static color is red and it cannot be changed.Mouse light cannot be turned off.For 1.5k I would recommend this."
1,I have been utterly disappointed with this product as it was damaged when I got it and some of the keys on the keyboard board were not working. So I recommend all the buyers to check all the keys after they buy this product and I am returning this product.
5,"Really very good product, my son loves the lighting effect mainly in the headphone. Very strong Keyboard and replaceable caps. In this price you won‚Äôt get any combo lower than this price. Simply go for it, if you need wired gaming keyboard combo. Worth it"

5,"It is amazing and best mouse and Keyboard you can get.Purchase Date 26 February 2018PROS - Keyboard1. Lots of utility keys like volume, play/pause, Home, calculator, Mute etc2. You can change the lights3. Sturdy keys, so hard key presses won't damage it.4. No window key popup problem, we can lock it5. Long cable length6. Best clickable keysCONS - KeyboardLights don't hover and changes all over the keyboard but for the price, you can't expect it as well.PROS - Mouse1. Beautiful and colorful lighting. It has red, pink, and blue colors.2. Apart from the usual clicks, nice key combination for left and right click. A scroll button is also there.3.

5,"This is a combo of redgear blaze gaming keyboard (tournament edition they say), and redgear Manta mt21 gaming mouse. Both the peripherals are RGB however RGB can't be synced, keyboard is a membrane one and not the mechanical one however it just feels like the mechanical one because the keys are so soft with clicking sound and that is good to any one's liking. Mouse Comes with 6 buttons excluding the mouse wheel (Right Mouse button, Left Mouse button, two dpi button and two programmable buttons on left side), it's DPI is maximum 3200.Now talking about RGB thing, on keyboard you got two options either you can switch to any of the three colours(red, blue, pink) or you can switch to breathing effect which changes colours automatically. Coming on the mouse it has four colours (blue, pink, red, purple) although it comes with a software to program it's buttons but there is no need of it because the default buttons just does the job, but again if you want to program any button you got the software. And not only the keyboard and Mouse combo Looks good but also, they feel to be pretty sturdy, the cables are braided one on both, and body of keyboard is made up of aluminium metal, mouse also feels to be sturdy.Conclusion :- Highly Recommend, when the price is ‚Çπ1500, since the price of this combo changes a lot therefore it is recommended to wait for about 1week and as the price is 1500 just grab it, since it rarely goes below it. If you are using a normal keyboard and mouse then as soon as you switch to this you will surely be going to be impressed by it.Also if anything unexpected happens to any of the peripheral I will be updating the review.Thank you."
1,"WOW ""RedGear"" do we have to Pay premium for the Used/Damaged Product.I got product today and Mouse was ok and fineBut there was a huge Dent on left side of Keyboardand even packing box was ok !so literally cheating from seller.i suggest you not to buy from this seller it is really a bad experience."
1,"The product looks good and performs well as long as it works. I bought this product on 29th March 2019. I received a faulty set which was not working and was promptly replaced. Received the replacement on 1st April 2019. It worked fine till early August 2019and them mouse stopped performing / working as it should have. The customer service number on manufacturers website and that provided by Amazon does not exist. If you email them with n number of reminders, they do not care to respond at all.

4,"i get this combo today 6oct. i recived in two days delivery is very fast but i disppointed because the packing of this product is very poor. the cardboard is wet seal is open packing is damage. really toooo much bad packing but i am lucky the keyboard and mouse is not defacted.the keyboard and mouse is awesome in this price. i am a hardcore gamer so it's a really great combo, great performance, great looking.ALL around it's velue of money. don't think longs just buy.."
3,"I liked this keyboard and mouse combo for 1700 rupees. Looks very good and on the heavy side which gives you a premium feel. But the keyboard stopped working after a few months. Received damaged product as replacement when I claimed warranty. That too, after a lot of delay. Sent it back too and received a working keyboard but the frame was bent and the underside of the keyboard had a big hole in it. This was due to the extremely poor packaging. Buy at your own risk."
1,"Redgear usually makes good products at affordable prices. I was greatly disappointed to find this keyboard defective. Please ensure that all your keys are working properly so you can return the product if required.I purchased this as a gift so it remained unopened for a couple of weeks. On connecting this keyboard to our PC we discovered that the left shift and left CTRL keys were NOT WORKING! I tried updating drivers, unchecking sticky keys, using different ports on my PC - nothing worked. We had to reconnect our old hp keyboard in order to use our PC.One very frustrating thing about this 'gaming mouse' is that all of your settings are LOST on shut down. You have to relaunch the mouse application every time and 'apply' the settings in order to get your shortcut keys working as intended.Conclusion: Disappointing product by Redgear. Does not meet my expectations.Keyboard - defective (two keys not working), however the lights look pretty cool.Mouse - frustrating and impractical; settings need to be manually applied every time you start your PC"
5,"Usability:its quite satisfying to work on this keyboard on daily basis for WFH. Perfect for regular office use.It has a very good key travel which gives a soothing feeling while typing except for space bar..it enters double space for this design. Not sure if this happens for everyone.The mouse is also at the perfect size. Fills the palm with that smooth surface.Edit: Gaming Experience: This keyboard might not be feasible for gaming as the keys are hard material and we subject keys to pressure/pressing hard while gaming, which only pains our fingertips as there is no soft material on them.Look and feel --  5 star... Really looks awesome and colorful while using."
4,"When I was purchasing this and read reviews there was some very good and some very bas reviews. I thought how can same product have such opposing experiences.Then when I ordered I realised. On first order various keyboard buttons were not working and all other things like mouse, mouse pad and headset were perfect. But when I replaced the order I got keyboard working fine but headset sound quality was very bad on this one. Then I realised why some people were saying headset is just ok or bad and some were saying it is good. Then instead of replacing it again I just swapped the old heaset with the new one and got whole combo working perfectly fine. My headset is great. It is even better than my Philips SHP1900 that I got for Rs. 500.So everyone check all the items in combo if they are good, if not then replace them.1 less star because of the hassle I have to go through. Don't know if it is fault of seller or Amazon or the manufacturing company. Mostly it is manufacturing company's fault. They should make same product with same quality.By the way I am using this combo for 5 months now and it is working perfectly good."
5,"Despite me loving this set, I just wished the mouse DPI was as described.  It reaches minimum 1200DPI. I bought this because I wanted a lower dpi mouse and this set had described it as having an 800 dpi mouse.My old cosmic byte had 1200dpi hence I needed something less.Anyway, the keyboard is perfect to type, to game on, feels like mechanical though it isn't. RGB is spot on on all the peripherals.Mouse is a little slippery for my liking, but it'll get to me in time.The headphones could have used a little bass, just a little, because sounds can get a little irritating (sharp) at times. Directional audio is good, but sometimes it might confuse you how far the enemy / object is.By far the most comfortable gaming headphone I owned.Long gaming/music sessions, no problemo!Mic is on point. One might wonder if it'll catch audio since it's right up the left headphone cup, but it surprisingly does!Overall, a really good product.Durability will have to be tested in due time.Everything else is spot on."
4,"Timely delivery of the product. Looks extremely nice. Had a few friends drooling over it. The quality of the mouse is great. Feels sturdy to operate and looks like it will last. The cables are also of exceptional quality and covered in a threaded enclosure. The keyboard is great to look at, especially with the red background light. However, the keys are a bit flimsy and do not seem that it would last longer. However, it is adequate at the price it was available on Amazon. Satisfied with the purchase."
4,"In defence of the RedGear Keyboard.There are some problems with the keyboard, but for the price point this is totally appropriate.There are only 3 RGB colours ‚Äì red, pink and blue. The LED lighting is not very bright.And yes, the keys are not actually visible from any other typing angle apart from straight down. In all other scenarios, you will have to raise the keyboard at a 90 degrees, in order to find the key you need to press.That being said, the keys are definitely very clicky. The built of the keyboard looks super sturdy. The borders are fully metallic, enough to leave scratches on the table if not handled properly. The keys give a proper feedback on being pressed. As a touch typist, there is simply a joy in pressing this keyboard. I‚Äôm having fun just typing the review itself.As for the reviews stating the presence of phantom spaces and what not, I cannot agree, the keyboard works properly as it is supposed to. I do not know how long it will last but it definitely gives the impression of lasting a long time.The mouse, on the other hand, is actually a step above the keyboard. This is possibly the most sturdy mouse I have used so far. Logitechs and dells have failed me before quite often, that too heavy duty gaming mice. But so far the RedGear mouse stands strong. The LEDs are not bright, for sure, and the extra buttons on the mouse are not the best quality. But they give a good feedback on being pressed. The wheel is still working properly after rigorous use, including the middle button press and scrolling. No phantom scrolls nothing. The mouse is working satisfactorily.So all in all, a good purchase."
4,Mouse works exactly bas mentioned about it.Keyboard in my case has a bit issues on the num section as numbers 5 & 9 on single click dials more than onceExample - hit 9 once and it shows 999 or 9999 you have to like touch it slowly and same goes with 5.I have used it for gaming and the sounds makes perfect.Lights - mild for blue but a little bright for purple and red in dark.
3,"The Redgear keyboard mouse combo is a good option at this price, it looks and feels like a nice gaming keyboard. But I had to return it due to following issues:Mouse is too heavy, after some time it cramps yours hands.The Num/Caps/Scroll light on keyboard is too bright, and really distracts your view on the screen.Direct Multimedia keys are missing on the keyboard, they are accessible through Fn key!The keys on the keyboard are not printed well and are only visible if you keep the keyboard backlight ON, so you can't turn off the back light even if you want to."
4,Its been a week since I've been using this keyboard and mouse combo. Here is what i feel about the combo.Speakin about the keyboard its good for what you pay but it isn't the best in the segment. There are better options available. Ergonomics aren't on the perfect side but good does the work for AWSD gaming. Sometimes the keys don't respond but it isn't too often. Key markings aren't the best and hence not clearly visible. Overall keyboard isn't bad for what you pay.Coming to the mouse Ive got no complaints except it doesn't work on all mousepads ; {. I was lucky enough i ordered the RedGear mousepad along with it so it worked well with it. Sensitivity of the mouse is perfect for gaming and there are dedicated keys to adjust sensitivity while in work. Mouse feels premium and fits right perfect in palm. Definetely no complaints for mouse.All in all its a great combo and serves the purpose. If you're getting into gaming then its a right combo to start with.
1,"It is definitely not for gaming mouse and keyboard.. when Playing games like pubg, mouse accuracy is not good. Even though it has dpi upto 3200 still it is not accurate.. you cannot play easily.. mouse is too heavy that will restrict your quick movements. Keyboard is also bad as the keys are hard to press as well as miss sometime."
2,"Delivered on time. But what a poor packing condition! No any packing at all! Just ugly looking box with one side open! The game set looks very odd and untidy.  the mat is old and dusty with spots of fungus. Mouse seems very flimsy. Keyboard is too huge and heavy. Ordered it as a birthday gift for my nephew because of high reiting and reviews, haven‚Äôt tried to use it  but should return it. Waisting of money."
5,This wired keyboard mouse combo is amazing for gamers. Absolutely one of the best in the market and much better than most others. I am using this as the primary gaming keyboard/mouse in a rig I hooked up for my kids. It was long overdue. Keys have a wonderful feel. The travel distance of the keys is more than most normal keyboards so you feel the movement when playing. The mouse is solid and feels tough and hardcore. The red backlight is not intimidatingly bright but is enough to see the keys if room lighting is low. The mouse goes through the rainbow of color changes every 20 seconds or so. Great products.I am using a Asus TUF Gaming X570-PLUS motherboard with a AMD Ryzen-5 3600 MHz 6-Core processor with a Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB DDR4 3200MHz RAM. My graphics card is ASUS Radeon RX 580 8GB Dual-Fan OC Edition GDDR5. The PSU is Corsair RM650. I'm using two hard disks in this. The booting is a Western Digital WD Blue SSD 250 GB SATA III and the bulk storage is a standard 1 TB Seagate Baracuda as the secondary. All this is housed in a Corsair Carbide Series CC-9011050-WW cabinet. I'm using Samsung 27 inch Curved LED Backlit Computer Monitor and a Redgear Pro Series Wired Gamepad. The keyboard mouse combo is this Redgear Manta MT21 Gaming Keyboard. The sound is from F&D F-203G 2.1 Channel Multimedia Speakers System. Everything is bought here on Amazon within days of each other and it is perfectly matched.I recommend this keyboard/mouse and whole matched setup to anyone interested in building a top-of-the-line gaming computer that will not be outdated anytime soon.Highly recommended.
2,redgear product is good build but mouse seems to wearoff after a month of moderate use Amazon plz help me find the warranty of product to replace the mouse
1,"There exist NO service of this product. I have written mail and done tried contacting the relevant service center, but of no use! Also, the product is also NOT WORTH buying at this price as other GOOD products are easily available. Please buy different product rather wasting Your hard earned money!"
5,"I like the product. Great for budget gamers or for beginners.1. Keyboard - Though its a membrane keyboard but it feels like mechanical keyboard, 3 colours are of leds are moderate not so bright not so dimmed, one problem with keys that letters and numbers cannot be visible with out lighting them up.2. Mouse - The mouse is pretty handy you can feel the weight, keys sounds clicky and u can settings things up by installing the drivers given within the box.3. Mouse Pad - it's smooth and grip is good. Feels good while playing games.4. Headphone - Though its a over the ear headphone but still doesn't fit properly in my case. Ear cushions are very soft and doesn't hurt the ear. Good clear sound only for game play but for music not up to the mark.Overall very good combo at this price tag and packaging was good and deliverd in time."
2,"Never thought I would go so wrong with this purchase. My main issues are with the keyboard. The mouse is also just okay. I am just happy that it still works after about 7-8 months.Coming to the keyboard, it is just bad. I don't know what they were thinking while designing this. The bright blue LEDs for Caps on, Num pad are placed in such a way that they will torture you throughout. So you have to keep Num lock off, caps lock off just to spare your eyes from torturous blue LED shining in your eyes.There is absolutely nothing elegant about this keyboard. The keys make so much noise while typing and have a mile long travel, that the keyboard is just not suitable for proper gaming. The alphabets and digits on the keys are extremely low quality. Not too happy with the purchase. The two stars are just for the fact that both my keyboard and mouse are still in working condition. Aesthetically they're simply not upto the mark."
5,I bought this keyboard for playing games and it was a wise decision to buy it. Although it costs nearly 2x of a regular keyboard-mouse combo but the extra money is worth it. If you are into programming then also go for it. It is great to type.1. The backlit keyboard's color can be changed by pressing the Scroll Lock key in succession.2. Each mouse button's dpi is configurable.3. Mouse's color can be set to rotate with an interval or 6 or 4s or it can be made to switch to a static color.4. Both Keyboards' and mouse's backlit can be switched off.5. Keyboard and mouse give a feeling of sturdy build quality.
5,Nice Product.... really its awesome & keys are smoothHead phone with Bass filter & surrounding sound
5,"I was disappointed with Gamdias, whose keyboard stopped working within weeks of buying. I have been using this for 5-6 months now, and trust me - you can't get anything better at this price. It is a work of art. It is beautiful. A must have for a gamer who can't cash out the big bucks.The build quality is amazing. The mouse is extremely high quality and can give the big baddies in the field (Razer, Corsair) a run for their money. The keyboard is heavy and provides a mechanical feel. It's not good for typing but for gaming, it is nearly perfect. The LEDs could've been brighter and the keys could have been more visible, but that's fine.Edit: It's been more than 2 years and both are working fine. The metal paint on the mouse is coming off but that's fine. The numpad lock light is slightly fainter than the lesser lit caps and scroll locks (which is a positive since those lights are quite bright). No problem with other LED or any keys or anything else. Thank you, Redgear."
3,Mouse needs mouse pad.Keyboard is like any other tactile keyboard.There are cheaper options for the same quality. I am going with the Zealot LED mouse (higher DPI) now Dual Hammer keyboard. Fingers crossed.I have a zealot mouse already (super impressed). Hopefully my next one is as good as my old one.Keyboard - IMO - Rainbow ones are better.
5,"I'm crying.. this is the second keyboard i bought.. and before this one i used a decade old HCL manufactured keyboard which was bought on march of 2010. after attending my first typing test using this keyboard i realized now that how fast i can really go. i'm so happy that it made me cry, i started making typing mistake and halting while typing bc i am typing way too fast.. i'm no more stuck at 55wpm, it's around 65 70 now, hope it will go higher in future.. Thank you redgear, thank you appario."
5,"I'll directly get to the point.1. Keyboard body is full metal, mouse if full plastic(despite it's look). But it sure feels good.2. 4 colors in mouse with customizable blinks to happen between 4 or 6 seconds.3. Mouse DIP can be adjusted to max 3200. It's not very much but i don't think you'll require more.4. Color is the best part of keyboard and mouse. They have big leds instead of small one's on keys only. This makes the look amazing.5. Keyboard's spacebar has a bad built. When i first received it, spacebar was broken. Replaced it and it works fine.6. Cable is braided so won't tangle or break.7. Overall you couldn't find anything better than this at this rate. Believe me i ordered logitech prodigy 512 and logitech hero 510 mouse. Returned both of them.10/10 for this product."
4,I have been using this combo for almost 3 years now and it's fair to say that in the heavy use that i put through these its great that they survived 3 years. First i would like to talk about the keyboard the feel of the keys are great for a membrane keyboard. Also the actuation force is not too much or too little it's right where you want it to be. The only issue with the keyboard is that the space bar started making some noises after 2 years of use but it was gone after a few days. But if you are there for the rgb the or rather the rpb (red pink blue) it's fine but good for the price. So the keyboard itself is a great product no such glaring issues in that. The mouse held well for casual use which was about 1.5 years and then i started facing some issues with it as for aiming in any game you have to hold the right click but it randomly just don't click and if you are holding the click it releases in the game. Also when i played Minecraft with this mouse which involves a lot of holding the left click my left click is not giving me the same feedback that it used to give and the travel has also reduced. Other than that mouse is also decent but only for big hands as the mouse is fairly big. Also there is no option to sync the rpb between the mouse and the keyboard but at this point you are asking for too much at this price. Also there is software support for the mouse which is surely nice to have. I will sum up by saying that it is a great combo it will surely last you a good while.
1,"I got a refurbished product,1st, when i received  it was squished inside the Amazon carton & as soon as i cut the seal of the carton products spilled out! the whole package (inside) was torn & taped somehow to hold ,That was really unexpected !I thought fine woud accept that if it could be a transportation issue but no ,THE KEYBOARD was not at all user friendly when the keyboard lights( by scrl lock) are off u can't  figure out /difficult which is what key in the daylight or in your room light! & the indicators lights r so sharp as if those r blue Lazer Beam Like seriously that is the most  annoying thing including all those are those  keys hight & spaces between them, my typing speed was drastically getting reduced keys getting stuck or my finger due to its hight!  If you think that its accurate, in game no my friend  its not it lags as if it's  a Bluetooth 2.0 In 5 feet (Ofcourse it works differently with different configurations )However it was made hard & drop resistance. But was not adequate as gaming & working .The REASON I SAID IT WAS REFURBISHED COZ OF THE MOUSEPAD IT WAS REPAIRED WITH GLUE OR THAT TYPE.HEADSET those were having scratch marks .The only thing  was somewhat ok was the mouse.Therefore i had to Replace as their was no RefundSo i didWhen the REPLACED product came this time it came safely without Amazon carton i don't know  how their was no levelling just the box came ,This time the MOUSE showed problem THE TOP 6TH &7TH BUTTONS WERE LEFT ALIGNED  & THE QUALITY OF KEYBOARD  WAS THE SAME AS BEFORE! & THE HEADSET WAS NOT WORTH OF SOUND QUALITY!i got frustrated with this product & i wonder how  this type of product can get a tag of Amazon's choice!"
5,"It is a super combo but unfortunately i have received a open pack with a broken keyboard then I have returned it and then  I have ordered another one it was well packed and products [Keyboard,Mouse,Mouse pad and Headphones]are superb.Especially I like the Backlight in the keyboard ,headphone and mouse .Everything is nice except that since it has backlight if the backlight is switched off the letters and symbols on the keys are not visible."
5,"Like me who dream for the RGB keyboard offered by Corsair, Cooler Master and so on, but don't have the money to buy. This keyboard and mouse are for them :).  Keys feels like on mechanical K/B. Mouse is also awesome. I Purchased TVS keyboards two times @1790 each, but won't last that long. I bought this combo for Rs. 1299."
4,good product on this price
1,"I did not test this properly when piano arrived. I used once immediately after arrival, piano still worked only from batteries, I assumed I should probably try later without batteries. Today I tested and piano still worked from battery only. I then tested the output of this device with a multi meter and found it emits only 6.8V instead of 9.5V. Then how could the piano work? I think the return period is already over, so I am leaving my frustration here. Very very disappointed. Product looks neat and intact, but out right not working, and lying useless now."
1,"This adapter is not compatible (Polarity is reverse) with my Casio Piano. I am unable to refund , as it is giving me only replacement option. Please supply compatible adapter or refund money."
4,Pros:* Value for money* Good length of cable* 2 Pin connection.‚Äã Round edges.Cons:* Average wire quality* Size of the adapter is somewhat big
3,The adaptor is not from Casio or any good brand.  Only model name LAD 6 written on adaptor which does not justifies brand name. So it is some what not a transparent deal.

3,"Product finish is not good,yet I have not got keyboard hence can't check it.there is some moving sound comes when shakes the lad6.that internal circuit is not properly fitted.after using I review it again."
5,This product is working fine. Did not find any problem.
5,"Nicely working , but a little bigger than normal adaptors"
1,"CON-1. Looses connectivity in every 10-15 min or when it sleeps/inactive. Then, Manual re-setup is required everytime. It should auto connect. For 2 he of work, more than half an hr are wanted in Setup.2. No plug n play included for fast connect.3. No return policy- only replace.PROS1. Sleek, small, well built and exact copy of Apple keyboard.Overall, Suggest to other buyer, don't waste money here. Look for better option."
2,"*Keyboard quality is good.*However, to wake it up from the sleep mode,  you will have to reconfigure it, which is definitely time consuming.* Nowhere on the keyboard, is written 'muvit India' but it's a chinese product with tag, 'made in china', underneath it.*It does not come with USB receiver and can only be connected through bluetooth."
5,The most light weight keyboard I have ever seen . Amazing keyboard with superb lightweight features works very efficiently and best suited for my laptop .
5,Light weight and value for money. Pretty look and feel key board. Compact in size also. Overall rating excellent. Buy without any discussion. Thank you Amazon.
1,"I would never recommend this product to anyone because it stopped working after a month. Prior to this, there was the issue of continuous disconnection."
1,"The keyboard has major connectivity issues. Each time it goes to sleep, it doesn‚Äôt automatically connect. It‚Äôs absolute waste of money."
4,It works and connects well. My only issue is the arrangement of keys. It is different from a standard keyboard  and gives me trouble while typing. The design can be better.
5,"The keyboard is sturdy and the finish is good. I‚Äôm using it for a Lenovo tablet and it‚Äôs working well for it. Sometimes, some keys don‚Äôt type out, I put the Bluetooth on and off and then it‚Äôs fine."
5,My first impressions are it's a fantastic product for the price. Can't expect better than this. Excellent packing superfast delivery. Key of keyboard are soft and layout is spacious enough.
1,"It keeps lagging every time. Sometimes unresponsive. It looks good, and that's it. The most unseamless and lazy product I've bought. Try using it when u are in a hurry..ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
4,"Features of the keyboard is nice, it's is handy and easy to carry. The defect is it takes time to connect to the lap or mobile, it is little hard to use in time of emergency. Apart from that keyboard is fine and nice."
5,"Very sleek and lightweight... over all feel is very premium.. size is as good as a 15.5 inch laptop keyboard... very ergonomic and responsive, connects through bluetooth."
5,"Very good product. True value for money. Too profitable, compared to offline market."
5,best keyboard. I like it is very cheap
1,Don't buy... It works only for a week
5,Good product
5,"I really love the look of the keypad cover, It fits exactly on my new Mac.The colour blue is really pretty and exactly in a shaded look as it was in the picture, that's the best part.The material plastic is also very durable and good in quality.Thankfully the delivery was on time as I ordered just a day before. The packaging was really nice and protective.I am definitely going to buy another set of this."
1,"Doesn‚Äôt fir properly on the keyboard.Difficult to close the laptop fully.Also, when you try to press ‚Äòenter‚Äô it also presses the key above ‚Äòenter‚Äô as well and vice-a-versa.Not many options available on amazon so you might have to go for this only."
5,"Review for Keyboard Cover -This is my first experience with a keyboard cover - I bought it in hopes of quieting the ""butterfly keys"" on the new MacBook pros (I have the 2016 13 inch pro, for reference). I am so happy to say it WORKS! I am a first year law student and use my laptop a lot at school, especially in the quiet depths of the library where every breath can be heard.This cover doesn't completely silence the sound but it does dull it to a workable extent. I got the black color, and you can honestly hardly notice it is even on the computer. Beyond that, it is almost invisible. It just kind lays over the keys and feels soft to the touch. it is a more than reasonable cost for the mitigation of my issue. I also recommend the same brand for a protective hard case - I have the dark grey and it fits amazing and is very sleek. Would recommend to anyone!"
4,"I like the texture of the product. But I don't like that it makes the keys a tiny tiny bit harder to press. It's no issue for light use. But when I'm writing a long email, I remove the cover. Otherwise my fingers ache after 10mins.Definitely a good buy for the price. Keeps the keyboard clean from dust."
5,Absolutely loved it. Fits perfectly on my new macbook air 2019 keyboard. There are many products out there but kindly check the compatibility before ordering. This one works fine for my model of macbook.
5,"It is so good, once you apply this on the keyboard, you don't even know that there is a protective cover. This fixes and sticks to the keyboard exactly and firmly. Thank you Amazon. Dr.Raghu.B.S."
5,"the skin for my lapi is an perfect choice .the skin quality is perfect with attractive colour .the best is that is fits perfectly which i was afraid of ,but size is correct.the quality is good and using it on keys make feel as if i am having new keyboard again !"
1,Caps lock hole is at the wrong place. Too thin and poor built quality.Night time experience is worse. None of the letters match. Must not buy !!!
4,"I think this product is bit so expensive but for a person who can afford a macbook can afford this too. Product quality is great, you need to flatten it on flat surface for about a min to get it shape. Overall protective and even looks great on gold edition macbook air"
4,"Product is good .I choose different colour for a change , but black being a game changer and matches with your mac . Satisfied with the product .This is my 2nd buy from Laprite ."
3,"It says it is for macbook air 13‚Äù model A1932 but it printed numbers/alphabets/signs don‚Äôt sit exactly on the ones on the original keys. We can see the under the keyboard cover at slightly left or right.Otherwise thickness, material are good."
3,I suggest one should buy transparent one so that the key is visible when backlit is on or CAPS ON. with the colored one you cannot see the Backlight ...
4,I have used numerous skins ...but yet this is the best .Although bit blocks the letters wen u switch on the backlight it's quite goodVery happy with the productRelief to sticky keys expecially
5,it looks exactly like it is shown in the picture...However it does not stick to the keyboard which makes it fall
2,"It ripped in a couple of weeks without contact with any sharp objects.  I rinsed it for the second time and dabbed it with a towel, next thing i knew when i put it back on the keyboard, i saw the tear."
3,"Good product but did not fit myac air 13"""
2,The skin is uneven at some keys like esc and delete key. And in the night the keyboard light is not visible so you'll have to remove the skin to see keyboard keys.
5,Better than other products. The best part is that it's very cheap
5,Better than expected was not sure while placing the order if it will be good or not but it is a good product. maybe be a bit expensive but works for me
1,It doesn‚Äôt even stay on the keypad
4,Very neat finish
5,Fitted well
5,Perfect keyboard skin for macbook air 2020
2,It is just a cover to put over keypad.... So... So... Not as expected.... Will not attach or stick to keypad....
5,The product is simply amazing I loved the look and feel
5,Best product
5,"This keyboard cover easy to use, looks like Branded, waterproof,dustproof,surpb quality...love this"
1,Product did not fit MacBook air 13
5,It's exactly how it is shown in the picture. It's very thin and fits exactly on the keyboard.
5,Perfect Product and fit for my new MacBook air 2020.Must buy
2,It‚Äôs meant for the previous macbook pro version not the new ones. Dont buy
4,It is so good and perfect fit for MacBook air
1,Did not fit my keyboard. Returned it.

1,Spoils the original look of keyboard with tis variety of shades.
1,The product does not fit the screen. Does not solve the purpose.
5,Good quality fits right
1,Not up to the mark..not worth the price atol
5,value for money.
5,Excellent product worth it.
1,"I was so exited to open package once its arrived. as i expected, the product was awesome. Good quality materials used for making it. after using for few days numpad ""2"" key LED was started malfunctioning. it started show different colors because the green color was not working in LED .  Well, as everyone does i gave it to service center (With Box) and after 1 week got replacement. I was expecting the brand new replacement (ZEBCARE customer said they going to replace with new keyboard). unfortunately i received a keyboard wrapped with plastic.!!. No box. I asked service center, they said it came like that only. I tested it and found Function Key ""F6"" is again having same issue like earlier keyboard had.And also the keyboard was used and had dents in corner. Returned it again. Now waiting for new Keyboard.."
5,"This is my first mechanical keyboard so i don't know exact difference with other mechanical keyboards. Coming from membrane keyboards u will feel this one as butter smooth. Keyboard is very heavy so it does not slips. The shiny matt finish of the metal looks cool. Typing is buttery smooth on this one. RGB is very bright and clearly visible in bright lighting condition.Edit - after replacing keycaps, it looks even more cool."
5,"Pros:1) Multiple LED modes - My knowledge in this domain is limited, but I could count >20 unique LED modes which are great in low-light conditions2) Braided cable is strong and does not look like it will put out anytime soon3) Keys have good loud blue switches which is what I wanted for my home set-up4) Heavy and stable, will not move based on heavy typing and feels sturdy and high qualityCons:1) Could include a wrist rest portion as add-on, I have purchased this separately (the height of the board makes this difficult)"
5,"The product is good and way above my expectations.Pros:1. RGB lighting is a nice addition.2. Floating key design makes it easy to clean.Cons:1. Its only come with Outemu blue clicky switches.2. Long keys (one with stabilisers) are little wobbly.3. Noticed some inconsistency in keystrokes.4. Keycaps fonts are terrible (at least according to my taste).Improvements:1. Please give other switch options too (tactile, linear, etc..).2. Kailh box clicky switches (white, jade) are much better in terms of sound and tactility.3. Really wish if it had an armrest of any kind."
5,"After a long time I have finally got a keyboard again. Been on laptops for the last 15-17 years so never had to buy a keyboard in the interim.I got this to go with my RoG Strix laptop - mostly to protect the laptop keyboard from abuse - hahaha.So the good stuff first:RGB - reasonably controllable via the Fn+Key combos - wish it was documented somewhere so you could know what to do to get a particular effect. Even better would have been if they had a software driver to control this like they do for the Phobos mouse (reviewed seperately)The build quality is incredible. It feels like a zombie apocalypse weapon. I don't mean any zombie games either - you can literally use this to smash things open. All metal and HEAVY. Love that.Mechanical keys that remind of the good old days when we only had TVS Gold (for anyone here old enough to remember those)The same thing comes under bad as well - Mechanical keys are loud. I had not thought of this and am forced to type on the laptop directly when the wife is asleep in the same room or when I am in a Video Conf and don't want people to know I'm typing. By loud - I mean really loud. This is not a bug or a fault. It is one of the selling points of mechanical keyboards - but keep this in mind if you are in the market for one.Nitpicking here because I need to put another bad point - but it's not really all that bad - the fonts on the keyboard are a bit hard to read. I can tell they were going for a futuristic/gamer aesthetic, but there are times when you look at a key and go ""what the heck is this supposed to be"" (G/6, 2/Z, 0 looking like square braces, over the top B that doesn't look like anything you have ever seen, 8 missing top and bottom mid parts - the list is huge) but the worst offenders are the special keys, Caps, Shift are understandable because you are used to having them where they are. The symbols really don't do much. PgUp and PgDn can be odd looking but the worst offenders are PrintScreen/Break Scroll Lock and Pause/Break.Not a major issue, particularly if you have been typing for some time - most of the time you type by touch anyway. But this is an area they would want to improve on to get full marks from my.To round off the complaints, the last one is lack of wrist support. You need to get one because the keys are floating far above the surface and you will get carpal tunnel unless you rest your wrists on some sort of elevated surface."
5,"Ok so here are some honest review after used 1 day. (Don't know about the long run)Looks: Cool and very sexy. In this price point its more than enough. Build quality superb. Top meterial made out of aluminium/iron not sure. But branding is in good position. Cable is breaded and usb is gold plated and very high quality. No issue with my modern usb port. Bottom half made out of good abs plastic with rubber padding on bottom. On top if you open then leg you can find rubber padding there too. So with stand you cant move the 1.3 kg keyboard.Talking about weigy. Not feel that much weight.Technology: outemu Blue switches used here which is similar than Cherry MX blue and can find in any cheap rated mechanical keyboard.Pros: very cheap it doesn't mean effective. Its good infact very good. Just the key lifespan is less than cherry or any other heigher competitors according to document.Key caps are easely removable and that's why they didnt provide any tool or extra key cap. But if you ever want to change it search in Aali express for switch and keycaps both. Now here I want to mention two things and where the cons startedCons: fonts printed in the keycaps is not so cool and I saw the same type of fonts many recent chinis keyboard. Please wheather India or china, change it. Now the company is indian but they are manufacturing the product from china. My device mamufactured in May, 2020.Some people talked about light led wable of keys, but beleve me never found such thing.The main sailing point of the keyboard is full rgb. In this price range no one offer this. But all rgb mode are tested and those are great. White professional static light to diso yoo gamming everything is there. So they just put one multitoned led and read only ic in the board. Thats great cause atleast I am not expecting software like logitech for this one. Extra programmable button and macro keys ar not there for the same reason. Apart from Sound control whole media keys are useless.windows lock working fine amd antighistingPackaging are great, in this price point I guess this is the bestNever found this keyboard too loud"
5,"This is pretty solid built keyboard with many amusing lights effects. Nice feel of the keys, size is optimal.There are no dedicated multimedia keys, they are combined with Function keys. Comes with a plastic cover that can be used as dust protector when not in use.For more details you can check my video uploaded here and available on youtube also."
5,Well the keyboard is bery well built its quite heavy but actually its needed for stability during rough usage. The keys are otemu blue switch which is very similar to cherrymx blue switch and will give you thebsame experience. However the spacbar is slightly wobbly but its ok as the overall performance is excellent. The rgb are bright enough that you can even see in well light environment . For gaming its very well built even for typing and coding it is the best product that you can buy at this price. The ergonomics are very well as it has legs at the back it helps us for better wrist position. However the over all feel and use of this keyboard is excellent.
5,"Its best gaming keyboard. Its has specified key lightening system which make your night gaming better I mean key highlight system. so its best for gaming. One more thing it has no tutorial so if you guys who want to use the specified key lightening system use these key binding. first use FN+~ (Left top under ESC ) then use FN+LEFT ARROW (to change LED color) for indication of color the ""~"" key flashing with the color then you have to push the specified key which you want to color just like my picture second one. I thing you guys might be helpful for these."
5,"Its blue mechanical keys, they make nice clicky sound if you are into it.No software needed, the RGB pattern can be controlled from keyboard itself.Specific keys can also be configured from the keyboard.I used it for coding as well gaming. Works perfectly.Its a steal at the mentioned price range."
5,"I have been using ZEB-Max Plus for a year for work and I was happy with that. Now I needed one for my WFH setup and I wanted to invest in a robust, good performing and long lasting product which can deliver all these without costing too much. This keyboard has everything a normal user or gaming enthusiast want. The RGB effects can be subjective but I find them a plus point as it makes your keyboard standout in room aesthetics. There are several effects but there is no SW to drill down further so this is a bit of limitation as compared to other brands but considering price point this still offers lots of LED effects.Brightness is also good and looks decent at different angles.I have not played games as I am far away from building a gaming PC but my work requires a lots of typing. After using it for a week I found it very easy to use. People who have never worked on a mechanical KB they should try these and they will never go back to cheap membrane KB. The keystrokes are precise and usually 50-60% pressure on key will get the job done. So very comfortable to use and the clicky sound makes u really feel the flow of typing. Now some people may find it noisy so they should go for a brown switch mechanical KB if they still want a mechanical KB but with less noise. I personally favor the clicky sound.The KB has aluminium plate on top so it is bit heavy but it does not move easily once placed and u can type with full force without worrying about the placement of KB. You will though require both hands to position it if u decide to change your typing angle.The USB connection is braided with Gold connector so vey sturdy adding more value to the product.Cons:- no wrist pad, many companies offering magnetic or plastic wrist pads in low price models. It would have been nice if it was included.- no additional SW to more customize LED experience. But I understand there are trade offs if you want a product at competitive prices. But still a feedback to Zebronics.- no KEYCAP remover!! Come on Zebronics !! it would have been a very useful tool without any cost to existing product. Grrrr!!- design is very old school, just all black and no other theme/color scheme may make one feel like it is too bland when looking at out of the box. So they could have used some different theme to make it bit flashy.Overall I am happy and satisfied for the price and quality product Zebronics has delivered.There are more technical points which are already mentioned by seller but I will not delve into those. The cons are not much of a deal breaker. I recommend this product to everyone."
5,"I have been using this keyboard nearly a Month for Gaming . For those who are looking for a new below 4K price range Mechanical Keyboard (Outemu Blue Switches) it's a great Deal.PROS:*The Build Quality isn't superior like Corsair or Logitech keyboards but for the price it's great build quality. it givesyou sturdy feel while using.*It has a floating keycap design which makes looks cool also easy to remove keycaps and clean, and these are double injected keycaps too.*The cable is braided and Gold plated USB connector which is very nice.*There's some useful FN keys and bunch of RGB lights to control the brightness and change the effects.*This keyboard is good for gaming and also for casual use, If you're not a fan of clicky sound check silent switch keyboards.CONS:*They should add a Software to control the effects and brightness.*It's little less comfortable without a wristpad they should've include it, Even same price range keyboard brands providing wristpad.*There is no Keycap Puller, even the lowest price keyboard brands providing keycap pullers."
5,"this is works good , had no problem with its , only problem is lack of keycap removerAfter 3 months of usage , the lack of keycap remover is a problem as dust can get in the keycaps on the edges and make them not press down properly , I thought it was a sotware problem but just needed to remove the keycaps and clean the inside properly"
5,I usually use it for typing and sometimes for gaming. That clicky sound omg you'll love it. Got it on time. It was a great deal for me. Of course I cannot afford Cherry MX blue switches as of now but some day I'll buy Das Keyboard.
5,"Does have its cons but given its price and lack of competition I give it a 5/5ProsBuilt like a tank with its full metal body & base plate, double shots keycaps, and much key wobble.Mechanical Blue Switch feel great and consistent, they sound great too (Check out the video for the sound)RGB: Even if each lighting key is not configurable it has enough effects and colours to serve the majority of the people out thereNice strong cablePrice: This is the best of all the pros, you will not find a keyboard that looks good with the blue switch and RGB effects like this under 5KCons:The font is unnecessarily hard to read, I think they felt it makes fell more like a gaming keyboard but ended up making it hard to read sometimes.The 3 Status LEDs (Caps lock, num lock & the other one) don't change colour"
5,"I loved this keyboar a lot, though i want to list pros and cons for eveyone who wants to buy them:Pros:1) the keyboard has great backlight not too bright and not too dim 2) For anyone who is wondering which keys are used they are outemu blues 3) The font of the keyboard and the keycaps are very good as the keyboards of the same price like the cosmic byte cb-gk-12 have very bad font and keycaps4) The build quality is also very good and sturdy for long use5) It also has braided usb cableCons:1) It would have been good if the keyboard had individual backlight colours as the keyboard only has rainbow colours and not individual colours like white, black etc.Until now I had no issues with the keyboard and I will update if I do."
5,"This is an amazing mechanical rgb keyboard, you can‚Äôt assign each key a Color but it has pre defined  rgb modes. Good quality product and perfect for gaming, it simply crushes its competitors in this price range.It‚Äôs also an Indian company."
5,"Everything is good, fun experience. The LED brightness would have been better and the lock keys' indicators could have been changing colors. Right now the lock key indicators stah blue only."
5,"This is one of the cheapest mechanical keyboard in the market. The mechanical switches are not cherry MX, but its delivering the same clicky feel. Also the keys are not perfectly stabilized, as it shakes when u press it from the edge. I would recommend to buy this keyboard if u have 5000 Rs. Its great!"
5,"I am using it for everyday work, Coding and Gaming. You can use it for the same as well.A very good, sturdy and responsive mechanical RGB keyboard, with a braided cable and strong metallic body."
5,These are really great mechanical keyboard at this price.The build quality is good and its quite heavy. It feels like a durable product. Its fully metal and you can feel the weight.These are otemu blue switches I guess which are pretty much the best substitute for cherry mx blues.Not a big fan of RGB but I am not gonna lie these RGB look really pretty.There are no better mechanical keyboards with these set of qualites at this price range. Period.
5,"I can't believe that it took me 14 years to check out a mechanical keyboard. But this thing is amazing. If you have never tried mechanical keyboards then you should definitely try it out, its a game changer. Typing is a joy with this. The softness of the key, the typewriter like sound, and the deterministic feedback of the mechanical keyboard is amazing. This is also pretty stable, heavy, and backlighting is amazing and varied.This is my first mechanical keyboard, so not sure how this particular brand ranks among other mechanical keyboards. But I can't imagine them getting any better than this."
5,I liked the RGB lights tacrile feedback is good.Very good premium mechanical keyboard at this price range.You can easily learn typing.Go for it.Highly reccomended.
5,"Pros:Mainly used for Gaming and & programming great performance so far, The keyboard feels heavy duty & durable the keys have great travel and lots of RGB modes to choose from.Cons: It collects a lot of dust and is difficult to clean if you have a vacuum it gets much easier to clean the keyboard Its not very ergonomic you might need to invest in some wrist rest for this keyboard"
5,I didn't expect the product to be so good. I expected but not this much.  They keyboard is far better than my expectation.  Mechanical switches for this price is worthy to go after. The build quality is so so sooo good. The only thing I wish to be there is a dedicated software for light control. Rather than that this item is absolutely bang for the bucks.
5,This is my first mechanical keyboard so i don't know exact difference with other mechanical keyboards. Coming from membrane keyboards u will feel this one as butter smooth. Keyboard is very heavy so it does not slips. The shiny Matt finish of the metal looks cool. Typing is buttery smooth on this one. RGB is very bright and clearly visible in bright lighting condition.
5,"The most legit keyboard with tactile switches.Lighting modes are OP.Never disappointed about quality.It has blue keys, so be aware that it makes noise but that is fine by me."
5,Go for the max pro version if you are looking for some good RGB. The keyboard is of really good quality material. The build quality is solid. The key-caps seem to be really good quality too. Been using this one for a couple of months. No hiccups at all. The clicky sound of outemu blue switches are good. But beware of the sound if silence is your thing.
5,"Liked everything related to it. Was a bit skeptical after reading the 1 star ratings but personally I'm super happy that I went for this keyboard. Used it for 3 months now, everything works super fine. The keyboard's sound that it makes and the rgb patterns are my favourite aspects of it."
5,the low maximum brightness and lack of hand rest are some of the drawback of this product but rest are top notch and I recommend this product for the bottom of my heart. Zebronics is an Indian company with international standards. This product is sturdy and heavy which gives stability at your table.Go for it.
5,This is a fantastic keyboard - you need not be skeptical - I tried it and am LOVING typing on it - it's simply addictive and feels great.I do not play games at all - and I bought it for programming/typing and it's great for that purpose.The other competition was a Redgear Invador - no service center in Delhi.Redragon Vara - no service center in Delhi.
5,PROSLove the way it sounds when pressing the buttonsLove the way of RGBBraded wire is much higher quality then i thoughtDurableA five star ErgonomicRGB effects are really awesomeCONSPacking was badDelivery was not good tho!(About the box packing)
5,This is a very good keyboard it is perfect for gaming the switches are very tactile and clicky and makes it good for gaming key registration is also good and the actiaction point is perfect this keyboard is very good for gaming . Just go for it . The rgb effects are damn good best keyboard at this price
5,"Works great for everything. Been using it for almost a month now, and have encountered no problems till date. The weight of it makes it especially awesome for gaming, it does not shift in those tense moments, making you misclick something. RGB styles and lighting effects are amazing. I've stuck with an only green effect to match my mouse and PC front fans."
5,"PROS :-1.Gold plated usb2.Braided cable of 1.8m3.Full customizable rgb of 18 different modes(brighthness, speed, direction and animation control)4.Good vibrant RGB5.Sturdy and premium build quality6.Very good packing box(main box)7.Cable organiser tie is provided in the wire8.Good keys caps (Key caps puller provided)9.Caps lock, num lock, scroll lock key has lights on when it's on otherwise it's off..CONS:-1.Blue Switch manufacturing company is unknown2.Outer body is fully plastic (but it'sHeavy still. Might be cuz of metal plate inside it.)3.No wrist rest is there for long gaming sessions (for die hard gamers) . (For that problem, you can go for CB GK 11 or you can buy a wrist rest or may be Jugar can help.)NOTE FOR COMPETITIVE GAMERS-THIS ISN'T A 80 PERCENT OR 60 PERCENT KEYBOARD. IT SHOULD BE KEPT IN MIND.(You can go for Gamdias' 60 percent keyboard near about Rs. 4k or more)NOTE- THIS HAS CLICKY BLUE SWITCHES WHICH MIGHT BE ANNOYING TO SOME PEOPLE WHEREAS IT MIGHT BE THE ONE OF THE BEST CUZ OF THE TACTILETACTILE FEEDBACK.Final verdict -BEST IN CLASS LIKE ITS PREVIOUSVERSION ZEB MAX PRO VERSION 1... FAR BETTER THAN THE COSMIC BYTE MECHANICAL KEYBOARD SERIES."
5,My experience with it very grateful... Key are strong... RGB is also good + brightness is good enough.. cleaning is easy. Overall good keyboard üëç.
5,"Excellent Value for Money Product!The Keyboard is Fully Mechanical with Great Lightening Effects(Pictures Attached) with Great Pleasing Clicky Sound.The response is Extremely Fast and Cable Is Of Really Good Quality & Length.The Build Quality of Keyboard is Metallic which Makes it Long Lasting and Tough.Definitely Buy it without Another Thought, You won't Regret it!!"
5,"Very nice keyboard, i am totally impressed with the build quality and typing experience is so good. Lighting effects are also very nice and colourful. I just love it"
5,"Pleasing typing with good RGB light affects. Nice mechanical keyboard, I am hope for it to durable."
5,"great product for the price, i have been using the for a week. build quality of this keyboard is very good, key feel very tactical and the lighting option is also great. over all i'm very happy with the purchase..if you are looking for a mechanical keyboard withing 3.5 to 4k range, then i would highly recommend this."
5,The product is good and as per the specification unlike other items. It is serving my purpose for which it is intended too. I will suggest for others also. I bought this one and then I bought another which is bigger in size than this one.
5,Product as promised. Loving the pastel pink.
5,Good package üî•üíØ
5,Its amazing and I love it.
5,Decent
1,"Though quality looks good for the given price. however, it's not compatible with keyboard of my Dell Inspiron 15 3000 laptop. Keys are not aligned with laptop keyboard even after the position of keys are same as keyboard's keysI would not recommend it."
5,"Pros : it's a perfect fit to my Dell G7 15 inch backlit keyboard . I was suspecting it won't fit while ordering this , but thumbs up for the fitting .Cons:1. Fn keys F10 and F11 for inc dec brightness are not matching .2. It will stick to the keys , so a its creates slight gap between keys and cover on the edges .3. Keys are not transparent,  so it won't pass the light through it , will block backlit.  This is little disappointing ,little lighte will come on key edges .Check the photo.You can go for it , it safe gaurd your keyboard ."
5,"1) Flexible, washable, easy to apply and remove for cleaning or disinfecting2) Feels great to touch, keeps your keyboard new and fashionable3) Keep out dirt, food, dust, liquid, and other junk from your keyboard4) No glue, static cling, flexible, washable, easy to fix & remove5) Waterproof and dustproof, protect your keyboard against everyday spills"
4,Great productJust a few minor issues which i felt are there but aren't as importantPROS:Good quality siliconGood quality printTransparency allows back-lit keysCONS:Font of print for special keys like / and ‚Çπ are not very good lookingThere is no hole or transparent gap for the caps lock lightMight be a bit puffed when put at first but washing it and drying it properly gives a nice fitThe keys feel even more like a modern keyboard and the mechanical feel of your keyboard will not stay
2,Do I need a keyboard protector? nope because after using this hell I should throw my laptop. we can barely see my switch lights. and it's too thick I don't even feel if the key is pressed or not. I don't think this product is useful. And thanks for reading till now I appreciate your patience.
4,"This one is perfect for Inspiron 3000 keyboard. Just one drawback, capslock light is not visible.I have cut a tiny hole and the problem is solved. But manufacturer/seller should do that."
5,"Perfect fit. I got it today and feels good.I have Inspiron 3593, it is a generic version for Inspiron series and F10 button may not have backlit keyboard symbol but that's okay.Will update after using for few days. Cost could be bit lesser. I got it for 328 Rs/-"
5,"I'm using dell 7559, perfectly fitted, but low light conditions ypu want to remove to use backlit keys are not visible while using this key protector. Other than that every keys are prefectly fitted easy to remove and place. Quality was good, but little pricey i got on a deal of 309, price could be less than 300 is much better"
5,"Very nice product, perfect fit for dell inspiron 3593 laptop. Highly recommend this product"
4,I reviewed after using 3 months.Perfectly fitted dell 5000 laptop.Good protection from dust to your keyboardCons is onlyI wont more transferred chiclet that looks better on black laptop.

4,"I used this cover for Dell Inspiron 5567(15.6"")The cover is good, it fits the keyboard. But the""enter"" key in the cover doesnot match with that in the actual keyboard.All of the remaining keys are aligned , except the enter key. But no problems while pressing the enter key. Works good ‚úå‚úå"
5,"Good product to protect laptop from liquid and dust, fits very well, only thing is that it didn't fit on the key just above the enter key on DELL LAPTOP"
5,"It is genuine product , but it doesn't stick to your keyboard so I'm afraid that dust may still enter in the keys .It really suited my laptop, Thank you Amazon!:)"
1,Not good for backlit keyboard as I couldn't see the keys in the dark even though my keyboard has backlight in it. Keys are not visible in dark.
4,Very good.... It nicely fit on my dell inspiron 15 series.... But last edge of guard is too small... It cant cover main keyboard edge....
1,Worst product ever. It's a piece of nonsense no quality nothing. Wasted my money for this thing. It should be of 50rs. This company is a loot.

1,I cant use it because the sound it produces is very high. It doesnt have quality.. Its not worth
1,This thing can't do anything...it looks like it's made out of the tools you get in a science experiment set for kids.Please don't by this.

5,Received product as advertised
5,The product has suited my expectations. Thanks to Amazon.

5,Nice fit my dell 3542 laptop
2,"Surprised as I found several flaws in this product. No led indicator in keyboard ie. Caps lock, Numlock etc. Since it is wireless, need to have On/Off switch to conserve battery.. missing in both keyboard and mouse.Edit on 04-Aug-2020 :Space Key gets stuck in keyboard and space character gets repeated.. unable to use at all."
1,"Low quality build for keyboard and mouse. Indicators are not working for Num, CAPS lock.Design of Keys are not good!Not worthy to buy !"
1,"Utter waste of money.  Both the key board and mouse started malfunctioning after just three weeks of use. Bought this thinking that HP is a reputed brand, and can be trusted.  Now I understand that HP is a brand that cannot be trusted any more. and I see that many of my friends are of same opinion. What they say is that, now a days HP has became an untrustworthy brand."
5,"This is a very good basic keyboard, keys are sturdy and very comfortable to write for long duration. The overall size of the keyboard is compact and ideal for smaller workstations. The wi-fi receiver is plug & play and very responsive. Mouse is bit flimsy but works very well. At its price point it is value for money. The only drawback is lack of Back-lit Keys but I can live without it as I use it only when I am working with my laptop at my workstation."
1,My mouse started malfunctioning after using a month. The right-click button triggers wheel functionality and the left click triggers right-click functionality. It feels impossible to contact the service center and after continuously trying for an hour the customer care suggested me to go to a service center as online support for accessories is not provided. I REGRET BUYING THIS PRODUCT
5,Keyboard and mouse works perfectly fine. Finger impression on the keys makes typing comfortable. CAPS key indicator not required since laptop has CAPS LOCK light indication. Mouse is super smooth and efficient.
4,"Very Comfortable, Mouse was Smooth Handling, No Sounds In keyboard Press. nice product, ""But delivery Boy was Asked Me for extra Money For Shipping the Product Its Rude Act. He's Like:-Delivery Boy: Mister give extra Amount for Shipping this Product.Me: why Sir I Seen Already The Amount, its Shown me all  including Delivery Charges, taxes, GST+ & more , why even you asking me extra Money.Delivery Boy: No No Sir Give Some Extra Money, its showing me more in our website.Me: No I am not  giving you more money, i readied  all terms & conditions why should i give more money.delivery Boy: Its Ok Then, Give me How Much You Think, like Rs.30 Or Rs.50.Me: they are not paying You salary Or what, why are you wasting my time.Delivery Boy: its Ok then Its your Choice Mister.(Conversation END )Its Such a weird Act. Please Guys Give Such Attentions to This Conditions."
1,Worst keyboard money can buy. They even sent me a used one.Lot of good keyboards available this is not one of them
1,Low rating for ridiculous services from HP.1st they send defective mouse.In replacement they sent broker key board with no battery cover backside.Wasted lot of time & looks like selling used product.
1,The keyboard looks and feel cheap (almost like a duplicate). The plastic finish is not smooth at all. Anyways started using it but to my horror the functionality was even worse. Few keys won't respond on single hit and few registers twice or thrice on single hit. Such a huge disappointment. Finally decided to change the keyboard but to my shock there is only a replacement option. I will have to find out if the replacement is better if not this item could get stuck in replacement request loop forever.
5,"Keys are smooth, Low sound clicks. Mouse clicks are irritating usually but this one had it's own mechanism not to play any sound with mouse clicks. you'll love it when you use it.The best option i loved it auto power of, to save battery, you need to press a key to wake it up as simple as that...Awesome benefit with battery indicator just above the number key padImprovement, It's better to Numlock, Caps lock & Scroll lock indicators on Keyboard"
4,I‚Äôm writing this review after 3 weeks of usage. My work involves an extensive usage of mouse and few keyboard taps. So after 3 weeks of usage I find the mouse scroll has a squeaky noise when in scroll up or down. This kind of noise is usually expected may be after 6-7 months of heavy usage.Pros:1. Comfortable grip on holding the mouse and keyboard taps.2. No lagCons:1. Mouse scroll is squeaking2. Not value for the money3. Not a good build quality
5,With work from home in full effect I needed dual screens and it was necessary to use the laptop as a screen. With this combo I was able to do that and have the freedom to use the keyboard and mouse free from the laptop. The keyboard is smooth and responsive and the mouse is small but powerful and responsive. The best part is that the mouse shuts off if not used for a certain period of time.
1,"I purchased this some 6 weeks back. It suddenly stopped working. My laptop ( even tried with other laptops) is not detected it now. For last 1 week , it was disconnecting  frequently now it completely stopped.Now sure how to fix issue ."
5,I read few negative comments regarding the product. I find it to be awesome till now. If there be any negative finding i will update my review. till date it works fine without any flaw. For notification of CAPS LOCK and NUM Lock i use a software called 'TrayStatus' it works for me
5,Gud product
5,Pros:Sturdy KB and mouseNo click sound for mouseAuto off feature works well (for conserving energy); Just scroll the mouse button to reactivateCons:No inidcators for Capslock/Numlock
1,"Quality not good, no value for moneyBoth mouse and keyboard do not have On/Off switches which makes it difficult. Keypad sensitivity is not great. Mouse scroll wheel got busted within two months. Overall not a quality product"
4,Both keyboard and mouse have a soft feel when using. The mouse buttons are exceptionally buttery and feels good to use.Grooves in keyboard reduce typos but it could have used a palm rest
4,Good combo with affordable pricing. One observation was sometimes the click is not responding for our actions
4,Keyboard seems to be slow in communicating with the laptop. Battery in keyboard drains very fast  but mouse doesn't drain the battery fast.
5,Good keyboard and mouse with automatic power on and off
2,Absolutely worthless product to buy.Although delivered within 24hrs of ordering. The product had innumerous glitches and software problems right from the time it was attached with the laptop. The cursor started malfunctioning and draining the batteries within blink of an eye.DO NOT GO WITH THIS PRODUCT.
1,"Within 3 months my mouse's scroller stopped working.Customer service response was as cheap as it can be.Service centres denied accepting product through courier, where I am ready to bear courier expense too.I don't recommend this product to anyone especially online."
4,Keyboard and mouse is good quality and responsive. You will feel while pressing the keys of the keyboard. The only demerit I noticed is lack of indicators for Caps Lock and other locks.
5,Very nice product at this price Must buy for gaming and work form home purpose
5,Just got the product delivered today. It really feels great in typing and also has a premium look the mouse is also great. Responses really fast and the chords are also quite long. But now i got disappointed by seeing the price today it dropped by almost Rs. 70..
5,I purchased to handle my smart TV and it is perfect for same. I am happy with item price and perfectness.
5,Wonderful product cheaper than what you get in park lane Hyderabad and many places here . Go for it.
1,What I did not like about the purchase is the package condition. The seal was open and the box was in a torn condition. I am giving 1 star for this purchase only because of the seller's attitude not because of the poor quality of the product.
4,Good sturdy and perfect with MAC as well.Only fault is that there r  NO LED indicators to know if caps or scroll is ON.
2,Very poor range for the setup.. the transmitter dongle has to be set in front of desktop to have seamless connectivity
1,"Would not recommend to go for this combo as keyboard died after 1month, although tried replacing battery.It gives weird error, like if you press 's' or 'a' , it types 'as' and it is happening for multiple combinations.Waste of money product"
1,"Packaging was worst, seal was open and again pasted keyboard was perfectly fine but mouse one side is not working I think the mouse was accidentally damaged due to worst packaging"
1,Stopped working after one month.. consumes lots of battery
5,Bought it with a lot of overthinking. When got the keyboard and mouse in it was working beautifully. Solved problem of my 2007 purchased hp laptop broken keyboard keys.
3,We bought this but the mouse is faulty and so we asked for a replacement - still waiting for it.
1,"this product is faulty and not usable at all , since i think i crossed the time limit of changing it  i have to look for some thing newworst product i have ever got from amazon .of they change it , it will be great help."
5,Fantastic keyboard...seamless and smooth.. anybody looking to buy. Keyboard should go for this one.
1,Poor build quantity. Too much lag. Intermittent operation.
5,"I'm highly satisfied by the functionality of this keyboard. It works a dream on android and windows. I got it for Rs1590 which is very cheap when compared o the flagship Logitech wireless keyboard for all devices. Except for simultaneous multipoint connection, this keyboard misses nothing. The touchpad is useable and keys are functional and have good key travel"
5,Worked without ANY tweaks on Kali 2021 over Raspberry Pi 4 8 GB. Auto detect on reboot. Works like a charm. Best companion for a solo Rpi system.
1,Worst product. Do not recommend at all. Does not work.
5,Superrr.. Just go for it.
2,Mousepad not working properly
1,Product stopped working after just about 10 days....a complete waste of money.
5,Value for money and with mobile n tablet u can do work like laptop.
4,"Amazing product. It is exactly like shown in the picture, nice and sleek."
5,The keyboard is simply great. The quality is excellent. I am really impressed with the design of the keyboard as it really helps to type on portable devices such as tablet and mobiles.
5,"Product works perfectly well. It is light weight ,easy to use. quality is good for what you pay. It is a good brand. go for it."
5,Good Build Quality and touch pad works great.Working perfectly.Compatible with iOS / Android OS / Windows OSGood!!!
5,"Go for it, it's 100 times better than dell keyboards. I have used 3 from same brand"
5,Excellent üëå
4,"I have attached the snapshots of the setup.The keyboard needs a fully lit environment so no shadows are cast on it while typing. The key travel is good and the keys are springy. However, the keyboard is too light, so you have to use a mat or cloth underneath to prevent it from slipping when typing. My normal typing speed is around 30-35 words per minute. Even while accounting for errors, the tight alignment of keys will force you to slow down a bit. It is easy to get used to it though. But have a mat underneath. It slips a lot due to its lightweight nature.A simple backlight would have been great for this keyboard, along with some added weights and softer rubber feet.Great product for those who want an economical typing keyboard. Can work with a USB hub as well."
3,Just about fine.. there should be slot to keep the dongle if not in useAlso the quality is not as sturdy as it should beFunctionality is fine
1,"It worked well when it did, which unfortunately was only for a few days. With hardly 10 min of use, this unit has conked off"
5,"Do not working only after 2 month, don't buy this product.  No on/off button. used with normal battery 1.5 months but only 2 or 3 days used with duracell now it is dead."
2,Enter button is too hard so that lot of mistakes come while typing
5,Nice product...Also work with smartphone
5,Good
5,"Working fine, thanks for quality product."
4,NA
1,Made in China
5,It is very productive
5,"Now a days PS/2 keyboards are very rare to find.*No Ghosting at all,*with this keyboard you can press as many keys as you want at a time (it's very important for a gamers)*with my old keyboard, in Far Cry 4 i cant Move ,Sprint and jump with W+ shift + space at a time (because of ghosting) But now its not a problem.*It's a heavy keyboard, means solid build, Keys are soft (soft keys good for gaming)*if you want ZERO input lag then ps/2 keyboards are better ( Even better than 1000hz polling keyboards)*but 1000hz polling keyboards are priced at more than 3000/-*Then this keyboard with 0 input lag costs only 800/-im lucky to find this Keyboard before sold out."
5,"After I decided to learn programming my wireless keyboard was not making the cut because it didn't have dedicated arrow mark buttons. I was planning for more like keys where I can bang hard enough but still be soft enough for me to soft type. This one fills the role easily. I especially wanted a PS2 keyboard because I didn't want to loose another USB port on my computer. It was a wrong idea because keyboads required backlight, and this doesn't have one. I should have gone for the back light ones because in the night these keyboards become monsters. Mind you I am a proper typer. I can type without seeing the keyboard. So, it was really a banger for me.But still, I wanted a keyboard where I can also game, this is why this particular keyboard makes that cut and choose ps2 for that specific reason.Keys are soft enough yet sturdy. Go for it, especially if you are a mechanical keyboard user."
5,"This keyboard from HP is awesome! Super smooth to type, keys are fine. Your fingers do not ache after typing for hours. It's for heavy duty and if you are looking for a keyboard that lasts long, this is the right one, no earthing problem too. Works fine."
5,The keyboard is genuine HP keyboard. Very sturdy build quality and soft keys. A little heavy but it imparts good stability. Very satisfied with the purchase. Recommended product.
5,Excellent Soft Touch Keyboard with no key in sound and very soft touch..a much expected product..as I have to do a lot of typing works..
5,You can never find better keyboard than this for your pc. Build quality is excellent and it looks and feels like great. Other keyboards in front of this look cheap plastic toys.
1,"Bought this keyboard solely for the purpose of N-key roll over, which its NOT. A lot of key combinations don't work and i'm pretty frustrated right now. I waited 3 weeks for this keyboard (because of transit issues) and i didn't even get what was advertised."
5,One of the very few PS2 keyboards. It also has multimedia keys. No problems in one month of usage.
1,The keyboard is not working.  The keys are not working.  Waste Product.  May be duplicate product.  I tried for replacement of the product but it is not allowing. My money is wasted.  I never thought such good product would perform like this.
5,"Using this keyboard I am writing this review. I am very happy to purchase this HP PS2 KeyboardNo technical issue, Buttons are very attractive and sweatable.convenient for typing purposes. it will be very beneficial to me."
5,I am very happy to purchase this HP PS2 Keyboard. Design is very fantastic. Keys are very soft and the PS/2 cord is large for comfortable placement. This is a genuine HP keyboard.
5,"Excellent , highly recommended.Ps2 keyboards are better than usb keyboard.I am fully satisfied"
5,Good product... still ps2 is the best then usb in modern IT world
5,It is a heavy and stable keyboard. Keys are really soft and easy to press on. Wonderful keyboard and much much better than USB keyboards. The material is really solid and will not break easily.
5,Keyboard looks fine and I can finally wake my pc from cold boot which usb keyboard are unable to do.
5,"Keyboard is so strong weight is around 1 kg wire lenght is good, key pressing is so soft, without any noise. But warranty is unknown. If every body want ps/2 keyboard go for it blindly."

1,"Overall good mouse. One notable difference compared to logitech mouse is, this one is heavy with one battery. Difficult to lift it and scroll cursor while gaming,Update: no standby mode so battery drains very quickly, not sure how this is a highly rated item in amazon"
5,"Recently bought this Wireless Bluetooth mouse in just Rs.799 from Amazon with cashback offer - https://amzn.to/2UDyH2FFrankly speaking, I never switched from Dell Wireless Mouse earlier. But, since the time I'm using Amazon Basics mouse, I'm completely satisfied with its performance.Also, it has various adjustable DPI settings, you can select any DPI level just by pressing 'DPI' button from top of the mouse. DPI levels started from 600, 1000, 1600, 2400, 3600 as mentioned in the description and even you can observe that yourself while moving cursor across the screen.Bluetooth connectivity is great, quick responsive. Really smooth movement. Fits in palm perfectly and no irritation even-if used for a longer period. The scrolling as well as the scroll click is good.Overall, value for money product and really worth. Using this since last 2 years and no regrets whatsoever.MUST buy product if you love your hands/wrists. ;)"
3,"[2nd November 2020]Nothing bad about this mouse except it stopped working after 4 months of use.For claiming warranty I called the given number and the lady told me to email at <cloudtail@blubirch.com> to claim.I Will update this section after they respond.[3rd November 2020]In reply to the previous email, they have asked me for sending a video capturing the device switching on and about the issue.

Happy Shopping!!Regards,Team Cloudtail-------------------------------------------------------------------------"
1,Worst product ever. I just trusted Amazon basics and stuck with this as there is no refund policy. Even though if I want to replace it with wireless version of this. Which might have better scroll and possibly less sound.No value for money. Absolutely worthless. Don‚Äôt go for this. Buy something else.
1,Cheap qualityVery cheap plasticNo customer supportAmazon basic : but Amazon customer care gives you the phone number of some other customer who dont pick your call or disconnect it
2,"The mouse looks good, and follows the shape of your hand (right handed). But not confortable to work with for long... it sometimes makes right click by it self... not easy to select or click on small icons as it's not stable... it became so irritating and tiring to use this mouse... I believe it's better to spend a lil more and buy a good branded mouse."
4,I've only had it for a day but I'm already liking it. At this price point it's hard to find a mouse with front/back buttons and a sensitivity control button. The mouse also feels good in the hand. Overall really good.Edit: over three months now and it still holds up to the early impressions.
5,"I am giving my review after 20 days of using this mouse, and I must say this is good and value for mouse. It feels big in hand and good to use. Earlier I was using Microsoft mouse and it is big from that one."
3,"A great mouse if you have smaller hands, but if you have larger hands like me, it's quite uncomfortable. Although not as per my standards, it's a decent and workable.The sensors don't switch off after a certain amount of inactivity, which is off-putting. Cheaper mice nowdays have that functionality which could aid in battery saving as well as accidental clicking.Although a decent mouse, if possible avoid buying."
2,"Mouse worked pretty OK for 3 weeks, but suddenly the sensor is jumpy and unstable, I'm trying to get replacement but Amazon is not allowing it saying return window is closed.The build quality is not upto the mark and inability to get it replaced makes me believe it is better to buy it from a shop with 1 yr warranty."
4,"I opened the package after 15days. It is working in reverse direction. If I move right, cursor goes left. If I move mouse up, the cursor goes down. this is defective and I don't know how to return it.Update: Amazon got it replaced with new one. Appraising the stars from 1 to 4."
5,"Works well. Comfortable to hold. Light weight.The only negative (may be due to the way my Pam touches) is that the placement of the forward and backward button triggers a 'back' occasionally which is a problem for some sites(banks for example) and is an irritant for most other sites.Otherwise, a good one."
5,"The design really fits my hand perfectly. As if it was made to measure. I forget that i am using a mouse- it is that comfortable. However, it is a battery hog. Every now and then,  I keep forgetting to switch it off before going to sleep. Few days like that and the battery is gone. Used like 6 Duracell batteries in 4 months."
1,Useless product. I bought this because amazonbasics always used to provide quality products. But im really unsatisfied. Every time i try to use the mouse after 30 minutes it just stops working.. then i have to again remove it... very bad item.. its just that i have already exceeded the time to return this item as i didnt test it when i received. Now im facing this issue with it..... feels like i lost the money
3,"This was a good upgrade for me from a standard 2 button mouse. The 2 extra buttons increased productivity as I was quick with navigating stuff around and not to mention how helpful it was while gaming.Cheap batteries dont last long in this (maybe 10- 12) days. Alkaline batteries with proper switching off will give you 2.5 months on average.The mouse was indeed comfortable in my small palm and with the heavier alkaline battery it was much more stable. However its laser (its optical) was a bit too sensitive, like it could still provide a weak and laggy input if the mouse was moved after raising ever so slightly. It was annoying at first but I got used to it so as to avoid it.The build is all plastic and I am a bit disappointed. This felt quite cheap and the glossy stuff you see is just glossy plastic. But my grip wasnt that affected.The scroll wheel was quite bad while i was using it as it occassionaly scrolled into the opposite direction(I did try chaning lines / scroll in windows but didnt help).Unfortunately, the mouse started malfunctioning after a severe drop (careless me). Left click now gives input of mouse button 1 and mouse button 5(extremely annoying back button ) and the right click is jammed.However I have another mouse made of harder plastic and It has been around for more than 7 years with drops more than this and it still functions without any problems whatsoever. That is why I recommend spending a bit more for something with a better build."
2,"The mouse is comfortable to hold and looks fancy - those are the only good things about it.It feels very low quality and I doubt its reliability. The clicks are not precise. I have had better cursor accuracy with much cheaper products. It is also very light weight, so it doesn't give a solid feel when I am using it. I almost feels like a cheap plastic toyIf you are planning to use this for general computer use, it suffices. But if want to play games or if your use is going to need more than regular clicks from a mouse - do not go for this."
3,"Pros:2 extra buttonsCheapErgonomic for smallish handsCons:Buttons are of bad quality, cheap sounding and feelingScroll wheel rattles in placeScroll wheel has no side pushThere is no way to program the buttons to your needs, and they can't even do an undo redo function.Overall dissatisfied with the mouse, invest a little more in the Tecknet M002 2.4Ghz mouse, it's probably worth it."
5,"It is one of the best. Had very low expectation but turned out to be an amazing product. It is Solid, Slightly on a havier side but you really do not feel that in daily use. The side grips are amazing but it is not made of rubber. It is made out of plastic but oddly it feels like rubber when you hold it because of the texture."
1,This mouse is manufactured with extremely inferior materials -- brittle internal plastics that break without provocation. This leaves the mouse unusable.There is no way I can recommend this mouse.
5,Works well and has bo issues while being used.Fits comfortably in your hand and the DPI setting is fantastic snd can be adjusted in the fly depending on the use and its purpose.Good for gaming as well as anything else youd use a normal mouse for.
1,"Reducing rating from 5 to 1.At start, it was perfect...Ergonomic, quick, smooth. After 5 months of use, it's wheel started malfunctioning.Clicks and wheel are basic functions for a mouse, and Can not be accepted to malfunction wihtin 6 months, without any drops or damage."
1,"I bought this in November 2020, and rarely used it. Its the end of April 2021, and I started using it from past 2 days. Till now, I barely used this for 10 days, and the scroller on mouse stopped working. I am upset with this. It is very steardy, and easy to use, but that's true with most of the mice. A good mouse should do sensitive tasks like scrolling properly, which this mouse failed... Please look at Logitech, its the best!!!"
3,"It has been aprox 4 months...the mouse overall is good with good dpi control and accuracy with good connectivity, there is no bluetooth but thats fine. However on my unit the scroll wheel just decides to act weird. Like scrolling down or up is very jumpy, scrolling down makes the page go up and down both i.e, u can't scroll and makes the device unusable...same with scrolling up. Even the scroll button now occasionally works. Rather get a logitech mouse which is more reliable though it may have less features."
2,"1) Firstly, size of the mouse is small so it is not comfortable for long working hours..2) Secondly, dpi settings is not stable in terms of maneuverability, I am unable to point the mouse pointer on a specific spot..3) Thirdly, the mouse pointer stuck many times while moving from point a to b..I have only liked the look and feel of this though the performance is certainly not up to the mark!"
5,"Works as intended. Not high end mouse, not very heavy. But is fair for most purposes - not for high end gaming though. Just one word of caution- the bluetooth receiver is lodged in the cardboard in the package - the way it is lodged, it is easy to miss it. So, keep all the packaging of the mouse with you until it is fully installed !"
1,"I had ordered 2 of these. Both get connected to the same receiver whichever is inserted first into the USB slot i.e both of them work on one same system. Therefore can't use more than one of these in tight sitting arrangements like offices, LAN parties, cyber cafes, meeting rooms, etc."
3,"The ergonomic of the mouse and durability is very good. Only problem with the scroll button which gets damaged in some time. The scroll wheel stops moving/working.Very high prices on Amazon, for almost 1000 there are many other brands with good durable quality."
3,"Good ergonomics, but the cursor keeps jumping. The scroll wheel is not very accurate - the pages don't scroll sometimes, sometimes scroll too much or even worse, scroll in the opposite direction!I didn't realise this issue initially otherwise would have returned the product"
1,"I have bought multiple amazon-basic products, this is the time one which has disappointed me. None of DPI works smoothly.. some time its work very fast and some time its runs in milliseconds breaks/pause... specially if you move move just a little."
2,"Unlike the description, it works very erratically on glass and glossy surfaces. I got it exchanged also, but the performance was consistently poor on aforementioned surfaces."
2,"The mouse is well designed and works well. However, in a couple months the scroller has started to misbehave - it never goes in the direction where you move the scroller. While rest of the aspects of it work well (nice ergonomic structure, look and feel), it has become very frustrating to use it with the scroller not working as it should. Have all but stopped using the mouse now."
1,"I have bought this product couple of months before, it's easy to hold and works great. But the major disadvantage or problem in this problem is battery drain way too quickly. Since I've bought this product I had changed 4 batteries in it. If you want to buy it for office purposes I'd recommend reconsidering your option once."
5,I really love the dpi switching feature in this mouse!  Really good for gaming as well as in photo retouching if you're into that....gets you the control that you need for precise input! And I liked the two navigational buttons on the side which you can use while you're browsing or in your file explorer!....and the built quality is good!
2,Not that good - within 2 months - I am facing problem in scrolling and responsiveness of the mouse.I will prefer to use Logitech Mouse than this.I made a bad choice in this case - I should go for Logitech only
1,Quality is not up to the mark and scroll wheel broken after 10 days of use
5,Quality of this product is great... However there was one thing that I noticed.... I'm 5'9 and for my hand size I felt that its size is a bit small.... Otherwise there's no issue.... worth the money!!
3,"NOT FOR GAMING, although this mouse is good and is dpi changable, but i would not recommend this mouse for gaming because of its light weight.Battery consumption is too much, just within one month i already changed a cell. But for office use and students use, this mouse is great."
2,The middle button stopped working after a month and stopped working completely after 7 months and you have to contact amazon french for warranty support so customer support is also terrable.
5,Am using this for over one year I haven‚Äôt got any trouble with it..And the DPS ore very useful controls the mouse  Yep it is very compact size nice devise..
5,So far I am loving it.Very smooth and weight is accurate.If u spent 10 hours a day on pc then it's a good choice. Very comfortable.
5,"I have got this product today in two day delivery and I paid Rs 80 as delivery charge. And also got some Cashback. Must go for it.Some amazing features like light weight, smooth buttons and convenient for typing purposes."
1,"Orininal c2500 wouldnt be like this, you can check with the original image on ad, and product delivered, the window logo on window key is the way you recognize the product original or copy. better another 200bucks and buy original. rather getting repaired with copy in 6months. and wires are too week, board is not too strong, ill break in one bend. keys will get loose soon..  worst."
5,"i brought for my ofc, its good for the price.Pros: soft, light weight, mouse is ful size and comfortable to hold, easy to clean design.Cons: letters should have been much more darker ( means more brighter white color font)....you can buy for normal use, not for gaming pls....."
1,Pros: Cheap. Simple with no gimmicksCons: The keys are very hard to press. Broke after 6 months some keys not working. Keyboard real model name K45Other Thoughts: To be honest this is the worst keyboard i have used till date. My old acer keyboard was so good it worked for 5+ years and the keys were also so soft. It's a cheapo crap in the name of HP. Avoid at all cost buy something else.
1,"I got a really bad keyboard and mouse. The quality is so bad that the keyboard is not fully flat. It has a curve due to the extreme cheap plastic quality. I was to continue using it due to the urgency but then some of the keys wont work. I needed to press two times. Password wont work and did not know the issue. Horrible product. I returned and got a Logitech combo at same price and no words to compare. Very good build quality, finish and I am sure it will run for several years. May be this HP product is good but what I got is fake mostly."
4,This set I had to get it replaced twice within warranty. I don't know why but  my Keyboard stopped working twice within the warranty period. This is the first time I am experiencing something from HP. Now it is working well and I hope it does so in the years to come. My previous keyboard (also HP lasted 7 years)
3,"The mouse works fine, but the keyboard is made of cheap quality buttons that started getting stuck while typing. The main keys like the shift, space bar and the backspace are the ones that keeps ghosting often. You might want to consider getting another keyboard. Since, the combo was a value for money, I opted for this one. Not worth the problems."
4,"Good professional layout keyboard without any fancy keys. For normal typing, it works well. But, some lengthy keys like spacebar already make some horizontal movements. Need to see the reliability in the long run. HP used to make sturdy keyboards earlier that used to last forever. Going by current standards, it doesn't seem to be the case.Mouse is good. Not much complaints there."
5,"All over good.durability 1year minimum for gaming users..light weight around 200grams.No technical issue, Buttons are very attractive and sweatable in case of typing..you can definitely purchase this combo pack.it will be very beneficial to you."
3,"I have ordered this HP C25000 keyboard &mouse combo on 21st Oct, 2020 at 8pm and received it on 23rd Oct, 2020 by 10:30 am(being a Prime subscriber). Isn't it a swift delivery, yes never had this fast delivery on any ecommerce site.Coming to product:Con's1. Yes it seems to be a copy of original HP C2500 one.2. The key board is small and keys are too short, I am a medium handed persona and I can't type fast using this small keys, if I press one key, it may type two letters. Not at all suggested for office work which have extensive keyboard usage.3. A couple of keys seems to be very loose like both Shift keys, and T and a couple more keys very loose.4. Many said there is not much key tap sound, but it makes considerable noise while typing.Pro's:1. Mouse is big enough and works perfectly awesome.2. Both keyboard and mouse seems to be strong enough to last more than an year.3. Lookwise, stunning. Perfectly designed and apeleaing in looks.4. Brand, but again for me it seems a copycat.Hope this review helps. Thanks."
5,"I use this set with my HP laptop for Work-from-home situation. I have not been a fan of chiclet-keyboard of any non-Mac laptops. So, I wanted a low-cost external keyboard. Ordered this set and it works fine. Touch and feel of keys are good. Of course, that is maybe because I like old-school type of computer keyboards! Overall good experience. Bonus: This Mouse, I am even using it for my MacBook Pro. Mouse works 10 times better than the so called magic mouse from Apple. Lol!!"
3,"Super flexible, feels like a little more force can easily break it. Light though. Better than chiclet i.e. laptop-style keys as these are half-height. Certainly helps in gaming. Do feel a little mushy, and give that feeling like, oh, this is so obviously membrane, and certainly even the cheapest mechanical kb like those redgear/redragon/cosmic byte can beat it in terms of gaming and typing experience. For the price, though, can't really ask more. Spend a little more and do youself a favor, buy the redgear blaze 3."
1,"Hi,After getting this product the key was very smooth and so comfortable to use, but after some time key of the keyboard start becoming jams and now some of the keys also not working...same with mouse, scroll got jamsWill not prefer this product to anyone, if someone cares for their money then he/she should go for another option"
4,Good Product. When i open the box. Space key in missing but its still in the box. i fix it by myself and its wprking properly. Very smooth keys. Mouse is also very comfortable.  functioning is proper. You can buy this . after all good product. I'm using this for typing ot gaming purpose.
1,quality of the keyboard is really lower for a brand like HP. I DOUBT IF ITS ORIGINAL.you really need to press the keys harder for the data to be captured. please dont buy this product.
2,"I ordered it by mistake, very flimsy product..finishing is very bad...no special function keys...Mouse is also looking ugly and both are not a durable ones...Please consider a different one if you are planning for a long term usage guys..."
5,600Rs ka mila. Sabse achhi baat Mouse kya kam karta hai...rubber grip for scroll is the best thing.2. Size of the mouse is best no other mouse as it is.3. Senstitvity of mouse is fabulous.4. Light weight.5. Keys of keyboard is so smooth even after rough and tough condition.Over all great product
5,Good prodect keys of keyboard are soft and mouse is excellentLoved it thanks Amazon üòóüòó
2,It is so noisy and flimsy. You will feel typewriter effect while using. Not for office use. Wasted money on this.I wanted to return but there is no such option.Bought another dell keyboard - kb216p. Very satisfied with that.
5,Using this keyboard I am writing this review. If you don't like to press buttons really hard and want to buttons to be fast n responsive then this is the best keyboard for the job. I am using this key board for 2-3 months give me plsr.
4,"Good for daily use...with my Dell laptop. Using since last 11 months, no issues"
1,"Keys feedback is hard and rough. You don‚Äôt get nice feedback when typing, always tend to recheck on the screen for what you have typed. Price is also not that cheap. For average users only. Not recommended for regular typing activity."
1,"Never buy this keyboard. Most of the keys started sticking just in a month's time. Could not see a return option otherwise returned it. Keyboard seems good appearance wise and mouse had no problem.Especially space bar, enter and backspace keys are problematic, they dont have proper response. as they go sticky and stuck."
5,"I am learning to type and was looking for a keyboard of mid range, between 600 to 1000. This one serves the purpose beautifully. The keys, plastic feel and built quality of the mouse and the keyboard are very good and satisfactory. I am happy with the purchase. It's a genuine product. Don't hesitate and go for it if you want one for mostly typing and office work."
1,"Bogus ... No response from HP ...faulty keys... and no body responding ...HP service center only sent ( no of time E Mail done)  thank u for writing us ... embarrassing that no replacement mail or message or call even if faulty product and product under Warranty , will Amazon take any action with HP to solve my issue ???"
5,"Got tired of battery replacement/charging worries.. So, chose this as companion for a gift to a niece. Just add a USB hub in the path, so that just one single USB jack needs to be fit into the laptop. Optical mouse - get a non-jazzy good mousepad."
2,"The mouse is too small but working fine and clicks good and is very responsive. I didn't like the low quality keyboard which will bend when you press slightly. Not very responsive and doesn't feel like a decent quality keyboard. Zebronics keyboard was way better than this. don't buy seeing the ""hp"" branding. I am using the zebrronics keyboard now."
5,It's been 2 years since I'm using this keyboard I have got no issues it's working perfectly fine ..I don't play games on PC so I don't know if there is requirement for specific keys to play games efficiently if not then it's build quality is good enough to use it roughly so you can surely play games.
1,The keyboard stopped working after a month and it is not heavily used also.Not sure whether this is a original or duplicate product or a defect piece.The wired mouse is working well until now.
5,Best keyboard and mouse combo in this price .Not for gaming but awesome for daliy and light use . i have played some games on it . it is okay not for professionals  butdurable
1,"Both the products, the mouse and keyboard are pathetic. The mouse doesn't work at all. It freezes frequently and the keyboard keys being pressed once automatically types the letter unlimited times as in a case where a key gets stuck. Totally disappointed and I can't even replace the product. Seems like this was not an original product being sent."
1,after 2 months use the keyboard got damaged and the service center is 50 KIM away.for me its better to buy a new keyboard than going to the service center for a new one 2 times.Do not buy this.
1,"I just received before day of lockdown and started WFH with this keyboard first one month absulutely fine but starting of second month two important keys(ENTER AND SHIFT)stopped working.Keyboard is not durable, we can spend one or two hundred more and can buy other brands which are durable."
5,"The typing experience is very nice. The tactile feedback is very good. At this price, This is an excellent choice and the keyboard has volume up/down and mute controls which is very convenient. value for money and very soft keys and very smooth operation also."
5,Best keyboard and mouse combo from HP. Best performance I purchased 679 rupees
5,"The keyboard is great with keys making minimal noise. They are not soft keys but it didn't matter to me as much. Overall works well. The mouse functions as expected, clicks fine and the mouse pointer movement is accurate. Overall great product."
5,Good quality keyboard and mouse. The built quality is really good and the performance is up to the mark with no lags.
5,Keyboard quality is very good ....Buttons are very smooth ...Weight less product ...Mouse is very good quality & smoothly working ...overall very good product ...I am totally satisfied to by this product ....
5,"It's really amazing.No issues at all.Surely go for it, and I purchased it around 800-900rs, Its worth."
1,Cheapest build quality I have ever seen in keyboard and mouse. Okay price is less but why this product is so so so cheap build. They should have used better material and kept price little higher
5,Good for gaming and fully mechanical includes extra switch
5,"This is one of the best gaming keyboards, for a great price. It has a good feel to it. :D"
5,BEST MECHNICAL GAMING KEYBOARD FOR BEST PRICE WITH RED KEYS I LOVE RGB IT LOOKS TOO GOOD üëç BUY IT IF ANYONE NEED OF IT WORTH MONEY ‚ù§
4,Product is good. Keys are responsing quickly after pressing. Only issue is packaging is very bad. 0 star packaging. Electronic items should be packed with bubble packing. Box was opened. Very bad packaging.
5,Works perfectly and solved purpose. Ideal to attach with a gaming keyboard.
5,Handy product
5,Gr8
5,Works really nicely with my dell Laptop
5,Works perfectly well with my mac book pro. No additional installation needed.

5,very good product within good price.
5,It's good and easy to use product
5,Good product
4,Clean and smooth. Very nice product.
4,"Price is high, quality build is good, Perfect fitting in my Dell Inspiron, must go for it. If found in local shop it's price will be low"
4,"This is a long term review and I am doing it since Amazon asked me. Bottom line is for the price it is one of the best ""gaming"" keyboards you can buy. I bought this keyboard around 2 months ago and it's still working fine with few minor or negligible problems.For detailed information keep readingFirst of all, the keys are not mechanical as they might seem. The actuation force is a bit high for a gaming keyboard, which means the keys need to be pressed a bit hard to register. Typing is fine, but could've been better since I've worked on more affordable keyboards and they type better. And also I would like to point out that the keys are painted and the paint is fading off (I've attached a picture, check it out). This has brought me down because now the keyboard looks cheap and shabby. I use the keyboard for gaming, so the keys I pressed the most are WASD, LShift, Ctrl, Space bar, and Tab. In one of the pictures that I attached, you can see 'A' and 'D' are already faded like they've been scrape out.Now the lighting effect. The lighting effects are good. There is quite a number of modes you can switch to (video attached). However, the keyboard is base lit and not key lit, which means the lights are not inside each key but is placed in the base of the keyboard and spread out throughout the keyboard. Key lit keyboards are better for readability in low light condition but you will not have a hard time using this keyboard in the same condition, either.Lastly, the build quality. The keyboard is completely made of plastic. Not too bad, but there is a lot of flex which makes it easy to break if you put some force to it. But I know you're not looking forward to put pressure on the keyboard with your dumbbells or any thing that's heavy, and since you're gonna be using it for gaming, the build quality should bother neither me nor you.Here's my verdict, for a thousand bucks you can't go wrong with this keyboard. It has decent keys, pretty good lighting effects, decent build quality, and oh I forgot to mention one more important thing, some of the keys have anti-ghosting feature which means if you press them all simultaneously, they will all register which is very important in gaming and you do not find this feature in conventional keyboards. This is a deal maker for me. However, I am not sure which all keys support this, but the keys I use most often which I mentioned above support anti-ghosting so I have no complaint and neither will you."
4,"1st review (the day of the delivery)I'm going to be honest; I was kind of scared when I read the reviews because most of the people were giving negative and bad reviews about it.Those who gave negative reviews had one of these problems -1) Improper packaging and wrapping2) Bad handling by the delivery executive3) Damaged/removed keys4) Lighting options not working5) Broken base/ some of the keys not workingNow, if you're reading through the reviews and are about to move on to the next keyboard then wait and read this one.I'm going to talk about the keyboard in detail, including all the features, it's pros and cons.The first thing I did as I got the keyboard was to check every key if it's working correctly or not, and they all were (sigh of relief).First, the delivery and service :The order arrived two days early, thanks to the Amazon team. I bought the keyboard in a lightning deal (Rs. 880), which was even more reason to be scared because the lightning deals are infamous for delivering defected and used products. But mine looked good as new and felt terrific. I got the hang of it quickly.Second, the packaging :The packaging was intact and adequate. There was a cardboard covering on the outside and then the box of keyboard itself.Inside the box, the keyboard was covered and protected safely and adequately. So overall, the packaging was fine.Third, the feel and build quality :The keys are lifted, as mentioned in the description, and require less pressure to press them (it being a membrane keyboard and all). The keys do make a clickity sound, but it will not be even close to a mechanical keyboard sound, so don't keep your expectations too high.The build quality is where the keyboard loses points. The plastic used to make the keys and the body feels cheap and not premium at all.Also, talking about sturdiness, the keyboard is NOT as sturdy as mentioned in the description. It has a lot of flex in it, and the whole seems weak in terms of toughness and durability. But if you don't have a lot of traveling to do with the keyboard (in which the keyboard might break or something), then you don't have a lot to worry about since the keyboard will sit there with your system.The rubber feet under the keyboard hold it in place and it also has a kind of flippable stand under which can be used to lift the keyboard from behind.Fourth, the lighting modes :It has nine lighting modes that are bright enough to look cool even in daylight and the brightness can be changed.They can be changed by pressing Fn+(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). I will include images and videos for each lighting mode.You can change the speed of transitions by Fn+(-,+) and the level of brightness by Fn+(page up, page down).It has one unique feature, which I liked - the sound-sensitive lighting, which can be activated by Fn+9. It has a built-in microphone that picks up the sound in its surroundings, and the keyboard reacts accordingly. This effect looks really cool and is just amazing.Lastly, the multimedia keys :Fn+(F1-F12) Include - one media key (opens the music app), 3 volume keys (up, down and mute), 4 music control keys (play/pause, stop, previous and next), one button to open mail app, one home button (works differently depending on the app open), one lock key (locks the PC), and last calculator button.The description says that it has a 19-key rollover, which I tested and it IS true and they claim to be having 10M keypresses, so let's hope that turns out to be true as well.Overall the keyboard is a steal for Rs. 880, with the only drawback being the negligible sturdiness. If you want to buy a cheap RGB keyboard with lots of fun lighting modes, then go for it, it even has a one year warranty, so if anything goes wrong, you can always contact the manufacturer.Sorry if the review got a bit too long, but I was very confused when I wanted to buy it and I want to help others to clear out their doubts about this keyboard.This is a really early review and I will update it if I notice any changes in it.Peace ‚òÆThree months update-The keyboard is working fine. There are a few cons I discovered after the prolonged use.-It catches dust like a lot of it. So it requires cleaning the keys every week.-One of the letter (D) is starting to fade. The printing is not very good, and it's only after three months, so I'm guessing it's going to get much worse after this.Other than that, everything seems fine and the keyboard is working like it's supposed to. All the lighting modes are functioning well."
2,This keyboard not a good quality. In my case after 3 months keyboard is not working properly and I am very thankful for cosmic byte team. I am call the customer service of Amazon and they are give me a contact number of cosmic byte team. I am calling them to ask if my problem with this keyboard. The customer service is very good. Customer service will return this keyboard and they said it was faulty ic or circuit them afterthe 15 days he is replaced the keyboard but the in my case this keyboard is not available in India. I am change the keyboard to another keyboard for cosmic byte the model no is CB-GK 03 Black Eye to cut my old keyboard price and after paying amount to pay on the delivery. I have 2 star of the keyboard but I'm give it 5 Star for cosmic byte service center team. Good work.
5,"I'm using the keyboard since near 2 months . I'm running on windows 10 . The picture i uploaded is in the broad day light . so , i hope the people who's gonna purchase this keyboard does't have to worry about in the night time . The working conditions of my key board are , when it's not using the back light turn's off , when the system is in snooze or paused in gaming time's key board blinks and light's are stable while using . These are the things i felt using the product.  Now i'm only looking forward to the durability of the key board. I paid 812 Rs/- for this product. Comparatively cheaper with the competitor's in the market also. :-)"
2,"I liked the RGB effect when it worked that is, which it didn't half the time as the lights kept turning off for hours. Very unreliable product received. The front panel was damaged and numpad delete key was missing the membrane support. Otherwise the keys are nice and soft. Its a good cheap rgb keyboard if everything worked. But I won't recommend buying this at all."
4,"I did not buy this keyboard for gaming. I am a programmer and I have to write thousands of lines of codes at a go. Previously, I used the keypad of my laptop for typing but I wasn't feeling comfortable using the inbuilt keypad because I could not type very fast on the laptop as I always had a fear of jamming any key of the keypad. And you may know that replacing a laptop's keypad is very expensive. Hence, I decided to buy an external keyboard. While buying the keyboard, I considered mainly three points which were 1) the keyboard must have back-lit keys so that i can type in the night without turning the room lights on and disturbing others sleep,  2) the keyboard needed to be sturdy and 3) it must have adjustable height. At first, I decided to consider keyboards from reputed brands like Logitech but I realized that they were extremely expensive and would be an overkill for my needs. After that I came to know about this keyboard from CosmicByte. It had all the features which I had been looking for and luckily it wasn't expensive at all ! That's why I purchased this keyboard from Amazon at about 1.2k and after using it for some days, I must say it is quite good. I am listing down the pros and drawbacks of this keyboard below,> Pros1. It has 7 different LED colours and nine different modes ! You can even adjust the brightness of the LEDs and customize the illumination pattern. The LEDs are very bright and I can assure you that even reputed and expensive brands like HyperX, Corsair, Kingston do not have higher brightness than this one. Clearly, LED back-lighting is its biggest plus point.2. The height of the keyboard is adjustable and that's a good thing. It has four rubber pads on its back side to keep it firmly fixed on its place.3. The keys are scratch resistant.4. The cable is braided and super sturdy hence no chance of getting torn down due to folding.>Now, let's talk about its drawbacks,1. The keys are not that sturdy. It is still okay for typing but I seriously doubt about gaming. Although the keys look like mechanical ones but they aren't. if you are considering this keyboard for gaming then I would suggest you to avoid this.2. No dedicated media playback buttons.So the bottom-line is this is really a great, value for money keyboard if and only if you want super duper LED back lighting effect and comfortable typing for long sessions. However, this isn't a good gaming keyboard as the keys are not that sturdy and I seriously doubt how long it can last with heavy gaming.One last point, although this isn't about this keyboard. This is about packaging from Amazon. Amazon packed the product very poorly. They didn't wrap it with any bubble wrap or air pillows and shipped it directly within a plastic sack ! This type of poor packaging from Amazon is really a bad thing. I hope they improve their shipping standards."
1,"This keyboard advertises 19 anti ghosting keys but it is just sweet talk to point towards the fact that not ALL keys work.For all you gamers out there, please note that that this keyboard will not register the W,Q and A keys together. Which basically means that you will NOT BE ABLE TO PEEK WHILE MOVING DIAGONALLY. Similarly, W, E and D will not be registered together. For a keyboard which advertises itself as a gaming keyboard with N-key rollover, this was a HUGE disappointment. Suggest you to spend a little more money and go for actual well-known vendors because cosmic-byte is only here to fool you all."
4,"I got the keyboard replaced with a another brand new one by amazon & seller - thanks for that. Previous keyboard had issue with W & Shift key it was hard to press.Pros:Rgb lightning, with 7 color different color option, various light effects is a +, feels solid while press which is good for gaming, build is tough & not flimsyBetter than redgear keyboards in this budget. Even its the only good option in this budget.Cons:Keys are hard to press & painful while playing for long hours.Hand rest is not there so no place to rest your palm while typing or gaming for long time"
1,"So I bought this product since my previous keyboard was also from cosmic byte and I was pretty comfortable with it. I was very comfortable with this product, the lighting was also pretty and except the space bar, every key was sturdy. However, after 2 months of use the keyboard stopped working randomly. I tried to claim the warranty but they replied by saying that they cant do anything since the product is out of stock and will not be available until the end of September. Fraud for money, 0/10 Customer Service and reliability. Would not recommend this keyboard at any possibility."
2,"Dont buy if you are a coder/type a lot.It was my experience after one month of 9 hours a day using it.This keyboard is nice looking like a truck in RGB mode.but on reality side you will hate it using in rainbow mode. It irritates while working. I used the static color blue or white while working in dark room.But after 1 month. I am done with it. That rgb thing is just a fancy thing which you will not use until you are recording video or posting instagram snap or some friends are with you in the room to boast it. Else üò∂Its waste. Atleast I didnt use RGB ever.Talking about typing experience. I am a professional developer and I have to type a lot. Using this keyboard initially was okay, I tried to adjust myself. But after a month fingers started paining. Keys are hard to press. Membrane keyboard is not made for coders. Go for a mechanical keyboard if you use keyboard to type more than 5 hours a day. Else this keyboard is fine for excel and basic stuff ( gaming too).Cant use it or return it anymore. It will go in cupboard nothing else. üòä Wasted but learnt a lesson. Will use it maybe in future when mechanical keyboard sound is not required. Thanks for reading"
5,I was looking for a budget keyboard with RGB backlight to step up my setup and then I came across this product. In my view this keyboard is very close to perfect (for the price).PROS-1.Highly customisable RGB lighting which no other keyboard offers at this price range!2.Good click feeling..even though not mechanical.3.Long braided usb cable.CONS-1.Keyboard should have been working raised at angle to make it more ergonomic.2.The red back looks really cheap!CONCLUSIONI would definitely recommend this keyboard
5,First of all to cosmic byte plese make specific area to get reviews  in Amazon all of keyboards reviews are mixed up..And to you who is reading cb gk 02 corona is a great keyboard with engraved letters and good rgb for price..If you don't have budget to buy more than 1200 then this keyboard is for you.And if you are buying this for traveling plese don't this keyboard could  break under 5-10kg load so take one cheap keyboard which is unbrekble..
5,"The keyboard is certainly good looking and as shown in th images.Pros: Bright lit and readable keys.-Accurate key stroke are registered-I would say when it comes to gaming this is at par with some of the expensive keyboards.- Multi Color LEDs with 9 preset modes- Braided cables which is a only available on premium keyboard. It's a mark of a quality keyboard.Cons: No arm rest which makes it a pain to use this for longer hours.- The Led modes are preset and they cannot be saved so each time you turn on your PC you have to select your previously set mode again.- Prone to collecting lot of dirt as there is log of gap between the keys.But despite the cons I love the keyboard. It's one sturdy keyboard. If you are on a budget, but want to have a premium keyboard experience then go for this one."
3,"My cousin bought this keyboard and i tested his out its RGB colors look very pretty and was convinced to buy it, but when it arrived the box was damaged and when i saw the keyboard, it was opening even though the screws were there, had it replaced and even the replaced version of the keyboard was damaged, this shows how well they handle the package, i'm returning the product as of now, guys if you want to buy this keyboard I recommend to buy it on their website which is cosmic byte, the guys in amazon do not know how to handle the product, this is the first time i've had a bad experience with amazon through may years as being a regular customer."
1,The back lit leds seemed pretty good....Just then my eyes fel in the bottom part of the keyboard...The screw joints were broken... Ya that's right... I egarly waited for this keyboard to be delivered.... But I had nothing but a handfull of disappointment... I don't know who's fault is this is that the courier service or the product was damaged from the first... But I'm very disappointed.... üòë
5,"after a month of use i can say it's just awesome, too good.. key travel is more than my old intex one which is actually good, it is somewhat prone to catching dust under the keys, not too big of a deal since it's fairly easy to clean blowing air or using tweezers or removing the keys.. i would have liked a computer sleep hotkey but no big deal, can still use the windows shortcuts but they are like 4 key presses.. windows+D then alt+f4 then arrow up then enter.. love the lighting and control options.. it doesn't remember the light settings once the computer is turned back on that might be good actually.. takes anywhere from 1 to few keystrokes to get to the desired setting. this is in no way a mechanical keyboard but it's far better than the membrane keyboards we typically use.. sits somewhere in the middle.. spillproof too, there are 3 water drain holes at the bottom, you can see right through them. i didn't have any issues with the key prints fading off yet and it feels like the paint layer is substantial when i touch trying to feel how thick the paint is, quiet thick i would say.. having said all this, it still gets no less than 5 stars from me.. there is no other keyboard even close to the price with backlit rgb and this many lighting options that looks so dam cool.. nothing beats it.. I'd say go for it!"
1,"I received the product on time.Keys are soft & good.Backlighting is amazing, with multiple options.So far working good.Wouldn't say it's the best choice for gaming, but it isn't the worst @ this price rangeupdate after 45 daysKeys y-p, alt stopped working.Disappointed"
4,"this is just an attempt to find out what typing on this thing feels like.The tactile feedback is pretty good, however the end is a bit soft. So it's good-bad.The overall feel of typing is pretty good though.The keys aren't too hard to press, they are spaced well enough.The shape of the enter key is a bit different from what I'm habituated to, but that's not an issue.The backlighting is pretty good. It comes with a direct on-off switch, and has 3 levels of intensity adjustment.Note: this is a blue LED only model. The direct LED on-off key is very handy instead of having to toggle through the settings.The risers on the bottom aren't too tall, so they don't give the keyboard much of an angle.Overall, it's a very good keyboard, but not one particularly aimed at gamers.It's essentially just a normal keyboard with some backlit keys."
5,"The most best keyboard in the price range. The build quality is good not the great. And it has 9 lighting RGB effects which is eye-catching. I love this keyboard. And some reviews says that the text is fading after long use that is totally wrong. I am using for 3-4 months and i plays always fps games like pubg , call of duty , counter strike. Etc. In this case i use W A S D SHIFT keys offen in my case it long lasting and the test not faded. The best keyboard under rs1200 and you can go for it.  Now it is currently unavailable in Amazon but you can try in cosmic Byte website. Best buy for my PC upgrade."
4,"I  typed for long time with this and yes I feel real comfort. I don't need press hard which cause hand pain for long time typing. Also the backlit effect helps a lot to work at night at office. At this price plastics quality is not that good, if I press hard at middle sometimes it bends. Also the shape of enter key little bit troubling me but as a whole worth buying it."
4,"I bought the red variant for 1139‚Çπ on 12.08.2020.First impressions :Built quality:Average, but not a concern for most of them. There is little to no flex while typing. Back red casing looks cheap, but rest are OK. Keys print quality also seems ok, but the plastic keys feel cheap compared to my previous logitech keyboard priced around 1000‚Çπ.Gaming:Played pubg for 1hr, no ghosting issues found, also responsive. Lighting is good and keys also get lit up. Only 2 color modes for the single colour variant: normal and breathing.Productivity and general usage :Here is where this keyboard falls behind. Since it is marketed as a gaming keyboard, it's OK but the typing experience is not that great. You will take some time to get used to it. On my first day of usage, i felt myself making more errors while typing. This all accounts on the key shape and feel. I felt the keys where quite boxy and slippery compared to my old logitech one.Packaging and delivery:This is the worst part. The product packaging was bad and dusty.No date of manufacture printed on the box. Also no serial number printed on the box to identify the product's genuineness. Also the amazon box was torn open and the keyboard box could be seen through when it arrived. Thankfully the keyboard was OK and no minor scratches or defects were found. Disappointed with amazon delivery and seller in this part.This was my first impressions on this keyboard. I felt it is slightly overpriced. Should have been around 800-1000rs.Will update my review after 1 week of extensive usage"
4,"Warnings!!!!!.Cb-gk-08...This keyboard has only rainbow effect only,no other color effects...Brought it on: 29/12/2019Pro:Sturdy buildGood key press( sound not as much as a mechanical but it will do the job)Good rgb brightnessGood packagingBraided cablePrice is low (799)Con:Only rainbow effect(i thought it was full rgb but only Rainbow effect .One key combination swap the aswd keys to arrow keys(haven't found what key combination to undo it)"
5,"Everything Is Perfect So Good For The Money. Lighting is so awesome you can see in my video. Braided Cable for More Durability. Feels like mechanical keyboard but won't hear that much ""tak tak"" sound. You have to press Keyboard keys are little bit harder because if you don't then it will send 2 or 3 signal at a time happens with every membrane keyboard. 7 color RGB light 10 Themes with Frequency Changing and Brightness Control. That more than enough good.Only complain is that the Keyboard key printing is average like normal cheap keyboards."
3,Pro:1.Brought form 716 RS2.Only keyboard with decent backlights3. ALPHABET are visible at nights BIG DEAL4. Doesn't gives a cheap look of rgb colour mix5. Good side protection and red light at edges.6. 3 variable brightness adjustmentsCons:1. Single colour2. A bit costlier for single colourOver all better than RGB as pink and green or red are not that good as per my preference  or the combination of those neither breathing lights are useful but just marketing stuntQUITE WORTH !!
3,"The keyboard is good and all, but the keys won't last very long... Its a membrane keyboard, so the keys will get softer as time passes. But after lightly using it for around a month, the keys are already very soft... If you like soft keyboards then you may not face a problem. But for those who like tactile keyboards, just get a mechanical keyboard or get a different membrane keyboard. This keyboard is good for typing, but not good for gaming.."
3,"Alright I'll be honest. When the delivery guy first delivered it, the package was kind of ""squished"" and dented near the lower left corner (depends on how you see it) but the keyboard box was still in shape so it was only the external packaging. Lucky :v. It kinda looked like they just picked it up from their store room as if it was sitting there since like 3 or 4 months getting all dusted because I could notice the settled dust on the keyboard box. The keyboard works just fine anyway tho it's only been 2 days since I am using it. Tried all the RGB effects and it is just as mentioned in the user manual or description. The Del key on the numeric keypad looks 3% faded just 3% :v. Tho I hope the other keys don't start fading after heavy usage hmmm. That's all for now."
1,"One of the worst keyboards ever. The antighost keys never register properly. Dont ever use it for gaming. When you are using mutliple keys (for a game like fifa), all the keys wont register properly and you can certainly feel the lag. Have to press the keys years before to get the proper move. Only the lights in the keyboard are as advertised. I have used a no. of keyboards (wired and wireless) and even if this is a wired one, it dont have the response of a bluetooth keyboard."
1,All the lighting effects are working fine but the keys are not working didn't expect this from cosmic byte worst feeling everüò¢üòî. The main box had tape on top of the seal not the Amazon box but the keyboard's box. Very disappointed. Inside it even had a old bill.
3,"packaging was damaged. But keyboard was ok.Backlit are fine and bright enough.You can control brightness, color and other functions of backlit.Lights also can be reactivate according to sound.But major problem i am facing is that with keystrokes,Back key and some other key r jamming. You need to press back key from center otherwise you will face jamming while you pressing the key.Btw its my 1st rgb keyboard with gaming look.I used to use simple 500rs keyboards.In future will try to use mechanical."
5,"It's a must have keyboard, Love it's various modes & is useful in no-light conditions. Always wanted to have a back-lit keyboard for my laptop; wonderful to program various colours & speeds of lighting."
5,"Bought it 2 days ago and so far I'm impressed with the keyboard. At this price the features are pretty great. The keys are elevated and some of you might take a few days adjusting to it. The anti ghosting feature is also present which is a must if you play games. Regarding the build, so far it appears to be sturdy. I'll update the review in a few months if any issue comes up.P.S.: if it has been a few months since this review was written, there has been no issue at all. (12 July 2020)"
5,"I'm alot happy since I got this product. I won't say this best in this price range cause if you spend nearly 2-3K you've still not close to get this kind of product.Pros.7 Color backlit with effectsYou can select any of color as constant to work on.You can select different rgb patternsin different part of keyboard.The amazing thing is you can set your own color from given 7 in any of keyboard part which is user defined mode provided by this keyboard.Voice control over backlit works more accurate.Functions given with short cut like calc, mail etc.No need of install any driverConsI haven't found any cons but a plastic body and not of aluminium needs more care to be taken since it is obvious in this price range.Go for it. Will worth your single penny."
4,"Best keyboard I have ever used , not recommended for people who want mechanical keys, because it is totally different from mechanical keyboard and membrane keyboards, it gives some different feel while gaming, it's response time is very good, and the brightness of RGB is good not very much bright. It has voice detection RGB mode which is a good feature in this keyboard which is present in ‚Çπ3000 and above keyboard. I only recommend thes IF YOU HAVE LOW BUDGET FOR BUYING KEYBOARD (BELOW ‚Çπ 1500) otherwise u can buy cb-gk-12 which is little bit expensive but it is worthy ü§óü§ó"
5,"The reason I bought this was for programming and gaming. This has sufficed my expectations. RGB isn't one of the best features of the keyboard. But let's face it, the only time it is used is when you take a picture or to show-off to people. Otherwise, personally, it is more of a disturbance rather than an interesting feature of the keyboard. But you can always turn it off. So that's a win-win.The overall key handling, typing experience, mechanical feel, gaming experience, sensitivity is so damn perfect for the price especially. Got it for 700 bucks. It is really a good purchase if your budget is low and you are not looking into using it that heavily. Once you get the hang of it, you will stick to it. Go for it then?"
5,Good product considering the price. Gives a mechanical feel when you type on it. In my opion an average user can also buy it. Not sure about gaming cause I am not that much into gaming. Overall a good package.I got it around 700 rupees. If you are getting it in that price point then it's a steal....The only con that I have is that you can't change the colors....which is annoying sometime....also I feel the default brightness is too harsh..... Although you can change the brightness levels...
3,using this keyboard for almost 1 year. my use is heavy and for gaming only. the keyboard is of good quality but the lettering on some buttons are faded after 1 year of use. I had some issue within 6 months of use. some keys were stopped working so I gave it to repair to cosmic byte repair center under warranty. service was good and fast. they did something I don't know what but it's ok now. so service is good. its good product but not perfect its good for its cost.update : used this for 1 year and 4 months of regular heavy gaming use and its dead now. some keys are not working. and base broke in half all attached screws are broke. quality issue.
4,"Been using this keyboard for a while now and I have not faced any issues with this for now.However, The only thing annoys me is that the the flippable stand on back of the keyboard does not stay in place. so you have to adjust it every time to lift the keyboard a little up or down.Apart from this go for this"
3,I have used this keyboard for a total of 5 days and my experience went from good to eh.Below I'm mentioning my experienceThe RGB would look great in beginning till you won't habitual to it.The keys become wobbly after heaving usage like typing and gaming and make noise even on light touches.Doesn't have gold plated usb.Has braided cable!The keyboard appears great online but the plastic is weak and keys may stop working if pressed hard enough.The only point of buying it is the RGB keys that's allReturning it
5,Best keyboard in this budget... There are more expensive keyboard than this keyboard.. But this one is a lot better than them... Key pressing feedback is awesome.. Customizable light.. 9 types of default lighting effect... Build quality is also very good and strong..
4,"its is not the old version,its the new version of keyboard,and doesnot have the lightning features like it used to have in older ones.Overall agood keyboard for normal usage and can do casual gaming's  not hardcore. Also membrane keyboard cant give u the feel of mechanical keyboard,but gets the work done.It look nice at night and also keys can be removed and cleaned.I dont prefer it to be take along when u travel.keyboard has 3 zone lightning, but no extra effects with brightness controls, plastic body so not very rigid,to be true it doesnt feel like premium, got it for 900 rupees so no complain u cant expect much more in this price range,pretty much job done,decent look at night,bought it cause cosmic byte service is good,,hope it works fine with me also.braided cable is present.Dont get confused like me its a new version,older version used to have fancy lightning with effects.working for me for almost 1 and half month....hopefully last longer."
3,Good Protection to the key board. Fits fine on My Acer Nitro 5Not as Transparent as required.!Now I Cant see my keys without Backlight.Has some concentrated portions over the surface
2,"It's material quality is moderate, but not suitable as, once it get dust it won't fit on keyboard but easy to clean and should be cleaned frequently."
1,It is realy worst...please donot buy this...waste of money...no stickyness at all...no use of putting it on keyboard..and properly transperant too cant see clearly...instead get these things from local shops...doesnt deserve any star
4,"It's a Good product, it's slightly longer than my 15.6inch lap key board(pic attached), but it is doing its duty very well so no prob with it."
1,"When I opened the package, I was shocked.  The product was folded!!  When I put it on my keyboard, the fold mark remains distinctly on the right side just above the numeric keys' area (see pic).  The seller, in trying to save a couple of inches of packing paper, has completely messed up the product.  Also, the product is just a thin translucent silicone rubber sheet, worth not more than Rs. 5.  Adhesion is average.  It is not transparent.  It is milky white in colour.  If you look at the keyboard directly from above, most keys are visible, but from a normal viewing angle of a laptop, we will have difficulties in locating the keys.  After a few days of usage, I discarded the thing.  Don't waste your money on it.  Better go to a local computer shop, look at the available options and then decide.  It is not correct to shop such products on eCommerce portals because of too many unknowns at the time of ordering."
1,I have received keyboard protector which is tampered from one side and the other side looks nice.Not sure about the size. It sticks easily to keyboard giving a perfect protection but one side looks really bad.Thanks
2,If you are a gamer and using your laptop for that purpose you should buy two or there of these because it will rip off after few weeks or months and you would need more.TIP: Buy two of these cover your keyboard with both the protector or you can either fold 1 and place over W A S D keys which we gamers often use that part is very crucial and only that part will rip off so my suggestion to make a double of that protection fold it and place it inside another protector.  Also the adhesive is useless so use your cello tape to fix it. Hope it helps
5,"Hi, I ordered this product from Amazon 6 years back, see the attached screenshot for the order date. I re-ordered this one today. Its very good product. It lasted for me around 5 years and without any issues, I washed it number of times and re-used it. No issues observed for me. It became loose after 5 years of use and got torn at some places so I had to buy new one. I have used very roughly and still lasted long. Now I re-ordered same one, I have extra keyboard and I don't use my laptop keyboard that much, so I have to use this product to keep my laptop keyboard safe & durable. I hope I can make it through more than last time. Thank you for the product. Only sad thing is inside the product its says made in China, last time also it was made in China, Please manufacture in India for India."
3,"Was looking for a temporary fix as the Silicon key guard for my Dell latitude isn't available in Indian thus ecporting the same, needed a temporary fix thusProsThe price pointFor strictly temporary usageConsAvailable in 1 size.Doesn't stick to your machine at llProtection ..... just dust and accidental spill...if the cover is lying on your key pad"
3,"Material is good.Gets dirty very frequently like almost everyday.If no backlight keyboard available, you will face a lot of visibility issue.I have to DIY it, refer the photo"
3,"My laptop does not have a backlit keyboard, in my room, usually, the main light is turned off. However, with this silicon protector, I cannot see the keys at all. Would be great if it was more transparent. So I purchased a USB led light to do the job. Also, it does not stick that great, I use it only when I am not typing, or when I'm away."
1,"Very bad quality product. It's got white patches, making it difficult to read the letters. It's neither fitting the keyboard enough, nor is it sticking to the laptop.Following the instructions is a waste, as there is no sheet that can be removed from the back of the skin."
4,"For the price, this product is very good. However as obvious from the price, this quality is low. It is a plain surface with low quality plastic. But it does the job and prevents dust from accumulating on the laptop keypad."
1,"Delivery was really fast (ordered in evening and product got delivered in morning) but it was returned product from someone, since the cost was 69 only with free delivery hence didn't placed replacement order and keeping it, it is used but surely work for 2 to 3 months after cleaning it properly, it is recommended to purchase such cheaper products locally."
3,"It arrived in time and well packed. A fold on the silicone done during packing buy the manufacturer, remains even after a month. It does not stick well. Opacity is fine to allow keys to be visible. It covers entire keyboard. Thickness is ok. Minimum order quality of 2 is another factor which can be made to 1."
1,"It is company packing but coming with folded in 1/4th of the sheet, which is give a line in because of this there is a gap in the sheet where dust can go in. I have checked it for Dell 5500. it is bit large for this full keyboard (6mm larger than the laptop, 6mm sheet came out of the laptop and disturbing hdmi and usb ports."
5,Thank you AmazonFirst I was confused when I read reviews etcFew people sayingIt‚Äôs Pearl white not transparent oneOnly backlit keyboard laptops keys looking with help of lightOther laptop it‚Äôs juz whiteButI ordered I got transparent one
2,"Product is correct quality for the price. Expectations should be as low as the price.My experience with it, I'll shareProduct is not packed/finished correctly from the manufacturer end.The bend you see in the image that i have attached, is not unfolding, it is stuck like that as if its been heated and pressed hard.While typing on it, it will keep sliding around with your finger by few millimetres or centimetres here and there so you have to adjust it often.It gets lifted too when typing as your finger and this material will have more friction between both than the material and the keyboard"
1,"I purchased one such keyboard protector on 09 December 2016. It was delivered to me on 15 December. I am very disappointed with this purchase. After I unpacked and installed on 21 December 2016, I found that the keys on the keyboard were very poorly visible. I could not work on my laptop at all. I was forced to immediately unistal it. Tridib Ghosh, Kolkata"
5,This is a great product. You can go with it. But if you are thinking to put this on and then type on the keyboard that will make it difficult. I use a usb keyboard hence I do not have have any issues. This product stops dirt and dust entering your keyboard and also protect it from any spill water.
3,"Oversized for my Tuf A15. But it's good. Better to say, not so bad not so good, it can be worked through. The adhesive is quite good and the keys can be pressed efficiently without any mess. Thickness, it's slim, not so thick and shearness is not so impressive but it's fine.Overall product is good for a Standard 15.6 inch laptop nor for a gaming laptop üòÖ"
5,"If you are not finding this in your local shop then for sure purchase it from amazon.I got it in 69 rupees only.I would say according to price its not the best but its very good.There was no any adhesive kind of thing in my cover also i din't replace it .I just sticked it with the help of a black tape on my laptop keyboard and would recommend you to the same or you can use double sided tape if available.For my 15.6 inch it was half inch longer but i managed with ityou will not face too much difficulty in seeing the letters .At last i will recommend it , its very good and provide good protection from dust...."
4,"It does not adhere to the keyboard surface. Also, the transparrency is quite poor, i cannot type with comfort with this on my laptop keyboard. The material is OK and is washable, which is a plus point considering how well it attracts dust."
4,The product is good. But can be improved. It gathers dust very quickly since it's silicone and washing it off is a problem as the dust sticks to it. Moreover the cover is too opaque and it's hard to see which keys are being pressed. Even with a backlit keyboard I find it hard to see the buttons. Rest all is fine but this product is still useful but also  has a lot of scope to improve.
4,"I recommend the keyboard skin protector.It adhers just fine on the keyboard, I tested, it does not move or fall off of the keyboard so serves the purpose.The sheerness could have been better because without the keyboard back light the world and not much visible.I am happy with the thickness. You cannot feel it through the keyboard while typing and that is good üëçüèª"
2,Silicone cover seems to have been packed a long time back. Lost the coercive property to paste itself on laptop keyboard
5,"Yes it is not that Visible ( Somewhat invisible).Due to so much dusty environment, I was looking for something cheap secure, and maintainable solution. Somehow I ended up looking at this and believe me you will not regret buying this.GO FOR IT BEST SOLUTION FOR DUST AND DURTY HANDS FOR YOU  LAPTOP."
5,"Product as expected,got it for 69 rs for 15.6 inch laptop with num keys.Fitting is nice, grips the keyboard nicely and does its work of protecting the keyboard from dust and surprise liquid spills.So i am relaxed now, and happy with this productDelivery was also fast in ongoing pandemic."
2,"Cudnt use for even less than a month. The product says it can be reused and washable. Well guess what, it wouldnt even stick to the keyboard properly n kept moving. Thought would wash (i knw it was dumb) thinking maybe it may get some adhesiveness but nothing."
3,Definitely not for the people who have laptops with no backlight. I can barely see the keys through the cover when my backlight is off. Good for people who wanna practice typing cuz you cannot see the keys so you gotta guess haha.
5,"Totally worth the pricePeople are just dumb üòëWhat else you expect from a product worth ‚Çπ69 (that too delivered to your door) , a gold sheetThe job of this product is too prevent the keyboard from dust, and it is doing that job succesfully"
1,Its not fit on 16in laptop keyboard as I have lenovo ideapad its way bigger for this key board and there is no good look to.
1,Very bad product not working but seller is good I have purchased my laptop from this seller and that was awesome I know we should not always judge the seller by products as some products are already cheap and bad quality I returned it.
3,Should've been proved somewhere around 60-80..I guess this is the cost one pays while buying things online..I have brought accessories like these for almost half the price from local stores
5,"It the perfect product.As i am a gamer due to sweating my keyboard keys get dirty like in every 2 days, the sweat white spots stick to the keys that's why i bought thisADHESION IS PERFECTFor those who are saying the Adhesion go after sometime, it's because of dust particles, just wash it with water and it becomes new and perfect"
3,"Pros:*Cheap*Transparent*Slightly tight fitting with keyboard, so need of tape to attach on board's*Okay qualityCons:*Damaged product as U can see, there is colour marking on surface of keyboard skin*Not properly fitting for Asus strix 17.3"" lap*Price is a little high when compared to price"
1,Waste of moneu don't buy. After buying this you will surely realuze that this was not required at all. Second thig is that it is made in china thereafter nithing left to explain.
1,"Can not stick to the keyboard, there is no adhesive system inbuilt in it. The keys can not be seen properly when kept above them. As per price expectation was high but this is not that much useful at all compared to other keyboard protector of low price."
4,"This product is just okay for its price and its serves it purpose of not allowing dirt or accidental spills reach below the keys on the keyboard. Especially important because nowadays most keyboards are inbuilt into the laptop chassis and are not easily removable for cleaning. Rather than trying to blow or vacuum clean once the grime got in between the keys, better prevent that happening."
3,I bought the skin to protect my laptop keyboard from dust and moisture but it was not transparent for seeing the leys beneath. I wanted to return and refund but it did not work. Replacement will also be opaque. Please have it collected and refund paid amount to my  bank a/c.
2,"A good product which is necessary for gamers and long time pc users. Though its a bit expensive, it is really worth as it helps to prevent wrist painEdit:After 4 months of daily use the stitches have started to open and the silica gel is coming out from it. Not a good product for long usage and might not last another month. Not worth for the price"
1,"I use it for simple work from home setup. I liked gel for support. But, after 2-3 days only, it started tearing up from the bottom. Now, it has exposed inners.I threw away the box unfortunately, so I can't return it as well. Not sure what can be done here. This is bad quality product. Need replacement."
5,The packaging was fine and got delivered before the delivery date. The rest pad isn't too soft. It's as per the support. Uploaded the picture along with my laptop.
2,"Gel starts to come out, the cloth binding isn't that proper. Soon the edge tear up and the gel starts to come to out.being sticky in nature. it sticks up on to fingers when in contact. Additional protection to make binding more strong could have give 5 star rating."
3,"Pretty comfortable to use. Wrist strain has been lesser.However, within 3 months the joints are opening up. Not worth the money spent.."
5,Loved the product. First day of usage its helpful and keeps my posture right. Will share after a few days.
1,I am writing this product review after using it for just 3 months. As you can see the product is not durable and has come out. It was also very hard and did not give a ergonomic posture. I would not recommend this product to others.
1,"This is a very cheap product for the price listed!! Received this just two days back and the edges have already start to tear open. Do not buy this product, absolute waste of money. Very unhappy with this purchase"
4,Very useful. It discolors after some time
5,"Really Comfortable, and fits for my table and keyboard. If you spend hours in front of your pc typing this will be life saver for youüòâ, quality is good though"
5,Comfort
5,good build quality for the price. comfortable and sturdy as advertised.
4,The Quality of the Product is good.The service is good as well!!
5,Very nice product.
5,"Good wrist pad, serves the purpose"
5,Good one
5,Very nice pad.. very soft and comfortable
5,Well packed. Please to use
1,Too heavy
5,Ergonomic
3,"Positives:1. Easy to connect, no dongle required.2. Small, thin, compact and lightweight.3. Rechargeable battery.4. Backlight in keys, adjustable colour and intensity as per ones preference.Negatives:1. No devoted keys for: Home, End, PageUp, PageDown, Delete. Using Fn key we get the functionality of Home and End keys but even for those there is no option of inputting the combinations like Shft+Home, Shft+End, Ctrl+PgUp, etc.2. Very light weight, so it is difficult to type because it moves on the table top with small force. There are no rubberised place holder at the back.I can not commnet on the battery backup as I returned the product the same day, as I needed the key combinations funcationality."
5,Overall good product but the price could be little lower it isn't justified at 899 rupees.
5,Nice product but costly.
5,Good product
3,Small and cheap material
5,Conpaitable easy to carry and work
4,"It's not bad for the price. I got it for 1099 but would have been a better purchase under 1000.My ObservationsBuilt quality is goodLooks beautiful and elegantKeys and spacing is goodRGB light doesn't change color. It lights up in 4 fixed color from one side to the otherüü¢üî¥üü£üîµSo the characters on the keypad also appear in the same color.Backlight is dimmable in 3 levels and you can also turn it off.Only 1 Fixed durarion breathable mode no other effectLED under the membrane is visible, the light isn't spread evenly.LED under the last row/space key is slightly irritating.It looks elegant without backlight but then the characters are slightly difficult to read.In dark rooms you can easily use it.Grip at the bottom is good and riders are broad making it much stable. Gives a very good typing angle for hands.Can't really comment on typing experience, will get used to it after using for 2-3 weeks.Overall not a bad choice, looks and feels better than other so called gaming keyboards in the same price range.If you are not bad hardcore gamer and want a decent multipurpose keyboard at affordable price then go for it."
5,I bought this because my computer is not backlit. I couldn't use it in a dark room. This is great because I can turn the lights off when I am not using it. I just keep it plugged into the computer. Very nice and easy to use.
5,"it's a pretty good keyboard. It feels smooth, I like typing on it, and it's much smaller than my previous keyboard which means I have more area on my desk. Happy with my purchase!"
5,"This is a great keyboard. Typing on it right now! I love the keypress feedback, it's just what I wanted. The backlit and breathing effect is just awesome. Honestly, not much to say here. Everything works great."
5,JUST AWESOME!
5,A bright keyboard. This is what I wanted as I do gaming at late night. Keys are super soft and gives mechanical like feel. I loved it so much.
3,I have dell inspiron 15 7591.Cons:1. Doesn't stick2. cannot see backlit keyboard light through keys.
4,"I was looking for an anti slip cover for my matt finished keyboard panel. this fulfilled the purpose. Also, I liked the the high degree of care the company has put in to make the product. the cover is as thin as possible making it not to touch the screen when the lid is closed also, the keys printed on the cover is slippery enough to match the original keys on the keyboard that the difference can only be felt by a high speed typing person."
4,It‚Äôs a very nice product and very useful. Though the price is a little high I can tell it‚Äôs one time investment. It looks even more good with backlit keyboard. The one less star in my rating is because of no access to fingerprint. This skin doesn‚Äôt work with fingerprint reader on the keypad. Rest all is perfect.
4,The fit is perfect for my Vostro 7590 too.  but only issue is you can't see the keys in night time. The backlight light isn't visible through the skin and it's annoying to me. For those who doesn't care about backlight light then it's perfect for them
3,"Good as keypad protector, slim and fits perfectly on keyboard. Only drawback is that for backlit keyboard you won't see keys properly at night time when back lit is on with this skin."
5,Good product. Useful. Blocks dust going into the keyboard.
3,"Although key board layout is same, it differs in size. So, not fitting well on laptop key board."
3,No way to say whether your 'caps lock' is on or not for the black one. I am using Dell Inspiron 50 5584.
5,Perfect product
5,This is exactly what I was looking for my Dell Inspiron 7501. Nice Product. Backlit light does not penetrate through the keys.
5,Product is very good and excellent quality but only one exceptional case i.e if you use backlit keyboard it doesn‚Äôt shows any light of keyboard
5,Satisfied as my dell laptop keyboard issues are covered and I am able to use it
2,Not sticking
5,Fit very well on laptop keyboard. Overall quality is good.
1,Dislike the quality
5,Good
5,"very good product. fits well on the keypad of my Dell Inspiron 7501 notebook. Value for money, good quality."
5,"So I purchased this for my Android TV box as the original remote that came with it wasn't ideal and did not have an alphabet keypad.To my luck while searching for wireless keyboards this one popped out. I must say its a truly amazing product sure its reflected by the 5 stars I've given this, in my verbiage 5 Stars is wowsome. So let me tell you the wow features, once its connected to the device you want to control and even if your a distance away like 8 to 10 feet it still works great. It has a keyboard, anyone who uses an android tv box will understand what it means to have an alphabet keyboard to type stuff on. Controls are fairly simple, and if that wasn't all it has an air mouse, so you can seamlessly swap between Keyboard and Mouse.Another good thing was the price this came at, Im mentioning this because the price range between sellers was 599 to 1200 at the time I purchased it and honestly I couldn't find any telling difference for the higher prices for the same product amongst different sellers. So at the price I purchased it, this was a steal.I was pleasantly surprised that this has USB charging instead of the traditional AAA batteries which was really welcoming. Did I mention the battery life is Superb, Im a mid level user and its been a week that I haven't charged this. It also has an ON/OFF button to turn the keyboard off when not in use.Also do note The USB that needs to be attached to the device you want to control is tucked in the battery compartment when you receive it, mentioning this cos It took me a few minutes to find the USB :)Thank you for such an osm product that makes life easy for us."
3,"1) SIZE IS LESS THAN EXPECTED2) BUTTONS WORKING FINE, BUT SOME FUNCTIONS ARE NOT ACTIVE3) RESPONSE IS GOOD4) NOT FOR HEAVY USE5) JUST FOR SCROLLING OCCASIONAL TYPING IT IS OK , OTHERWISE DON'T BUY FOR HEAVY USE6) SERVED MY PURPOSE7) IF YOU ARE AN BELOW AVERAGE USER GO FOR IT , OTHERWISE NOT..HOPE MY REVIEW HELPFUL TO YOU"
4,"Packet contains Keyboard, battery, USB charging cable, USB receiver and manual. Keypad looks like earlier blackberry quarty type key pad. Item is delicate. Got easily connected with my Android based smart TV. Lot of keys and it will take time to understand all the key operations. Works only when TV is switched ON by TV remote. Find useful for operating smart TV. Not checked with laptop & desktop PC. Delivery of Amazon is safe, fast and in good condition.Used for one day, hence durability & battery life can not be confirmed.Concern: The manufacturer is not providing any Warranttee/Guarantee . Hence, it looks like he himself is not confident about his own product."
5,All function are working properly i use this keyboard with my pc and android tv box it is very helpful for smart tv and android box
4,"The mini keyboard with touchpad which I received is same as the description, now let me highlight some Pros and Cons as I have noticed so farPros:  1. Functionality: fully functioning (except browser button), touchpad sensitivity is preety well, very well programmed in terms of power saving and responsiveness.  2. Feature: packed with Li-ion BL5C 2020Mah rechargeable battery, wireless receiver (plug & play type),  3. Design: very lightweight, 3 indicator for power, battery and input. Key quality is also better than expected at this priceCons:  1. Functionality: not much to complain, you can not use it while charging ( you won't get the fun if you are using a wireless keyboard while wired with a charger :P ),  2. Feature: could be better in terms of key orientation, my suggestion is to add one more shift and ctrl key (practically it is gonna help a lot while typing) Design: here one think I must mention is the touch pad size, though it's a very responsive one but I will really appreciate if the touchpad area could be bigger, may be it will charge some more bucks but we will be happy to pay it for that.Overall I will suggest to go for it, it is really worth of this price ( I have purchased @‚Çπ539 )"
5,"I purchased this product in emergency situation. My keyboard and track pad suddenly stops responding and the repair cost was too high. So when I received this, my friends laugh that what a joystick kind stuff that is. But when I started using this, I enjoyed this very much as I can use my laptop remotely (which is very helpful in winters). The battery life is good and is of light weight. The only problem I found with that is we can't use it with during charging. Otherwise it is over all a great product."
4,"This is a super cool keyboard!! But it is smaller than I just thought it would be. But seriously, this stuff is good for daily use, but finding where the keys are is a bit difficult.But using it for just one hour will train you to find each keys around. The negative thing I found is that, I don‚Äôt know why, but as before, the manufacturer‚Äôs packaging was torn and squeezed. I thought the product might be dead by that, but this keyboard worked very well for me.Another thing I felt annoying was the USB dongle. It‚Äôs just a hard piece. It‚Äôs very difficult to plug in and remove from the USB port. It just shows out to be killing my device....Before using this, please take care that charge this thing for around 1 or 1:30 hours minimum. Pressing Fn+F2 will switch on the backlight, but it will last only for 5 sec. Because it‚Äôs in power saving mode. But when it‚Äôs connected to any device, this problem won‚Äôt come up. Would suggest to get one. Cool stuff!!"
4,"The mini keyboard is just as described by other reviewers. It's especially handy for the smart TV and laptop. However, I discovered that there are two versions available. One that is backlit and one that is not. The one I received was not. But I've seen reviews with backlit keyboards so was expecting mine to be the same. A bit disappointed about that."
5,its really nice....worth for the money it came with Li-ion 1020mah battery.......and all the function keys are working properly......
4,"i recd yesterday. Now i typing this feedback using this keyboard. overall i am satisfied. there concerns1. in manual it is mentioned that while charging it will work, but in real it wont work.2. special button for open default browser not working3. in real it looks so small4. i am not able identify whether charging completed or not, no green light indicator5. There is no complete manual. how to reassign unassigned buttons"
5,Amazing product simply value for money.... Although it may be a little hard for people with thick hands... The buttons are too small but once you get the hang of it it's not really hard to use the sensitivity of the touchpad is really amazing I can't expect this kind of reaction from product so cheap... So so you should definitely buy it but from some other store because there are some other stores where they are selling it for cheap....this products battery life is really amazing considering it's a keyboard and the charging is relief as if it charged for like 2 hours it can go on for 3 to 4 days using continuously....
1,"I was looking for a sleek and handy keyboard option. While the product is quite small, and light, the keys are quite hard to press. I instantly wanted to return it. However, I had opened the package a bit late and the return window on Amazon had lapsed. To top it, I realized that a few of the keys do not work. I still contacted Amazon support who said they couldn't make an exception even though product was defective, and they put me in touch with the seller. The seller wanted me to courier the product to Mumbai. For something that had cost less than INR 600, spending INR 250+ on courier made no sense. I let it be. But a lesson learnt!"
4,Liked it. Easy to connect and use but not with backlight buttons. Bl5c battery is good. It works with android phone than firestick and windows. DEFINITELY NOT for  Windows. In windows it types automatically hundred letters with a single strike of key. Extremely horrible. But good with android phone. Not tested with ios.
1,"It's not all working, the device just switch on nd off apart from it does nothing.. I try to connect with smart TV, android TV box, laptop but it didn't work with any of them.. Never seen such a worst product like this before..Note: That 1star, Amazon won't let me to submit my review with star rating, if u ask me I would like to negative rating.. it's not all worth for one star.."
5,I am using it since a week and I must say that the quality of the product is osam...beyond my imaginations.It is small in size which make it more portable. Connection is strong..no issue. Keys are made of rubber. And specially the touchpad...to me it's the best part of this gadget. It's smart ! Power autometically turns off during inactivity. I did not manually turn the power off yet(As I did not need to). All the keys are working.This varient does not come with backlight facility. Actually I did not want backlight as this varient looks more eligent and cool to me.N.B :- 1.  I was facing a problem...I think many new users may feel so..that is the 'Back' button for smart tv and boxes. The mentioned back button would not work. Instaid use Right Click button. 2. This keyboard comes with a rechargable Li ion battry along with a usb cable but no adapter which is quite suprizing but the important fact is that the model does not support AAA battries.Thats all for now. I totally recommand the product. Go for it with no hesitation.Bdw my seller was ' Easyekart '.
5,"A must for all smart TV box. I purchased it for the purpose. It works like a charm. Very responsive, feels a little bit flimsy in terms of weight but you can work with it as it is supposed to be lighter. However the buttons and touch pad feels soft and sturdy. It has good back-light support a must when operating in the dark room. Compact, good placements of buttons, ergonomically designed and intuitive. Fast delivery and good bargain. Recommended."
1,There are two ways to use similar products.1. With receiver: but they do not supply a receiver. Also third party receiver are not compatible with this.I replaced the product couple of times to get the receiver. But it was only waste of time.First delivery didn't had receiver.Second time delivery didn't had receiver & power cable both.2. Bluetooth: not supported on this device.Thus one cannot connect this device. Do can't use it.Total waste of time & money.
3,"By looking at photo, looked good, but i am surprised, why it was not delivered to me.anyway its a very handy toolFor controlling androidsmart t.v."
5,To tell the truth I was quiet sceptic when I first saw the product. Especially battery looked cheap. But to my amazement bthe battery has been running gor a week now after first recharge and my daughter use it continuously for 4 hrs. daily. Even normal mouse battery doesn't last that long. Keyboard all keys are working perfectly. Mouse pad is good and sensitive. Everything works as advertised. I am very happy with this product AND FOR JUST UNDER ‚Çπ400!!! Only thing if it was backlit too as shown in pics. Maybe that was a different model I'll buy that too.
1,Do not by from this supplier gopani sales. Has missed the blue tooth dongle and the cable as shown in pic. When asked about it told  me to return back. Waste of time
1,"Dont buy cheap product.The usb dongle got damaged after 15 days. As the product has no warranty, no option to claim refund. Keep patience and buy a good branded part. Otherwise you have to feel cheated like me."
5,Pros:1. Small in size2. Easy to carry and use.3. Remote to an pc4. Battery holds for a day (normal uses)Cons:1. Too small bez sometimes it's difficult to use multiple keys at the same time.2. Connectivity - You have to be in straight line to pc for it's to work. Distance is only 10m
4,"Good product. Based upon the price it is absolutely fantastic. The charge retaining is very good, stays for more than a month. Charge time is around 5 hours. Matches perfectly with my MI smart TV. Product is exactly as per website description."
1,Just battery charging indicator on. Wireless indicator off. Even full charging keyboard doesn't work. First time bad üëé expireance on Amazon. Bad üëé.... I want my money refund
3,working with firestick via usb otg with power cable which can be bought on Amazon @ 350
5,No manual. But easy to understand. They sent it with power button left on and no charge. Battery is good enough for two to three days. Very rare use will give a 1 year of usage at most
5,Is a superb peice of device..!! A must have for those using smart tv/ android box..  nice navigation experience..!! Easy to use..!! Handy and light weight..!! It comes with a rechargeable 5C battery(like those used in old nokia) phones.. back up is up to 1 week with a 4 to 5 hr use per day.. full charging may take up to 3 hours(didn't check it exactly).
3,"Light. Mouse pad works.Not a great keypad. Types doubles n at times unresponsive.Still easier than the TV REMOTE.Quality ain't great though!Expected White as shown, got Black."
5,"Its too Good, Connectivity range is good enough, All keys and mouse touchpad is work batter, very handy, and the best part is that we can charge it when it drain, very portable and easy to use anywhere with any device."
4,"It didn't come with manual so settings it up was rather time taking, average battery life , Good form factor"
1,after 4 the battery is not charging properly.....charging problems....so kept for replacement.......waiting for it...i think i have made wrong decision
4,Nice. All of the keys work. But the only problem is that the buttons are a little hard to press. Overall portable and nice product.
5,Have been using it for a month now. Works like charm. Connects to BT as soon as you turn it ON. Standby mode is just awsome.Highly recommended for Fire stick.
4,It's build quality is cheap. But what else you want in ‚Çπ400? Much better than stock tv remotes. Really useful for doing long text quarries in search bars.
4,"This one is good, I'm using this for a month. No issue has been found so far. Battery back up is ok. U can live with it. Nice feeling I get while using. I run this with raspberry pi 3. It is compatible with Linux,windows, Android os."
5,Nice keyboard...palm sized...good built ..and can carry in purse easity...portable..
3,It works well but the reason I hv given only 3 stars is bcoz this product is too delicate. Drop it once and it stops working. Please make it more sturdy.
3,"It worked great,  range 15 feet, no obstacle affect functioning. But after six months, mouse pad and few buttons stopped working and few others results in wrong keypress, for example, right arrow opens default mail programme,"
1,"In product description, it says li-polymer rechargable batteries included, however, no batteries were there neither any user manual. Also, the back cover is too lose. Doesn't even fit. Seems not as per the product size. This is a complete waste of money. Don't buy. Cannot configure this junk item"
3,Value for money productNo black light keysFirst i got  the product with black light keys but without usb receiverThen i order for replacementNow with out black light keys
5,"Before buying this item I had many thoughts of whether it will fit my keyboard or not. But after receiving this product and trying it, yes I made the right decision of buying it. I believe it will fit any 14 inch laptop because it fits mine perfectly. The material is exactly what I wanted and gives my keyboard a full coverage. You can easily clean it or just wash it like me. Its waterproof so nothing to worry about. I believe its durable and I am very happy with this item. I totally recommend this product to anyone who is willing to buy. Just go for it."
1,"Either seller sent me the wrong product or the black with clear product doesn't exist.Fitting, thickness are decent. But this is not suitable for backlit keyboard. Returned the product waiting for refund."
2,"This is just a sheet on the keyboard but doesn't really fit the keys into it. So when you are typing the sheet moves. It doesn't even allow the backlit light to cross, so it kills one of the key features of the laptop, that's backlit. It's locally available for just Rs. 100. Will be keeping it only coz I am currently shopping only online. There is also no information if where it is manufactured. I am hence assuming it is again a China manufactured."
5,This keyboard protector is a good product to have. The laptop is completely covered and it prevents the dust from falling on the keyboard. And it is very easy to remove and clean. I think it is worthy to have If u are thinking your laptop to be  clean and safe
5,I recently purchased keyboard cover for my pavilion x360 laptop. I highly recommend this product .Its so thin and accurate and it doesnt even fall when i use the laptop in tablet mode.
4,Fits perfectly to my hp pavilion x360 14 inch laptop. Thickness is light. Looks wise its classic. Worth for money.
3,"Worked good for 3-4 months, but then it started accumulating dust and grease which was not going away even after washing. When i was closing my laptop lid...all this dirt would stick to my screen, causing me more trouble"
5,Nice one it is very much comfortable while you type doesn't stick as if it is glue but then also it is nice while typing
5,It fits perfectly with my HP 14inch 2in1 pavilion laptop. I have rectangular keys and it is perfect. The silicon quality couldn't have been better but it is manageable. The price is also decent.
5,Superb product n superb fit for Hp x360 i7 16gb ram.Only con is night typing as silicone cover blocks much light when you turn on backlight keyboard.
5,Good product. High quality.  Perfect fitting. I zm using it with HP Pavillion x360 dh1180tu and it fits gr8
5,Nice and Thin cover for laptop keyboard 14inch HP.  At the time of placing order i have doubt on my selection. But after recd the product feel happy. Thanks to amazon.
4,It was a perfect fit for my pavilion x360-14dh007tu but the only problem is that it blocks the light of keys so the backlight keyboard will become simply useless. But still I would recommend this. I loved it.
5,Soft enough for smooth handling
5,"Just recieved it now, it's really good, I got it for 325 only (in Amazon sale). Worth buying it, perfect fit for HP 14s ER0003TU"
3,"I saw sa me kind of item in amazon it is very colourful and affordable, but available for USA etc like national only, why can't avail such kind of products here."
5,All things are good and exactly same as promised. Not feeling like cheated. Don't know how much this print will last but as of now it is very much neat.
3,"As the Caps Lock light is not visible when the caps lock is depressed one cannot use this skin as confidently, one has to lift the skin to see whether the caps lock is on especially so when working with passwords."
3,It Stretches out in less than a month regardless of seller.. Not worth the price.
5,perfect
5,I am satisfied with product. This cover perfectly fit with my HP Pavilion x360 Convertible laptop. Great quality product in less amount!
5,Perfect for HP Pavilion x 360 i3 model.

5,I used this device to connect to my Samsung smart tv. It really worked well.
4,"It fits perfectly for hp notebook 15 bs 146 TU. It sticks itself to the keyboard.No slipping.One disadvantage is that it spoils the look of my laptop. My keys are visible but not like before.It makes them look dull.Other than that it is really good.As for as durability is concerned, I have no idea.I have to use it to see about it.Delivery is quick and satisfiable .  If u are looking for product to safeguard your laptop from dust and others without considering about the look of your laptop,U should go for it."
5,This Keyboard Skin nicely fits with my 15.6 inch HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop (CX0144TX). I didn't went with the Black variant because the font on the Keyboard is different. Overall it is a good product.
4,"Quality is good, size is thin on keys, soft on hands, protects laptop keys from dust (and spills maybe) but I felt costly. Anyway worth buying as it serves the purpose."
4,I can‚Äôt see through this cover caps lock key is on or off . the caps lock key light is not visible but overall good product

5,GOOD PRODUCT
3,"200 can be given, 375 is seems pricey!!"
5,"Best product,transparnt and good product,but high price..."
4,I don't think it is worth for the money spent.

4,"Such a nice product. Very comfortable and useful. Suites with my table, but not with chair handle. I was suffering from shoulder pain due to uncomfortable computer table settings, but  after started using this product its gone like magic. üëç So comfortable...Quality/material of the product can be much better."
2,Product is useful but after 1 hr of usage the leather part is start coming out. Its is sticky as well.So quality is absolutely not good.In terms of sterdiness... yes its pretty sturdy.
3,Pros:comfortable and easy to install and useCons:Not very sturdysize is small compared to the one shown in the product page.may break if we apply force accidentally
5,Excellent product. Easy to install and quite sturdy to operate. My arm pain is gone as I get very good arm support and operate the mouse from this armrest. Bought for home and office both.
5,Update to my last review. I bought another one a week later and now it's comfortable for both of my arms
5,Quite easy to fix to the table. Seems to be sturdy. It is quite comforting to use and has helped reduce wrist pain from long use of mouse. It can be conveniently folded close to the table when not in use.
5,"Product is as described and shown. Has good quality and very easy to install.  Best part is how it can be turned , after it's fixed we can turn it as per our convenience and after use we can just turn it toward the table so it in not hindering space."
4,"easy to install, can support normal arm weight but might break if pushed hard or harshly , could be sold little cheaper though."
4,Comfortable and good rest for arm as i work for long hours. But it keeps coming off the table after sometime and i have to screw it back. May be this is because of the smoothness of my table. Need to use it for more days in order to know the durability. Overall good one and go for it without any second thoughts.
1,It's overpriced.
5,Good product. Durability is to be evaluated as I am using it less than a month. Comfortable.
5,Perfect suit for my work from home needsEconomical to upgrade the tableBought two pieces to suit for mouse and keyboard
5,It's a good comfort.
4,"A very nicr product. Good for Office use. I am very comfortable in using this product, and extremely usefull if the table and chair heights are not same."
5,Packing is nice and quality is OK. However it is not much helpful for me due to my chair height.
2,"It's not that strong , if you accidentally press with force then it will break. But comfortable."
4,thoughtfully designed
5,It's good
5,Good...
1,Disgusting product
1,Not at all comfortable
5,very nice products i love it
1,Meaningless product
1,Was a digastar
5,I use this product for arm rest on table.Its a very useful product. New thing people will experience for sure.
1,"I found this keyboard when i am looking for bluetooth keyboard for Android.When they showed the product, they are showing only keyboard.But when I received, i got keyboard and wireless usb dongle.My idea is to use this keyboard, with Android mobiles which got Bluetooth inside.But Android phone is not detecting this keyboard as bluetooth device.It looks they are selling wireless keyboard as bluetooth keyboard.It is nothing but cheating. It looks they are intentionally hiding the wireless dongle from the imagesthey are display."
1,"The product is faulty, I could not run this in my office laptop and my home PC both having Windows 10. I needed it for my Raspberry PI, but it neither worked there also. The product manual is not good, there are three lights there on the device, the manual did not have any description on them! The yellow and blue LED kept blinking all the time, when the device is on. I found the red led is for charging indication, blue is for steady connection and yellow is for probing the connection, which I found out by googling. It seems that the device was unable to make contact with the connector dongle. The manual did not contain information about the on/off switch I had to discover them by myself! I have also found out, after googling, that it should have keyboard back-light; the manual did not have that mention and the back-light was not working. The charger cable dose not charge often. The device is compact, light weight, looks sturdy, price is little high for a product that has no service center. However I have requested for replacement, lets see what I get now."
1,"Nokia battery came with the controller was not charging even after an hour of charge, so I went to buy AAA batteries when I went to put these batteries I came to know the space is too wide for them to stay put. So overall a big waste of money, if I had not thrown the carton box I would have returned this pathetic excuse for a product."
5,I am using it for smart tv.Its is easy to operate now and can be used for playing games. Battery back up is good it work for two weeksQuality :it mainly plastic body. I faced no issue in working even after 2 months of useingCons:It cannot be used to switch on the TV.
5,"It's still working fine. With minor setbacks. I purchased ot on 24 jan and been using it since . Just a few things i noticed that doesnt work now, up arrow key works after 2nd try. So i think it's starting to wear itself out coz it's not bulit to last as can be expected by the price.It is still giving me a battery backup of around 4-5 days and range is around 6-8 feet. I'm using it on a chromebook and all shortcuts works fine."
5,"this is a good product. working with computer, smart tv and android box. good to play games and work with tv. very useful for playing games with smart tv/ android box. good quality and easy connectivity."
4,The wireless tech product is good. Has three colour backlights on buttons. Does what it claims. If mouse is stuck switch off and on the device so it works again. Touchpad is really good.
5,"Good and worth product.... Very useful one...I'm using for TV, computer, and iMac üëç working perfectly..."
4,"Easy to Use, cheap and best, works fine.Range is also good. Response of KB is also fine.Buy it for day to day Digital life uses."
1,"Wastage of money , not at all useful, i have tried with my smart TV, keypad is working, no mouspad working"
5,"Well thought out and marketed p-roduct, does everything it is supposed to do and more."
5,"Plug n play device out of the box. Just connected with windows 10 Laptop, everything seems fine. The touchpad is working too. For the price it's a great buy. Was confused about buying it first place, but looks good to me. Cheers :)"
2,It's portable I think of 12 inches it's 4 inches and little Rough for touchpad.But still it's okBut expensive.
2,"keys are very hard, defeating my purpose of buying this for typing...and they are made of cheap plastic, this product isnt worth more than 150rs"
5,Good and convenient
5,"Easy to use and functions very well, battery backup is quite good and easy to recharge"
2,Poor plastic and battery life
5,It's been a month I have to recharge it once in 4 to 5 daysNice.Value for moneyAnd must buy.
5,Very good at this price range.
5,Just awesome.. i was not knowing before that this is so much handy.. even the typing is okay and button position's are okay.. value for money...
5,"Good value for the money, liked it with USB Micro and nice one."
5,This is outstanding
1,Worst product. There is no rechargeable battery included whereas in the box battery is mentioned included.
5,Nice Product
5,Excellent product!
5,Battery life is not good.  Too short battery life
1,fake productthis product name is bluetooth keyboardbut this keyboard has no bluetooth optionsfrodfake product
4,Battery stand by is for only 1 hour and needs charging.
1,Product was worst quality battery didn‚Äôt even last 2-3 days and there were no connectors inside to use Aaa cells
5,Works well with Android smart box. You can type easily with it
5,It wonderfull product. I purchased for my android box and it is working fine.
2,The description mentioned rechargeable lithium battery and I received a product that uses AAA batteries. Why so?
5,Jskjsjddjdj
3,It's good but its too short and built quality is not good
1,"I had to change the battery within few days. Or else, product is OK."
4,Product is well and good....but mouse click...  Slow.
4,Work's well.. but it's a mini
5,Dont buy.....waste 10 days after stopped working only lights no key working nor mouse
5,Good quality .Good range.all function are working properly
5,Works fine
1,"Initially impression of the skin was good (thickness, comfort and stickiness). after a week of use it started losing its sticky property. So i tried to wash it carefully. It was able to stick laptop's keyboard but not as before. after few days i noticed bubbles between the keys and noticed it was misaligned. half side of skin is aligned good but it ruins  the other half. and form wrinkles. (i would suggest not to wash as it is definitely not wash friendly or remove it after sticking or go with the plain skin (not engraved ones (best)))."
5,"Packed well, fits properly for my Lenovo L340 15.6 inch.Very useful to prevent your keyboard keys filled with dust or dirty hands."
5,Ok
4,IT IS GOOD BUT I've it get durty from back it is very hard to clean
5,Easy to fit
5,Very nice quality and packing was also good.Perfectly fits my lenovo L340Worth buying @ Rs.350 as it one time expense.
5,"excellent product ,it fits perfect for mylaptop lenovo ideapad 320's keyboard."
2,There are no number in the right side of this keyword cover
2,back light  is not visible in latter . so we cant use it with backlight
5,Very good product for laptops
3,"I got used one keyboard skin .,. Disappointed"
5,"Perfect silicon keyboard case.All the key cuts are perfect and layers over perfectly.It is totally washable and keeps your keyboard away from dust particles and water splashes.I purchased this as my default laptop alphabets prints are silver in colour over silver keystrokes.Earlier there was no visibility in low light, but after applying this silicon case the letters are clearly visible.It helps you in smooth typing.Worth buying it go for it."
5,"Sheer silicon that fits the keyboard and individual keys if you have verified the suitability from description for your model number. I purchased the black one and it increases the visibility of my keys, as the original white on silver is less visible. Seals the keyboard effectively."
4,"The fit was on point. I bought the black one which gives very nice look to the laptop. Only problem is that with the backlit keyboard, the words don‚Äôt appear to be lit up but it‚Äôs not a major issue."
5,"Good quality, looks so good on my laptop, kinda looks like macbook thoghüòú"
5,"Simply superb, clear and bold letters, washable, perfect cut for each keys ..."
1,Doesn't fit to keyboard.Quality is good but useless.It is better to buy a plain silicon sheet.
4,"Well fitted, good quality, good packaging, value for money"
5,"It can easily Protect keyboard of hp pavilion gaming 15 ec 0100ax model from dust, as it fits all keys .. thank you.."
1,Worst product sags just by simple touch
5,This produhct  good for hp laptopsPerfect in size
5,Perfect fitting
4,"Bought this Combo for ‚Çπ 509 (product + delivery) on July 20, 2018The Product is same as it is shown in the picture.Pros :1. Colour Combination looks stunning.2. Keys are Soft and doesn't make awkward sound click sounds.3. Mouse works fine and the response is also good.4. The Additional Keys on the Left and Right hand side of the Keyboard enhances the look of the Keyboard and adds shortcuts to Useful Tools.5. The Keyboard is some what Water Resistant like it can handle water splashes and drain out water from tiny holes (present on the back side of the keyboard).Cons :1. The Wire Quality is not that Good, a Flat Cable look which is not that of a great quality as Dell, HP or Logitech provides.2. The Mrp is ‚Çπ 619 and this Product even sell at a price between ‚Çπ 645 - ‚Çπ 950 which is totally not worth it.Conclusion :OVERALL A NICE FUNKY LOOK keyboard + mouse COMBO AT A DECENT PRICE RANGE (‚Çπ 450 - ‚Çπ 550)"
3,"Well it's actually a good combo for the price rate of 500.  But the mouse is not durable , on the first hour of use , the left mouse button stuck after double clicking ...,The keyboard on other hand is much better , the buttons are soft and silent , quality of keyboard is decent .....I m not going to order replacement (becoz of mouse problem ) ... As Amazon takes 1-2 months for exchanging this one with a new one , also there's a great chance that next time I will recieve a much worse product ...(from 2 times experience before ).... Also there was no packaging , the delivery boy just hand me the original box of this, no wrapping and Amazon packaging ...?"
5,Very Good quality product .
1,"After 6 months of useageProduct was packed well by amazon and it was delivered on time.Key board keys r smooth and noiseless. Mouse responsiveness is to the markAfter 3 months of useage, the key board is not working properly. When I contacted Amazon customer service, they asked me to contact the brand and provided me with a number. The number is invalid and when I called Amazon back they told me to ""Google"" the brand's customer care number and talk to them. It's good for 3 month useage. If you are ok with it please go ahead and buy it.It's better you buy some other product from a decent brand don't go for this one.Amazon service is worst in this regard."
5,"Keyboard-I don't know about gaming but this is worth every penny. I was hesitant about its shape at first because it looked too over the top to me but I like it now. It's light weight and silent. It doesn't make the 'tk tk tk' sound when you type.Mouse -The mouse is good and nothing fancy, which is great. I hate fancy mice so this works for me. It makes a little sound when you click but it doesn't bother me much.Installation speed -I tried the keyboard and mouse on both a slow and a fast laptop to check the installation time taken by the products. If you have a laptop in a decent working condition, it would start working immediately after it is connected. But for slow laptops, you might have to wait for a minute or two. But I feel that's because of the laptop and not otherwise.Registration -It comes with one year warranty so you can register your product on their website and manage everything online. I loved that."
2,"I should say this keyboard probably is worth the price with the mouse combo. However this doesn't feel good on fingers. It is spongy, bouncy type feedback typical that you would get on budget membrane keyboard. You will get used to it. One problem is that small inverted Enter key is so awkward. I dont know why at all they do it. You will hit enter key when you didn't want to.EDIT:As of December 2019 (just short of an year), I'm buying a new set paying a little bit more, maybe Logitech. Reason is that the mouse scroll wheel has 'worn out'. It's wheel don't even engage the encoder (it's been a while since it's this way - so it didn't literally last a whole year), I opened up the mouse and saw how flimsy the whole thing is put together."
4,Not highly recommend for gaming but for office work it good choice & value for money. The keyboard have multimedia shortcut keys
1,"Very poor quality. the USB connector was loose and the computer would keep telling me 'no keyboard detected'. The keys are hard are NOT ALL ALL smooth for typing. Within a few hours of use the keys started to stick and the keyboard froze, becoming completely unusable. My mistake was throwing away the packaging so i am stuck with this completely useless product without any option to exchange it."
1,"Edit:Reduced the rating to 1 star due to following reason:Worked for about 12-13 days. And just as the return window expired, the product started developing problems. Some keys on keyboard appeared to be stuck for example character ""c"", ""m"", return key and few more just did not respond. After unplugging and plugging again, found that keys are working but now these keys were working over time. Feather touch these problem keys and the key strokes resulted in ""ccccc"", ""mmmmm"" etc. Tried multiple USB ports, re-installing driver, changing the keyboard ""repetition"" settings but in vain. Now I can't return the product also since the window has expired.The mouse still works but I don't trust the quality of it."
5,"I have now been using the combo set for close to a month. Initially, I opted for it because I found it cheap compared to the combo sets I have acquired and just did not want to spend much. I didn't expect the set to last long. But I have been extremely pleased to find that the set works better, and in some cases, much better, than the three or four Logitech sets accumulated by me which have this or that component not working properly. The keys of the keyboard are different in style to the Dell keyboard I have but equally good to use. The Dell is softer but much more expensive. I have kept a record of the Amkette set for future ref should I need to buy a set again. Great value for money."
4,"If you want a budget combo, you can definitely go for this one.Pros:* Cheaper price* Keyboard has as multi-media keys* Cool orange colour for arroys, WASD and media keys in keyboard.* Keyboard is compact and has a good feel for typing and amateur gaming experience.* Mouse is accurate and very responsive, you may feel a little bit slow in FPS games due to it's little bit low DPI.Cons:* The markings on the keycap erases after 3-4 months usage on heavy use, else I would have given 5 stars."
4,"While the look and the extra shortcut keys at both end are great features but when I use it for typing by keeping the keyboard on lap, it shakes a lot and looses balance.The keys are big and you need to press them deep. Another issue is with the noise of keys while typing. The keys makes noise even you shake it tilt the keyboard slightly.The wire used in both mouse and keyboard is not rounded and smooth. In fact it is neither flat too. Hence it feels pretty itchy when rubbed over your skin.Good point is it is cheap and light weight.Using it since 1 month and so far no issues .The Rupees symbol drivers are not found, hence as of now that feature is useless"
5,"The build quality is good. For normal works,  it is just excellent.... For those who usually do rough typing or faster typing,  I would suggest them to go for Dell and Hp keyboard because I have personally used them and still using it. The delivery was fast. The combo is just fabulous at this price range... With budget between 500-700, u can just go for it. It a value for money product.."
1,Update : Don't  buy it..Key stopped working in the 10th day of use.I have Bought this keyboard Just today.  Shall surely share an updated Review After 1 month of use.But Right now.I would like to tell you my Observation.Pro:1. Budget Friendly combo between 500 to 600 Rs.2. Nice Poppy Color looks great to eyes.3. Soft Keys make less noise when you use them.4. Finishing is Descent for the priceCons :1. The Text on the Button looks printed and Not very Attractive and Clear. Hope it doesn't come out.2. The key travel is too long.  If you dont like keyboard with long Key travel you may not enjoy the typing experience.To summarize it a good Keyboard for a Small Budget.
4,"---I got this product at 436rs (17th NOV 2017)Its been 1 and a half years now I'm using this product.Honestly, it is not a gaming mouse and keyboard combo...its the same as normal Mouse&Keyboard. the keyboard might give you a feel likewise but not the mouseFeatures:>Worth it under 500rs (I got this product at 436rs (17th NOV 2017))>Good build quality of keyboard and about the mouse you cant use it roughly.>my Keyboard isn't working anymore from last month. stops working automatically (Nov19).>mouse still working good.why should buy>at this price surely this is a good choice.why should not buy>If you want a real gaming keyboard and mouseUpdate: 18Nov2019 keyboard is not working suddenly, no kind of damage happens"
2,"Hello,I got keyboard and mouse combo, and felt its good, but when i connected mouse what i found was its not functioning well and it stops in between.  Seriously felt bad to purchased it from online as if it would have been from shop, i would have immediately got replacement for it, but I got stuck here, can you please replace the mouse for me please.RegardsNimesh."
5,"Keys are smooth,Design is fantastic.One extra star for all over the look.This keyboard is even better than Dell .Mouse is not that great but it is accpetable in its price & i think it is great deal in the price.NO issue at all after few months if usage."
5,I have ordered it for my son ..Excellent product ..laptop keyboard will make kids to see screen from short distance thus i ordered it.. It is really awesome.. you have one year warrenty hassle free you ca register it from amkette.com.It may not be suitable for gaming No RGB . But looks premium.Over all Thanks to amazon for recommending this order.. Amazon always ahead..
3,"Keyboard looks decent, about 3 months of usage works fine.It is not a gaming keyboard, so NOT SUGGESTED for gaming.The shortcut orange keys are made of rubber and good to navigate quickly.Can be used for laptop's extra keyboard or a secondary keyboard.Mouse looks decent as well wire quality is normal and sufficient length.Again NOT SUGGESTED for gaming.OVERALL its Average and can be used as a secondary Keyboard and Mouse"
4,"Perfect combo for the price. Initially I was skeptical while buying this for the quality as most of the combo available for this price are of worst quality and don't last more than 3-4 months. After using I find this to be perfect for regular/office use. If you are looking for a office keyboard/mouse combo this should be the one you can depend upon.PS: For Amazon, this is not for gaming and being a USB combo I don't think you should look for battery life."
4,"At this price its not a bad deal.  The keyboard is really good. Keys are responsive and quiet. The shortcut keys on left and right are a nice touch. They work without any additional driver s/w being needed but if you are touch typist they might put you off a bit....the alignment of the hands are slightly altered due to the left side keys.  the mouse is slightly small. the wheel is badly placed. if you use the mouse wheel a lot to scroll through web sited you will get wrist pain soon. to summarize the keyboard is good. the mouse, while not bad is slightly smaller and the scroll wheel placement is a pain"
5,"1.Decent product to buy within budget!!!2.Good for gaming3.Give feel of type writer but key strokes are on softer side while typingBeing an IT professional, computer related gadgets has to be best of use .It's of every day use for me and works really good"
4,The keys have a nice long travel and feels sturdy. Have been using for 03 months now and completely satisfied with the product. The highlights on the keyboard look good. Quick access keys on the sides of the keyboard are a good addition to the keyboard. Overall the best budget keyboard and mouse combo available out there. Would recommend buying it.
4,"On a whole, for this price range the product was really good for office use and for gaming also it was some what better with no noise of typing and sturdy keyboard.The mouse was quite responsive with decent look.Only defect is the packaging it didnt came with the amazon packing, just a box like it came as you can see in the last picture, it was somewhat damaged outside the box so i was scared about the product but it was all fine inside as u can see the pics posted.Overall this product was good in this price range."
4,I happen to use this for my regular use and not for gaming. The keys are soft and the benefit is the multiple short cut keys that are available on the keyboard which are really working.I can not vouch for the gaming though.
4,"First of all I already own an Amkette Xcite Pro USB Keyboard and I have been using it for a year without any issues, so I knew my new purchase also would not disappoint me. I bought new Amkette keyboard mouse combo for Rs 427 at Amazon Grand Shopping Festival for my sister and she already loves it. The only con with this keyboard is it cannot be used for gaming, as still the UV coated keys fade away if you use for gaming."
5,So simple...but I think it's not a feather touch......When I received this package the box of the product I teared I think it happens at the time of packaging but product is perfect no complaintsAnd this combo pack is value for moneyAfter delivered this package I know about amkette's other combo pack valued of RS599/- it is more beautiful with blue colours and it's shortcut keys are on the above........Overall rating is very good
4,"Initially i got a faulty keyboard with the ""Enter"" key getting pressed with a feather touch which made typing impossible. Then got it replaced the next day.Post that everything has been fine with the keyboard.Mouse also works great.Good product."
5,I was recently looking for a keyboard and after looking at few I found this one this product had the most  excellent design I had ever seen so I ordered it. After a few days of using it I can assure you this is the most ergonomic keyboard with clicks which are Satisfactory compared to a gaming keyboard I would recommend people who can't buy expensive keyboard to look for this.
1,"Horrible product, hardly 2 weeks I used and the escape and space buttons are inactive. Tried reinstalling the drivers, fixed sticky keys also.. guess the product is only not good"
5,"Well packed and awesome multimedia key u can acess calculator , my computer and mute with just simple touch.Nice key operation Thanks to Amezoe and Seller for great product with more than excellent packing for product safety. Go for it blindly"
1,"Don't buy this product .It's made in china, Also it feels cheap plastic used .uncomfortable for typing .should have priced 200 inr"
1,It's not even an year and the number keys which are above alphabets stopped working. I have barely used the keyboard. I haven't used it more than 20 times in a year. It's not possible for me to go to a nearby city in this period of covid to claim the warranty.
5,"Nice designed keyboard with colorful buttons of Volume control and play control, left-right directions buttons and the keys are not making much noise.  I love the keyboard.  Also, the mouse is just as good as the keyboard."
4,"it is a good quality keyboard. The good thing is that keys do not make noise while typing.This keyboard has adequate space between the keys and the peripherals have some important keys like email, audio keys and more.Overall a good quality keyboard and mouse combination, look-wise also it is nice , easy to use."
1,The numpad on the right side of this keyboard is not working.  Not sure if any special keys to be used before I use the numpad. Tried options but nothing much on internet.My bad luck is that I haven't checked it till after one month of delivery date.
1,In my last post I mentioned about the keyboard not working. Now when I try to contact customer support- the number is not in service. Tried multiple other numbers but nothing works. How to get the warranty for the product when they is no support from the product company.
5,Purchased on 31 December 2019Good product with sturdy built body. Loved the look and feel of the keyboard and mouse. Not a small mouse fits the hand well. Also it comes with multimedia buttons which are an added advantage.
5,"Its wonderful product. but for some reason the numeric keys alone were not working after 10 months. It may not be the case with everyone. Not sure,if it has any replacement/warranty period ?Instant One Touch Multimedia and Internet keys access really handy.Noiseless and smooth keystroke help us to have quiet typing experience.key letters looks new... didn't fade away.Optical mouse is very good."
5,"Received just now..!It's awesome keyboard with good look and design...and additional keys(home,mail,calculator,volume,browser etc.,.) in keyboard on both left and right were useful, easy to use and quickly accessible.Coming to the mouse... fits in the hand. Buttons were not that much hard and scroll button also...okay finally satisfied...Will gonna see how many days these product lasts longer..!"
4,Keyboard is good lightweight everything is fine. Seller is telling lie that it's made in India it's absolutely false I've attached images to show that it's made in China.
2,"Item is working OK. I have just received the item. In fact I am typing this comment using this keyboard only.However, The Item details as shown in the description is not correct. The keyboard has been shown as a product of India, but it is  a Made in China product. I would have returned it for selling product by displaying mis-information, but I needed in urgently. So, I shall have to keep it.If anyone decides to buy it as Indian product, rethink, it's not."
3,Key pad makes noise while pressing thats the only drawback
2,"The keyboard doesn't have Home, End, Page-up, Page-down keys that are basic and important keys. It has got a Num Lock light but doesn't even have a Num Lock key!"
3,Num lock is not available not present
4,"if u r normal user, go for it"
5,High price
1,It's ok but not good
1,Disappointed
5,Good keyboard & small size
1,My Laptop is Z560 I had purchased from you because your price was only ‚Çπ787But after installing on my laptop I found L key had manufacturing defect and not working plus back side is also has defect.I request seller please verify your product before selling online.
5,While ordering I c was in doubt.  But when received the quality was very good.  Packing also double properly. It for properly in the laptop.  Works fine üëçüèª
1,Worste products waste of money after one month not working

4,Nice product
5,Working fine with my lenovo G570 laptop.
4,Good product.
5,Good
5,good
3,I am using this from a month and I had found that the quality is very nice & cuttings are accurate for keys.but I had noticed that this product is over priced.It will be better if it is 150 or 200 rs.That's why I had given 3 stars
4,"+ It perfectly fits the keyboard..- attracts dust.(it is it‚Äôs purpose but it feels like blowing air can get dust on it)- after few days of typing on it, cover gets too attached to the keys, it feels like its stuck to keys with some kind of oily adhesive.. may be due to lack of air(personally i dont like it).. i ocationlly pull the cover on such keys by pinching it. For this, one less star.."
3,Quality is good. Transparency can be improved. It is translucent.Only thing which bothers me is the comfortable level.I feel more comfortable to type without this guard. But I don't get that comfortable to type fastlly after putting it. I assumed that it would come around 80% of it. But it is around 60-70%.Use it if you are very concerned abt the dust.
4,"This is amazing product. And it's fit. It's little bit thin. If it's not, then it'll be best product. But if compare to other products, it's best key-guard for lenovo laptop. I recommend transparent one because you can see your actual keys. Some model have some different key changes. So you can not worry after it."
1,It is not compatible for my HP 15-dk0264TX LAPTOP. Otherwise the product was good but returning it.
5,"I bought for lenevo S540 model, first impression is good, fit to keyboard and also look good in backlit keyboard. Thank you üôè"
4,"I bought this one for my Lenovo ideapad slim 3 ,it's suitable and fit for the keyboard,but the price is little bit high,I bought it for 373 inr, it's looks only below 200 inr."
5,The best keyboard  cover with a fine quality and thickness is too good ...its absolutely  transparent  and not at all opaque...I bought it for 376 which is worth the product the printed mrp is 900 .....so just go for it....
4,It is worthy but not a sticky thing and it is fitting well. It is made up of tubber.
3,Ok...
2,Not Sticking to the keyboard from the edges near space bar key. Thickness is okay. A bit costly.
4,It's perfectly fit for Lenovo IdeaPad S540 15.6inch model.
3,"Very bad packaging, no complaints in regard to the product, but packaging could be made better with some customer satisfaction perspective."

2,"I was really looking forward to use this monitor as it sounded perfect for each of my needs of work, leisure, gaming and large display*QHD resolution*IPS display*HDR""AMD Freesync*75Hz refresh rate and*32"" screen sizeTrusting LG and Amazon I ordered it on the day of launch only to be disappointed by the poor build quality(See images)Uneven panel gapsUnreasonably high screen(IPS) bleedingOne of the other reasons I opted for this monitor was the support of a feature called Dual Controller where one can control 2 machines with one set of keyboard and mouse basically magic! Sadly found out that a necessary part of using this feature called Picture by picture is not supported rendering the 'Dual controller' useless. Also dosent work with VPN connection which many of us need on work PCs"
5,"I bought this monitor a while back and here's my experience:The Good:1) Has IPS panel thus has excellent viewing angles.2) Anti glare coating3) Height , tilt and z-axis rotation4) Plenty of pre-configured picture modes5) Gaming mode with black stabilizer6) Multiple inputs7) Easy to use joystick controlThe bad:1) No y axis rotation.2) HDR is not that great, still looks premature and may wash out the colours a bit.3) No build in speakers.4) Very heavy"
5,"Iam quite happy with the performance of the monitor. LG 27UK650 4k IPS.I had bought a benq 32"" 4k VA monitor at 39k, but returned it due to poor performance. There was also a grey display bleed on it. The colour reproduction on it was not accurate, especially red. It was also too big for my eyes and got strain after using it. Remember that Pixel density matters and viewing distance. Decide for yourself on that.LG monitor with IPS panel is much better. Iam using it with macbookpro 15"" and didn't go for LG 27UK850 (43k price) as the only benefit in that is a usb-c port (and additional usb 3.0 ports often unused) with reverse charging. But if you use a single usb-c to HDMI port (good quality with 60hz at 3k price) it also works in the same way but no charging happens. And it is always good to use the original company charger for laptop for longer battery life than using low 60watts of reverse power in the case of LGUK850. Hence LGUK650 (33k price) was apt for me as I use an additional 2.1 speakers (better than ibuilt speakers), taking audio out from the monitor. The menu and the joystick is very intuitive and also easy for volume control. I also noted that audio switching in usb-c to usb-c sometimes doesn't work automatically (in benq) in utube.Colour reproduction in this LGUK650 is superb and is at par with my macbookpro. Good contrast ratio. Sleek design and white back makes it even stunning especially for my led light bounced on the wall. Stand is also sturdy as I use a height adjustable table. I haven't figured out how to run the mac in clamshell mode without connecting power cable to laptop. Probably it doesn't work.Go for LGUK850 only if you really need usb-c at that price point."
1,"Received the monitor today and I'm very impressed with the bright display and crisp colors, the text is sharp and clear, the color calibration is good out of the box.The build quality is also good.Unfortunately, I got a defective panel which has severe backlight bleed issue, I could have accepted it if the backlight bleeding was equal from all corners, but it is worst on the right side and affecting the color uniformity, as you can see in the attached white image, it has a red tone on the left side and blue tone on the right side, it is more visible in real.I'm giving 3 stars due to the mentioned issue and going to request a replacement, I'll update the review and give 5 stars if I get a good panel.If I get a defective panel again, I'll reduce it to 1 star.*Update after replacement-I have received the replacement, and surprisingly it has the same problem! I can accept the backlight bleed or IPS glow, but can't accept severe color variation on the screen, you can see the color variation in the attached image, color tones on the right side and left side are totally different, is this acceptable? Going to return it and I won't purchase any monitor from Amazon from now on."
1,Looking at the specs I ordered without any second thought. The first monitor had huge IPS glow. Thinking a defective piece requested for replacement. The second one had IPS glow and huge backlight bleeding. The stand material looks so cheap. I did not expect this from LG. I think they are selling defective products via Amazon.
3,"I've bought this for my Xbox One X.If you have premium console like Xbox one X and Ps4 Pro then go for it. For PC gaming 4K resolution is too much even for my GTX 970 card. If you want to buy this monitor other than gaming, its not true HDR even itsupports HDR10. Don't use HDR Effect feature for SDR content it looks ridiculous.After one year of usage corners are turning to red after watching for 3 hours then back to normal only after turning it off for 1 hour."
4,"Let me start by saying this first: This is a good SDR monitor which is decent for HDR usage - It is not great.I not going to waste time one reviewing the trivial stuff such as ergonomics and style - you can get that from anywhere on the web. I am going to focus on performance and colour reproductionSDR performance----------------This monitor has a really good SDR performance. It has good colour gamut and brightness and decent contrast ratio (1200:1 native). Colour really pop and it comes packed with several colour profiles. In my experience the most accurate - not the most good looking - profile is the SMPTE-C profile. However I switched to the 'Custom' profile and manually adjusted the other parameters like: colour temperature, rgb levels... and got a better result that has delta Es under 0.68.The panel has pretty good gray uniformity, but the black uniformity is not that impressive; but, it is not a deal breaker, and you have to expect it from any consumer grade IPS panel.HDR performance----------------The monitor does suppoer HDR signals on both HDMI and Display Ports. It is not a true 10 bit panel; it uses 8 bit panel with FRC. This is pretty common now a days while HDR is still in its infancy. The thing is you wouldn't notice much of difference between true 10 bit and 8 bit+FRC for consumer applications. A true 10 bit panel only makes a difference for true professionals such as Colour graders, those in the photography industry, and movie industry who generate HDR content. If you only want consume HDR games and movies 8 bit+FRC should not be a concern; in fact, there are other more important considerations such as: brightness, contrast levels and black levels.The peak brightness of this monitor is only 450 nits, while HDR specification requires at least 1000 nits. This is where it gets tricky. The HDR specification was originally developed with TVs in mind; they were not meant for PC monitors which sits much closer to your eyes. For PC monitor 1000nits brightness if unnecessary; such brightness levels could damage  your eyes. This is why VESA came up with the DisplayHDR specifications that are meant for PC monitors. This new spec has 3 levels DisplayHDR 400, 600 and 1000 - the number indicating the target brightness level. So this monitor KIND OF meets the entry level DisplayHDR 400. I says kind of because while it meets the brightness level requirement, it does not meet other criteria listed in the specification - so this is not a DisplayHDR certified monitor.Contrast levels should be around 10,000:1 for good HDR performance. This is required for showing details within dark areas; a lower contrast will result in the dark areas being too dark or grayish hiding away the details in them. Sadly, this monitor does not even come close to 10,000:1. The monitor only has 1200:1 contrast ratio. This is expected from IPS panels. VA panels on the other hand offers better contrast ratios and hence better rendering of black and dark scenes - but they suffer from bad viewing angles and does not provide great colour accuracy.The black levels on this monitor is also not that great. In a dark room, blacks appear dark grey. It is not much of a problem in a moderately lit room. This is due to the lack of local dimming. There are IPS monitors with local dimming, but they are insanely expensive.So the HDR performance is just decent. The main reasons by it fails to provide a great HDR experience are the lack of local dimming and average constrast ratio.That being said, let me remind you one thing: HDR on PC monitors is in a messy state. I have not found any monitor that meets all the HDR criteria yet. Some new panels are expected to come out by mid-2020 that could improve this. But at the moment there is no point in wasting a lot of money for better HDR performance as the gains don't justify the price.Gaming performance------------------Very good monitor for gaming; at 5ms the response times are really great for casual and semi-pro gamers. The only serious limitation is the 60Hz max FPS. But then again, running modern games at 4K at even 60Hz would require a beast of a PC; so, I wouldn't worry about that for now.If you are a professional gamer or mostly play fast paced games like CS, you should look elsewhere; this is not the monitor for you.Multi-media performance-----------------------This is a really great monitor for watching moives and streaming live sports coverage. The colours look really impressive and as long as you are not sitting in a really dark room, the black levels are also decent.Even though the monitor is limited in its HDR rendering capabilities, it does manage to make a significant difference. I have watched several 4K HDR Hollywood movies and they looked amazing. I have found that sitting in a slightly lit room gives you the best experience with this monitor.General usage performance-------------------------Becasue of the high pixel density of this monitor everything is crisp and clear. You will notice no aliasing with text. In Windows a scaling factor of 150% is required to make texts readable.Usual Issues with IPS-------------------------Backlight bleeding: Backlight bleeding is when the LED backlight steals its way through the panel into the foreground. This usually manifests as a whiter or yellow tint around the edges. Sadly almost every IPS panel has this problem. And the panel I got hs this issues, although not very serious. I can see a tint of yellow in places along the bottom border. This appears to be caused by the bezel pushing a bit too much into the panel; indicating a manufacturing oversight. However this only becomes visible when brightness is increased above 50. However when in HDR mode, the monitor switches to high brightness and this bleed becomes noticeable, especially when the scene is dark. If the content you are viewing - games or movies - is not too dark or black it is not an issues. But when you are watching  movie with top and bottom black bars, this yellow tint is a bit annoying.One thing to remember here is when it comes to IPS there is a thing called panel lottery: no two panels are the same, it will depend of your luck; you may end up with a really good or a bad one or something in the middle.IPS Glow: This monitor does have IPS glow as does any other IPS panel. Unless you are in really dark room and watching dark content at an angle, this wouldn't be a problemCheck the attached image: The whitish overlay is IPS glow. The yellow tint inside the red circle is Backlight bleed. NOTE: IPS glow and bleed always look exaggerated when photographed. It is not that profound when watched in person.Usual Questions Regarding HDR:1. Does this monitor support 4K HDR @ 60Hz over HDMI?Yes, it does. The HDMI ports on this monitor are HDMI 2.0 and supports HDR meta data. One thing to remember is to enable ULTRA HD Deep Color from the monitor settings for the HDMI port you are using.2. Does this monitor support 4K HDR @ 60Hz over Display Port?Again, yes. Now this is something a lot of people seem to be confused about. LG data sheet says that the monitor has DisplayPort v1.2. Now the version 1.2 originally did not have any specification for HDR meta data; this was added only in Display Port 1.4. Now the thing is there are no Display Port 1.2 or Display Port 1.4 devices. These numbers - 1.2, 1.4 - are just versions of Display Port specification document. So a manufacturer could implement a device with a Display Port and implement some features from v1.2 and some from v1.4. This is what LG has done. They have implemented support for HDR metadata into this monitor. So if you connect this monitor to the display port of a source device  (Console, PC ...) that also has implemented the HDR metadata support, it will accept 4K HDR signal at 60Hz. At the moment, GTX 10XX and newer cards support this. GTX 9 series does not have support for HDR meta data.3. How to enable HDR on the monitor?There is nothing to enable. When the monitor receives and HDR signal, it will automatically switch to HDR mode4. How to enable HDR on Windows 10?To use HDR on Windows, you have to first enable it. To do that go to Display Settings - you'll see a toggle there that says 'Play HDR Games and apps'. Just enabled it. Note that this will result in everything else in Windows will look washed out. This is normal and is a known problem when Windows tries to map SDR content to HDR colour space. Unfortunately there is no way around it. Hopefully Microsoft will come up with some solution.Alternatives:From my research, there is only one alternative around this price range:Benq EW3270U - This is a VA panel and provides much deeper blacks and contrast ratio. But it has very limited brightness and viewing angles.Summary:A very good monitor for the price asked. Does support HDR at 4K 60Hz. Has common IPS issues like IPS Glow and Backlight bleeding - but nothing too serious. Very good SDR colour gamut. HDR performance is limited due to average contrast and brightness levels. Great viewing angles and pixel density."
5,"Resolution is excellent, I use it as a secondary screen with my retina display MacBook pro and it puts the retina 15"" display to shame.I also use this as  my PS4 Pro monitor and the graphics are crisp and sharp at 60 Hz. Still waiting for games that can deliver true 4k and HDR.Price is high but compared to buying it in North America and lugging it all the way to India, the price is just right.Cons: I wish it had two display ports so that I could run both Gaming console and Computer on Display Port.10/10 in my books"
1,"It seems I've got a bad piece. There is backlight leakage from four different areas around the edges (see the attached image). At first, I tried to ignore it, but after watching 3-4 hours of Netflix, I noticed that light leakage was causing significant obfuscation of visuals in the affected areas. I have now requested a replacement and am hoping I'll get a substitute that is free of any defects. Will post an update about it. Other than light leakage, I am overall borderline satisfied with this piece. üòê**UPDATE (10.10.2019)**The replacement arrived this morning. And with it, frustration and apprehension. I received a defective piece originally, which got replaced by an even more defective piece üò° ü§¨. My mind just cannot grasp how it is possible for LG's Quality Control engineers to miss such defects during the testing phase, unless of course they deliberately ignored these faults. Please take a look at the attached images. The one marked ""Monitor No. 2"" is what I received in replacement. Even a 5-year old can take one look and tell that something's not right with the panel.I wonder if these big MNCs have completely abandoned all Quality Control checks from their operations. And it's not just me complaining; take a look at other monitor reviews on the internet, of not just this brand and model, but others too. Thousands of independent evaluators and users are reporting issues like severe backlight leakage, poor color reproduction, discoloration, and what not. Even Dell, the undisputed king of computer monitors a decade ago, is these days receiving flak from users for poor quality products. Shame on LG, Samsung, Asus, Acer, Dell, and all other manufacturers for selling defective products to unsuspecting customers. While we customers struggle with returns and refunds, they get to sit on their laurels and count our hard-earned money. Not fair. Poor quality control practices are a LOSE-LOSE prospect for everyone. The CUSTOMER loses his faith. The SELLER loses his business. MANUFACTURER loses customers' trust and profits. So, why do it?What now? For starters, I am not going to buy LG monitors anymore. Two failed products in a row is my threshold limit. I have neither patience nor money to waste on LG's junk anymore. I am also now totally apprehensive of buying any expensive products at Amazon because I am scared of putting myself through this tedious and uncertain process of returning/replacement/refund again. What if Amazon refuses to replace or return a defective product in future on some technicality in its policy? I'm starting to see disconcerting risk in it now. After many years, I am forced to reminisce the good old days when one could walk into a store; see a thing for what it is, touch it, feel it, use it; and if satisfied, order one for the household. In an email, I have appealed to Amazon to disclose return rates and/or other relevant data on product pages to enable customers to make informed decisions. This can also shame errant manufacturers into tightening their Quality Control checks. I hope Amazon's management will initiate positive and effective action in customers' interest.I have requested for a return of this defective monitor. As and when the process is completed and I have received my funds, I will post a final update. Until then, üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è."
5,"I have been splitting hair between 34 inch and 32 inch display. Having already used 32 inch monitor previously it was difficult for me to consider 27 inch. Interestingly there are way more options in 27 inch range. If you want IPS 4k panel, you will need 65k+ budget. In 34, if you go to 2k res it is again 68+k. I could see pixels in 32 inch full hd previously. Hence my criteria was 2k minimum with IPS. Frankly this was the only monitor that fits this criteria within budget. I am happy to report that with 2k res, everything is crisp. I love this ips panel, no light bleeding for me. Love the colors as well. You should know that this monitor runs at 60 H at 2K res and 75hz monitor at Full HD. This is NOT a 10 bit panel in case you were wondering. This is 8 bit panel and probably FRC to match 99% SRGB space. The monitor display is matt finish minimizing the reflection. The stand is sturdy and very well made. I did not like the HDR mode and prefer the standard mode. I bought this monitor for 25499 Rs. In USA this model is sold for much less(250 USD, 18000 INR). But that is the exact case for almost all monitor and electronic items. The monitor brightness is pretty good and i am running it at 77%. I like the dual controller where i can use the keyboard and mouse of pc1(hdmi1)to pc2(hdmi2). The box includes one hdmi and one display cable. The box delivered cleanly without any damage at all. The borders are really slim and that makes this monitor look beautiful. The matt screen floats front and the borders are inside the screen which looks so good. I have run the dead pixel and light bleeding test and happy to report my panel is flawless. I will use it for my office work and photo editing for which this monitor will be perfect. Remember 4k is going to be hard on your graphics card and 4k ips panels are crazy costly. So glad i got this finally. And if you are thinking about 34 inch dilemma like me do ask yourself is Full HD 34 ips or 2k 32 ips as they are similar budget. Attaching pictures to help you decide. Other reviews had not been helpful for me so i was in a doubt. I decided to make this review to help others like me. Get ready to spoil yourself. One thing i must note that when i connected external speakers via the headphone jack on the monitor the speakers were not very loud even at 100 percent, so i connected the speakers from the headphone jack from my laptop directly. One other thing is that the ports on the back is little flimsy as if you too much pressure to connect the HDMI, the entire port board seems to go inside, so just connect carefully."
1,"Quality is average,  dosent look like 10 bit hdr sceen. Blacks are not true black. ,the price is drop by 3k after Amazon August sale, this is frustrating and seller is clearly deceptive."
1,"After using one year:The monitor developed blind spots on all corners and the colors faded away. Many people reported this issue but I thought it was one of such issue. But not the case, this monitor not worth buying. Save your money on some other good one like Samsungs. Don't waster your money one this.Following is my initial review after purchase:This is the best monitor I have used so far. I was using Dell 24 inch full HD monitor and I want to upgrade to UHD just for the added real estate for my development environment. Here are some points I noted so far.- The monitor works only at 30 fps with HDMI 1.4 output on UHD. 30 fps means lots of blurryness and flickering. So if you need 60 fps output, make sure your system supports HDMI 2.0 or have displayport available.- If you are using Intel NUC, you may want to purchase mini-DP to DP conversion cable as NUC have only mini displayport.- The monitor comes with DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable & HDMI cable in the package.- The monitor can be tilted and height adjusted which is very convenient- HDR mode is just awesome, the colors popup and sharp- Since the edges are very narrow (near bezel-less), the size of monitor is same as my old 24 inch monitorSo overall, it is very good monitor and recommended for everyone."
5,"Bought monitor during non-sale time. Govt reduced gst for monitors. So price of the monitor gone down abit. I bought it for 34k and 1.5k cash back and zero cost 6 month EMI.Coming to the monitor, i always prefer LG monitors with IPS panel. My previous monitor was a LG IPS 24 inch monitor, which served me more than 3 years without any problems. Picture quality of this 4k panel is so good. 28 inch is perfect size for gaming. Played alots of 4k games with xbox one X, including RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2, witcher 3 etc. Colors pops up. Even though the peak brightness of the monitor is 450nits, colors pops with all HDR enabled games. Played horizon zero dawn PS4 god of war and so many PS4 games with HDR, and I am not going back playing SDR games. God of war looks phenomenal even with base PS4 with HDR enabled. If you are a console gamer like me who doesn't prefer TV, GET THIS MONITOR. Worth every rupee.There is small amount of bleeding in this monitor. Not noticeable generally.Overall, i am totally satisfied with this monitor."
3,Gr8 picture quality but too much of backlight bleeding in my monitor. Thought of getting replaced with new one but only refund is available. Loosing my offers now
4,"Packaging was good. Delivery was quick. Make sure you buy from Appario Business seller on Amazon.It was a surprisingly light weight box.My First Glance Review :1. I don‚Äôt think the panel supports HDR as Windows 10 refused to detect any HDR capabilities. HDR is listed only under effects as a kind of ‚Äúcolour filter‚Äù in the settings hence, HDR is not massively supported. This means, Netflix might not detect HDR capability in the display.2. Brightness is very good indoors and even 60-70% is more than enough. The display also has an anti glare coating (nowhere mentioned) which makes it worth every penny in a studio environment where I have a window at the back and flood lights everywhere.3. It‚Äôs a 75Hz panel that supports FreeSync1. Don‚Äôt expect smooth gaming but it is more than capable for office work, YouTube, emails, texts, media, etc.4. You‚Äôll love the real estate of the screen. It‚Äôs huge and Windows10 does a great job at scaling.Tip- Download LG‚Äôs OnScreen app to toggle modes on the fly.5. The all-in-one single button can feel a bit flimsy to use but it‚Äôs a nice implementation.6. The plastic body feels a bit cheap and scratchy however the brilliant display makes up for it.Overall, not amazing for gaming or for consuming HDR content but good for everything else.I‚Äôll update my review in a month to see if something changes."
5,"12 days review:Pros:* You get real QHD (2560√ó1440) resolution* Brightness is too good. Photo and video is shot at 5% brightness.* Good refresh rate. Videos at 60Hz runs smoothly.* Installation is super easy* Overall looks cool on my table* Video editing, web designing is a breeze with this IPS panel screen* 3 years of warrantyCons:* Doesn't have an inbuilt speaker. (Not a deal breaker)Haven't tested gaming yet, will update on AMD freesync and refresh rate once i run some games on this display."
4,"The monitor is really good and even the IPS glow/bleeding is minimal but I'm using it with a Macbook Pro M1 and the text is really blurry. I think that MacOS is not really detecting the OS, as it shows it as a 31.5 monitor, while its actually 27.Even the Onscreen Control app doesn't detect it. I'm waiting for an update from LG or from Apple.For now if you wish to use it with Mac OS, avoid it or look for a 4K monitor.Update:So I was able to update the LG onscreen control app. The laptop now works fine in full native resolution of 2560x1440 but there is not way to scale UI to 125%, so every thing is really small. Its something that Windows supports but MacOS only supports 200% scaling and that too on 4K displays.You can use SwitchResX to create a custom 1080p HiDpi resolution but it doesn‚Äôt work on new M1 macbooks, as of now 03-Feb 2021.Tried both display port and hdmi methods. No luck."
1,The LG 27UK650 Constantly flickers while watching Youtube and on XBOX ONE X...Appario Retail Private Ltd- Going to return it. Kindly replace this defective Monitor
5,"I researched a lot of monitors and narrowed to this and 32 inch from Lenovo. Both are quad HD. But this is way better - mainly with brightness and modes. Mine did not have any light bleeding or dead pixels - Luckily no issues.I went with Quad HD not only since 4k is costly, but you will need a Display Port to get higher than 60 Hz on 4k. My laptop only has HDMI. also having Quad HD is better than Full HD for my photo editing.Tips for work mode - I use with Reader mode and my eyes doesn't strain after few hours, like it used to do with my previous 24 inch. If you want really crisp text, set the resolution to Quad HD and then set the scaling to 200%. This way you can still work from 5/6 feet away and see clear text.Movies and videos are really vivid. Try some wildlife or sea related videos, you will really see the colors. I haven't tried gaming on this yet. But tried to set at 75 Hz and it is good.There are no individual buttons, but a single joystick like button to manage the settings. There is also OnScreen control software which you can download from LG website (there is nothing for this model, but you can install the software listed for some other model - it still works). For Windows OS, this is better than using joystick.With windows I found no issues. With linux usage, I found some screen tearing with intel drivers on Quad HD resolution (I'm still researching how to fix this)."
5,"I bought this monitor for 21.5k during lightning deal. Picture Quality is amazing. I use this monitor for 60% coding, 20% YouTube/Netflix, 20% Gaming. Overall very satisfied.Few good to have features that is missing:1. no height adjustment. So, you cannot keep your laptop in front of it and work.2. no usb C port. Need to buy Usb c to hdmi adapter for macbook.3. No inbuilt speakers. I connected my external speakers to TV using 3.5mm jack."
4,"Great Monitor...got this at 22999/- on great indian festival .... Using it for couple of days...First Impression : Wow , just wow... no edge bleed no dead pixel nothing everything is perfect... ips glow is balanced... HDR option is great but at 22k price what i got i am happy with it... bcs HDR is a pricy aspect... but you will be happy with it...Picture Quality: Is top notch... true ips panel with excellent viewing angle and color production ... true gem i can say...Display port cable and hdmi cable will be provided with the container .... so no need to worry.... just buy it without any second thought...  and yeah you can enable gsync with it... it has freesync version 2... so you can enable it with gsync via nvidia control panel...So Happy Puja... and stay safe and enjoy with your family and if you are a single like me then just enjoy by yourself üòâ..."
1,"Update Dec 2020:- After replacing display panel 3 times in just 2 months. LG replaced the unit in OCT 2020. Since then it is working fine. I will update review again if I face any issue. Also warranty is for 3 years not 1 Year which I assumed earlier.I have used Samsung, Dell and HP monitor in last 15 years. This LG monitor is worst. Cheap quality plastic has been used. Now the real issue. I have purchased the monitor in Sept 2019. After 2 months (Dec 2019). it started to show black line on right side. Since it was under warranty, Screen panel was replaced by LG.In March 2020, At the time when India (most of the world) is under lock down and we need to work from home. This LG Monitor stated to show red color in all four corners. As day starts it screen looks normal and as day progress red color started to spread and become darker. It is still in warranty so I will get it repair when lock down will be taken off.I didn't except 2 big issues in just 6 months of usage. I will push hard to refund or replace the whole monitor not the just part in it.Now my bigger concern is what will happen after 6 months when warranty will end. I think repair cost will be huge.PLEASE DONT BUY IT. EVEN YOUR ARE GETTING IT CHEAP UNDER ANY SALES & OFFERS."
5,"Bought this monitor on prime day sale and it's working flawlessly. Ppl who are saying it doesn't have HDR10 just bcz of 350 nits brightness they should get some hardware knowledge and can check this monitor specifications on LG website too. It's not a typical TN panel with 1000 nits brightness lol.So far it's working good , display and colour quality is gorgeous  , software is easy to use , multiple modes to suite your needs and many more."
5,"My unit has one dead pixel in the lower right corner when new.The stand is absolute rubbish. The monitor is always shaking, even while (for example) typing on a keyboard in close proximity.The panel itself (my sample at least) had minimal IPS glow and close to zero backlight bleeding. This was the major consideration to not return the monitor as there was never any guarantee that a replacement would not present those other issues.The colours are excellent and you get three- and six-colour adjustments which help get a more accurate presentation. The pixel pitch is just right for slightly older eyes - not so small as to make text hard to read, and individual pixels are just about indistinguishable at a couple of feet.The 75Hz limit is problematic for those looking for high-refresh panels, but this has no aspirations to gaming anyway, so it's a compromise. ARGB support is really the only thing that makes this uncompetitive with my Dell U3017, the colours are slightly off even with a wide-ish gamut. But that cost three times as much, so it's not a fair comparison."
2,"This was my first LG monitor(probably the last as well) and the first thing i noticed out of the box was the display was not calibrated as can be seen on the features page. So, took a while for me to set it up and trust me it was not easy. So, overall it was tedious process.The comes the backlight bleed test which was so uneven when seen from different angles. Primarily, the right half of the screen looked off which i assumed for IPS glow but then did some research, compared it side by side to some other IPS monitors only to find out this cannot be entirely IPS glow. This was a mix of IPS glow, backlight bleed and poor panel assembly. Hence, had to return it which was hassle free thanks to Amazon.The replacement was delivered the next day, and that was a complete disaster!! it was a used product with power on time of 37 hrs along with the issues listed above amplified which was quite obvious considering it was a used one. So, this is the first time facing this issue with the seller as its a reputed one and have previously purchased lot of products from this seller which were clean. So, not really sure what went wrong this time.So, coming to this product would say the build is good however the quality control by LG should have been much better. Would not discourage to go for it as all panels are not equally made so you never know you might get a good piece."
5,"Bought this for 27,000 Rs. The Monitor is an effective option at this price range for 32 inches as Acer is the only other manufacturer that decently prices monitors in India. Prior to this I had a 32"" Full HD Acer Monitor which was average. This monitor has a nice matte coating and its color reproduction is the best I've seen in an LG. No issues with PWM on low brightness. The viewing angles are good. There is no back light bleed on my unit or any dead pixels. Consider the speakers to be non-existent.The unit is very easy to setup after removing the packaging. Takes about three minutes to set it up. If your priority isn't FPS gaming or Art Editing, this monitor is probably the best 32"" choice you have in India as those two setups would anyway cost you more than a lakh. QHD is also a perfect resolution in this size for casual use such as office work, entertainment and gaming. 4K would be overkill and too graphic card and memory intensive at this point. The jump from 60 to 75 Hz is noticeably better though I didn't expect any change. As a film producer, I've seen and used a lot of professional equipment and know that this is a good purchase. Will give a 4.4/5"
5,"It works flawlessly with my PS4 pro with resolution set to max and HDR turned on without any hiccups. It has two HDMI Ports HDMI 1 & HDMI 2 you can easily connect PC in one port and console on other port and switch between them by pressing provided button going to input. It also have different kinds of display presets for gaming like FPS 1, FPS 2 and few other modes. You can customize as per your liking in the custom mode. It has audio jack just above DC adapter connection behind the panel. Through which you can connect your headphones/speakers without even needing the audio jack in the PC. Display is IPS, Res- 4K and supports HDR10, display latency- 5ms. So if you have a gaming PC or consoles like XBOX One X or PS4 PRO then this monitor would be your choice in this price segment."
5,"Using this for programming, video & photo editing.Very good colors, excellent balance of cost and quality for a 4K UHD computer monitor."
1,"Worst thing about this monitor is price bought it on prime day sale for 26k and current price is 24k....About screen - great viewing angles, good color reproduction... Its not true HDR, not meant for gaming... Bing problem is even FULLHD videos will not look great in this screen you need minimum 2k video.... For that u need good internet connection.... Love sports doesn't look best trust me even though I've 100mbps connection.... So consider these before buying"
5,"Let me begin saying that I use this 4K monitor as an external display for my 2018 MBP. The colors and contrast are just impeccable. I'm an engineer and a photographer by trade so I LOVE to see proper color reproduction and at the same clean, crisp, anti-aliased text when I am coding.The packaging on this is beautifully done! The product came in good shape and I haven't had any issues like other's complain. I'm sorry it has happened to you. Electronic items like these are a throw of dice sometimes.Anyhoo, right out the box the contrast, brightness and gamma didn't look that great so I tweaked the settings according to the lighting in my room to fit the bill. TIP: I try to match the display quality with my MBP's retina display to get that consistency. You could also go deeper into the color config of the monitor RGB's HS (hue and saturation) sliders if you want to ""fine tune"". If you are using this for your MacBook, please make sure you calibrate the display and create a profile for it (under System Preferences>Displays>Color).Cable management is neatly done behind the display panel I love how wireless my desk looks!Picture quality is rock solid. And for the price (~31-32k) it think it an amazing value for money. Also, if you guys are using MacBook Pro with this display, please buy a cable good enough to give you 60Hz frame rate on the Display Port (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07BBHCPXH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)"
1,"1. All HDR display flavours won't work except HDR effect, will not use vivid option in on screen support software from LG site2. When attached to type-c 4k 60htz the HDR video will stuck for fraction of second intermittently3. While using as a duan monitor with Lenovo yoga s740 or 750, the apps will crash with her enabled and with max resolution and dpi set to around 125%. I am sure about this testing because when I used 27UL500 on same laptops everything was stable.4. When split more is enabled for 4 windows then apps will flicker frequently.5. Using MS Teams for video or audio call in monitor screen will crash the application when it works fine on laptop main display itself and also work fine with LG 27UL500 model so offcourse it's ab issue with this monitor and it's compatibility with Lenovo yoga s740 4k ips laptop."
4,"I'm using this with a Ryzen 3700x and Geforce RTX 2070.Pros- Decent sharpness as you expect from LG- Stylish stand, thin bezels. Good for multi monitor setup- Color calibration is good for Photo/Video editing.- VESA mount compatible- Works with LG display software. Saves unnecessary button clicks.- Comes with both Display and HDMI cables.- Minimal branding. Great for aesthetics.- Audio outCons- Brightness issue. I have another 27inch LG27GL650F FHD monitor side by side and the brightness is lower compared to that. I had to spend a lot of time calibrating and trying out different profiles to reach an acceptable level of brightness. Problem seems to be in the firmware rather than the display itself.- Takes a lot of time to calibrate. Specially if you are connecting through HDMI, the brightness seems washed out.- Overpriced in India. Should not be more than 30-31K.- No G-Sync. Not suitable for competitive gaming if you have an Nvidia Card.- In FHD mode (125% zoom), icons gets pixelated. No super sampling.- Viewing angle is not that great this being an IPS panel. Expected better from LG.If you are looking for a 4K for media consumption, light gaming and decent Photo/Video editing, go for it. For anything more than that, you might want to go for a Samsung display."
2,"Best budget 4k @60Hz display for gaming(4k alert, RTX2080TI recommended), moderate lvl creativity(99% sRGB only) and HDR(entry level, but still very bright +350 nits, eyes strain alert). I was really doubtful about Indian stock quality after reading so many negative reviews. But I received a perfect screen with no back light bleed(as it should be). Although IPS glow(which is normal for IPS panels) is there and you might notice that in a dark room with a dark scene/image. But definitely not a deal breaker considering the selling price.Update: Display showing image retention issue. See pics. Selling lower quality monitors in India."
5,"I bought this monitor in sale in Nov/Dec 2019.It's refresh rate is advertised 60Hz but with it's cable provided and extra cables I had, it doesn't seem to work.After seeing review, I tried different cables,  USB type C hub etc etc.. but it didn't work as I expected and as it is advertised.What I tried:1. A dozen HDMI cable. USB Type C Hub.2. Provided HDMI and DP cable.Result:  Refresh rate at 30Hz with No HDR.  (See attached pictures).Expectation: Refresh Rate at 60 Hz with HDR as advertised here at Amazon or site.Advise: Avoid this  purchase if you are expecting 60 Hz and HDR as features on 4k.Oct 5, 2020: Sorry for creating confusion. My sincere apolise for above comments.1. It does support HDR and refresh rate 60Hz.My laptop supported HDMI 1.4 that's why it was not working. Buying a usb c to HDMI cable worked perfectly."
4,"This monitor works perfectly for office work and very light casual gaming.even if you are a moderate, it becomes extremely difficult to connect the monitor to your your PC as many PCs have different display ports like the mini display port, type c and HDMI. It is very difficult in India to find a reliable 4K converters for that matter even 4K cables. HDR in this monitor does not work that great so if you are looking for HDR effect then you will be hundred percent disappointed. The response rate of the monitor is fine.one more throwback for this monitor is that it does not get recognised as plug and play you have to manually download the software from LG website. I am using the latest version of windows 10 operating system but even then there is no plug and play."
2,"- The resolution is good but compatibility with various devices like firestick or even computers is not quite good. Cannot make the full use of the resolution.- Colors are not accurate straight out of the box. It is very hard to set it.- Menu/Software is not quite good to make the best use of the resolution. No manuals provided.- Headphone jack is of very cheap quality. Audio out of it is CRAPPY. There is also a small delay noticed.- Made of cheap plastic.- For watching TV, even 10K worth of TV would do much better.- Adaptive Response time is not quite good. Not smooth most of the time.- NO RETURN is so ridiculous. Forcing to keep a inferior quality product.- LG customer care of not quite prompt and does not sound knowledgeable."
5,"Best monitor you can buy in this price range. I wanted a QHD monitor since 4k is limited on content and need proper GPU to run smooth ( issue with office laptops). This monitor has excellent colors, contrast, viewing angles and ports. I got it for 25k and run great on 75Hz at 2k.HDR playback is also very good( tested on youtube), people saying you need 1000 nits for proper HDR need to check again since HDR has different standards. A reputed company like LG won't say its HDR without proper certification."
1,"Pathetic Seller he sold a defective piece and i had run behind LG for  getting it fixed. As per LG they will replace only with in 1 month of purchase and amazon also has the same policy so finally after repairing it, again with in 1 year of repair same issue resurfaces. now again i have to run behind LG. its been an year and not even a single apology or any concern from the seller. Always the same one liner we cant do anything its passed the replacement window from Amazon."
2,"The monitor is good if there are lots of bright stuff on screen and/or the room is well lit. Terrible backlight bleeding right from unpacking, not at all good for watching movies or anything with dark scenes or backgrounds. HDR is a gimmick at best on PC and doesn't work well, colors seemed washed out - you'd have to dig deep into nvidia settings and tweak to get a proper output for HDR content.Connects fine with HDMI but the display port does not support HDR. Xbox One detected HDR and switches to it while playing games or video."
4,"Orderd on 23 dec 20.Delivered 25 decide 20.Reviewed on 4 Jan 20.It is a good budget 2k (1440p) monitor. Received both dp and hdmi cable. Make sure while connecting your dp port don't have any part of cabinate coming out as obstacle for connection. Because the dp cable has larger connector part, otherwise you will see no display. Refresh rate is 75hz on 1440p resolution through dp cable, did not try on hdmi cable. Thankfully no dead pixel, no ips glow even in dark room. Also stand is not thay wobbly. Enjoying old games at 2k with dual core (pentium g4500) and r7 260x 1gb. Even crysis 2 is running good and 2k with highest setting. It has Freesync2 version and working great. No real hdr, it is just increasing brightness and adjusting the other parameter.Try contrast 60-70, brightness 50-57 to enjoy good colour and to protect eyes.Final verdict it is good to enjoy 2k gaming, watching movies for regular and casual user/ gamer."
1,"I bought it on a sale after saving up money only to get a damaged monitor used by someone else. After weeks of wasting my time and now another week to return and refund, I get nothing back. This was a pathetic experience and amazon does not want to be responsible in anyway.The monitor itself was good and I will buy this one properly at a local store, albeit at a higher price. I lost my trust on Amazon after 5 years. Will update the review again in the future if any changes are madeEdit 1: They took the monitor back and offered a refund but they didnt do a replacement like I asked. Immediately after I returned it, the deal was again active with a single piece! It seems they resold the used monitor they sent to me as new again to someone else!!"
5,"This is a very good 4k monitor from LG and for me it ticks all the boxes to be a great buy.PROS -1). Very bright (can reach upto 400 nits)2). On screen software is nice to control your monitor settings without using physical buttons .3). LG IPS panel -Colors are brilliant on this ips panel.4). Very minimal backlight bleed - Even though this is an ips panel the blacklight bleed is bare minimum.5). Design - very thin bezels gives you an immersive feel and stand is quite sturdy and very adjustable.I also think it lacks few things that I noticed.CONS -1). It lacks Swivel movement , so you have to move whole monitor with stand in your direction.2). HDR is not that effective .3). Even when I adjust its stand‚Äôs height to minimum, the monitor still feels to be placed at a high position .Also it was a great value for money at 28700/- effective price during Great Indian sale."
5,I simply loved this monitor. Before I had LG 27uk850 which is a bad monitor and had light bleeding issues so I had returned that monitor. But now this monitor is beautiful and I am using it with my MacBook Pro and with imac also. Yes it's not upto the level of MacBook Pro or IMac retina screens but still it gives very good output with MacBook Pro.I have not purchased the USB c version because don't want to charge my MacBook Pro from usb c cable which I think 60w and can damage your MacBook Pro in future with regular charges so I opted for this model and using the display port ( have to purchased it separately) and charging my laptop with the original power adapter by Apple.Cables: The HDMI  cable and display port cable which comes with the monitor have no use. They don't give the 60htz output and gives only 30htz which is laggy. So you have to purchase the proper 60htz cables. LG should provide the good quality cables which is the negative point of any Lg monitors.Light Bleeding: I am lucky that I didn't get any bleeding issues with this monitor but yes IPS glow is there which is a common thing with all IPS panels. Remember light bleeding and IPS Glow both are separate things because some people count IPS glow as bleeding issue.Monitor Stand. I don't like the stand ( which is a personal choice ) which came with it. Cant even move it to different positing properly so I have purchased the gas arm stand which is very smooth and your desk looks very clean with it.Overall I am very satisfied with the monitor.
5,Pros  - Screen is really good  - Feels Premium  - Height adjustable  - Split screen also works download the driver from lg.com for this model. Pretty sweet feature.  - On screen screen function also works by downloading driver from lg.comCons-  On 4K resolution everything becomes so small it is not readable. I know this is the thing with every 4K monitor out there. So most of the time I keep the resolution at 2k for better readability.No in speakerNo USB port
5,"I am totally satisfied with this monitor.The HDR isn't as pronounced as they say because it's HDR 400. But the the monitor has consistent colors and great color accuracy. The stand is very sturdy and has appropriate weight when doing all types of adjustments. It's a great stand after all. I would say unless you plan to buy a separate monitor stand, buying this UL650 model is highly recommended over the standard UL600 model of this monitor. Because the stand is well worth the money. The only complaint would be that it doesn't swivel left or right. But it can do literally every other movement we'll ever need.Let's talk about the overall build quality, it's just great. The vesa mount is very satisfying to use. The overall body of the monitor is made of good quality plastics. The white color looks really good.It comes with 1x HDMI cable, 1x Display Port Cable and a CD. The CD was not packed properly it was just thrown inside the box along with the warranty papers. I couldn't find the software to install that will make things even better. When searched on LG website it shows no software available for this monitor model. Or when I found one, the download link didn't work.Anyways, this is a great monitor and is well worth the money. 4K looks stunning. Unfortunately my laptop isn't very powerful to run 4k60 smoothly. I'll be using this monitor with my new PC build that is coming soon. Until then I'll be using it in 2K 60hz mode.It still looks great in 2K 60Hz.27 inches might be a bit too big for many but as a video editor, I find more space adding upto the convenience. You could go with the 24 inch ones but I couldn't find a good 24 inch 4k monitor that is color accurate and has good reviews.Also 27 inches seem to be the sweet spot for monitor size especially for productivity and it looks like 27 inches is a standard size.The colors are very vibrant and has many color settings presets.Straight out of the box everything looks stunning. And the display is matte so you don't have to deal with reflections.It is an overall great monitor with great value for money.One complaint I would say is that the headphone jack in the back of the monitor is flimsy and not of good quality. It sounds bad when the headphone is connected to that port. It sounds excellent when I connect directly to my laptop.So I wouldn't use that headphone jack. Anyway it's just a small thing.If you want pure audio quality don't use that headphone jack.If you want pure picture quality this is the monitor to go at this price range.I'm very happy that I chose this.I will update the review if something goes wrong in the future."
5,"I am being honest in what i write here.... there really isn‚Äôt, literally, anything else in the market like this monitor at this price if you really have the need for it. Ultra gaming is a given but need for content creation is also way above average. This product from LG really is a masterpiece for this price. I love it entirely."
5,"a nice monitor, good colors, hdr works when connected to macbook 16inch, no visible back light bleeds. overall happy with the purchase."
4,"After spending a 10 days of doing extensive research, I bought this LG computer monitor for coding, and love the clarity. text look crisp and clear. It's reader mode is fantastic for working for long hours, as I spend 8-9 hours per day for office work and 0% strain to eyes. Some of it's unique features such as pivot, dual controller, and screen split makes you productive and the coding work easy."
5,Not a gamer. Mainly for work from home office work. Connected to HP laptop. Very simple installation. Texts are clear in documents and no distortions. Color looks pretty. The up/down movement is really useful to get the height right. Just push monitor up or down to adjust height.  Not a bezel less but looks good.
4,"Pros:Excellent Panel.Accurate and vibrant colors.Can get really bright.Good Black levels.The stand provided is really nice.Cons:Wobbles a bit if the surface shakes.Price is slightly on the higher side for the the features.One would atleast expect a USB C at this price point bit it doesn't have one. It's available in UL850 which is 10k more than this model.Irrespective of what the description shows, it DOESN NOT have a USC C port. I was aware of it before buying but the images are a bit misleading."
5,It's a good 4k monitor for the price. HDR is there just for the records but couldn't expect more for the given price range. Overall it's a great monitor for 4k video editing and movie watching. Currently using it with Dell XPS 15.
4,"1- I first plugged it to my XBox despite knowing that it 60Hz display2- Played a 4K video that has lot of green snake (by this time every 4k enthusiast has seen that over and over)  - Absolutely stunning results gorgeous looking display (using the in box provided HDMI cable)  - Provided HDMI cable is capable of rendering 4K at 60Hz when used with Xbox3- Tried playing NFS, XBox detected a 4K display and wanted to enable special feature, went ahead do it  - It's good but not really meant for gaming, for more than one reason  - For gaming a full HD TV with 100Hz refresh rates is more than enough for not to gamer (a Full HD TV would be more value for money if sole objective is to play games )4- Plugged in to Linux laptop using provided HDMI cable (TypeC->Hub->HDMI->Monitor)  - First impressions  1. Nice display  2. 4K is stuck at 30Hz  3. Everything has lot of whitespace all of a sudden and everything looked very tiny  4. 60Hz with one lower setting was best in this case5- Plugged into my windows laptop that already handle 4K like a pro  - First impressions  1. Flawless, colors perfect, scaling perfect  2. With HDMI the refresh rate is still stuck with 30Hz (not bad, can live with it but that's not one wants)Display port cable in my opinion is as waste as the CD provided, as most of the HUB and laptops won't have display port. That cable has display port on both ends what a bummer and wasteful assetI have ordered a 60Hz type-c to HDMI cable, shall update if I can get 4K @ 60Hz with that. (Works)Nothing wrong with provided HDMI cable but your HDMI port in hub or laptop might be capped at 4k@60Hz so get the right cable accordingly.Very good for reading comfort and watching videos.It would be much helpful if type-c to HDMI or Display port cable is included in box"
1,They boosted the price to 30k and sold at 29k saying it‚Äôs an offer. But after I bought it. It became ‚Çπ28k. That‚Äôs the price of this product.
5,"I really love the monitor. It is best one you can get with incredible features like 4k, vesa mount, adjustable stand, 27inch.Only problem is that it doesn't have usb c. There is another model which comes with it but it is 10k more and i feel not worth it. I right now use usb to hdmi convertor with my laptop."
5,"It‚Äôs a good monitor from LG. 4K resolution with 27 inch size is a good combination to go for. The text appears very clear, colours are also good while using with Mac OS. Thankfully, there is no backlight bleeding in the monitor I received but it has typical IPS glow.Few cons: HDR does not seem to be working as expected with Mac. Packaging and built quality of the panel could be better. In this price LG could give slimmer bezels.Overall good monitor for productivity and multitasking during work from home. I got it for 27K in sale so it‚Äôs ok."
1,A huge and intense Backlight bleeding on the corner that is even visible when doing some task on screen...and degrade the viewing experience......please note we are spending 30k just for display
4,Very good 4k monitor but Hdr is useless.. I have connected to Macbook Pro 16 inch the colors are washed out..But everything else expect for Hdr is just perfect... üëåüëåüëå
5,"I purchased for photo editing in photoshop. Its just great looking, 4K is awesome, stand is so flexible, I have absolute no issues with monitor , worked just perfectly with my MacBook Air, I had to purchase a Thunderbolt to Display port cable though. By default it comes with 1 HDMI cable, 1 Display Port Cable"
5,"This is an amazing product for those who are looking for color accuracy. Amazing quality. Preferred over other brands, LG is slightly costly but delivers the value.Go for it."
5,Great picture quality and great features
1,"White Spot on Display, Used product sent to me. There was already 1 hr or up time on the monitor."
1,Not happy... Had to get the screen replaced just after one week of getting it due to ghosting issue and even the second screen has the same problem waiting for serving replacement. Pretty sure I was sent a refurbished item for the price of brand new.
5,"Using with my Xbox One X...amazing quality...Also using as my PC monitor..No complaint whatsoever. If you need an ideal 27"" monitor, this is the one."
5,Good monitor. I'm using it for my design use. One thing I found as an issue is that enabling HDR changes the colours a lot. So I'm using with it turned off. Other than that it is a good display.
4,True VESA certified 4K HDR 400 Monitor..Excellent quality clear and brighter picture with good features overall i am very happy.. LG did a good jobüëç
5,A very perfect and beautiful display screen. All good but but no speaker . May be a small built in speaker could have been better . Just love it on Play Station .
2,Monitor is average.  Refresh rate is stuck at 30Hz with Windows 10 Laptop and with MacBook Pro. Techsupport has no clue on it yet
1,Every thing is fine but after using for few months I am noticing a screen burn issue  even for 10 to15min static image. And this burn is noticeable on grey colour.
5,"Detailed in pixels, Comfortable standWorth for each rupee"
5,Great monitor to pair with my MacBook Pro - have been using it for work and no complaints so far. Make sure you have a 4K 30/60 fps compatible cable or adapter - otherwise you‚Äôll see some quality loss.
5,"Monitor is very good. It is helping me as expected. Only problem I see is that when Mac goes to sleep mode and comes back, monitor turns complete yellow. I need to disconnect n connect back to get back normal."
4,The monitor condition is good and renders 4k as expected but somehow my Macbook pro 2019 becomes so slow and literally unusable after sometime. Not sure if issue is with the monitor or the display cord or the laptop.
5,"Picture quality is great, Inbuilt speaker missing.Worth buying , i bought this for Rs 29,999."
5,Perfect for my Photo Editing Jobs
3,No swivel functionOtherwise fine
5,Only missisng thing: It doesn't swivel.
5,Superb product. Just go for it
5,Excellent colour
5,Love it! No issues. Best 4K Monitor!
5,Very nice display for regular day to day office work
4,"due to COVID - 19 my office instructed to WFH for few weeks and I need an office like setup at home for my busy workday. Bought couple of these monitors and an Amazon Basics dual monitor stand for mounting these monitors. The whole setup compliments my office desk.Pros: - Matty finish (good for programming / development use) - 75Hz refresh rate - LED backlight (night time you can some light bleeding, but during day time / under proper light no difference) - VA Panel (no details about VA / IPS panel either in the documentation or Samsung website) - Colour reproduction is awesome - Mount option available - Frameless Design (looks great)Cons: - No Audio out port (as mentioned by others). You can't use it for other use cases (like tv) - Limited connectivity options (no DVI / DisplayLink port), only HDMI or VGA - VGA resolution is not good when on MAC (I tested Mac Book Pro only, don't know about others). HDMI is recommendedNeed to check the durability."
5,"Got this monitor after going through almost a week of research. Wanted to buy the LG 24"" as the Samsung curved one has a VA panel and I have seen it, the colors were not that great in that one  but at the last moment I saw this from Samsung. My expectations were high from Samsung and it did match my expectations.Pros:1. Color are vibrant and pictures are sharp.2. Blacks are blacks, as good as a LED monitor can reproduce black. In day time it feels like an OLED black, at night you can see a bit of light as its an LED, but its really good keeping in mind that it's an LED panel.3. The 75hz refresh rate makes it feel a bit snappier than regular 60hz monitors.4. The thin bezels gives it a modern look.Cons:1. The stand is not adjustable, I didn't expect it to have adjust hight option, but at least adjusting the inclination angle option should be there for an monitor.But it's a great buy at this price point. I got it for 9999. You can go for it. Everything else is really good in this one.Edit: after using it for 6 months, I am impressed with the picture quality and colour reproduction. I didn't face any issues till date. I was so impressed that I got another one to have dual monitor setup :)."
4,This is one of the best displays that I've came across at this price range. The only problem is that you cannot adjust height of the display like most monitors.
4,"CONS (only 2):1.Viewing Angles are NOT OK.Of course it is not an IPS panel. If it's an IPS, there will be a clear logo. There is no mention of the same on official product specs either. It could be a PLS panel.2.Gaming modes: 75 hz. Useless, just marketing. No difference at all. Note: My testing was based on a dedicated graphics card with appropriate settings. Max output was 72 hz. Beyond that, screen will blankout, become non compatible.  However, you will not find any difference compared to 60hz and 75hz. Maybe you will see a difference if you place the panel under a microscope or some highend slow motion camera purely for purpose of panel testing. Its just a marketing myth (irrespective of brands). You can find significant  difference from144hz onwards.PROs:NO BACKLIT BLEEDING across the screen. I tested with a pitch black image file with full brightness settings and various angles in a dark room environment. So no issues at all.Panel is matt finish, so no screen glares to an extent.Color reproduction is very vibrant. Somewhat 70% close to HDR 400 although its not a HDR screen.Overall Build quality, fit and finish is excellent. Very slim bezel with simple modern design and appeal.9.5 K is an excellent price.Package and delivery was good."
5,"Picture quality and viewing angles are awesome, frame less design looks great, but stand is not adjustable and backlight bleeding is there, replaced, and the new one also has bleedingEdit: Returned the second one and purchased again, 3rd monitor has no backlight bleeding"
1,"Neither bad , nor Good . For the price its ok . Color is faded a bit but for 10k . Its ok .Backlight bleeding is there , but very little, can be ignored (I am picky about backlight bleeding) . I came form a TN panel, so color is obviously better but the punchyness strains the eye a lot .Overall a nice monitor to go for . Didnt give 5 star as previously I saw a dell monitor (forgot the name) about 5 years back . That had better color but 7 ms response time which was bad .Imp : dont go for 1080p in 27 inch monitor if you are looking for new purchase. You will see pixel . 1080p is best till 24 inch .Update : got a dead pixle today . Thank God within return period . Dont know how long this will last ."
2,Received Yellow shaded screen and got replaced thanks for that & On Amazon website on Technical Details Origin of country shown as India but on the box its not made in India its some other county.
2,Good monitor but the major issue what I've faced is unable to adjust the up & down height adjustment. Just fixed position.
1,"After reading blinding issue review. I trusted Samsung and it was my mistake. I have two monitors one is Samsung and other is Dell, but to be very Frank the samsung has worst quality. I don't know is it specific to model only. I request you do not buy this product."
3,"The product is having major backlight bleeding.The first unit I got had little backlight at the bottom and I replaced it, and the second one I got had bleeding from all directions. it was just worst."
5,"I have been using this monitor for a week now, primarily for work and a little bit of gaming, and I am quite impressed by what it offers for the price (I got it for 8500 during prime day).Pros:1. Deep blacks give great contrast ratio2. Matt finish minimizes reflections3. Freesync and 75hz are good additions for gaming4. Very slim bezels on 3 sidesCons:1. No vertical height adjustment2. Color accuracy could be better out of the box. It is apparent in the pic where you can see the difference in green color of the leaves on the laptop screen and the monitor. But since i am not doing any color sensitive work, I found it acceptable."
5,I think this is not a IPS display as there is no mention of IPS on the box nor in the manual and description.After a Little bit of research i came to know that Samsung has its own version of IPS technology and it is called PLS technology which is very similar to IPS hence i got very similar image quality.Overall inshort:Pros:1) Punchy Colors.2) Contrasty image (some may not like).3) Wide Viewing angle.4) 75 Hz refresh rate (72Hz freesync on).5) No Backlight Bleeding.6) Really thin bezel for price.7) One Joystick botton to control all features.8) Cable hook provided in box for cable management.9) Quite good design.10) Blacks are quite good not best. Cons :1) It is little bit pixelating kinda okayish as its 24 inch but higher than 24inch it might get worse.2) No height adjustment only tilt feature.3) I think its not as colour accurate as IPS because image looks quite punchy maybe you have to adjust setting for accuracy.4) No one tap button Power off as its a two step process.5) No onscreen software control available.6) No audio out from display.7) Stand is glossy and matte plastic combo which is okayish.8) Only HDMI and Sub DVI no Display port.By the way it can be overclocked to 83Hz max and HDMI cable is provided in box.Overall good Monitor for its price as i bought it at ‚Çπ9500.
5,"This display is classic Samsung. Contrast-y, bright and sharp. The actually frequency is 72.9 Hz whereas advertised as 75 Hz.The picture modes are good and offers a dedicated Game Mode - where all the sliders are maxed out.The FreeSync is a boon, it improves the ghosting observed and minimizes any screen-tearing.The fixture is robust and looks sleep, except there is a slight screen wobble when I types at my max speed.The cable management behind is good and the included HDMI cable is a welcome.The bezels are stunning and movies/games look seamless.I like the display, 9/10."
4,"I have been using a 27"" LG 4K IPS primary monitor that costs 40K+ and a cheap 20"" Samsung TN secondary monitor. The secondary monitor has been showing some signs of old age, and needed a replacement. What I wanted was an affordable monitor that had reasonable picture quality and over all build quality.To be honest, I only expected an average performer in this monitor, and was pleasantly surprised by it's image quality. The colours are vibrant (don't expect the quality you get from a premium monitor) and it has more than enough brightness.My premium primary monitor, while having excellent colour reproduction and pixel density suffers from shoddy quality control -  I had to replace it five times in the span of 18 months due to various issues ranging from terrible backlight bleeding, colour non-uniformity and image retention. So when bought this rather cheap Samsung monitor, my expectations were not that high. But it outperformed my expectations. For the asking price, this is a steal.The good:1. Adequate image quality and colour reproduction. Bear in mind that it is not factory calibrated.2. Excellent blacks - Even though Samsung says it is an IPS panel, I suspect that it is indeed a VA panel, because I have never seen an IPS panel that is able to render such deep blacks as this monitor does.3. Really good brightness4. Relatively lightweight5. Almost no bezels6. Adequate viewing angles7. The VESA mount bracket is on level with the surface, unlike some LG monitors where the VESA screws area is depressed which would make it incompatible with some VESA mounts.-----* The pros listed below this point are specific to my monitor, and may not hold true for every one as these things are dependent on QC and is based on your luck.6. Only extremely minor backlight bleeding - so minor that you'd often fail to notice it. My 40k+ LG monitor has major backlight bleeding issues. So this is a major relief for me.7. No image retention issues8. Excellent Black and White uniformity. Grey uniformity is only average.Cons:1. The included stand is of low quality. It has sharp rough edges and mold marks.2. Tilt is very difficult to execute. You have to apply a lot of force to tilt the monitor, sometimes I felt worried that I might damage the monitor.3. Not so great pixel density. Being only a 1080p monitor, 24"" size makes the pixels too big which force you to stay a bit farther away, otherwise the text does not look smooth. This is not a problem for watching videos or playing games.------* Following cons are specific to the monitor I received and other devices may not have these issues4. Dead pixels - Mine had 5 dead pixels which were prominently around the top right corner. I wasn't bothered by those though.NOTE:When I first turned on the monitor I experienced some contrast related issues. The monitor was unable to render certain shades of grey and looked indistinguishable from white. It turned out that this was caused by the setting 'Black level' - mine had it set to 'Low', and once I changed it to 'Normal' the issue was gone."
5,"Pros.1. Samsung screens doesn't need a intro. Even other mobile manufacturer's are buying screens from samsung only. So screen quality is top notchüòç.2. It is a IPS panel, viewing angles good. Inky black. Good contrast. Great brightness. No backlight issue most important to choose this.3. Comes with hdmi cable and power cable. No VGA anyhow I don't need that, but if you need you have to buy it separately.4. Installation is easy and wall mountable. Planning to make it as a second tv after WFH over üòùCons.Price again it is not a cons. Would have been great if it is little cheaper.Overall great purchase and good Monitor"
5,"Good monitors,  I bought 2 monitors for a better dual screen experience.  Although this is basil less, the black edging is significantly lower compared to the other monitors I've used at work.The backlight bleeding is very less  , Infact it's the best of what I've seen so far. (photo attached has reflection)The viewing angles are great. I do not see much difference in color when looked at the display from the sides.The monitor automatically selects input devices. Can be controlled in the setting menuOver all, for 9k -10k this is a good  monitor for the price rangeDownside: no dvi"
5,"I‚Äôd say this is a great monitor, I use it for gaming with my Nintendo switch and use it for editing photos and videos for my YouTube channel, which I have a video review on at Parikv99. Picture quality is really good and build is superb as well. Only things missing are an audio out port, but that doesn‚Äôt bother me much since I use my headphones anyway and height adjust. Great, value for money monitor that I recommend if this is your budget."
5,"This is a gorgeous monitor on this range, I bought it for my office use. It was easy to setup.Picture quality is difficult to say, my laptop shows sky blue color but monitor shows in turquoise color. Tried all the settings, not sure there's a color problem with my hp laptop or Samsung monitor.There's no adjustable stand but can be wall mounted - the way I wanted."
4,"Rcvd the product very fast.Negative Things:1. Screen Is fixed type you cant not adjust it horizontal or vertical.2. While connecting with laptop as second screen refresh rate gets only 71.90HZ, contacted customer care, reply rcvd as extending the display across your screen and tv then you will of course experience a bit of a decrease in performance.Only the good thing got it in 8500rs in amazon sale."
5,"A great external monitor that's just the right size for day to day office work and occasional Netflix/ Prime viewing. Was looking for a monitor to help manage working from home and the increased need for an additional monitor to help with screen share / presentation etc.Need a little tweak to make this really great.When this was plugged in at 1st, the text were awful and no matter what I tried to do with the settings nothing seemd to work. Finally after playing with the settings options on the monitor (not via Windows OS) figured out that setting the 'Game Mode Always On' did the trick. The text is razor sharp and smooth transition when you drag and drop windows and other apps. Most of the other settings were kept at factory setting. Monitor is very very bright at 100%. Recommended to dial it down to 20-25%. Hope this helps if you are struggling with the resolution."
5,"Excellent product. Though I am little sceptical whether it is IPS or not. Good colors, really bright for indoor, anti-glare. You will enjoy viewing it. My unit has a tiny black dot on the right side, I believe a foreign particle in between the layer. But I dont mind it. It does not have back light bleeding. Right side portion is little brighter than the left side if you are viewing black. Tilt mechanism is little weird. Otherwise really good product."
1,"12-05-2021 - Amazon delivered the monitor in one day but received defective product, upon complaint amazon expert verified the issue and initiated replacement immediately.13-05-2021 - received replacement. Problem with this is it's not at all monitor for daily work. Even with '0' brightness i can't read a word doc for more than 5 mins. Definitely some issue with brightness. Note: i am on 75Hz. Requesting for return and Amazon acknowledged that. Thanks to AmazonIssues -No sharpness(looks like CRT monitor)improper RGB balanceThe LCD panel also having some issue as able to some overlighting patches in the bottom."
3,I bought this samsung S24R356FHWXXL 24 inch monitor and Its build Quality was nice. But one problem I found was its color was not accurate and giving bluish green shade. so It affects my designing work and I requested return. So as per their policy they replaced it with another monitor same model. But the problem was still there. so again returned and I gone for Benq monitor. It gave me very good color accuracy and satisfied with the result :)
1,"I  ordered this product on 16th of this month, I was waiting to for this very eagerly. Finally i received it today and installed, Initially i played few HD videos i liked the picture quality. Later I wanted to do my office work so i connected my laptop and then i got resolution issue i tried to resolve it but i couldn't. When i read the documents (work related word files) i found there is  another issue like sharpness, i was not able to concentrate while reading.  I tried to resolve the issue but i couldn't. And i finally decided to return this product, so i contacted amazon technical team, but i am not happy with their suggestions, they are asking me to use one more week, when i have made up my mind to return this product. I spoke to three people and everybody suggested the same. It was just a waste of my time and energy,  because they were not giving exact solution.I am very disappointed."
5,Great product! Got it at Rs.9499 without any offers. Package arrived in 1 day. Eco friendly packing. Monitor has eye saver mide which is great and brightness can be increased or reduced as per comfort. Looks nice of the while and display is problem free.I didnt see any noticable light leakage in the screen edges as some posts say. Probably its miniscule.
1,"Please think when purchasing it. This is flickering when most of the display time is in ON state. As mentioned Flicker-Free monitor, but has flicking.And Samsung Technical agent has not proper knowledge for fix these issues.This is my second monitor still the same issue I'm facing yet."
4,"So, my first attempt of buying this product was not good. The monitor had screen bleeding after few hours of use itself. Returned and got a replacement.Pros:Love the look, design and curve around the edgesNo screen bleeding with the replaced monitorDisplay is goodOverall happy with the price point and product.Cons:Stand is not adjustableThe button is on the backside which was difficult to find at first and not so great to useBrightness level is too much even if I decrease it to a minimum, but I have got used to it now after few days.Overall, worth to buy especially for the price compared to the competition"
5,"I am Software Engg by profession was always thriving to get a bigger screen monitor, now is perfect time to maximum the useage of this perfect product from Samsung during this WFH culture.Samsung always know for their product durability, monitor looks sturdy, good build quality, good picture quality as well. You cannot tilt or adjust monitor that‚Äôs the only where felt the disappointment which not of a major deal breaker."
1,"Ordered a unit on 3rd April, received with multiple dead pixels on it. I was not sure about the dead pixel policy but worrying that it may get worse in the future I opted for a replacement. Oh my was I in for a surprise, the replacement unit had a physical defect along with a dead pixel. Returned the 2nd unit as well, and took a refund due to ""Only one replacement policy"". Both units had Sept'20 as MFG date. Samsung needs to improve its QC or Amazon delivery guys need to handle the package with care."
3,"I thought I'd use it as a secondary, vertical monitor beside my primary 27"" WQHD IPS. I couldn't stand it.The panel is not that great, very little headroom to tweak it to display accurate colors. Cannot even set gamma manually, just some presets. Then, the PPI is also low enough to look unpleasant. Samsung claims it's an IPS, but I suppose it barely makes the cut.Find something better for your money."
5,Good product. No backlight bleeding issue. If you need a good quality monitor go for it. You'll not be disappointment.
5,"After checking all monitors from HP and LG in this price range, finally decided to go with this model. Major reason was the price as I got this 24 inch mod for only 8.5k during prime day sale!!!I will divide the review between pros and cons-Pros:1. Cheapest 24 inch full HD IPS monitor from a premium brand2. Picture quality is excellent, viewing angles are great as it has IPS panel3. Bezels are almost non existent which gives a premium look4. Setup is easy, hdmi cable is provided instead of vga which is a plus for using with most modern devices5. Only one button operation For controlling brightness and contrast etc.6. Cables can be arranged with the provided clip7. No weird backlight bleeding8. Wall mounting is possibleCons:1. Stand takes little extra space due to the design of it2. Minimum brightness could have been lower3. Tilting range is limitedIf you‚Äôre deciding between this one and LG, you can go with either one as both are almost same."
3,"Its is really a good monitor in the price Range, but cant adjust the height or neither can be tilted.Picture quality is really amazing.The monitor I got had too much IPS glow from bottom (clearly seen in night) and had few dead pixels. so, I had to return it.Sometimes my eyes were hurting on watching this monitor, although brightness, contract was at the minimum level.For Dual WFH home setup, yes its good, make sure that the monitor is placed 3 feed approx from your sitting place to get a decent view and not hurt your eyes.Rating  -Monitor Build - 7/10Picture - 8/10Gaming - 8/10WFH - 7/10"
3,"Text from far looks good but if you are using it upclose this won't cut it. I have a macbook pro, i think i might be spoiled by those crips display. It's not atall a bad panel but for my use case i might save up to buy a 2k or 4k panel, 1080p ain't cutting it."
4,This is a great monitor. I switched from 19.5 and this feels huge compared to that. The picture quality is very good and watching videos is an absolute delight. It also has a vesa mount for hooking it on stands or wall. Its not really thin compared to some of hp monitors at that price but it feels sturdy. But the stand takes quite a lot of space and is spread out and its overall a bit heavy
4,"Monitor color looks good.No edge bleeds.Monitor stand is firm, but very annoying problem it looks little bit tilted towards front side, and I cannot adjust it as it's not adjustable. But if you don't pay much attention then it doesn't bother much.I'm going to keep this one, already returned 1 monitor for defects.Colors looks little yellowish with default settings. I decreased RED and GREEN little bit now looks OK.I'll post later if any problem I face later."
1,Very poor build..Ants entered inside the display within 1month..can't believe it.. very very very cheap materials used..cheap thin plastic around the display is very fragile and loose!! Is this really from samsung??!!! Or fake one?
2,- Few portions of the package were found as opend. Not sure if this was for quality check or something else.- Packaging was not good. Might be negligence from seller.- Very cheap plastic quality.- Screw marks found from under the panel locks.- No visible black bleeding.- Picture quality on HDMI is better as compared to when connected over VGA.- On the screen there's a thin lamination which looks like a matte wrap.- Please check the images carefully.
5,"Okay, I think this is worth every penny, Picture quality and colors are very good for me. I changed the 60hz refresh rate to 75hz rate and is very smooth. Yet to play some AAA games on it but I'm pretty sure it would't make a big difference. I'm not fan of fps shooting games so i high refresh rate and fast response rate computer is not needed.To be honest the main cover image on the product looked very pale to me I only bought coz it was under 10k, and I was pretty amazed when i open it and switched it on. It was stunning both design and display. I just hope it will last longer.Very satisfied with packaging, instructions and delivery. Love you Samsung, appario retail and Amazon ! :)"
1,Not great monitor in terms of display quality- no height adjustable stand. Height of default stand is very low for most people so ended up paying another 2500 for height adjustable stand.- did not survive warranty period. Display stopped working in 10 months.
5,I bought this product because I edit videos for a living.I have a YouTube channel: KTNTECH (You'll find the unboxing and impressions video there)If you're a gamer do not go with this one.Because it's an IPS Panel the response times are a lil less and there are tad bit jelly effect while gaming.If you're a photo/video editor definitely this is for you at least on this budget.Thanks for reading.Don't forget to check out the channel :)
5,"Bought this monitor on 5th Jan 2018 at Rs. 15,499 in lightning dealFollowing are my observations:1) The first thing I noticed is that top and side bezels of the monitor are very thin which is aesthetically pleasing and gives it a premium look.2) Screen is decent and has good brightness and contrast. Not sure about color reproduction but it feels alright.3) Screen has a refresh rate of 60 Hz at 1920x1080 resolution. However it has an option of 75 Hz at 1024x768 resolution also.4) Even though this monitor has Eye Care (Bright Intelligence), I felt that the sensor adjusted brightness is on higher side for my liking.5) There is slight backlight bleed at top left corner of monitor which is noticeable only in very dark environments but overall has uniform IPS Glow.6) Response time mentioned on the box is 5ms (Gray to Gray) and I felt it to be good for FPS games. Overall, it's a good monitor for casual gaming.7) It comes with UK style power cord and needs a converter/adapter or a spike guard will work.8) The box also includes HDMI cable and the monitor has cable management as shown in product description which I felt is a nice addition to the package.Monitor has following ports:D-SubHDMI PortDisplay PortLine-in port and3.5 mm jack for plugging in earphonesThis monitor also has in-built speakers which are pointed downwards. The quality of audio from them is nothing to brag about and max volume is that of a typical tablet (my iPad Pro 12.9"" 2017 has better sound output than them) but no complaints here considering the price of the monitor.Overall this monitor is value for money product considering the price I got it for.Cheers to Amazon for on-time delivery.Feel free to ask any questions about the product, will be glad to help!"
5,"I have worked on many monitors (Dell, HP, Acer) in office and home. Never had a Benq. I will get this out of the way, my favourite brand is Dell (I have bought around 10 products). I was torn between the Dell (2717H), Viewsonic and Acer. For some reason I never had a good experience with products of HP.My requirement was a 27"" monitor. I am not a serious gamer only play casual games from time to time. The main purpose was to do programming and watching videos (and reading). This monitor suits perfectly.Pros:- Excellent display. It had a bit of light bleed on top right corner but it was just the glass a bit out. I just pressed it in and the bleed was gone.- Good contrast and viewing angles. I have not played any FPS games till now but overall the experience till now (10 days) has been smooth and consistent. The 5ms response time is good enough for me.- Although it is a 1080p display, the text and videos appear sharp, no pixelation or ghosting. Colours are uniform and even.- Bluelight filtering is good. Helps when reading a long book / article and puts less strain in the eyes.Cons:- The Eyecare feature is a bit aggressive. The display becomes too bright for the surrounding light. I just switched it to standard and set the brightness and contrast to levels I am comfortable with. The day/night light in my room doesn't differ much so I don't need to change the settings.Other monitors with similar features were around or over 20k, I got this for 17k. Overall a very good budget monitor. It also has 3 years warranty which is good and tells that I can expect a pretty long life from this.Let me know if you need to know more."
4,"I bought it mainly for its auto brightness. But, the brightness doesn't go too low there is no light around. So, I had to stop using the feature that I especially looked upon. Anyway, it's a value for money product. Good fit for someone who uses it occasionally. Not recommended for you are going to stare at the monitor for around or over 8 hours a day. For such use cases, better to go for Dell ultrasharp monitors. They are costly, but your eyes would thank you for sure."
5,"I was skeptical about this BenQ G480 eye care 24‚Äù inch monitor first. After a lot of research, I found this monitor too good for regular reading and office work. I previously had a DELL 21.5 inch monitor which that has a really thin bezel on the side and the top. Further, it is quite good in color production along with two fine speakers at the bottom.Now, for the last 1 year, I had this severe pain in my eyes as I mostly work in front of the screen. The pain gradually increased at times I couldn‚Äôt even stare at the screen perhaps, due to the harmful blue light emission. I was waiting for the shopping days to come up where I can buy a decent monitor(bigger size) and also that could help me get rid of severe eye strain.As I already use blue cut lenses I did not find the previous monitor abstain harmful blue light. And this time I have decided to buy the BenQ monitor 24 inches (Eye Care). I did not expect to be excellent in color production either I play games using this.After, I received the monitor which I purchased just for 7.8k during the festive season deal.I found the feature ‚ÄúLow blue light‚Äù and ‚ÄúBrightness intelligence technology‚Äù - uses a dedicated sensor to map out the ambient lighting to adjust the temperature and brightness of the screen which seriously I have never seen on budget monitors.Anyways, I am quite happy with the purchase I have tested and experienced no flicker issue neither extreme blue light emission after you have just switched to ‚ÄúLow blue light emission‚Äù.In addition, I received a major upgrade to 24 inches that allow me for seamless reading. Moreover, the monitor comes with 36 months of on-site warranty but sadly, you can register the monitor on their website there is no option to do that.I have seen people complaining about the screen bleeding issue. Fortunately, I did not face anything yet.I am in love with my new 24 inches BenQ monitor irrespective of having 5 ms response and limited to 60Hz refresh rate. This monitor is perfect for and reading, working for a longer duration but can‚Äôt say about photo or video editing work. I purchased the monitor mainly seeing the eye care technology that puts less strain on eyes even after continuous usage of 6 hours.I have attached several photos of the monitor and how it looks exactly. Also, I have tried to show the features that you can access using the buttons beneath the screen."
5,"This monitor is really good at this price point ( I got it for 9499 during amazon sale )Pros:1.Colors are much more Vibrant then normal LED's, i have a triple monitor Setup so i can compare this with other LED's  from dell.2.Dark and Bright values are much better differentiated.3.The best one is the price you cant get any thing better than this at this price Point...Kudos to Benq for that4. Brightness is way too much high5. Multiple connecting options ( i plugged it to my PC as well as my PS4)Cons1. There is some back light bleeding ( But that is ok even expensive monitors has minor light bleeds)At this price point i think Benq has done a great job.if you want a cheap IPS display then this monitor is for you."
3,"The monitor is well built.  Quality is also good.  However, It's painful for the eyes if you do text based stuff.  The fonts will look blurred.  It seems that 22inch or lower size monitors are best for Full HD Resolution.  24inch monitor will have larger pixels which will make text blurry and affect eyes.  If you just want a bigger monitor, spend more money and go for Ultra HD ones.  Otherwise, you may regret it as I have. Looking forward to selling mine!"
5,"The BenQ 27 is an amazing monitor the most interesting that I loved about this monitor is its slim bezels on the sides and top. I've connected it with Laptop and the output quality is uncompromised and looks good. it also has an inbuilt speaker (but I never used it because it's not good in my opinion).Moreover, the texture on the display is well finished with Matte so it could block glossiness and reflection. The monitor comes with a control panel to adjust different settings related to colors and sound. It also comes with a set of Color schemes preset, which are also customizable. Right beside the control panel buttons, it has a power LED indicator too.My overall experience with this monitor is amazing."
5,"Good product, performance is excellent and exceptional difference or upgrade in my viewing experience. Suggest the product to buy if anyone is thinking to buy one in budget, though I still have a doubt whether it is an LED or LCD as I received a manual saying LCD in the packet.I wish to buy one more if I get a clarity on this LCT/LED thing .."
5,"I bought this in late December 2019 for 12.9K. I had switched to this from a 22 inch LG monitor (model 22MP68VQ, to be precise). The color reproduction on that monitor was downright brilliant. So, when I plugged this one in out of the box, to be honest, I was somewhat disappointed. The colours looked so faded and unappealing, the blacks were nowhere near black and the overall panel appeared to be so low quality, that I almost contemplated returning it.However, when I tinkered with its settings, boy was I amazed. The color reproduction improved massively, including the contrast and brightness. I also made some changes to the Intel display driver's setting (mine is a Windows system), however, that might be different for you based on your system.First and foremost, go to ""Picture Advanced"" menu on the OSD (on-screen display), and set Picture Mode to ""User"". This will turn off all settings such as Bright Intelligence, Low Blue Light, etc. (Trust me, you don't want to keep them enabled for the best picture quality). Then navigate to ""Picture"" tab in the main menu. Here are the monitor's settings that worked really well for me:1. Brightness: 100 (you may lower it if it hurts your eyes)2. Contrast: 603. Sharpness: 54. Gamma: 55. Color Temperature: Normal6: Hue: 507. Saturation: 50Once you have tweaked settings to the above numbers, you will see it greatly improves the picture quality. However, if you have an Intel display driver like I do, you can tweak the settings there too for an even better picture. Here are the steps for that:1. Search ""Intel Graphics Command Center"" in start (this may be different for you if you're running an older driver). If you can't find it in start,  you should be able to right-click on your desktop and go to Intel Display Settings too.2. Navigate to the ""Display"" tab.3. Go to ""Color"" tab in the window.4. Leave ""Brightness Enhancement"" to default at 50.5. Change ""Contrast Enhancement"" to 48 from 50.6. Enable ""Luminance-based Color Model"". (THIS IS A MAJOR GAME CHANGER)And voila! Your these settings would breathe a new life into an otherwise dull default settings.One thing to note here is that the piece that I received had slight IPS glow / backlight bleed from upper left corner, mostly noticeable in very dark environments with 100% brightness (see attached picture). However, it is very common in IPS displays, and gets worse as the screen size increases. I didn't want to gamble with a replacement product, so I chose to stick with this one. Mine came with zero dead pixels, so I was worried about the replacement being worse (more backlight bleed / presence of dead pixels)."
5,"The product is very good. Eye care setting has options like Multimedia, Reading etc...  I usually keep Multimedia while playing games and Reading when I am coding and doing office work. I usually spend 8 hrs per day infront of PC, I didn't experience any eye strain. Vertical adjustment is not there, so if you have comfortable chair and table, it's good. Inbuilt speakers are good enough. Like other commented, I did not expect a home theatre like speakers from a monitor. Its suitable for hearing computer sounds and attending meetings with client. Build quality is good. I bought it for 7750Rs, Because of Corona pandemic prices are increasing, I don't have any option and didn't wait for the deals. I feel happy for purchasing this."
1,After using the monitor for 2 weeks I noticed that the top part of the screen has a white spot and also the edge of the monitor is open from the top (pic attached). The return date is now over. I feel cheated. Really upset with Amazon.
4,Pros:1. Tiny bezels2. Great colour composition3. Good collection of input options4. Vesa mount compatible5. Pocket friendlyCons:1. Inbuilt speakers are useless. They don't reproduce complete sound spectrum properly.2. Brightness is a bit low. Difficult sometimes in bright daylight3. Menu control system UI is very bad
5,"Display: I bought this monitor as a secondary display to aid my programming. The text display in Windows 10 is awfully pixelated and not at all crisp. If you are  buying this for text based usage, strictly stay away. I can't emphasize more. All the other display related features are absolutely miserable.Sound: The less we talk the better. The speaker volume and quality is fit for nothing absolutely pathetic sound. I don't know why this feature exists.The Bomb: You cannot return, can only replace. No matter how you try the display is ending up being garbageI gave 5 stars because most of the people only read 5 star ratings and I don't want my rating to slip through."
5,"Absolutely amazing monitor. Definitely recommended for the price. Best value for your money in the segment without a doubt. After days of research and enquiries for a 22"" monitor, and comparing it with Dell's & HP's, I ended up buying a pair of GW2283's for my video editing setup. What a delight to the eyes! Go for it without a doubt, I'm not regretting a single penny spent. Definitely at par with Dell's & HP's IPS 22"" monitors, saving you around 1k for the same performance and build quality. Maybe if you search this in your local market, you can buy it for a bit cheaper. But I had no option as such so went on via amazon.Pros-1. Although I have a dual-display setup, a single 22"" will be productive enough for most of the tasks, especially this having a 1080p res.2. This thing is built like a tank! So robust and heavy, i wasn't expecting it to be of this premium built-quality for the price I paid. This thing is HEAVY! Durability- 11/10.3. Really good panel. BENQ has been an understated brand but believe me, the actual display quality is no less than it's competition, even at comparatively lower prices. Brightness- 8/10 | Sharpness- 9/10 | Color Accuracy (in the segment)- 9/10 | Anti-glare Display- Good readability in direct light (though it reduces the overall brightness but the negotiation is worthy) | Great Viewing Angles and Adjustability- IPS panel, nothing more to say.4. I/O management deck- definitely helpful to keep things organised when you got crazy wiring all around as in my setup. Practical design.5. Also the overall packaging was really good. It came all foamed up in a double cardboard box. Good job Amazon. BENQ package was however far superior with all kinds of protection.Cons-1. No HDMi cable provided in the package, although the monitor itself has 2√ó HDMi ports. Just 1 VGA cable (of good quality) provided.2. Only tilt adjustment for the stand, no height and swivel adjustment, but that's just nit picking. Won't expect that from the segment.3. This thing is heavy. But definitely it has its benefits in terms of durability.4. The built-in speakers are just, meh! Not too loud, not too crisp and clear. Just average. Does the job. Sounds more like a mono rather than stereo, but I personally use headphones for my job so no big deal for me.5. It is not completely bezel-less design. There is a thin in-display bezel after the rim of the panel. Actually the overall bezel is more like 3mm from all sides when actually booted up. Its not absolutely bezeless as they show in the picture, but the crop is minimum.Verdict- Overall a great, robust, practical and powerful tool for your setup if you want durability, great display quality, performance and practicality. Nothing fancy, but still looks appealing, sleek and smooth to the eyes. Highly recommended to pick one of these uo, you wont regret for what you spend.1080p Res, 60Hz refresh rate, IPS panel features, robust design and build quality, premium looks, super practical. What else do you expect for 7.5k bucks?JUST GO FOR IT."
1,"Please don't buy if you are trying to buy it for macbook. It doesn't work with macbook pro even with original hdmi to type c adaptor. The resolution is not good.Benq technical teams recommendation to fix this issue was to ""use different hdmi to type-c adapter available in the market"" and pray that one of them works as they have verified it from other customers, but they are not ready to share which adapter to use. Wasted 2 weeks talking to benq customer but then they are not ready to help."
1,"Having used Dell Ultrasharp 24 in, I ordered this one after reading great reviews on it.  After trying all kinds of options for three days, it still tired my eyes in no time.  In comparison, I can work on DELL U2415 Display for hours!  I returned it after four days of wasted effort.  May be people who have given highly positive reviews for programming as well have not used Dell U2415.  The latter is pricey, but I am going to buy more of the same.  Nothing beats 24-inch (1920 x 1200) in crispness, quality, and very low eye strain!  The extra 200 pixels in width adds a lot to the comfort!Can't comment on gaming capabilities."
5,"I have been using multiple monitors over the year, I usually change the monitor in an year or so. This is just an amazing product. I have moved the TV and kept this monitor at its place as even my Sony bravia TV did not match the video quality of benq, I would give my 200% review for this product. If u like movies and want to watch 1080p videos on YouTube this is best. I am amazed that I spent 6000 rs almost twice a year buying bad monitors but this is best monitor with real life feeling of videos. Buy it u won't regret it.Anyone who has visited my house has said that this is a amazing And videos looks like life like video can't explain. But this is the closest I have gotten for the past 14 years to a monitor which is TRUE HD"
1,"After seeing so many good reviews, I got this monitor hoping I‚Äôll get a good product but was disappointed. Seller was Appario.Firstly, the amazon packaging was torn and damaged from one corner. It shows how carelessly they have handled a delicate product like this.Coming to monitor:1) I see the bottom bezels are not uniformly aligned to the screen, this was causing heavy screen bleeding from bottom.2) It claims it is an IPS display but it‚Äôs just a cheap LCD. The blacks and dark colours are horribly faded. Details are lost in shadowy parts of scenes.3) It claims to have 178 degrees viewing angle but if you‚Äôre sitting even 45 degrees from the centre the details start to get faded.4) And about speakers I‚Äôm still wondering why they even bothered putting that in the first place. Total wastage.I don‚Äôt know if all the monitors are like this or if I got a lemon. I‚Äôm starting to doubt that this is a refurbished monitor and used a cheap IPS or LCD panel which gives its such a faded look, but the other reviews said that it‚Äôs ok to have that much backlight bleed into their screen, so maybe it‚Äôs the product itself. Anyways I‚Äôm not happy about the product being an IPS display behaves like a 10 year old LCD models.Either ways I‚Äôm returning it never to buy this product again. I‚Äôll rather check the new LG or Samsung models which I hope would give the IPS display of the quality which they claim on their products."
3,"I have worked for fair amount on some really good monitors and this isn't one of them. Only reason I bought this is because of 5 star ratings. Most people who have rated it 5 stars have probably not used a good display before and they got amazed easily after purchasing this. But believe me DO NOT buy this if you have already used a good monitor like Dell or Apple. You can purchase two for dual monitor setups because both have mostly similar colours. Let me tell you why I'm saying this.Pros: Cheap, Sturdy construction, thin bezels, non glossy finish unlike Samsung's or LG's ugly shiny displays. Thats it.Cons: very poor color calibration, in some cases the colours are just worn out and in some cases it gets overexposed,Speakers...they suck 2/10 score,The ports, there should have been at least one display port.Brightness (it is too bright on its default settings, you can keep it that way if you want some more addition to your electricity bill)Saturation, hue options are useless and only makes it look worse.The eye care tech is nothing but a gimmick.I have been using a Dell 21.5 inches monitor for almost 7 years now and even now its a lot better than this Benq one. My Dell monitor has thin borderless bezels, accurate colours, a good display screen and even has the ability to overclock from default 60 hz...I've raised mine to 74hz.Honestly if Dell was selling this monitor right now, I would have purchased it without a second thought. I had to purchase Benq because I needed something cheaper.Instead of the useless speakers and stupid eye care tech, they should have made a better panel with accurate colours and brightness.I am disappointed.Update: After many-many trail and errors and web research, I am somewhat able to adjust the monitor's display to somewhat accurate colours. Still I won't recommend it to people who have already used a good display."
1,"I brought this product thinking the best and I made a great mistake, I picked this over DELL that I repent till now. The first 10 days the product was good after that spotted a small line in the middle of the screen. I have registered a complaint with the team REF: R200301312 and no one bothered to reach me till now. Escalation number 9560055022 was also not reachable. If you want to spend your hard-earned money put in a well-reputed brand."
1,"I ordered the item on 24th June and got delivery on Delivered 30-Jun-2020. Amazon Packing was excellent to avoid any damage to the item. I started using it on 6th July. On 12th day; Friday 17th of July, there was a flicker on the screen which was hardly noticed. On Sunday 19th July afternoon there appeared vertical lines covering 3/4 of the screen from bottom.  Reached Amazon to check what next; as 16 days replacement period after delivery date expired, I was advised to contact BenQ customer service. Sunday being a holiday for BenQ customer care; I opened a complaint with BenQ customer care, hoping to get a resolution.Manufacturing date of the product is April 2020 and product having 39 month warranty from manufacturing date or invoice date which ever is earlier is the only hope to get this one working again. Fingers crossed. I'm not giving any rating as of now; as it is too early to comment either pros and cons of the product. Will write a feedback after the product is fixed and continued usage for a month or so.&&&&&&&&&&&&& experience after monitor replacement.&&&&&&&&&&Replacement item received on 18th August. Using the item till then for 5 days a week almost 9 to 10 hours. It‚Äôs time to rate this product... it‚Äôs a great product and happy with the purchase. No issues with the replacement item at all. Overall I recommend this product if you are looking for a good monitor for daily use."
1,"I purchase this monitor on Oct 21,2020, I could not able to switch on the monitor due to  3 pin power cord(cable) is not able to insert any of my switch box or extension board which is big and not fitting and I contacted the Amazon customer care they said better to buy a power cable or plug separately which is really not expected from the Benq and I felt 16A cable unnecessary here, please consider this point while buying this monitor."
4,"Overall the monitor is great but there're a couple of issues I would like to point out.Being an IPS panel, this monitor suffers from back light glow.  Blacks are not fully black. This is not noticeable if one is working in well lit environment. However, in a dark environment at night it does cause eye strain.The buttons on the monitor are physical push buttons. It would have been great if they were touch buttons. Physical buttons tend to get defective over a period of time."
1,"When the product arrived, it was sealed in a thick box and multiple layers of plastic. But eventually when I got to the sealed tape, I found it had already been broken apart. I decided to test out the monitor instead of returning the opened box and that was the mistake I did. After 10 days, the top half of the screen on the monitor  became dimmer and duller for no reason. There is absolutely nothing great about this monitor to write about."
4,"This monitor has met all the features that I need for it's price. Here is my review for Benq GW2780.The good -- The monitor is well built and beautifully designed with all the matte surface and textured plastic. It looks clean and simple.- I am very happy to find no Backlight Bleed at any part of my monitor which is very prominent among IPS panel based monitors. There is just the ""IPS glow"" which is completely normal for an IPS panel.- The viewing angles are excellent.- The monitor size (27 inches) is big enough for all the entertainment needs.- It has a popular and standard resolution of 1920x1080 (Full HD). I'd say that this resolution for a 27 inch monitor with 81 PPI (Pixels per inch) isn't really that bad, which means it is good enough for text based content and other entertainment.- It has some inbuilt features called the ""Low Blue Light"" mode and ""Brightness Intelligence"", which works great in reducing strain if you work for several hours. Brightness Intelligence feature automatically adjusts the monitor's brightness by sensing the lighting conditions in the room without needing to change the brightness manually.- Many connectivity options including the DisplayPort, two HDMI ports and an audio port.- The pixel response times are really good. You can find no issues in fast paced FPS Games.The bad -- The inbuilt speakers sound really low.- There is some weird bug in the OSD (On-screen Display) menu of the monitor, where changing the Gamma value doesn't change anything in the picture. But, it doesn't really matter because the default Gamma value is the standard anyway.Conclusion - This is a nice, all feature packed PC Monitor for it's price, you will never find in other monitors, at least for now. You can go for it!"
4,"I purchased this monitor for the sole purpose of using it as a vertical monitor. My job requires me to read a lot on my PC, and ever since I started using one a few weeks ago, vertical monitors have become indispensable in my Work From Home setup. This is my second such monitor, the first one been a Dell P2419H, commendably serving my requirements in the office. At home, however, I felt the need for a slightly larger screen; one that can be kept at a distance, so that my study table isn't cluttered. The Dell P2719H was my first consideration. Its asking price, however, far exceeded the budget I had allocated for the purpose. My second option was the HP E273 - again, priced as much as the Dell, so was dropped. The third option was a model by AOC (a brand I didn't know a lot about). It seemed to tick all the boxes, and in fact I even ordered it. And that's when I came across this new Prime Day launch by BenQ. It was going at ‚Çπ17,500, a good ‚Çπ3500 less than the Dell's asking price. So it didn't take me long to convince myself to cancel my AOC order, and opt for this BenQ monitor instead.On its own, this is a good monitor, and one that does its job well. Its when you have the luxury to compare it with another IPS panel, that you notice the shortcomings. Like I said, the IPS panel on the BenQ GW2780T is good, but Dell's panel is better. The build quality is good, but Dell's is superior. The BenQ's speakers are rubbish, and my laptop's internal speakers are way better. No, seriously. The speakers on the BenQ are terrible, and aren't even loud enough to justify their inclusion. The Dell, on the other hand, did not even bother to mount any speakers, for better or worse; instead, Dell comes with a built-in USB hub, which is a far more useful feature to have. It has 2 USB 3.0 ports, and 2 USB 2.0 ports. The slower USB 2.0 ports are useful to plug in your wireless keyboard/mouse dongle, and the the USB 3.0 ports are always useful to have if you wish to leave your portable HDD plugged in (haven't tested their transfer speeds). Hands down I'd opt for Dell's USB hub feature over BenQ's terrible internal speakers. Both Dell and BenQ offer matte finish panels, which are inherently less reflective, unlike the HP E273, I think.EDIT: Please ignore the following paragraph. Turns out I am wrong. But it doesn't affect my final rating for the product.

Lesser backlight bleeding and better colour reproduction are two things that I immediately noticed. Also, the viewing angles are better on the Dell, although both BenQ and Dell house IPS panels. Then again, BenQ's panel is more than sufficient for my requirement, which is to read documents and articles in the vertical position. Both the panels appear to have a similar set of additional features, with one model offering something that the other doesn't, and vice versa.To sum up: but for the significant price difference, I would have opted for the 27"" version of Dell's offering. But that doesn't mean that BenQ's GW2780T is a bad monitor by any means. In fact, on its own, I think its a very capable monitor, and its capabilities match my requirements sufficiently. But if and when you do find the price difference to be negligible, I would suggest you opt for the Dell's offering. You will not go wrong in opting for this BenQ monitor. Its just that Dell is better, and it costs a lot more."
1,"Initially I ordered for 27"" monitor, and I received 24"". Then it got replaced. And then at very 14th day after I got the replaced product, It's main board got damaged and I was unable to connect using HDMI cable. When I complaint to BenQ Head office at Gurgaon, The team is totally incompetent. Their Manager Deepak Khurana is on leave, and his represent member Om Prakash himself says that he cant do anything without Deepak. Let him return from leave. The entire team just play email - email within their own team only, and the customer just watches the show as an Audience. It's almost a week now and I have still not got any result.I would urge every buyer to not buy this product ever as I have lost my 12k in this plus I am on leave for my office for not having monitor. These salary deductions are extra losses for me"
1,"The monitor is indeed good but of substandard build quality. I purchased it in August 2020 for 8k. Till a week back it was working fine and then suddenly when I wake up one morning there is a black line on the screen. I contacted customer support. They registered the call but when the technician visited he said it is damaged and I can't do anything, you better buy a new one as the cost to replace a panel is the same as this monitor (WHAT?). I was keeping the monitor really well and it did not fall at all, had it fallen it would have had some dents, there were zero dents and scratches. In this Oct sale, I purchased the Dell Monitor which should last longer than this BenQ thing. I really thought well of the product after reading the reviews but it indeed turns out of substandard build quality.Poor aftersales support."
5,"First Things First:You need to activate the Eye Care feature in the monitor. It is not ""ON"" by default. I realised it after 3-4 months of usage! :/Replacement under warranty:My initial monitor developed a vertical line after 3 months of usage. No particular reasons for the line. Raised a complain with the BenQ customer care in their prescribed format. They immediately accepted the fault and agreed to replace the monitor under warranty.Got the replacement of the monitor in 4-5 working days. No hassles, no paperwork. Appreciate the quick and professional response.Coming to the monitor:My usage is extensively for work purpose and seldom for watching movies.This monitor meets both my requirement. The Anti-glare feature is particularly impressive. I also work late at night, with the lights switched off. The monitor auto adjusts the display brightness according to the light in the room. However, this feature has to be activated from the menu in the monitor.Overall - Go for it if you are looking to buy for work purpose and little bit of videos/multimedia."
1,"Received unsealed / tampered pieceThe delivery agent has opened the seal to keep the invoice inside the box - yes sounds very stupid to hear to such stories used to cover up.By the way the Amazon invoice was found inside the box justifing the story, the Benq tv production team got a dream that I am gonna purchase through Amazon, so they typed my address etc on an Amazon invoice kept it in the box sealed it partially."
4,"The blue light filters works well and make it comfortable to read for long time... bezel is narrow...only issue I am facing is that when blue filter is enabled in reading mode monitor does not allow to vary brightness or other picture settings...it's prest...without filter enabled settings can be varied. The auto brightness adjust is an added feature, though it works... It does not make much difference to the picture....in addition to providing setting to vary sensitivity they should also have provided gain"
4,"I have purchased this item from Amazon, I have paid Rs.7890/-Pros:1. Design which will attract you first.2. Eye protection display3. Sensor to adjust brightness4. Dual HDMI5. It comes with a small speaker (Don't expect a good one, but within budget this is a good thing)6. Audio Jack if you needed.7. 3 Years warranty8. Cable management deckCons:1. Brightness is saturating when you watch netflix or youtube.2. No HDMI inside package, instead you will received old VGA cable.So basically it is perfect for budget.## If you are a Macbook user and want to use it as external display then go for it.Tested:1. MacBook Air 2015 (Os Catalina) - Working with (Amazon Basics Mini DP cable and Bluerigger)2. MacBook Air 2017 (High Sierra) - Working with ( same above )"
1,"i ordered my first monitor on 7th June and it had problem with the lcd it had a hairline crack near the right bezel of the display, as I saw the crack I immediately placed a replacement order and it came in just two days on 9th June but the replacement had a bigger issue the top bezel wasn't fully glued in so the dust would've sneaked the way into it destroying the display and thank god that I returned it quickly in my amazon return window cause benq customer care sucks I called them emailed them but no one helped me with this issue so I ended up returning it and getting my amount back, Now I've ordered dell P2419H I should've ordered it first hand cause dell has quite the reputation for the quality displays,picture quality is great if you can get a good monitor for them also color accuracy is great too but the light sensing feature is kinda buggy when you switch the color presets,go for this monitor if you have time and you believe in luck cause sure enough my luck wasn't the great with this monitor.i'd say that spend a couple thousand more and go for the dell or any reputed company which is recognized for its customer service.i hope this helps"
5,"**Update*After 2 months of use. got vignette effect on screen. Waiting for Benq Service center to fix it :(1. 27inch FHD IPS display is great to have for work.2. The Vertical monitor setup by rotating the monitor is also a good addition, I wish the screen rotates/changes from portrait to landscape automatically instead of setting the display settings on macbook pro.3. Swivel on 24 inch monitor rotates the neck of the monitor where as on 27 inch the neck doesn't rotate on swivel the monitor base has a movable pad so the entire monitor can be moved but not similar to the GW2480T (24 inch model)4. Cable management is good, I like the thoughtful ness went into the monitor handle on back, very handy one if you want to move monitor.5. Brighness intelligence with EyeCare features are great additions."
4,"Update:Bought it after some time and this unit seems to be defect free. Although its only 1 day, will test it for few more days but overall value for money device.I bought this one after a long research over Dell P2419H. The vertical mode is really useful for long document reading with less scrolls. Stand is really nice and build quality is good. It does not shake even at max height.Brightness and colors looked natural. Although I received a defective piece and in right 25% portion there was bluish tint. It is panel defect and can not be fixed. I returned on same day and now waiting for some time. because i believe if I order again they will send me one from same batch which can be faulty again."
1,"I purchased this monitor 6 months before, and now I am starting to see eye visible (70%) of the screen with yellow light bleed. I logged a complaint for replace and they just gave back the same monitor saying all is OK. I then logged another complaint, and called the company managing the support services, the person was not helpful just stubbon saying this is not a problem until the complete screen is dead. Absolutely useless BenQ support. It is not about photography monitor, its a simple IPS screen issue, I have used IPS monitors all my life and I know about light bleed. I have now given an order for Dell ultrasharp 24inch which has great warranty support stating ""Even if a single pixel is brighter we will replace the complete screen"". And hence I will always recommend buying dell monitors, please!!. I tried to find the receipts of Benq support, but I probabibly thown them into trash long ago."

5,First of all this is my very first product from Benq.I am not that much aware of this company. I am very much confused before buying this product anyway after continous search on Internet I made a list for the 27 inch monitors to be purchased. Almost all leading brands monitors are above 18000 rupees however I got this product below 15000 rupees. The performance of the product is awesome. I bought this monitor for reading purpose especially for the PDF reading in a very big screen. This screen serves the purpose with reduced glare and good clarity. Those who want to purchase a big screen with reduced price with good performance and good clarity you can buy this benq 27 inch monitor.

5,"First of all It‚Äôs the best 1080P 22‚Äù 75Hz in it‚Äôs price(7500) and I‚Äôm saying it after my research based purchase and after purchase experience.Contents:- came with Monitor!, 2 piece modular stand, VGA cable, HDMI cable thankfully!, AUX cable nice!, power cord and power brick, some paperwork*************************Ports:- HDMI, VGA, AUX input(can‚Äôt be used as output when sound is coming from HDMI), power input*************************Looks and feel:-It‚Äôs so different and better looking than those full black monitor and on the inside it‚Äôs 75Hz display so it‚Äôs a totally different experience inside and out with this monitor, the white portion of this monitor stands out beautifully, the main display is half as thick as a usb plug display is matt finish so it doesn't matter if there‚Äôs light source in front of it*************************Display:-Vibrant output, Beautiful color production, No dead pixels and no color bleedingSome people had issue with color bleeding but not me, supports freesync and capable of 75 FPS output, I haven‚Äôt noticed any stain on eyes 10+ continuous hours and I‚Äôm a guy with glasses.It‚Äôs a  75 hz display, i‚Äôve used 60Hz display for 11 years and it makes a difference it‚Äôs only display in this price range with this feature and sealed the deal for me.You can game on it no problems just know that this monitor doesn't sell as gaming monitor  and gsync and display overclocking support is not available, it has 4 MS response time and is better at gaming than other similar monitors and some expensive monitors too**********************Speaker and sound:-it has 2, 2 watt speakers in the bottom which is not loud at all and lacks basic bass I'm not asking for much just enough, for reference my poco F1 has loud and clear speaker than this dual speaker monitor it‚Äôs just there and you shouldn't rely on it but is a nice addition, something is better than nothingFor speaker to work you can give input by HDMI cable and if you are using VGA there‚Äôs aux input too***************************Manual setting suggestion:-This is a 75 Hz display so first of all check that your graphics unit has enabled 75Hz from normally 60Hz refresh rate to enjoy it‚Äôs full capabilityFactory display setting of this monitor was with a warm color to give feelings of blue light protection which was not looking normal so you may have to tweak the settings to fit your needs***************************One thing to keep in mind that it‚Äôs a 21.5 inch 1080P monitor which has a 102.46 per inch that means if you use it in its native resolution text might be smaller for you, text is totally readable and clear but small so I have custom scaled this monitor to 109% now everything is fine for the monitor but windows OS is bad at scaling some text are blurry like chrome suggestion which is totally not a big deal but something to keep in mind and if you buy 24 inch monitor the price of that is just shy of double the price of this monitor.*****If we are talking about eye care than this monitor doesn‚Äôt put strain on eyes just set it to comfortable brightness and use a blue light filter like flu.x or use windows 10‚Äôs night light feature"
5,Best budget monitor in this price
4,It's a good gaming monitor with 4ms response time and 75hz refresh rate. And the screen is amazing. The only issue is backlight bleeding along the edges which noticeable when the screen display dark colors. Doesn't get distracting tho.
5,"So, here it is guys‚ô•Ô∏èGot it for ‚Çπ8999 on amazon saleI posted about this on Facebook earlier after ordering from Amazon that if is it okay and everyone like ""Hell No"" go for LG or this is not a good monitor.I just bought it at my own risk as it don't have much reviews on Youtube nither on Amazon (Only 45 reviews)Whatever,I just wanna say this is a underrated White beast/beauty.4ms 75hz out of the box, Ultra Thin.Most Loved AMD Free-sync.No major backlight bleeding issue like LG and Samsung have.(I attached a photo of dark scene to detect any bleeding)And the colour reproduction quality is just insane üî•Also comes with 2 piece of 2w speaker though it's not loud but it's better to have those.The white colour is just giving it a look of extraordinary.It don't comes with a DP port so the HDMI port is 2.0 unlike 1.4 on other monitors (Free-sync supports only via HDMI 2.0)At last , I just want that youtubers should review this underrated monitor."
2,I like packaging! And no damage as i expected!About led Its work amazing but back light bleeding...Its start flicking so i try to return 2 time.i recognized it was a problem with windows 10 auto color picking..Thumbs Up for great product ....Its worth for money 14K but i think its comes to 12K for good
1,"Its nice, 75hz refresh rate, good colors, average contrast , BUT it has some backlight bleed, check carefully, buyers.Edit : replacement is even worse, it has backlight bleed at different places, and color banding too, banding is worse than the tn panel of my laptop."
5,"As the WFH became the new normal, I wanted an additional monitor to be added to my laptop. I was expecting a HD monitor with an HDMI extension as my laptop didnt have a VGA port. After a bit of research, narrowed down on this monitor after seeing the reviews - definitely not disappointed. I have been using this for over a month now. I can say that I am very much satisfied - have to wait for few more months to see its actual performace.Pros:1. Really thin panel2. Provide HDMI & VGA connectivity for older PCs as well.3. Package has all the extension cords (HDMI, VGA, AUX, etc)4. Has 2w in-built speaker - not so great but can be useful sometimes. You can use the AUX extension to draw the audio out from monitor to any external speakers.5. Stand is easy to fix and holds the monitor perfectlyCons:1. Again very thin panel, looks delicate while handling - too risky if you keep moving your montior2. I see a blue light leak on top the screen - you will notice when you see that from top of the monitor (see image)3. No wall mounting option - so those who work with multiple monitors can't put them in the strut bracket.4. Locating the menu buttons is too hard at times, there is no written description on the bottom panel rather acer has given on screen navigation. I always use the blue power light to locate the power button and from there."
2,not happy with color quality
3,"The product is Great,,Irrespective of What everyone is saying about backlight bleeding or Contrast etc,, picture quality is Really great.IPS panel seems flawless, Contrast nd brightness are also great.75Hz with Amd freesync, FHD 1080p, With speakers, HDMI cable included, it really feels smooth.The only problem I had is this That There is a pink patch or say dead pixels in middle of the screen which only appears when screen is fully black,, still very annoying.Hoping for a Replacement.Seller:- Appario"
4,"This is my 2nd ever monitor from Acer. 1st one was Aopen which I still regret buying. The Aopen is pretty bad display. So after my 1st experience with Acer I was reluctant to go for Acer again. I had a few options in mind like Samsung LS24R350FHWXXL, Dell P2419H, Zebronics ZEB-A24FHD, AOC 24V2Q. Each one had some pros and cons. But finally I decided to go for Acer - color and thickness of the panel.received the monitor in good condition with an extra cardboard box packing on top of monitor company packing. As soon as I opened it, it just took away my mind. The white color looks awesome and the thickness of the panel is just too less for it to look the most sleek of monitors. Its bezel less and the colors are good too. Using this for a month now and all good, though initial few days it took time to adjust to the colors switching to this one form my old monitor, but now its fine.Please don't buy this for speakers as they are worst, hardly any sound from them. So speakers are just a gimmick. I hope the stand could have been a little more sturdy. Stand looks awesome in white but if that could have been a bit more solid, it would have been great.Overall, this monitor is worth a buy."
1,"Pros :>Style , ips , slim , amd free sync.Cons:>Over grains. Over sharpness. Over style. That's all . I'll recommend you not to buy by seeing it's appearance. Fonts aren't smooth , e.g bitmap font quality.And there is no quality driver in official acer website .How to fix fuzzyness :>By explaining yourself that you have bought a good monitor.> By sitting at distance so that your sight wont encounter that sharp fuzzy pixelated quality.> By rate it 1 in Amazon and flipkart .Thanks for reading"
5,"I have purchased this product at ‚Çπ13300. Its been one month. This is great product in this price range.The best feature of this monitor is it is very slim, I mean it is ultra slim. The picture quality is very good.The white color of this monitor is very beautiful.I purchased it for work purpose. Some time I watch movies on it. 75hz refresh rate good for gaming. I played GTA 4 on it. The was running very smoothly on this monitor.I have got some cables like HDMI, VGA, Audio and power cable. The quality of cables is awesome.Thanks"
4,Guys This is Akshay Gireesh from Dezire 2 Tech YouTube channel I have recently purchased this monitor for my new Gaming Streaming and editing Pc build because i am building my pc with an AMD graphics card I needed a budget freesync monitor and really talking about this monitor the first thing which attracted me is its ultra slim lookThis is an exellent product the first delivery of my product wast that good as it was having an unnoticeable small white spot so i returned the product and I got a replacement within two days really Amazon's service is great .This time the product was without any single issue and working amazingly If u are on a budget then i will strongly recommend you this full HD IPS monitor for gaming and editing.Guys full review of this monitor will be uploaded whithin a week on my channel Dezire 2 Tech do check out and from there u can decide whether to place the order or not Thankyou
5,"The monitor is very good. It's very thin and looks very elegant. The picture quality is also excellent. Assembly was simple enough.Overall, for the price, this is a steal. The pros far outweigh the cons.Cons :Height is not adjustable.Has only audio input, but no audio out!The quality of inbuilt speakers is not good, the max volume is too low to be useful.The monitor far exceeded my expectations."
5,Got this for office work purpose. Best monitor for both working and entertainment. Very light and thin screen and also bezel less display makes this product looks class especially white color varient. Got this for 7.9K best deal. Though it has inbuilt speaker output is not that loud but never mind you get AUX cable.Confused whether this one or BenQ... It features everything which BenQ has.. but look wise Acer scores well. Finally purchased acer and it didn't disappointed me.
3,"This product is actually a Good product nice viewing angles,picture quality and all.... exempt one thing that there is screen bleeding even after replacement of the product.Product quality in slighty above average...But greatly disappointed from screen bleeding on acer..one thing only to say that this product comes manufacturer itself has screen bleeding i think....so think thrice before buying this and there is no refund tooo.."
4,"I am writing this review after using this monitor for 1 year exactly.**I am editing this review. ( first, I write 5star before few months but now I am facing some issue hence reducing stars)I don't play games so I can't say how this monitor performs in gaming.I bought this monitor for my design and editing/production purposes. and this monitor was very best for it until last week.Now it has started showing very strong ghosting effact hence now I can't look at the screen correctly.wherever the white area on screen is, it shows gosting/motion blur and it pain the eyes if look at that area.this is just staring hence I don't know if this effect will increase in future or not but will update this review according to it in future.another problem I found is 1 dead pixel at around middle top area of the screen and heavy backlight bleeding at dark-screen which really don't bother me for now compare to this ghosting effact. If this will increase then I have to buy another monitor because it is already hurting me while working.If I talking about good thing about this monitor then it has very good display and color quality and monitor has also slim and cool design."
4,"The monitor is really great for those who are working from home presently. Picture quality is crisp and more natural. Definitely helps reduce strain on eyes while working. But stereo speakers that are built in with the monitor are useless, you will be barely able to hear anything from it and also there's no audio out jack, so you might have to connect headset to the laptop for meetings and calls."
3,The color reproduction of this monitor is very good though there is too much back-light bleeding.I was about to use it for photo editing but due to backlight bleeding I was not getting accurate blacks. The volume is too low that the inbuilt speaker is only useful in mid-nights in a very silent environment. You need extra speakers.I purchased a LG after returning this. Paid 2 K more. No backlight bleeding. No need of extra speakers. High volume.
5,"I am So impressive look prity, value for money,So slim,"
1,i purchased this on the 8th march 2021 it is not coming on now - Didn't even work complete 1 month... Today is 5th April 2021. And i bought 1 more monitor of LG same time that is just working fine without any problem. ACER Monitor not recommended wasted my money.
1,"Please don't buy this. The product which was delivered to me had clouding & backlight bleeding issue. So i decided to replace it & when the replaced product arrived, it had the same exact issue. Now I'm returning this product. Very dissatisfied. Never expected this from a company like acer."
1,"Too much backlight bleeding..not happy at all with the product. I have 3 other monitors, 2 from BenQ and one from Dell and there is no backlight bleeding in them.This monitor does not meet my expectations even though it is good interms of design but backlight bleeding is not what I needed"
3,"Cons:1.) There are two many wires as it's has a separate laptop like adapter for plugin.2.) Inbuild speakers are useless, better if is not available, I mean 2 watt speaker, not sure what is the purpose.3.) There is a AUX in cable, the speaker itself is useless, what's the means of input cable, it's better to have AUX out, at least you can use external speaker to permanently fix on your table.4.) There is not a single USB port.5.) There is no adjustment of screen, not even tilted one forget up and down.6.) For my use I don't feel the adjustment is right, moreover you don't have choice to adjust.7.) There are many wires visible on table, there is no holding point in monitor.8.) Decent pricePros:1.) The white color looks awesome2.) Bazzle free design3) Superb slim4.) light weight - 2.5 KGI feel if the height/tilt adjustment and inbuild adapter is present, this would be incomparable choice"
2,"It is not a bezelless monitor. It has about a whole inch wide bezel. I have a DELL monitor from 15 years back (still working) that has almost same bezel thickness.The pictures shown here are misleading. While the bezels are thick, the actual thickness of the monitor is much narrow, as shown in pictures. Would have been better to have inch wide monitor thickness whilst the bezels be less than a centimeter thick. Do not buy if you prefer a bezel-less monitor."
4,"It's a glossy white color, doesn't look as good in personal compared to as in pictures. Has 100% sRGB and 75Hz refresh rate in 1080p resolution. I choose Acer because of negative reviews of LG service centers. So far all good with the monitor."
2,"The monitor has lot white light bleeding in the lower left and right corners which destroys the black levels .Also, the bugs in the monitor firmware do not allow you properly configure the monitor . The speaker are just for namesake or we can say just hear the pop up sounds dont expect media experience from them . Buy it only if you have some budget constraint otherwise spend 1.5k to 2k extra for samsung or LG"
5,Best budget monitor for budget gamers. I purchased this for below 6000 during republic day sale and it's worth of purchase. Best looking for any setup. That 3W speaker is lound enough in quit environment. Minimal screen bleeding on complet pitch black background but you won't face any kind of of distortion in gameplay or movie watching. The sceen is anitiglare.
4,Overall display is very good as picture quality also you want  gaming on this display pls buy.I have faced issue with display. I have received damaged products. Display is bleeding on right Side and top side but I have checked tha picture quality is very good and value of money... For gaming....
3,"It's a good product for its price. The picture quality is not bad but not that great either. The monitor stand is straight-up bad. it wobbles a lot.Cons :- Monitor wobbles a lot.- When overdrive mode is set to extreme, there is a lot of ghosting.- 75 hz is ok for normal gaming, but if you want to play competitively, I suggest you to go for 144hz- Brightness is way too high for my liking, even the lowest brightness is way too high for me.- White color looks yellowish. you'll have to calibrate it from windows options.- Speakers are really bad.Pros :- The monitor looks amazing. The white color making it look really nice.- 75hz is great for normal gaming. from 60 to 75, it's a big change.- There are all the cables in the box- really small bezels.I hope this review helps.Update :After just 20 days of use, bottom part of the screen started showing black/dark colors.Update :the black light is gone, by itself"
5,1) Display clarity is superb2) Price is affordable3) No flickering at all4) Can work for long times without any stress on eyes5) Colors are true (While playing games and watching videos)
5,"Beautifully designed and value for moneyWhite sleek looks big but very modern designFeatures are good,  different modes for gaming,  movies etc.75 hzs refresh rates possible.Overall superior quality at the price point.  Thanks to Amazon discount and speedy delivery."
3,"Happy with the monitor. Provides great value for money (‚Çπ9499. Not recommend above this price).Pros:+Slim form factor.+White color looks classy.+Easy setup.+Good color reproduction for the price.+In-built speakers.+Support for Amd free sync.+Comes with vga and hdmi cable.Cons:-Hinge design is not good. Screen wobbles very easily, even while typing.-Speakers are of no use.-Only one HDMI port."
5,"The monitor is beautiful so is the color accuracy and the screen. Loved it. No backlight bleeding although had to get a replacement once since the first delivered product had backlight bleeding, but the replacement is perfect. Buy this monitor without a doubt if you are looking for a budget 27 inch ips panel with 75hz refresh rate. Also the monitor is aesthetically beautiful and super slim."
5,"Great monitor for 13k price. Only problem is that the screen is soo big, that 1080p resolution seems low quality. If the resolution was atleast 2k for this big screen, it would be totally cool. But overall a really awesome monitor"
1,It‚Äôs 0% brightness is equal to 60% brightness on my smartphone(iPhone SE 2020). Will definitely going to hurt your eyes.
4,"It's too bright picture quality I feel settings are little complicated still I like the monitor because of looks , looks wise awesome go for it , speaker sound is too thin. More of treble"
5,Excellent piece for this price. Speaker in the monitor is lousy but that's not exactly a fault per se. You can hook an external speaker to this monitor if you search for those options inside the menu
1,"The Acer HA220Q monitor is the worst.It's just the worst ips monitor I have used in my life.The product I received was defective it had severe screen bleeding issue also the images are not sharp when compared with other IPS displays. The contrast is also not up to the mark.The product is also not exchangable when contacted the customer care.Think well before you buy it. Remember , When you see an attractive price there is something behind it.The photos are also shared with it."
1,"Writing this review after using this desktop for 3 months. So it is from long term perspective. After almost 2 month of usage this desktop , we have started seeing the lines in the desktop and need to get it replaced under warranty which the ACER team is not replying to.  Overall this is pathetic.. :(Need amazon help to get this replaced under warranty"
4,As usual my review would be on end user side rather than being technical.1.First of all the screen have thin bezzels and it is not bezelsless.When it is switch off it gives you a fake promise of bezzeless due to its protection film cum glass.2.Why I have purchased it.I need a wide screen for my wildlife film editing and I have one more samsung 27 inch curved HD monitor for content viewing.3.1080p vs 4K yeah its true you will see the pixel but only you will focus your eye on screen from a 4CM distance.While working with a normal sitting position this is awesome.4.Who should buy.A  Video editor (pro and advance )or by a photo editor.A big No for Gamer this is made for more on budget centric commercial sector then for a pro gamer.You will like it while editing movies with any software like sony vega filmora or adobe primier .Multitasking Yes it is very easy for them.Casual game.It can be but I would suggest to go for a more 100hz refresh rate and delay responce.The thing which I dont like it there is no height adjustment in stand.I/O port are limited.No inbulit speaker but most of the movies editor has Studio Speaker.HDR:Buy it for everything but not HDR.It just a vivid+ mode note an HDR but still it looks pretty (at least for me)Material:Plastic.Stand are made of metal and plastic which looks goodFinal verdict:If you are video editor no matter whether u are pro or beginner just go for it.At this price range this is the best but if you have a budget go for min 2K resolution.Gamers:Unfortunately mates this is not for youMultitaskers/programmers:Close you eyes and buy.Entertainment: Can be but wide screen is not recommended without a curve for Entertainment1 star is missing as there is no hight adjustmentConsidering the price tag this nice product from LG
5,Nice product. Exact solution for my trading requirement. Extremely happy with this deal.
1,Cons:1. the main feature of the display is to use the on screen display for multi tasking. However i found that the CD provided doesn't have the on screen control software. I looked in the lg website and it says no so software available.This makes the display less useful.2. Also the advertised HDR10 effect while playing movies is not great. it looks over saturated.
5,"After a lot of reviews on ultrawide displays, I was lucky enough to find this under a price of 25k on Prime Sale. I‚Äôm using this for design purpose primarily, video editing and viewing HD movies. The wide screen helps in splitting screens and comes really handy in the WFH scenario. So far the experience has been splendid, I‚Äôd add additional review post a month of use. Delivery was smooth and arrived next day."
4,"Got this monitor for my WFH setup. Serves the purpose but some facts you should know before buying , my personal views on those :1. Very wide , better than 2 multi monitors .2. Color accuracy is spot on , eye candy for movie and videos consumption.3. Monitor looks sleek and awesome when switched off as well.4. Great for ultrawide gaming as well fantastic colors with 75Hz refresh is a very good feature for this monitor.5. This supports HDR 10 and it looks good , but keep in mind its not the HDR picture mode in settings. HDR is totally dependent on your PC . Anything lower than intel 7th gen and nvidia 1000 series wont support HDR. And if your PC supports HDR then you can enjoy it on this monitor without setting it to any mode(default).Why gave it a 4 star :1. As few others have pointed out , the split screen feature is not available out of box , I haven't used it till now.2. A little disappointing , but the multi input seems to be gone from this model WL500 which was present in WK500 üò™.3. A very important thing to know , this is a 2560*1080 p monitor , I am used to a 14 inch laptop with that 1080p resolution. The 34 inch will definitely have a lack of Ppi and hence the text and icon quality is really bad. If you intend to use it only for office work or productive work I would say dont buy this big monitor with such low resolution. (One point , I sit around 3 feet from the monitor)Ps. If you want to see more lines of code or more text from a file at a time , you are going to be disappointed bcoz of how distorted the text looks üò¢I bought this monitor only because I have just started working , and my budget was hovering around 15-18k. I got this at 25.5k in Prime day sale , so just got it. And 1440p uktrawides are crazy expensive !! almost 50-60k more just for that resolution bump !!!I am totally happy with this monitor for media and color accuracy. But the small texts look really bad. The skype application on windows looks pathetic , so i have to use it on my laptop only. Please keep that in mind and go for this monitor.Though there is a trick you can apply by supersampling with help on your dedicated GPU (Not Laptop). That may give better results. I have only laptops so can't try that yet.Overall get this if you consume a lot of media as well as need a bigger screen real estate monitor. But know that text is going to look bad and that's a sacrifice you gotta make at this price range."
5,"For quite some time I had wanted to get a dual monitor setup but the mess of setting up of two monitors with their stands was also bothersome. So I decided to go for an Ultrawide monitor also thinking of the future updates i would be making to my workstation. When I received this product and connected with my existing cable, i was upset that it wasn't clear enough and everything was looking so dull and faded. I started looking around solutions where people were writing scripts to darken the page for ultrawide monitors. After using it for 2-3days, I hated it and wanted to return but as a last ditch effort, I connected it with the cable that came with this and all of a sudden, an Avataristic display sprung to life! This monitor is amazing and deserves every bit of recognition among developers as its of perfect size and fits everything I want in it. And, its relatively cheap! Absolutely no complaints, even though its not 4K, it does not matter, the resolution and the HDR have filled my plate. I was having some trouble connecting this via thunderbolt 2 port on my macbook but was able to get that working with 4K Belkin MiniDP to HDMI Adaptor (has to be 4K even if the monitor isn't 4K, it surpasses the 1080p resolution, it being 2560x1080 and thats why needs a 4K adapter) I also use a macOS app called Lunar to control volume and brightness right from my macOS instead of the physical controls"
5,"I had been using LG 27inch for about a year and that was good - but split screen would constrict the width a bit too much. LG 34 inch ultra wide is perfect for those who need to work on two windows simultaneously - ample width for seamless work.Picture clarity is awesome. Monitor controls are via a small joystick, using which you control the picture settings per your need - provides quite a few options.No flicker - very stable display.Improvement areas: For wall mount, VESA holes are provided in a cavity - so you need longer screws to attach the bracket. Also, the HDMI/ power ports are behind the monitor and connector point outwards - so, when you wall mount, they hit the all.... would have been better if the ports are provided facing sidewards..... If to be used for table stand - its perfect..."
4,"The primary purpose of my purchase was to use it for my home office setup. Besides my office work, I use it for web browsing, media consumption, non professional photo and video editing. After 2 weeks of usage, following are my thoughts:1. I was initially looking for a curved QHD monitor and the prices for even the 2016 models were around INR 85K. At INR 27K it is a solid buy. QHD monitor will have a much better resolution but this monitor serves my purpose2. I would not recommend it to a professional photo or video editor. I would rather suggest going for a 16:9 aspect ratio 4K panel3. For multitasking it is awesome. The OnScreen software comes in real handy. One criticism is that the monitor came with no instructions for downloading the OnScreen software. The LG India website does not list it in the Software & Support category for this model number. However, I realized that it is same software for all models. I ended up downloading it from the LG US website by typing in an alternate model number. Works like a charm4. It is great for media consumption aswell. Given the 21:9 aspect ratio, for most of the youtube content, end up seeing black bars to the right and left. However, I find the content still immersive5. There are 2 HDMI ports and 1 audio out. It is adequate for me but it will not be future proof6. I really wished that this monitor had in-built speakers. I use my bluetooth headset instead7. I did not try gaming on this monitor but 60Hz/75Hz refresh rate will be ok for casual but not competitive gaming8. The stand that came with the monitor is just ok. While it is stable, the monitor has a tendency to wobble a little bit while typing hard on the keyboard. The monitor can be only tilted up and down. There is no ability to adjust height.In conclusion this monitor is a good value for money despite a few missing features"
5,"I needed one good big monitor instead of multiple smaller monitor for my trading. This has fulfilled my purpose. This is good. I don't play games so don't know much about it. However, this is good for watching videos too. One can buy it."
4,Pros1. Excellent for multitasking. (Use 6 to 8 Excel sheets together)2. Screen Split software by LG is great but a bit slow.3. 34 Inch Wide screen format makes work flow a lot easier very seamlessly.4. Matt finish is great for direct sunlight use. (However max brightness could have been better)Cons1. The company stand does not have any movement in height or any other axis. (Bought an Amazon basics Stand)2. If you are used to 4K laptops the display quality is just adequate.3. No built in speakers just in case you want to use a fire tv stick to play content.
5,"34WL500 - Firstly I brought this monitor for 21500 INR after applying offer (1500 INR on credit card). Was looking at the reviews and the price of this monitor for a long time, price was fluctuating between 27k and 25k and the negative reviews were mainly due to gaming. When the price came down to 23k, I decided to go after this. My intended usage is for VirtualBox running on laptop and display for my desktop PC ( no gaming). The split screen and dual control works like a charm. You can download the software from LG website for any 34 inch monitor. Only negative I see here is height is not adjustable, but for my home setup this was not an issue. For this price range I doubt you'll get a 34"" widescreen monitor. Setup is very easy, probably less than 5 minutes to get it up running, LG also provided a Hdmi cable. And finally thanks to Amazon for delivering it before the scheduled delivery date."
1,"I wished for a wide screen to get away from multiple monitors for my programing needs.This monitor is one of the worst when it comes to text rendering and reading, which is majorly what programmers do.My 6 year old Dell monitor (21.5 inches P2214H) is much much better at it.My assumption that the more than full HD display and a sufficiently wide monitor should suffice my need is broken. This monitor is not designed for coders. Worse, this is not a returnable product so I essentially burned down my 26K :("
4,"I use Dell U2415 (24inch 16:10 ratio 1920x1200) Dual Monitor Setup at work as well as at home .  So my comparison of this is based on that.  I bought this when I moved to my  hometown due to covid19. The screen real estate is good enough for those who are used to two 24inch monitors. You don't have to pan you head like a dual monitor setup. The effect of lost screen real estate is small since there is no bezel in the middle here. Unlike Dell ultra-sharp monitors, this has a physical menu joystick. The touch sensitive menu buttons on dell monitors are really annoying and the menu changes when there is no input detected and they take while to switch inputs . In this one when a new input is detected , there is an OSD popup informing that. There is a headphone out which gets audio through HDMI, volume can be adjusted using the joystick.I use this with the integrated graphics (Intel UHD 620) on my laptop. I find the image quality to be normal.  This is a decent monitor for work from home. May not the be the best option if you watch streaming videos. The videos on Amazon Prime and others are 1920x1089, even when the original content is 21:9, the streaming services adds padding. The 21:9 content on youtube is very limited.Things I did not like-Power button is using menu joystick, would love a separate power button.No USB hub. I wanted a DP over USB C, but that model is just announced by LG and not yet available in India.No DP port - It is standard now in almost all big monitors.The plastic feels and looks really cheap and is uneven in some places.The vertical resolution of 1080 is not a future proof one for gaming.HDMI cable included is not very good quality one."
5,"LG always produce good products. This is also an excellent product.After struggling initially with my mac pro 13' I am able to use the display at 2560x1080, 75Hz. Initially I was not able to use LG on screen software. It says No monitor connected. I connected with windows laptop and then connect back to mac. now everything seems to ok. This might be bug.Split screen works like a charm. I am happy with this since it increases my productivity to put windows side by side.Overall I am fully satisfied. Thanks Amazon for selling this kind of monitors."
5,"So big and best setup for Video Editing and Gaming!I use this mostly for video Edit and Trading!So amazing and the big 34 helps the edit panel very convenient for editing and for Trading, having four charts at once helps me track easily!Simply go for it if your budget is 30k"
5,"This is extremely good for Working, acts as two monitors.Controls : Joystick works pretty well to control Brightness, Contrast, volume and etc..No inbuilt speaker, works well with externals.Couldn't find the software to split screen, not even in LG support. Got the installer from a friend and its working good.Never tried for Gaming, so no review for Gaming :)"
4,"What a buyer must know but is not clearly brought out in the description of LG UW 34 inch WFHD IPS Display -1. The HDMI cable needed must be Mini Display Port ( mini DP) to HDMI type, if you want to connect it with Macbook. Do check if your PC/ Laptop has mini DP or regular HDMI slot. The cable supplied is suited for standard HDMI slot. I wish one more cable with miniDP to HDMI was also included, since this monitor supports two separate inputs  (from Different PC).2. There is some time delay in refreshing of charts occasionally. I use Trading View and Kite platforms for trading.  I have been refreshing the whole chart manually occasionally.3. Please note, that this monitor allows display of input from either of the two computers connected. So, there is a possibility that multiple programs running from your laptop which you display in various windows ( upto four split screens) may result in slow down. If you want two windows to be input from one PC and the other two from another PC so as to ensure that speed of the programs being run/ charts being displayed is not affected, this monitor WILL NOT serve the purpose. For eg. I have to run myFnO, Trading View, Zerodha Kite charts from the single PC - Macbook in my case, and this results in a lag in refreshing of charts in Trading View/ MyFNO/ Kite.So serious traders who can afford may like to choose next higher model of LG and spend another 10K or so."
4,"Good product no complaints  so far if you are working from home you need itFast service by amazonDon‚Äôt remove screws from back of monitor just assemble stand slide over it.Yet to explore lg driver for split screen etc but will figure it out if not then some other driver should be compatible from lg support downloadAnyway if you are a Mac user you can buy magnet app or tiles app from App Store around 5$  it lets you stack multiple apps on multiple monitors does not have to be lg any monitor and then each time you login your apps are set , point being there are always work arounds üòâ"
3,"Good ultra wide screen. But the main feature that I bought this, that is split screen doesn't work. The software that you need to install from LG website, gets installed but it never opens and keeps erroring out. Event viewer in windows shows that the application has thrown an exception. I tried many ways to get rid of the error but with no success. Only LG can fix it. they have to update their software. The main purpose for which I bought the monitor has failed. I am not happy with the purchase."

3,"Pixelated texts. I have a Macbook pro as the main laptop. This monitor is a big let down. I bought mainly for office work ( word docs/ Excel sheets), pixelated texts. I should have gone for a 4K monitor even with a bigger price point. Or better,  buy a 24 or 27 inch monitor at best and save the additional money. At 25k it is a waste for me. Amazon refused for return, I would have upgraded for a 4k monitor."
4,"I purchased it and today it is 25.01.2021 almost 2 month after purchase, I found it very good for seeing charts in a big monitor. Far(10 times) better then a laptop monitor. Your trading will get better and overview in market will change drastically if you start using big monitor. Though split screen is not of much use if you don't owe any good trading software, but in zerodha you can use it for two screens/four screens and, those two screens will help you seeing chart in better way. If you want to make a trading setup with this monitor it is good monitor atlease you should have one, monitor like this."
1,Disappointed üôÑ backlight bleeding...I requested for a Replacement and  the request was granted. But have not  picked up the monitor yet.
5,"The build quality is great, it's not thin like most LED TV, but it feels strong, the display brightness is way more then what I expected, I have a macbook pro 2019 and this display is brighter then that, I recommend use HDR or vivid mode for better experience, All the ports work well, the display or the adapter don't get hot with 38¬∞C room temperature. Well I miss the retina display of my mac because in retina and oled displays black color looks great but in this screen it is not that great, although in full black pixels you won't feel differences in the screen, the light scatters properly and it really feels premium. Overall it's a good display 34 inch is way larger then what I expected you guys should buy this."
1,"Was delivered on 19/Aug/2020 and its not even 3 months since I have started using it. Now there is a vertical blue line that has appeared on the screen and doesn't seem to go away. It's very frustrating to look at, especially while working. Please advice if anyone has faced such issues and was able to get it fixed or get it replaced."
5,I always have been usi g two monitors for my work... But with this size of monitor it gives me more convenient to use. Excellent picture quality. Split feature is very convenient. only con is that you will have to download software from LG site if you want to use the split feature...
2,"Not that good build quality and display was not that good.Its left and right edges have a blurness. I replaced one but still the new one have this slightly.Ic u nee perfection go for 80k price range ,otherwise it's value for 34 inch ultra wide series.thats all."
4,Onscreen control is not compatible with Windows 10pro. It shows only until Win8. Any suggestions how it can be used in Windows 10. Because Split screen feature is my main reason to buy this monitor.
5,"Its really awesome for music production and even light video editing. I also played games. As this is a 75hz refresh rate display, you wont get more than 75fps. But again 75fps@1080p is not bad for me as I am not a hardcore gamer. Or else the display is decent. No issue regarding display. I also never felt like pixelated because I work at distance of 3feet from the monitor, so for me it's not a big deal. Even I use it for document work and its decent though(personal opinion) rest all is up to you. If you want it for hardcore gaming then No.......go for something better with 144hz display. For music producers (beginner-intermediate) its a great choice. And about any flickering issues, no till date no issues."
5,"It took a while to get this running well. I have a 2017 Intel Macbook Air and the recommended settings for this display is higher. This needed me to do my own research and invest in a lightning to HDMI dongle that could transfer the data faster.To get split screen organization, you will need to download software from LG. And this model is not listed. So I downloaded software for something that looked like this display from LG's US website. All of which needed research.So to get this display to work the way I want took an additional 2-3 weeks of work. Once this is done, you are in good shape."
1,"I received thi monitor yesterday and on installing and switching ON, it shows only defective LED lines all accross the screen. Have immediately asked for replacment. Very upset as this was certainly not expected from a brand like LG !Will update status as it happens."
5,This is an amazing product at the price...The size is perfect and apt for work ...I would not be using this for gaming although it has a gaming mode. It connects seamlessly to two laptops/computers and the software enables to use both the connections at the same time.I am very satisfied with the purchase and amazon continues to serve well.
5,A very good screen with lot of options and it has a very good features like splitting up the screen in multiple windows and can do multitasking at the same time. I think its little pricy for this configuration. It has very good picture quality but not exactly 4k and brightness of the screen is also good for getting what you want see with battery saving options if necessary.
5,"It's fantastic.. definitely you can go for it..Good for Music producers , video editors and Programmers who wants to do multitaskingPicture quality is also fine..doesn't pixelate muchBrightness is good if keep at level10 for long time use without affecting the eyes"
4,"The functionality explained in the listing i.e., dual linkup and dual display (picture-by-picture) i.e., simultaneous display side by side from two sources is not available in this model. Although I purchased this monitor specifically for this purpose.Apart from it, the is a huge monitor (expect two 22"" screen combined) so if you really want this big only then go for it. Picture quality is good. It supports split screen but from the same source (one computer at a time) yet useful function. You have to install softwares from lg official website."
5,"It's huge, works like a charm if you need to work/view multiple windows simultaneously. It got delivered today. I'm yet to mount it on the wall. My son tried playing a video game and faced some lag. Just be cautious in case you are looking for a gaming monitor."
3,Monitor is binking. Dont know what to do. I had updated the driver and refresh frequency
5,"I bought 34WL500 from Amazon and found resolution 2560x1080 which is bad for screen size 34 inch. Atleast 2k(2560x1440).Texts were little blur, I started getting headache in 5 min of use.But here Amazon does amazing things....I was worried that the monitor was only replaceable. But Amazon accepted the return and returned the product.Thank you Amazon."
5,"Picture quality as usual justifies LG‚Äôs brand name. The ultra wide screen is useful to open 3 apps side bu side.The headphone jack doesn‚Äôt work, not sure if it‚Äôs problem of this particular piece, but I don‚Äôt need it so don‚Äôt bother much.Only thing missing is a height adjustable stand."
4,First delivery was received damaged. Replaced it within 2 days and all good now.Monitor is good for daily use and multitasking. Not tried any games yet so can't comment if this is good for gaming. On the costly side.
4,"Bought this monitor for my 2016 MBP 15"" and works flawlessly.Design is outdated with clunky buttons and thick bezels, but that display, oh boy! Is very good.This is my first ever HDR display and it makes MBP screen's colors look a bit washed away. My laptop screen is noticeably sharper(Especially for 1080p content), thanks to its nearly twice dense ppi, but for 4k content this monitor is very good!A usb hub would have made this a perfect monitor, but I was planning on getting a thunderbolt dock anyway. Read some online reviews opining that this is a better display compared to  similarly priced acer et322qk."
5,"In all aspects (Quality, Performance, Price, etc) this monitor is better. Those who are looking for 32-inch UHD can consider this one.This monitor doesn't offer PIP, PBP features which is not a deciding factor for me."
5,"31.5 inches of real estate, 4K, USB-C and HDR (though the brightness isn't enough to really call it true HR, you need minimum 500 nits for that).You can't ask for more at a price of 33-34k.The display is gorgeous, and thanks to the incredible contrast ratio of 3000:1, you can even use it as a smart TV with a Firestick 4K or Mi Box 4k (I got this).I'm a designer so I got it because of the color accuracy and it delivers perfectly. I can barely distinguish the colours from my 16"" MacBook Pro display.Keep in mind, it's a VA panel and not IPS panel so you might feel the colours are not as punchy but again, the contrast ratio (3000:1) is a lot superior (IPS panels usually have 1000:1) as a result which means your blacks look closer to black than dark greys you see on IPS monitor panels."
4,"Removed one star because benq neither provide app for monitor settings nor for split screen.Its VA Panel so images degrades slightly if viewed at an angle.Blacks are much deeper and uniform than IPS panel, loves it. Just like IPS glow on IPS panel, there is very very little VA glow, doesnot bother much. Audio is pathetic.Its really better than LG 32UD59 (VA panel) in image quality. which costs Rs 45k.Monitor is too heavy that my table mount monitor  arm can't handle it."
4,"I wanted to get a big monitor for software development.My requirement was:1. A 4k panel, preferably IPS2. 32 or 34 inch3. Eye care features like higher refresh rate (although I am not a gamer)4. Good ergonomics - height, tilt, rotate5. Acceptable sound6. Budget up to 40kSadly, No monitor ticked all my needs. After spending too much time comparing all available options in my budget, finally ordered this. Other contenders were Benq PD3200Q and LG Ultragear 32. Dropped due to 2k resolution. Since 2k at 32 inch is same as full hd at 24 inch (my existing monitor).Went with Benq EW3270U, since it it has 4k resolution and eye care features. The shortcomings were not major factors for me.Review:1. Display: Very good for programming. I have scaled up the sizes of items by 100% using windows settings. Still I can see two files side by side. Big test is easier on the eyes.2. Auto brightness: Tried it at night. It was too bright for me. So turned off and manually reduced brightness to 20.3. Adjustments: My table is a bit too tall. This monitor doesn't have height adjustment. So I need to look up. Will get a separate monitor stand to fix this.4. Connectivity: Tried HDMI. One slot didn't work - didn't detect signal. Second one worked, but resolution was only full HD. Switch to USB 3 cable, and working fine. Only problem is that the supplied USB 3 cable is short.5. Sound: Surprise! Many reviewers have said that sound is too low. I found that there is a setting in monitor controls to adjust volume. By default, they have set it to 30% (stupid decision IMO). I increased it to 100%, and it is louder than I can tolerate."
2,The monitor in itself is just mind blowing. But a cluster of dead pixel right in center of screen. I saw on Benq website they dont replace panel in warranty if there are less than 6 dead pixels. This is just unacceptable. So I returned it the day after. Although the resolution is so high that u cant notice in daily use. But you will definetley notice when something white or light appears on screen over dead pixels
5,"Monitor is big. It's like you have 4 16 inch monitors together. great for productivity. But, it will take time to adjust.I mainly bought for office work, i don't play any games.Main thing to remember is cables given with the monitor are fully futuristic and you may not be able to use immediately.Cable 1: Both sides USB type C of USB 3.1Cable 2: Monitor side DP port, laptop side mini DP.I wasn't able to use both cables to connect monitor to laptop even though my laptop is very recent laptop.My laptop which is Lenovo X390 only has USB type A USB 3.1 and a HDMI port.So, i had to buy another HDMI cable to use the monitor.28 inch variant of the same monitor comes with a DP port on both sides though.Another disadvantage is there is no height adjustment or side adjustment. Only adjustment is -5 to 15 facing adjustment.Just 4 days now, will update review after rigorous usage.Review after a week. I have a lenovo thinkpad x390 and lenovo thinkpad thunderbolt 3 dock. Monitor is not getting detected automatically on connecting to dock. Manually i have to remove the cable and reconnect to detect after starting the laptop. If i restart, settings are retained, but if i shut down, settings are lost and again on starting laptop, i have to manually remove the cable and connect again."
5,"First of all, this is an amazing monitor for the price! I highly recommend it if you do a creative works as a profession/hobby which requires color accuracy. I do 3D art and work with colours a lot and this monitor is just a lot of fun to work with! I'm coming from a FHD monitor and experiencing this 4k monitor is just amazing, everything is super crisp and clear!That being said you will have to do some color calibration on the monitor. The whites and gamma on the monitor were absolutely trash when I turned it on for the first time. Colours were okay though. The white balance is completely off and is orange-redish.  The gamma is off too and makes everything looks washed out, blacks appear grey, etc. I don't have a colour calibration tool but I managed to do it with the windows colour management software. If you have a pre calibrated monitor at home, you can use that as a reference like how I did.After calibration, the monitor is just amazing. It left me speechless. 100% recommend you to colour calibrate the monitor.I've attached images, A is calibrated, B is before calibration. Images were shot with manual exposure, white balance and ISO. It's not an accurate representation but should give you an idea."
1,"after going through lot of reviews, I decided to buy this monitor and I bought it on 25th Apr 2021.Things went well for first two weeks, and then the worst happened. I am seeing vertical lines from the last 10 days though i didnt move the monitor and i kept that monitor on a heavy-sized table (5x3ft).I dont know what to do with this piece, I am thinking to throw away this one and buy some other brand monitor."
5,Good value for money. Picture quality is very good. Large size is very good for coding development and general office use. Connected using USB-C to my MBP and it works Without any issues. With default settings the fonts are too small; too small to read- increase the scaling from Display settings of your MacOS and it gets much better. Lot of room for multiple windows. Planning to get one more to make dual monitor setup. Speakers are below average and no USB hub either. It‚Äôs disadvantage. BenQ should‚Äôve added atleast two USB ports making it convenient to connect or charge your phones. One other disadvantage: Even if you connect MBP via USB-C MacOS reports the battery is not charging. Overall good monitor for the price.
5,Using it for my PS5. It has very crispy and colorful display. HDR works great and even the eye sensor is very accurate.No issues with eye strain or colors being displayed inaccurately.Very good monitor for this price range. Amazon took around 10 days to deliver it to Mumbai.
4,"I have been using the monitor for 2 months now, and it has not given me any problems. The build quality is good. Sound quality could have been better, but for a monitor that costs only Rs 32,000, this is a minor nitpicking. Overall, great monitor. Go for it."
5,"Using it for my hackintosh setup, and gives u the retina display at 2k resolution. Colours are accurate, brightness is more than enough, HDR is a hit and miss. Fits in well with the wfh setup and being 32"", really does help manage organising windows very well."
5,"Great Picture quality thin bezel, sturdy stand with multiple ports (2xHDMI, 1x DP, 1x USB-C, headphone socket.The colours are great with good saturation. Probably one of the best 32"" 4K monitor at this price."
5,"The product is really good, since the size it little big it can give you a pain in the neck.Resolution is excellent, but without windows scaling it will be difficult to see the text. But on higher scale its crisp and clear. Not all softwares are scalable, text can be blurry sometimes.For programming I say better go for a 2k resolution antiglare monitor, that should be a best buy coz the text gets real small in this 4k displays.For entertainment this will be perfect buy."
4,"Well this monitor is not meant for gaming. You can still play games with vivid details @4k, but due to low refresh rates, response and fluidity wont be like other gaming monitors.HDR in 4K is just cherry on top.For media consumption this Monitor just hits all the right points."
5,"The BenQ monitor is awesome. However, do note that you need to buy a separate hdmi that supports 18Gbps+ speeds for 4k display. Also, if you are using Linux, you will not get 60Hz, which is my case. I think drivers in Linux are responsible for that and not the monitor.Thank you."
5,Awsome monitor. Got what I was expecting. Note that before buying check whether your laptop/desktop supports 4k output. Otherwise it will show only 2k or HD resolution. Dell Inspiron 3521 doesnt support 4k output.
4,Product packaging is goodDelivered on timeBlue eye is Good for office workFinds it good for learning purposeSpeaker is not audible even at close distanceMissing height adjustment is bit minus but not required in most cases as the screen size is bigger.
5,"Hdmi cable Missing .. only 3 cables (power, type C, Display cable)Good all in one entertainment monitor.Able to play in 4k ..cool"
5,I bought this monitor for my series x and it's awesome thank you benq
5,"probably the best for the price. Because it's not ips panel ,viewing angles are not good but very good contrast ,sharp and clean display, no edge bleed, accurate blacks."
3,"If you are using a MacBook Pro like me, you would hate this display. The VA panel just can't give you good colours and the viewing angles are very poor. Go for any IPS monitor instead."
5,"The picture quality is excellent and it's a joy to use a 31 inch 4k screen. Volume is a little low, but a very good monitor, probably better than most others available for the same price"
5,Good
5,Good value for money
5,Breathtaking views and ideal for both gaming and multitasking. Videos come alive with the screen. Though it could improve with colors at an angle.
5,"Good display and great picture quality , and better colour representation"
5,"Excellent monitor, nice and decent, value for moneyDead pixel - not found in naked eyes :)Thank you BenQ and Amazon both."
4,Nice but.. Big size. Not compatible
5,Amazing!

1,I just purchased this monitor today and it's screen starts to flicker after just 30 seconds of booting up. Can someone help me why does this happen.
3,"This monitor has a VA Panel. I had read that the viewing angles of a VA panel are bad, and I saw it in action on this monitor.It is a nice monitor, good colors, but you HAVE to look straight at it. The image washes out when viewed from an angle of even 60 degrees.This is good as a primary monitor, but not as a second monitor.My suggestion is to stick to monitors with IPS Panels if you would like to use it as a second monitor, and would end up looking at it from a slight angle."
4,"The colours are great the refresh rate is smooth af.. scores 144 hz on ufo test with hdmi cable too havent  tested on the display cable coz the display cable given in the box doesnt fits on my laptop since most of the laptop have micro display cable you ll need to buy one micro display cable to dp cable adapter.....1080 p on 27 inch doesnt effect much if you are sitting too close to the monitor unless you will see some pixalation but you ll see it in any 27 inch 1080 monitor you buy  and it aint effect much i am a architecture student and i do many graphics related works and its works fine. Gamming is smooth ...preety much everything you need ...go for it . Giving 4 stars because of the display cable, .. the seller should have given a micro display  to dp port cable  too and it didnt have a hdmi cable too in the box i have to use an other hdmi cable for it thats why...rest the performance is nice i ll edit it if i have any problem in future"
5,"This is one of the best monitors I have used. I had benq xl2411 earlier which is a tn panel, this monitor is an ips but gaming performance wise I felt it to be on par with the benq monitor. I had some apprehensions earlier regarding 1080p resolution on 27 inch, but they are no more, the image looks very crisp and the colours makes everything on screen very beautiful. Different modes on the monitor actually help achieve different purposes, fps mode for instance was helpful in playing games like CS GO, where the things were smooth and dark areas visible with fps mode on. Likewise vivid mode brings out some good colours for viewing pleasures when you watch a movie. The HDR mode works, but it only slightly enhance the view over vivid mode.Overall this monitor with its price range is one of the best ones to get if you are into competitive gaming and don't want to compromise on visuals as well."
5,"I actually ordered the lg 24gl600 first but i was skeptical about the tn panel,then i saw this monitor got listed and i quickly cancelled that order and order this one mainly due to ips 144hz and hdr.The product delivered on time and the installation was super easy.Now coming to the monitor,the display is stunning for media consumption. I was worried about the 1080p on a 27 inch might look bad but its not unless u sit really close to the monitor then u can see the pixels.Games like Witcher 3 and Assassin's creed Odyssey  just look stunning.Gsync works great and the hdr option boost the color saturation too much that everything look like Borderlands.The monitor is very bright so i had to set the brightness at 6 . 1ms MBR mode works great but reduces the brightness a bit and i loved the joystick to change the osd settings.Lastly,switching from 60hz to 144 hz is a blessing to a competitive gamer and go for this monitor u won't be disappointed."
2,"When i unboxed the product it was really good. When i setup the monitor it looked good but the sharpness was very bad as compared to a 24 inch monitor , Everything feels soft and words are difficult to read . The HDR10 is also bad as expected . The colour calibration is difficult and it does not feel like an ips panel . If u are a gamer then go with a 24inch monitor. The colour accuracy is very bad. This for only those who want to watch movies and some users in office. The sharpness is very bad and freesync cannot be used with mbr. The response time is fine for normal users. If u look closely u can see the pixels. I am returning this monitor cause there is backlight bleeding too and sometimes ghosting. When mbr is on the brightness decreases too. Please only buy if u are on an budget and cannot afford an 1440p 27 inch monitor.I used this monitor with my rx 5700XT"
4,"Display is best you can get, and can easily compete with even top monitors.But text is another story, text is not as sharp, due to 1080p on 27', in my opinion 1080p is best suited for 24' below. But it is true for any full hd 27' monitor, pixelation will be there for text.It is excellent for gaming, csgo was an absolute delight on this panel.Now coming to stand - It was worst and kept shaking on accidental leg bump, any monitor will shake on leg bumps but duration of vibration was too much. It was a deal breaker for me and I returned it. (Maybe I got a faulty unit, but LG is notorious for shaky stands even on premium monitors). Buy a vesa stand or mount (they can be expensive).My Verdict : Excellent for media consumption and gaming, average for text, or coding (not a deal breaker)"
5,"First of all I'd like to mention that I purchased this monitor(27gl650f) for Rs. 19999 and its very well worth it. It is a 27 inch 1080P monitor so you really cant expect crisp images here. Many people here are complaining about its pixel density, any 27/32 inch monitor running on 1080p resolution will never give crisp images, if you want crisp images then go for 2k resolution for 27 inch and 4k resolution for 32 inch monitors. 27GL850 is a better monitor here but its almost 15k more expensive than 27gl650f so people who bought this monitor despite reading its a 1080p monitor dont have the right to come cry here for not getting crisp images, blame your own stupidity. Ok with that said, lemme start talking about what I liked and disliked about this monitor.What I liked -1) ZERO FLICKER - I've never once had a flicker issue, the screen ran flawlessly even when there were some power surges, my monitor isn't connected to my inverter-UPS line so most of the other monitors didnt handle this well.2) ZERO SCREEN TEARING ON NVIDIA GPU - I run this on my 2080super and this is one of the very few monitors that have G-SYNC at this price range so i've never faced any screen tearing issues.3) RESPONSE TIME @ Max Refresh Rate - make sure you keep RT at faster and not fastest, and the RT is roughly around 4ms but the 144hz definitely makes up for it.4) COLOR BLEED - am surprised reading that people say this has horrible backlight bleed, it has to be a defected piece because it has very low backlight and color bleed which is barely noticeable.5) REFLECTIONS - matte finish makes this monitor handle reflections very well6) IMAGE RETENTION - has 0 image retention. What I disliked -1) HDR 10 - its pretty bad, it looks more like a marketing gimmick but at this price point you cant really expect a great hdr 10 screen.2) Response time at 60Hz - its slow at this RT, average is around 12ms and its very surprising considering its avg 4ms speed at 144hz3) Build quality - not exactly a fan of ultragear build quality...most of it is plastic and the mount is pretty average. Good thing it has VESA 100x100 so wall mounting is always an option.Verdict: If pixel density is an issue then go for 27gl850 which has 2k resolution(1440p) and has better hdr10 display and better reflection handling when compared to 27gl650f but remember that it costs almost 33-35k so at this price point, this monitor is definitely worth the money."
5,"rainbow six siege, csgo just name it i play them in it and has been a good experience.color issues can be fixed through settings.my settings:1: game mode - gamer12. 1ms mbr- off3. freesync- on4. black stabilizer- 455. response time- fast6. crosshair- off7. brightness- 758. contrast- 799. sharpness- 6010. gamma- mode211. color temp- cool12. dfc- off13. smart energy saving- off14. power led- on15. automatic standby- off16. osd lock- off* black level cannot be accessed if you are running the display on display port it is only available on HDMI.*setting the displahy on response time - faster, there is slight visible ghosting which is kinda negligible but stiull if you are the quality perfection kinda guy then keep it at fast only which gets the job done blindly.*hdr is off coz the monitor is ips panel with srgb and when tweaked from NVIDIA control panel to 10bpc instead of 8bpc the quality blooms from better to best. to be specific hdr is barely needed for any genral use its just for eye candy delight and a extra feature for the product to stand out from the crowd thats it.*display port cable is 1.4 so yeah its the one to get the juice out of the product by hitting the 144 mark and also getting the gsync power if you are thinking about using HDMI then i will advice to gety a hdmi 2.0 or 2.1 cable to reach 144hz and the crisp quality that this ips can produce.*black-light bleeding is natural for ips panel so no need to cry over it things have advantage and disadvantage and this is it you have to accept it but the product i received had minimal bleed so yeah while ordering pray that you get a perfect panel or else replace is your only option.*its 27 inches  and 1080p is a question indeed as 1440p is the generic resolution that comes with 27 sizes but believe it or not LG did a great job with their engineering pixel density is less indeed but its barely an issue its perfect in its own way no doubt on image bursting or quality.upvote if helpful..take care."
4,"The Monitor (GL650F) out of the box is not color calibrated. Rated it on a low score because its HDR is washed out a bit, lots of blue tint to it, otherwise its a good monitor, if you ignore slight pixelated view due to low resolution.Here are some color calibration and Gaming related settings to get the most out of your monitor;Brightness : 68 / 0 prefered - your choiceContrast : 50Gama : Mode 2Picture Adjust -> Color Temp -> Custom,then Set R/G/B - Red = 56, Green = 48, Blue = 42Response Time : FastAMD Graphics Card : FreeSync = onNVIDIA Graphics Card : 1MS = onYou cant have both 1MS and FreeSync ON, unfortunately.This is a good monitor for consoles, but if you use it for PC gaming then its a disappointment (even the LG GL850, infact, all 1080P monitors in year 2020). If its for PC go for at-least 2K or 4K monitors minimum 75Hz refresh rate, if your graphics card is not strong to give 60FPS at that resolution or stick to 144Hz as consoles are going to be the next thing in future of Gaming thanks to Xbox Series X and Playstation 5."
1,"Product is ok, value for the money, but disappointed with the seller, there was no HDMI cable in the box, the I tried replacement still the seller sent the monitor without any HDMI cable even though it's mentioned that HDMI cable is included in the box and in the manual"
5,"Firstly the looks are superb red black theme. monitor is best for gaming, no pixelation at all while playing games or surfing the internet..1) hdr 10 support best for movies2) 144hz feels great while playing fps shooter games such as csgo my gameplay is greatly improved3) very little screen bleading from right bottom side corner not an issue at all not even noticible4) Gsync compatible as well as amd free sync for those having nividia gpu and amd gpu5) monitor stand height and tilt adjustable6) brightness is very bright no issues at all that too with really good colour and contrast ratio7) anti glare screen so u wont see any glares and reflections irritating"
4,"Bought it for my Dual monitor workstation+Gaming setup. Planning to add a 4K UK650 with it which seems to have similar Bezel structure.Pros -1. Cost effective (Got it for 20K during Prime Day sale. So wait for discount on this)2. Thin bezel. Almost 89%+ display area3. VESA Mount possible and comes with an excellent stand with height and tilt adjustment.4. Sharp and enough brightness5. 1ms response rate. You can feel it during competitive gaming.6. 1 day delivery (May change based on location)Cons -1. Can view individual pixels due to FHD resolution. Not a big problem unless you are a photographer.2. Doesn't work with LG monitor management software.3. Does not include an HDMI cable. Only Display cable included.4. Function Menu not intuitive.5. HDR mode is kinda OK, not great. (Although depends on your GPU)Overall a great monitor if you are planning for 1080p gaming, documents, office work and dual monitor setup with another 2K/4K monitor for streaming. Value for money and with LG's awesome support network across India, reliable."
5,"Perfect viewing experience. The reason i took this one was because of the entry level G-Sync capabilities (it also has AMD free sync). I have a Nvidia GPU so it only makes sense to go for G-Sync compatible monitors to fully explore the gaming experience (Farcry, Tomb raider, fifa etc). You can opt for AMD Free sync monitors if you have a AMD Radeon GPUs (these monitors will be less expensive than G-Sync ones).90 degree rotation for potrait mode is additional benefit apart from height adjustment and screen angles. No motion blur, screen tearing found."

2,"First i use Samsung 21.5inch tn panel display 60hz, so pixel is great in display bcoz 21-24inch is sweet spot for 1080p, but i need to upgrade the Monitor for better gaming. So i buy this 27gl650-f and my experience is not good bcoz of 27inch display. It doesn't mean display is bad, display is ultimate for watching movies,pictures and videos so i return bcoz my first priority is gaming, i habitual to playing in 22inch display, but i dont like 27inch for 1080p.So if u want best ultra sharp gaming 1080p buy 21-23 inch display ips with 144hz and a freesync/ g-sync compatible.I will give 5 star for best panelI will give 1.5 star for 1080p Gaming"
1,"Got A Faulty Panel White Borders Around The Panel,Never In My Life I Experienced 144 hz Display But The White Borders Around The Screen Just Ruined It,Asked For Replacement Will Update After Geting The Replacement.Edit: I Returned The Miserable Item Again In The Replacement The White Border Was Coming All Around The Screen, I Am Now Relieved After Getting Rid Of The Faulty Item,Guyz Pls Don't Buy This Monitor From Amazon,If You Are Buying This Monitor Check Out From Local Store.EDIT:Got The Replacement,The Screen Has Now Has Right Side White Border Which Is Unnoticeable So I Am Keeping It.Conclusion:Buy At Your Own Risk,Because Seller Is Dispatching Faulty Items Likely,Bunch Of Scalpers.Update : I Just Returned The Monitor For Refund As The Black Light Bleed Was Getting Worse And Worse ,Now I Am Feeling Relieved,Next Time Will Buy Monitors Or Tv From Local Store."
5,Jumping from 60 hz to 144 hz is awesome.just bought it already loving it smooth frames and awesome gameplay experience till now all over its is best in this segment nano ips 400 nits brightness.Allover my best gameplay expericence yet. morning it reached was play game till now and just like to share my experience till now.IF YOU HAVE THIS PRICE POINT IN MING JUST GO FOR IT YOU WILL THANK ME LATER:)
1,Dead pixels are for sure I returned once still got a dead pixelWorst service I had to go to the post office and ship it myself for return yes they gave me the money for it but still they could've picked it upTook more than one month for this process I had to call almost daily since they weren't acknowledging my problems
5,Disclaimer: I‚Äôm no gamer / doesn‚Äôt do editing so don‚Äôt take this review for granted if you are either of above two.:-)I‚Äôm a sucker for looks and this Monitor definitely meets the criteria. Did fair amount of research and was okay with 27‚Äù monitor for 1080P ( most of the pros suggested 24‚Äù for 1080p if you are a gamer/do editing work) as most of the work i do is as of now is from a laptop.Monitor is sturdy and strong. Easy to assemble and hassle free. Comes with a DP cable and not HDMI. NO IN-BUILT SPEAKERS.
5,"Perfect buy for gamers üî•üî•First of all the stand, which is very sturdy and magically weight balanced by the monitor itself, to adjust the height all you need to do Just one finger to adjust the height.Monitor: to get a precious 144hz refresh rate you have to use display port , hdmi can't able to provide 144hz , hdmi supports only upto 120hz, and you can see the noticeable difference between 120hz and 144hz refresh rate.. 144hz is a treasure for gamers, with a good graphics card you can easily reach 144hz in high refresh rate games. I personally play euro truck simulator with this monitor I have attached a pic from that game you can see the colour reproduction of the monitor, in real life the clarity is so realistic and crystal clear.IPS panel: viewing is so good there is no point to complaint and it also has 1ms response time which is equal to VA or TN panel..in VA or TN panel you have to sacrifice viewing angle bcoz in those VA and TN panel the viewing angles are worst.. but in this lg 27gl650f ips panel has the best viewing angle and best refresh rate and best 1ms response time for this price, which is awesome üî•HDR enabled monitor: which is actually true also it has many color modes, In that when you select HDR effect preset, you can see the colour difference magically I personally use the HDR effect which gives best colour by the monitor .G-sync and AMD free sync compatibility : no adjustments needed seperately for nvidia and AMD Radeon graphics card to adjust the monitor for graphics card output which is coolIt also has a adjustable response time, HDR (on / off), 1ms response time (on / off),cross hair function, you can adjust almost everything"
5,"This Monitor is Absolutely Bang for the Bucks. One if the Best 1080p monitors Available online.Pros:+ Clear Picture , Very accurate Colour.+ Viewing angle is more than perfect, you can even watch it from 140¬∞ angle and it won't fade any colour.+ Premium quality IPS Display.+ Solid build quality.+ Easily Provide 144Hz with 1ms Blue free Motion time.+ Adjustable Stand - supports tilt, pivot and Hight adjustment.Cons :- The Screen size is 27inch but the display is 1080p so the Pixel Density is Low.- You will see pixelation if you play 480p or 720p movies,videos. Only 1080p Content Recommended.- The Bazzels Should Have more Protective layers.- The box doesn't include HDMI Port, so if you want to use this as a secondary monitor for your laptop then you have to buy a HDMI cable Separately.- Only DP cable can support the full 144hz refresh rate, HDMI is limited to 120hz.- The HDR mode Slightly increase the Response time and You need a high end GPU to Run games with HDR and FreeSync or Gsync mode on.Overall It's a GOOD PRODUCT if you are planning to Buy a Monitor for all types of uses Including Gameplay, Watching Movies,And Editing."
4,Very good monitor got for 20.5kIf u haven't experienced 27inch 1440p in real life then u won't notice the 1080pStand is adjustable in all ways up down portrait etc but is wobbly keep that in mindColor accuracy is what u would expect from LG IPS response time is 4-7ms gsync only on DP cableNo hdmi in box 1ms response mode gets invert ghosting which is annoying and I use it at 4-7ms onlyPaired with 1660S and Chillin
1,"There is Bluish light at Left Side of the Monitor. It is more noticeable with white background. It disturbs when I do coding. I liked the Monitor But, the problem of the Monitor hunts me all time.Otherwise, With 144 Hz refresh Rate, it feels smooth when Gaming."
5,"I have never used a 144hz monitor before; this was my first.I have been gaming for the past 15 years. I predominantly play Apex Legends. I had a 21"" 60fps monitor for the last eight years, which was not great for fast-paced games like Apex. Secondly, shooting opponents far on 21 inches is tricky as you can not see them correctly on a 1x scope.Now about this monitor, I received 24lg650, which is pretty good for my standards. The movements feel smooth and strafing enemies can be tracked much easily. And I can feel the upgrade.My expectation was low for this NT panel, but surprisingly, the colour accuracy is not bad. There is a bit of ghosting in some specific colours combination, especially for light blue and light green objects that creates a dark brown trail. The kind of game I play did not affect me much. Also, keep in mind that by default, the refresh rate was 60hz. I had to set free sync to Extreme to make it 144hz"
5,"If you are using Laptop, make sure your laptop has a Type-C to display port converter to utilise 144hz because laptops don't have display port (hdmi will run at 120hz).Decent screen with custom stand for adjustable height. 27 inch is perfect if you are doing casual gaming and video editing/extra screen for coding."
5,"1) The Delivery was good.2) No defetcs3) 144hz is simply awesome4) Haven't tested FreeSync5) Perfect for gaming6) While coding, I was getting some eye strain staring at this big screen for a long time.There is no wrong with the product, I follwed these steps to overcome while coding.1) Please make sure that your sitting posture is right (check in youtube).2) Aligin the screen correctly.3) Maintain some distance from the screen and increase the coding console's  size.4) Reduce more brightness."
3,"The backlight under normal use conditions is a bit too much and hurts my eyes even at 50% brightness. If i lower it further it affects the color considerably and dark's become too dark in certain games and videos.However in general i need to keep the brightness at 30% or lower for it to acceptable not not completely strain my eyes.For me the eye strain is a deal breaker and thus it gets only 3 stars.  It is possible that other may be used to or comfortable with this  level of brightness,In all other situations this is an absolutely great monitor."
1,First of all 24inch is too much for me.second brightness is too high.144hz was giving me unforgettable headache.also its too bright and in menu button brightness can't be reduced at too low level.only price is plus.those who are migrating from small size monitor please demo before going to 24inch and 144 hz gives dizziness and headache.
1,Please note that the display port cable in the package is of low quality and will not give display (flickering).There is no HDMI cable in the package too which makes things much complicated.I tried with seperately bought hdmi cable which made the monitor work fine.
2,"The display quality of the monitor is good but there is back light bleeding on the right hand bottom corner. I tried to minimize the issue by reducing the back light brightness but it is of no use. It is quite distracting during dark scenes when watching videos. I am wondering whether to return it, because a replacement unit might have even worse bleed issue. LG needs up their quality control system. Overall I am disappointed and would not recommend others to buy this monitor.Update: I have decided to return the monitor as the back light bleed is getting worse over time."
4,"It is a great monitor.Blown away by the color accuracy and it is fluid 144hz display.Use the display port to get maximum out of this monitor.But I found one problem there is one tiny stuck pixel around center of screen and it lighted green but you won't notice it while gaming or consuming videos but you will find it when you run any dead pixel/stuck pixel finder program.I have seen so many others reported this problem.But since this seems not a big issue as I am not noticing it in normal usage I'm not gonna return this monitor.But I will take away one üåü just because of it.And for IPS bleed, I'm not noticing any major issue to get reported"
5,"Very, very good monitor. Would be even better if this supports 1440p resolution rather than 1080p. At this size 1440p is better. Apart from that, the resolution , brightness, colour calibration out of the box are all very good. Didn't see any dead pixels either. The monitor sent to me doesn't have noticeable backlight bleeding, but your mileage may vary.The 144Hz refresh rate adds to the value. Would like swivel adjustment for it, but at this price that maybe asking too much. Recommended buy, if it is on sale."
5,"Overall I'm happy with my purchase the picture quality is great HDR in games are good don't expect best at this price in videos average just one con the Balance between HDR and SDR content is not that good even if you sett brightness lowest for SDR it's little high and colors are little on cool side but overall all on this price very good monitor for gaming even it's 27"" the 1080p looks good no tearing issue just every thing is bigger cuz it's 27"" monitor and one more thing the anti glear coating on screen that's little bit less you can see little bit reflection but overall good product"
4,"Excellent Gaming Monitor Experience ‚ù§Ô∏èDefinitely should choose the one who want IPS Display with Gsync support in budget.. the one who is thinking abt Pixelization its wrong because i was worried abt that in full hd 1920x1080 may be get issue with Pixelization but seriously not even disturb u until observ deeply and i have tested 4K videos and it played so well, and it will be more good clarity when we sit back and watch.Gaming 10/10Videos 10/10Editing 10/10"
5,"First I was gonna buy an IPS panel. But in my budget only acer's IPS panel monitor was available with 144hz display. And review of those were not good. Though review of this LG panel was good, but it was TN panel. So I bought and I am enjoying playing games on this one. I got display cable instead of hdmi cable. So getting full 144hz refresh rate. Packaging was good. Color quality is good."
5,Such a amazing product from LG ultragear.picture quality is nice enough for 1080p monitor with adjustable brightness and other settings.Gaming is just amazing trying out cyberpunk 2077 and so far 144 RR works smooth...tilt angle is also nice addition...modes are also present with buildin presets..reading mode is also available.I connect it to my Lenovo legion laptop and to my PC.Coding with multiscreen support by installing software from LG website works very nicely.writing after 3 months of usage and its very sturdy with monitor stand. any 100x100 vesa mount is compatible for wall mount.just go for it!
4,"This is pretty thin for a monitor of this caliber:DThe g-sync compatibility really helps in competitive games as well as Multiple AAA titlesThis is a review after 1 week of usagePros :- 1. great viewing angles2.Gsync compatibility at this price range3. No pixel density issues4. Aux support5.sleek and slim design6.inbuilt hdr effect + hdr10 (this makes everything beautiful)Cons-1. Tilt is available only till 180‚Å∞2.Sometimes extra backlight is seen from different viewing angles3.it isnt smudge proof,so avoid touching the display during monsoon4.hdr effect sometimes messes up the pixel density5. It's a bit heavier than normal monitors so handle with caution .Tips :- 1.this monitor is a bit heavy than other monitors so handle with care AND dont forget to fix the screw at the base of the stand before mounting the monitor2.inorder to enable gsync , you need a nvidia graphics card which should be connected using a display port which is included in the box"
5,"This is really nice  monitor , has 144 hz and colours are great , and gaming is really good on this , though while watching other videos sometimes I could see pixels it's fine not that disturbing, over all its great and value for money and it's IPS if HD gaming is preferred this one is enough , this won't come with speakers mind that , display port cable is provided with the box which works fine with frame rates over all great purchase during great indian festival thank you Amazon !"
5,"Writing review after one month of use, very good monitor to use. I am not using for gaming purpose as of now. Very good finish and easy to use.  Arrived in very normal package, but company packing is awesome and pretty easy to install. One of the best in gaming monitor in this price range."
4,"Edit: Received defective product. Will change the review after getting the new piece.New review: Received a new one. Seems to have a lot of ghosting issue. Using it with mac and xbox. Xbox identifies this as a 4K TV which is messing up the fps. Not sure how to get around with it. If 4K is turned off, the HDR stops working (for Netflix in xbox).And yes, the 27 inch is a bit big for this resolution. Not a huge issue, you will end up seeing pixels once in while though."
3,the screen ha all the features physcially good refresh rate..good build quality..but the on screen display controls could have been with software instead of joystick and it would be excellent.the height adjustment could have been still lower for lowering..overall excellent choice for average gamer and very good ..not much to diagree with this one.go for it ifnu can get it below 20k
4,Good product. Resolution is good. Both VGA and HDMI working. One HDMI cable should be added. Value for money.
1,"This monitor fraud with us, Because this monitor has tn-panel but this is not mentioned in description I don't love this monitor. And also I'm not using this monitor from the day it arrived at my home. And for gaming there is better monitor in market with ips display. I dont recommend this monitor for budget gamers also."
4,Serves the purpose and it works fine. Good for office use. Or Work from home and use it as a secondary screen.
4,"Decent enough monitor. Didn‚Äôt face any issue. Packed well. Working as expected.All buttons are provided at the back of the monitor. Bit inconvenient. As we wont change settings freq, it is ok."
5,Best product
3,It does not have hdmi slot...it's old school that's why cheap...
5,"nice product cheap and best quality, good stuff at this price rangeBut picture quality is disappointing, if you are looking for some game and video video playing stuff then don't go for it, but just for office work then it's the stuff for you.For gaming not at all recommended...."
2,"Text did not see clearly with rtx 1660 graphics Card. This screen is detect my system 17"" inch but box is printed 19"" what's wrong I don't know. This monitor is also so small size"

4,Good for pc  and games only

1,"The problem is in the picture clarity. The left half is absolutely excellent but not on the other side, some yellowish color which dulls the monitor. Have called LG Customer care for service and awaiting his presence to sort out this issue. If not I will soon return the product.Update: The service person convincing that it is nature quality of the light reflected which appears in white background. Yes, couldn't able to find any yellowish while playing videos. But, still it looks awkward. I usually work with white background software where I do not prefer this rile thing. I'm returning this LG monitor. Thanks to LG and Amazon for this awful experience.Replaced Product Update: Now Amazon making me not to buy their products.1. Seal is broken and revamped.2. There is a bulge/ bump in the frame of the screen.Returning this frustrating product. And I want my money back.I think this is my last purchase from Amazon.@Amazon, Don't play with LG brand, LG has lost one loyal customer because of you."
5,"This is a good 1080p monitor at this price:i have purchased it @8199 during sale, and i feel it just worth it considering the price the product is well build comes with max 2 years of Warranty do read all the warranty related information on LG website or on the warranty card>the Monitor comes with a HDMI port, by default i remain on 60Hz but if u want u cant take it upto 75Hz (u need a AMD card running on HDMI with AMD free sync On)colors are pre-calibrated but the coverage is only 75% of the color gamutcontrast ratio is also goodDont Get Confused about this Monitor This is a IPS LED montior Not LCD as its written on product name(for a moment i got confused with that)It is not entirely bezel less there is a small bezel but its  doesn't looks bad!if you are planning to buy this monitor go with!Hope these informations would be helpful to you all.. !"
5,"Excellent monitor at this price range .display is really nice and the colors are all really vibrant. It supports freesync and upto 75Hz refresh rate. You get an HDMI cable too, even though I didn't see it being mentioned in the product page. I am fully satisfied after buying such affordable and budget range Full HD LED Monitor.Cons:1. Glossy plastic back and stand finish attract lot of fingerprints2. Stand can only tilt, there is no height adjustment or rotation feature3. Only one HDMI Port4: No Speakers and USB port"
5,"This is a splendid product. Very to-the-point approach from the manufacturing perspective. One of the best price-to-performance ratio.Pros:1. Freesync is supported. This means if you are using an AMD graphics card, your refresh rate automatically shoots beyond the 60Hz limit.2. Reader/Custom modes are available. As a user who uses the PC for gaming along with web browsing, movie watching, programming, a reader mode is very much required. Prolonged exposure to vibrant and bright colors are not always the best fit for programming. This monitor takes care of that.3. Comes with a decent HDMI male-to-male connector. The cable quality might not be world-class but does a decent job of responsive video data transfer, when it comes to quick display changes (like gaming).4. Minimal bezel at the edges.5. Beautiful and faithful color representations.Cons:1. No horizontal swivel. This is a minor nice-to-have feature. However, the monitor does have adjustable vertical swiveling, which makes up for the missing feature.2. The main monitor control button (at the bottom base) is a little cumbersome to handle. This could have been better designed.Two things to take note of:A. If Freesync is turned on, you might have difficulties getting into BIOS as many motherboards do not support displays beyond 60Hz. It's kinda stupid but worth knowingB. For the programmers: This is a normal DPI monitor (meaning the Dots-Per-Inch is 96 and so, it does not fall into the high-DPI category). This is just an information. This does not mean that the monitor is good or bad. Just that it is a normal DPI monitor.All in all, a great monitor. I could not find anything to reduce even a half star from the product rating. 5 stars from me. Been using this for more than two weeks now."
5,"The whole box comes with plastic visible wrapper. So the shipping was awesome in 1 days delivery. However inside the box 1 monitor, 1 stand neck , 1 base stand, 1 cable management clip, 1 HDMI cable, 1 driver cd,  and some documents comes. No vga cable . Hence can use your old one. The base stand's design is awesome with half circle shape.  Made inside with aluminium  finished with hard glossy black plastic. The stand neck and the back side of the monitor also has glossy plastic finish. Back side there 5 ports including vga port named as D-SUB and HDMI port. So I connected my monitor via vga cable cause I have no HDMI port. however ther are wall hanging option too at back. Front side the whole 16:9 ration screen has very narrow literally invisible bezel but when  you will switch on the display you can notice very thin bezel at 3 side while the bottom has normal brezel with LG logo and only one joystick switch (Lg likes joystick ) . The resolution of the monitor is pure Full Hd with IPS cinema panel . The panel quality is A++ with very accurate real color production and this is the feature of the IPS panel. IPS panel is very helpful to the editors or graphics designers or gamers. Also this monitor has black stabilizer by which you can easily enjoy the dark scenes on screen.  LG is a leading led tv maker company with OLED screen, so it is as expected that it have to be a great panel. The control of the monitor's can be changed either from the utility on screen display software provided in the cd or by the joystick monitor button moving and clicking right left up and down. However the other company's monitor is not so good or balanced cause either they have panel with corner light bleed  or faded color grade or less port while this monitor has balanced features with perfect black which makes this monitor great and popular. I damn gurantee that you will not regreat after buying. Also this monitor is protected by Lg's manufacturing warranty. I got this monitor at  Rs 6800 with card instant discount. So thanks amazon and thanks seller and thanks LG . Hit Like if you have liked this preview"
1,"Product is good. But after 2months of purchase my monitor is showing vertical green line at right side. And I have to go to service center too soon.  And they told they replace panel, whether I don't know they replaced panel or not. Then they called me after 3 days to take my monitor. And the problem was solved. And again after 3 months I faced same problem and took to service center they are simply saying water damage. And this won't come under warranty. And they showing only photo of monitor panel which is good. And they are telling they'll charge for that. And I never wiped my monitor with dry or wet cloth then how could this happen. And I even know that's not water damage. They simply want to charge money from me. And I'm never gonna buy any lg products anymore.one of the worst customer center is lg. Its better to go with dell monitors"

5,First of all thanks to Amazon for delivering this product within 24 hours from chakan.1)Display of this led monitor is quite fabulous üëåI'm fully satisfied with it.2) It gives upto 75hz refresh rate but by default it gives 60hz you need to change it by going to display settings. 3)Gaming performance quite looks like a charm that's what I can say right now after 9 days of usage. I will highly recommend to buy this product from amazon and I'm sure it will win your heart too ‚ô•Ô∏è**Updated 11/04/2021**This is the second monitor I bought for dual monitor setup and its simple awesome... Thanks Amazon once again
1,"So Sad to recieve a defective product when u r as excited as i was üò≠ . The right side of my monitor had a large shadow, dull area . I‚Äôve returned it,will order again from diff seller after gettin my money back üôèüèª"
1,"the color quality is not up to the mark especially blak color is very poor in screen -screen shows grey color which is bit disappointing after spending double money on IPS technology.Pros-1.average power consumption is about 14 W which is good2.stand and look is good3. reading profile settings is available with pc software which is easily manageable.cons- 1.in built picture control is very bright and flickering you need to set colors and display settings from PC2.IPS panel quality is not up to the mark the contrast ratio is poor and black color is dull in screen, which is most important factor of Panel in order to enjoy perfect viewing experience.3 default brightness level of monitor is very high recommended to adjust it with in built graphic software of PC."
5,The very first thing I loved about this monitor is that its color calibrated. Not many monitors are. The first monitor I received took a beating during shipping and had a horrible backlight bleed. The second one was good and has no backlight bleed issues. The display quality is fantastic. The color is uniform and there is no flicker. There is a bit of IPS glow just like any other IPS panel. Navigation using the joystick is a breeze. I paired it up with my PS4 and everything has been smooth sailing. Just remember that if you notice backlight bleed after buying this monitor get a replacement asap. No one is mentioning about backlight bleed here and just accepting it as if it's a common defect.
1,"So the monitor stop working after 2 days of use , it was good until 2days but after that it become a trashSo I got a replacement for the monitor laterGuess whatIt's was not working eitherAnd now I got a another replacementIt was working but the quality was so much disappointing after 3 days the colour of screen become more pink , so I adjusted it by reducing the red colour in rgb but still it was not a good experienceThe Amazon services suckI really wanted a refund I don't got itTip: for buying monitorDon't get lured to free sync monitor if it's only 60hz monitorFor gaming look for High hz rate monitor instead of type of panelUsually go for the tn panel it's cheaper and have high frame rate and more fpsFor gaming fps is more important than viewing angle, color and contrast60hz monitor are not suitable for high end games  go for a 120 or 144hz but don't buy that if you don't have a proper graphic cardBuy a ips panel only if you are going to watch too many videos but not for gaming unless you have a really enormous budgetVa panel is a compromising option between ips and TN panel"
1,"<<dishonest Seller/LG>>  THEY ARE SENDING RENEWED PRODUCT AT NEW BUYING.I'm saying this because the display panel (i.e. LCD panel) changed to lower quality panel. At the display resolution 1920 X 1080  @ 75 Hz the blue color (color code #0078d7) looks pixelated and if the refresh rate is reduce to 60 Hz this problem almost gone. This thing happen when the panel mismatched with the controlled board.I asked to monitor technicians and other who also repair monitors, they have same opinion.I saw this monitor at our local computer shop and my friends also buy this same model from local shop. But the monitors from local shop has a grate picture quality and less back-light bleeding (barely noticeable ). And no pixelated blue color.There is no option for No Star rating, so I've to given one Star.I DON'T RECOMMENDED THIS MONITOR FOR GAMING. Because the response time is about 10ms on normal settings.About 5ms is possible by turning on the faster mode but there is too much inverse ghosting. And that will be a bad experience of gaming.Also beware of LG service at Westbengal region. According to their warranty policy the product can't be replaced only repaired. And the service person can't do anything except changing the service date.(In my case I called for the upper bar glowing problem but the service person, instead of coming to my house he solved the problem by himself. Yes , the person send a problem solved massage to LG against my complained without coming to my house, without seeing the problem with monitor. That was his supper power)"
5,"Video watching is very impressive and it wont disappoint movie lovers. It can be also useful to beginner level editors. Setting up the black stabilizer well can help the editors. It has very good view angle at the same time. It provides flawless gaming experience as a monitor made for gamers.Screen split feature is included in the on screen control. You can split the screen and assign different tasks on those. You can choose between many layouts, it can be life saver for web developers and few other professionals. While multitasking you can open PIP and play your favorite media in any part of the screen. Overall the on screen software is very simple to use while very useful. t performed exceptionally well compared to its budget. i will recommend LG22MP68VQ-P monitor for gamers, photo and video editors, web developers and professionals specially for those who are looking for a good monitor and tight on budget."
5,"I expected it to be good.. But when it came, I opened it and plugged it in..  then I was just delighted with happiness..Believe me it's the best panel under 10k budget.. Many of friends have different types of monitors .. but when it comes to picture quality.. This one is at the top of the list ..The color reproductions are outstanding..75hz , free sync , alsmost borderless display and most importantly IPS panel and yes the best IPS panel in the segment..No bleeding issue..I didn't notice IPS glow..Blacks are pure blacks..But only minimal problem is that it can not be tilted backward..Don't be panic going through negative reviews.. I will give it 10/10 on the price"
5,"Very good for the price range I got this one for 6400RS in great Indian festival sale. Very good for development purpose. Matt finish is good, not recommended for photo editing"
4,"Monitor is good but it's software doesn't work in windows environment when connected with VGA cable, need to check with HDMI cableSoftware works perfectly in Macbook when connected with HDMI cableAppears like technically VGA cable doesn't support/provide two way communicationSometimes when I remove macbook from HDMI and connect windows laptop with VGA cable then it does not recognize input signal and need to manually select input device."
5,"INTRODUCTION ::::::::::::::::::::::::::If you are looking for a great monitor, your search has ended. Without a doubt, it is the best budget gaming monitor . It is also the best monitor for video editing, movie watching and Internet browsing under 10,000 Rupees. And I will also try to explain, why it is better than its competitors, the Dell S2216H and HP 22ES, which are also awesome monitors under 10,000.WHY THIS MONITOR IS INTERESTING ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Under the budget of 10,000,a) It is among the very few monitors which are :* 1) 21.5 inch (Dell S2216H, HP 22ES, Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM,LG 22MP58VQ, Benq RL2240HE, Samsung LS22E310HY/XL, LG 22M38D, BenQ GW2270HM, HP 22KD),* 2) Full HD(Dell S2216H, HP 22ES, Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM,LG 22MP58VQ, LG 22M38D, BenQ GW2270HM, HP 22KD),* 3) IPS (Dell S2216H, HP 22ES,LG 22MP58VQ),* 4) Matte screen with IPS panel (LG 22MP58VQ and Samsung LS19F350HNWXXL(Glossy with PLS panel) ) (others have either glossy screen with IPS panel or matte screen with VA or TN panel)b) And is the only one which has :* 1) Free-sync technology,* 2) 75 Hz refresh rate(All other have 60 HZ)Please write in comments, if I am missing any monitor in the above list, so that others can read it.ABOUT BRAND ::::::::::::::::::::::::::LG makes some awesome products and they keeps providing cutting edge technology in its monitors. No wonder, we see them so much on youtube and other websites.BASIC INFORMATION ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::I will try to explain what these terms mean in brackets after the specifications.* Size 55.88cm (22)* Panel Type IPS (Best panel type for color reproduction)* Color Gamut (CIE1976) 72% (Color gamut refers to the various levels of colors that can potentially be displayed by a device.)* sRGB Coverage 86.1% (This is most common color gamut. Other are Adobe RGB and Photoshop RGB)* Color Depth (Num of Colors) 16.7M colors (Most common color depth. 10 and 12 bit color depth is for serious graphic designers)* Pixel Pitch (mm) 0.2915*0.2915 (Distance between centre of pixels to other centre of pixel. Lower the distance, sharper the image )* Resolution 1920 x 1080* Brightness(Typ.) 250cd/m2 (It's ok. Many other monitors offer the same brightness)* Contrast Ratio(Original) 1000:1 (Here VA panels are better, which offer better contrast ratios of 3000:1 like Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM. Better contrast ratio means deeper blacks. But for IPS 1000:1 contrast ratio is common.)* (DFC) Mega (LG's DFC is a meaningless number. Dynamic contrast means nothing, it's marketing jargon.)* (GTG) 5ms (Its not great, but its good for gaming. For awesome 1 ms response time look at TN panels like Benq RL2240HE)* Viewing Angle(CR‚â•10) 178/178 (One of the strong points of IPS panels is great viewing angles. No color distortion even if you look from very side)* Surface Treatment Anti-Glare,3H (Matte screen is a must have, if you have lot of light in your room)* Display interfaces D-Sub(VGA), DVI-D, HDMI (Many others have only two of these three display interfaces)* Audio output Headphone Out (Audio quality was not good, and why would anyone connect headphones to monitors instead of their PCs)* Maximum Power Consumption 17.6W* Sleep Mode Power consumption Under 0.3WADDITIONAL INFORMATION ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: * Also comes with cable holder, which is a detachable plastic part, that comes separately with the monitor and attaches itself to back of stand, and manages cables, so that you cannot see cables from front. It keeps things neat and managed. * It is VESA mount compatible. Many budget monitors are not VESA mount compatible. * Comes pre caliberated. Not many do. You get a printed 'color calibration factory report' with monitor inside box. You don't need to adjust anything by going into menu, if you don't want. * Not all IPS are good but this really is and shows a lot better image than TN panels. * You see sharper image on 22 inch 1080p screen, than 24 or 27 inch 1080p screen. As all three screens have same number of pixels, smaller size will have more pixel per inch than bigger screens.BONUS INFORMATION ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::I am really enjoying this monitor. If you like to have lots of features at low price and still want good quality product, this monitor is for you. Honestly I am waiting to see which monitor will come to dethrone this one, as the best budget monitor. I mean which monitor will be able to add more features than this one without increasing the price and still maintaining the quality.I have many stories to tell, about my experience with this monitor. How I connected this with different PCs and laptops and how it interacted differently on them. Not going to bore you guys with details but a word of advice try to use this monitor over HDMI, as it works better and adds feature instead of VGA.You also get OnScreen Control Software with this monitor, which I liked. Its simple to use. You don't have to control monitor settings from menu by using the joystick but you can do it from this monitor using your mouse easily. It lets you add display presets to different applications. And the presets will change automatically, when you switch to different applications. For example; if I add Reader preset to Microsoft Word and Cinema preset to VLC player, the brightness and contrast will go down whenever I switch to Word and will go up, whenever I switch to VLC.You can also use screen split feature with one click from it. Screen splitting is that you can split your screen and look at two, three or four windows at a time on your screen. For example; I can look at chrome and word, side by side and I will not have to switch between them again and again, if I am doing work which needs both of these applications. Although, Windows 10 and some other free softwares like WinSplit and GridVista,offer split screen feature, but I liked this software. It's easy.Also the main thing. It really shows sharp image quality. Color and contrast are fantastic.THE STAND OUT FEATURES OF THIS MONITOR:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::As mentioned above, it is the only Free-sync monitor available under Rs 10,000.In short, Free-sync technology allows the monitor's refresh rate to continuously adapt with respect to graphic card's frame rate. So, in a instance if your graphic card was generating 48 frames per second, your monitor will adapt to show 48 frames per second. All other monitors are fixed at 60 Hz or you can say that they are fixed to show 60 frames per second.Now the question is why your monitor needs to adapt according to graphic card. Because it solves two problems which are,1) tearing, when frames per second generated by your graphic card are more than 60Hz(or what monitor can output)2) stuttering, which is generated to solve the problem of tearing by using Vertial sync technology (V-sync)Watch some youtube videos to understand better about Free-sync. Without watching these videos, you will not understand tearing and stuttering. And without understand them, you will not understand the need of Free-sync.Some basic things about Free-sync :1) You will need a AMD graphic card for taking benefits of Free-sync. Because Free-sync is a AMD technology. NVidea has similar technology with name G-sync. But G-sync monitors are very costly in comparison to Free-sync monitors. And I am assured that they will not be available under Rs 10,000 for a long long time.2) You unlock 75Hz refresh rate when you unable Free-sync.THE PEOPLE IT WILL BENEFIT MOST :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Gamers (even with Nvidea graphic card, as they also get 75Hz), Video editors and designers (as colors are important for them, which they cannot get on TN and VA panels) and any casual user(who simply uses computer for using mails and watch youtube videos) will benefit from this monitor.Laptop owners who want a bigger 22 inch and higher 1080 resolution matte screen in comparison to their mostly smaller 14 inch and lower 768 resolution glossy screen.BEST PLACE TO BUY FROM:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Buy it from amazon, because many old units come with VGA cable. And here you get new manufactured units with HDMI cable. I received such a new unit that it was manufactured on 25th April in China and I was using it on 4 th June. Approximately 1 month after it was made. Quality of HDMI cable is good.PROS :::::::::::* 1) Free-sync* 2) Anti glare IPS screen* 3) 75 Hz refresh rate* 4) Crisp image quality* 4) Black stabilizers, for adjusting screen's gamma curve, which helps in seeing dark areas of games easily.* 5) Awesome Onscreen Control Software* 6) Best budget gaming monitorCONS ::::::::::::* 1) Bezels are not as thin as many say.* 2) Stand can only tilt, has no height adjustment or rotation. And also wobbles.* 3) Only one HDMI.* 4) Shows some IPS glow.* 5) Glossy plastic back and stand.* 6) Because of its popularity, it might not be available or sellers might increase their prices in future.* 7) No speakersALTERNATIVES :::::::::::::::::::::::::If you are not interested in many of the features present in this monitor you can also opt for Dell S2216H, LG 22MP58VQ and HP 22ES. Which sometimes go down in price. But HP22ES has slow response time of 14ms (GTG).CONCLUSION :::::::::::::::::::::::I didn't expected something like this will ever come under the price of 10,000. But it did. It's undoubtedly the best budget gaming monitor around the world."
5,"It's great for gaming as well as watching media.. It's a great entertainment device..All u need is speakers when watching movies and u are all set..great response time, colour production and picture quality.. The bezeless design makes it stand out from it's competitors.."
3,"The monitor is very nice overall with a matte finish and 3 side narrow bezel. Excellent product if you want to mount 2 next to each other.I upgraded from an old LG monitor which was VESA mounted to the wall and was hoping put this in instead, first it did not come with the screws and the ones from the old monitor would not work (too long) and second you need to leave about 3 inches between the back of the monitor and the wall (so only a swivel type VESA stand will work).Second problem is the handling of low resolution video (480p) and below. My earlier 19 inch monitor would handle 480p video quite well and the same looks extremely grainy on this 22 inch monitor. Don't know what is causing this but since I only changed the monitors and nothing else, I assume it is the monitor."
4,"Bought it for 7,999/- including cashback and allBringhtness control & contrast control is just perfect.Colors look quiet well.Blacks are  very clear in movies and games.No need to change settings for CSGO.Reader mode is also good but i just change contrast and brightness to suit me.Viewing angles are goodThat cable holder is very useful.And color calibration is seems good to me.Edit: cable holder is not that sturdy,Have some driver issues, screen tearing while playing videos and games at 60fps of higher"
5,One of the best monitor you can get under 10kI got it under Rs 8999 so it was a great dealPros :Matt finish no reflectionVery slim bezelsEasy assemblyYou can adjust it verticalCons :It requires drivers to be installed no plug and play.There was no amazon cardboard box the bill was pastes on the box of lg in which the monitor came and the serial number is not readable.But you can easily find them on lg product website under support sectionI'm currently using it with my laptop and it is a big upgrade from it's small 15.6 inch screen and 720p resolution
5,"Been using this monitor for over 6 months and I think it was the best in it‚Äôs category.For Gaming: Great @ 60 Hz, Bad because I was getting another monitor by LG which was supporting 75 Hz. But again the Gaming Monitor by LG had so many issues like dead pixels, glare and etc.In short this monitor is okay if you own a GTX 1050  Ti or lower since most of the games run @ 60FPS with that card. Get a 144 Hz monitor with a GTX 1060 or higher.For working: Perfect, no issues at all. No flickering, no dead pixels, work non stop without any annoyance.I‚Äôd give it a 8.5/10I just removed a few points because the swivel is not actually a swivel, integrated speakers would‚Äôve been amazing.Please click helpful if you liked my review :)"
4,"I bought this monitor for my PS4 console. The picture quality produced by the monitor is amazing as it has IPS panel. The display is also anti-glare with mate finish.It has only 1 HDMI port,1 VGA port and 1 DVI port.And also 1 aux port for audio."
1,"Monitor stand poorly designed with forward tilt, little jerk and monitor fell flat on the front panel, screen damaged is damaged and gone forever..thin bezel is not good for strength of the panel..I only buy Dell monitors which are robust, went for this seeing the review.Even display quality is not that great, too bright. May be good for games but not for regular viewing."
1,"I just got this monitor 3 to 4 days ago... And today i just set up my new system, and npw all of a sudden a red horizontal start to blink on the bottom area of the screen.. Near the windows search bar which is very annoying.. Totally going for a replacement.. Didn't expect fomrom LG. Dissapointed.."
2,"I gave 2 star Just because of Vertical Red line on the screen, otherwise, its worth to buy under 10K.I received my order on 2.9.2019, unfortunately there's some problem in the screen.I think it need to install Monitor driver. after installing monitor driver still having the same problem.. i change the cables, still its not working.. So, i ask for replacement."
5,This monitor is one of the most recommended for those who want a good quality gaming/multimedia monitor at a budget price. It has Freesync so when paired with an AMD GPU you get stutter free gaming. IPS panels are gorgeous and visuals look stunning. Bezels are very thin and the anti glare coating is a nice additionCons:1. No Display Port (So no Freesync via Nvidia cards)2. No height adjustable but supports VEGA mounts
2,"Hi,They say multi-screen display but this is not active with this product. My need was that but after observing its not supported its dis-appointing and but adv says it on amazon page....Like this many other features are missing. Please be careful on your needs on this costly monitor of 8,899.00Rs.Also, as per description they say ""1 Headphone Port"" which is not true. Please correct it amazon.no usb port very big disappointment at this price.Thanks"
1,"Received a old manufactured product,the monitor was manufactured and imported in the year 2013..initiated return let see what happens next.."
5,"Great monitor for the PC. Full HD, multiple inputs.It has a 3.5 mm jack audio output which will work only in case HDMI input is connected.Was able to connect to a set up box via HDMI cable and it converted as a TV and used headphones for audio.After a long research was confused between Dell S2240L which is best in 21.5 inch segment and LG22MP58 , chose lg because of 3.5 mm jack and its 2k cheaper."
5,"This an excellent monitor, recommended buy.I am using it with my laptop and not tried for gaming.So far it gives very good picture quality, brightness, contrast and all.Anti glare is great, works well on most of the conditionsCute look with 3 side thin bezels.Good for watching movies.Haven't tried gaming, so I cant say about it.Thanks to the great and efficient delivery from Amazon"
5,"Price Paid: Rs. 7000Seller: https://amzn.to/2Is7kBcPros- FULL HD IPS LED Monitor with anti-glare finish.- Good picture quality with accurate colors. Has very high brightness, range from 0 to 100.  Presently I have set both brightness and contrast at level 0, and its still bright.- The 22-inch size doesn't feel very big, feels slightly bigger than 18.5 inch monitor.- Very sleek and stylish looking with minimal bezels.- Wall mounting option is provided.- The monitor weighs just 4 Kgs.- The monitor is powered by 19V adapter, not direct AC supply, which is better.- It has many ports, 1 HDMI port, 1 DVI port, and 1 VGA port. For audio out, it has headphone jack. You can also connect a 2nd HDMI cable to the DVI port using an HDMI to DVI adapter.- The monitor has only 1 switch (joystick), which is under the LG logo.- Power consumption around 15 Watts.Cons:- Increases the CPU running temperature considerably unless you have the latest PC. I had a  720p monitor earlier and CPU temperature was much lower.- Glossy finish, though not a bad thing, it can easily get scratches and fingerprints.- Stand is not very stable, can topple forward easily.Make sure you buy from an amazon approved seller: https://amzn.to/2Is7kBc"
5,"It is magical. It is a very bright and extra smooth display. I am using it without Freesync enabled, and the 1080p is absolutely the best. It took me a while transitioning from a 4:3 monitor to a 16:9 aspect ratio, but this is the perfect workable resolution. 4k monitors are stupid for a small screen. You will need at the very VERY least 32 inches to make sense of 4k resolution, otherwise the icons, the display is cringe.Everyone knows about the LED quality of LG, it is mesmerizing. The IPS panel is absolutely bright and it is perfect for watching movies, browsing social media, checking email and the common day-to-day tasks. The blacks aren't as inky, but it is as good as an IPS panel can get at this price point, but the WHITES are absolutely LIT AF. You can't expect great gaming performance with mediocre frame rate, as it is not made for the AAA titles; but if you're a fan of the classics like I am, you would absolutely love gaming with this monitor.It doesn't cover much of the Colour Gamut, but it will be fine for an entry-level or first time creative professionals. If you're someone who work with the visuals ie if you are a Graphic Designer, Video Editor or an entry-level intern on a very VERY tight budget, you can't get wrong with this.If you're a casual PC user or a school/college student, you don't need to look anywhere else Simply CLICK THE BUY BUTTON. Anything else will be just overkill."
3,"At this price, I dont expect anything more and overall the quality isn't bad. The contract and white balance could be better, but I have connected my MacBook and its stupid to compare a screen on a 1 lakh rs device to a 10k monitor. But, its quite light, which may seem cool, but honestly its not like we need to move it around much. The problem with it being so lightweight is that if you use this on a glass table then the vibrations are going to make the monitor wobble. I have to stabilize it by putting a phone box under the screen so it reduces the wobbling, but it still happens."
5,"Great budget monitor with above average color reproduction and a 75Hz refresh rate. For those wondering, the 15 Hz does make a visible difference. Moreover if you intend to also use the monitor for video and photo editing the ips panel thats been factory calibrated works really well unlike other ‚Äúgaming‚Äù monitors that sacrifice picture quality for higher refresh rates and slower response times"
5,"Monitor is very good and sharp picture quality. IPS Panel. Crisp image. Multiple onscreen features available (if you install OnScreen Control software). Multiple modes are available (reading mode, cinema mode, image mode, custom mode etc.). Picture in picture option is excellent. Free sync available if you use with AMD gpu. I faced a problem to find out the power on/off button. It took around 15 minutes to find it out. Then reading the user manual (available in the CD) I finally found out the power on/off button. Very easy to install, just like plug and play. This is not a bezel less monitor. I am satisfied with this product and service also. If you are looking for a pc monitor and your budget is Rs.10,000/-, then this would be a good choice. So I will give it 5-stars."
5,"Awesome Product! Got it for 6400 INR. Best Deal ever and this is The best Budget Gaming Monitor You Will Ever Get.Paired it with RX570 8GB DDR5 With FREESYNC, If you never experience this Adaptive Sync before, Try it, Pair it with AMD card and boom, Best Gaming Experience Ever. And yes its anti glare, Modern looking, Fast in response, And Mainly Color Production is Awesome. Go For it & look For Offers."
5,"There are many reviews already written about this monitor. I won't repeat the same things.I would like to highlight the below points.1.It supports AMD FreeSync but it also works with NVIDIA Gsync. Just make sure you have the latest graphic driver installed from NVIDIA. Then in NVIDIA Global settings you need to select the VSYNC option as fast.2. Combined with AMD Ryzen 5 3600, GTX 1660 6GB DDR6 Graphics and Corsiar 3000mhz 16GB DDR4 RAM with GSync I get more than 80 FPS on Ultra settings at 1080p in Games like The WItcher 3, Hitman 2, Batman Arkham Knight.......planning to test it with more latest games like Red Dead Redemption 2.Cons: I found only one. You will need to calibrate the screen color. It had a little greenish tone with default settings (Your experience might be different depending on your configuration).But not a big thing, understanding the monitor controls and adjusting the screen setting took me around 5 minutes.Overall Great Performance Monitor for gaming. If you are on tight budget go with it !!BTW I bought it for 8499, the price is now increase to 10k. Don't know why."
5,This is the best monitor under 9k..just close your eyes and buyDont go for for 24 inch..many users notice led bleeding issue .Freesync enabled..so you dont have to worry about tearing issue for gaming..for nvidia users they will get native 75hzMatte finished which i personally preferDisplay quality is awesome üòçüòç
1,"This is NOT a full HD monitor, as the product description says. I purchased this product and had to return it back. Also the in the Q&A section, the seller is again giving wrong information about the product being 1080p."
1,Received in damaged condition. Though it would have solved my purpose. But now have initiated return.
4,Not IPS display. Viewing angle is very narrow.
5,Though the product supplied too good without any complain but one thing I must say that while talking to the courier guy I asked him repeatedly that to hand over the product to me and  not to the security guy ..but still it was delivered to the security guard that was really disappointing..these courier guys never follow the instructions...apart from this everything was ok
4,Good monitor. Working perfectly. no defects found. Good display quality.  There is vga and hdmi in it all two are working perfectly.  Good item at this rate.
1,I bought it because i had only 4k budget at the time and thought of buying a gaming monitor after some time.But now i regret i bought it. I should have took some more money from my friends to buy a good monitor.From day1 of using it. The video is shaky and after 1 month of usage even with a voltage stabilizer its white screen. I cant even use it now.Fck em.
1,Amazon shipped the defective & damage monitor of enter 15.4 inches. I'm requesting Amazon to change the damage monitor and send a good & perfect monitor respectively & also next time there should be no more harassment like this......
3,"Suitable for CCTVVGA + HDMI options available,Light weight."
1,Monitor dint work couldn't on the power. On the side of the monitor it was opened it was kind of damaged product we received.. Before shipping the product they should check the quality and performance.. Waste of our time.
1,The monitor doesn't show the browser. Looks like the monitor fails to load. This is very disappointing
5,Value for money

5,Worth vof price
1,Very bad product
5,"I'm a full time Developer and I needed a bigger screen because staring at small texts all day long on a 15inch screen is not good enough and it strains my eyes.Earlier i was considering 24inch of the same model but the price difference was of 4k INR and i did not find it worth but still i had doubts in my mind that whether i made a mistake or what. But once i got this product and i set it up, I'm telling you guyz, it is just awesome and for programmers I don't think that 4k is worth. That 2 inch difference is not something that you could notice. Infact, after using this 22 inch monitor, i think 1080 is the best resolution, and going 24 or 27 is overkill and you could see the pixels in the screen. So, if you are buying a FHD monitor, 22 inch is the best size you should go for, 24 and 27 inch is best for 1440 resolution.Not only for programmers, if you a media consumer then this is a great choice at this price.You should go for this product."
2,"Pixelated text and fonts cause headache while working or browsing. The system settings and menu is also pixelated, so it's not the issue with specific operating system. I tried connecting with windows, linux and Mac but pixelated overall appearance in all. HD videos appear good, without issues but I mostly work with text while coding and browsing, so it's waste of money for me. I trusted LG after reading lot of good reviews but no-one pointed this pixelation and blurry text/fonts issue. I hope my review helps others to make informed choice"
1,I was misguided to buy it saying it's made in india. Once I received it I got to know its actual china made. Had it keep it as it was not returnable.  Amazon please mention where the product is made.
2,"I just bought this monitor, and I know that this can run at 75hz of refresh rate, so I changed the refresh rate to the 75hz, and then I saw these wired green lines and screen trearing thing this only happened when I am running the monitor in 75hz settings, and when I dropped the refresh rate to again 60hz it becomes normal, and there will be no issues then, I am using it with my i3, 8th gen Lenovo Laptop with no dedicated GPU. I don't know why this is happening, maybe my monitor has some issues, if anyone is facing the same issue, please reply or otherwise I have to replace this one."
4,"The overall picture quality is quite good. Look and feel of the monitor is also good. It has a good level of brightness and contrast range. I use it for my job and spend more than 10 hours per day using it. But I don't feel any strain on my eyes. The height of the stand is perfect for me.However, there are two issues:1. There is some light bleeding (see photo)2. Speaker quality is very badAlthough I didn't expect the speakers to be of great quality, it still disappointed me for how bad they sound.But it has an audio port, so it should be ok. I haven't tried the audio port sound though.If you are ok with these two issues, you can go ahead with this one."
5,As LG is the main player in the field of displays and this time too I was not disappointed. It is a good monitor for both developers and gamers. We have an option for fine-tuning the settings for the monitor and there is also an out for speakers.
5,"Its a good monitor which uses IPS panel, so colors are accurate and viewing angle is good. Refresh rate is 75hz, but its 60hz out of the box, you would need to set it up to work at 75hz. I mainly use it as a second screen with my laptop for web development, but have tested games like Call of duty Warzone and CSGO. Sadly, none of them reach 60hz on my laptop. Upgrade from 60hz to 75hz does not feel significant otherwise in day to day computing. If gaming is the only purpose and you have GPU that can push games to 100 FPS or more, then 75hz display will be a bottleneck. Look for 144hz."
1,Backlight bleeding issue worst display
1,Ordered 1st one that have a horrible backlight bleeding and there is a gap between the panel and frame at the bottom right corner got replacement with another one and this have a opening at the top the panel is not glued properly light is leaking from the gaps at the top and this too have a backlight bleeding at top and bottom which is easily noticeable when screen gets dark
5,COLOUR ARE TOO GOOD TO LOOK ON THIS MONITOR WITHOUT ANY BACKLIGHT BLEEDING.
4,"I had done quite a research before I bought this monitor and if you believe me this is the best monitor in this price range...Cost varies from 11K to 11.5K, features and design are obviously mentioned in the product description and each of them stands true.The speakers are good. I checked and there is no backlight bleed in my monitor...The look kills it and it's worth every penny you buy it for..."
5,Colors are very accurate!I can also adjust the sharpness which will make things even sharper and clear.:::VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:::To get the best Picture experience you have to change some of the settings. As the factory settings are verybad-Keep the contrast to 50 and brightness to 80 or 90-Keep the BLACK level to LOW OR OFF this will give you a washed out effect if you keep it High don't use it.-Set the Picture Quality to WarmCheck the 2nd pic for more info try to keep it same as mine.
1,I hereby want to declare for the welfare of my fellow amazon customers that this product that I am writing review of comes with free dead pixels and bright pixels however the quantity of each is determined on how lucky you are till now I have replaced one monitor first one had SIX DEAD PIXELS and now to my amazement second one has 4 DEAD PIXELS and 1 BRIGHT PIXEL and 2 STUCK PIXELS so if you are bored in quarantine and have spare time to replace this product repeatedly then please buy.
1,"My monitor has fog like stains(the monitor is just 3+ month old it had it from start but it was not that visible at the start), and the panel is to be replaced, today is 21st day after I complained to LG service the technician came 2 times 1st time he documented took pictures of the problem and made the request for the panel after 10 days when I called customer service again they gave me 2 phone numbers to call both of them did not pick up even after calling 5+ times, after calling to customer service they sent the same technician to open and take pictures of the panel and now when I called them yesterday(20th day) they said your request is cancelled then they said it's open they said some senior will call me yes they called and said they will coordinate with me and the technician, now its been 24 hours the same thing happened and they are playing possum again, I complained to head of customer service in India or something and registered my grievance online, my lg tv which was not in warranty was repaired just in 2 days paid 5k the monitor is in warranty, this is how LG works carelessness everywhere they wont extend the warantee so u have to just shut up and bear with them even if its your loss"
5,"Using this for office work. It's a great monitor for my purpose.Only problem I see is its ""Made in China"". If I had realised this, I would have opted for something else"
1,"(EDIT: As many reviewers have noted, there's a dead pixel issue appearing now after 2 months of use. Disappointed as return is no longer possible!)First monitor I've purchased. Extremely happy with it, using it as a secondary display for ease of WFH.Easy to install but feels a bit flimsy on the thin stand. Liked that there are 2 HDMI ports, for multi-purpose use (laptop + Chromecast). The matte screen + multiple screen viewing mode options make it easy on the eyes. Thin bezel is a bonus, picture quality is top notch."
4,"I bough this in June for my WFH and using it since then. I am a software developer and use this with my Macbook Pro, Dell Vostro 3568 and Dell Precision 7540 and even my RaspberryPi.PICTURE QUALITY 3.5/5Picture quality is quite good for watching videos which are crystal clear. It is also quite good with editors in dark theme mode. Great while using VSCode and IntelliJ IDEA in dark mode. But not good at all with text in white background like in browsers. In white background, text is pixelated and you can see pixel dots which can cause headache. Had to change resolution to 1920x1080 manually in Dell 3568 as it defaults to 1366x768 which gave better picture. Other devices were by default in FullHD so no problem. Those who calling it OLED likeis only when you watch videos.COLOR 4/5Color is very good. I didn't have any backlight bleeding. Still I felt black could have been better considering its price. Black is better than Dell 3568 but not so good like Mac or Precision 7540.BRIGHTNESS 5/5Extremely bright. I had to reduce it to just 20.ANTI-GLARE 5/5Matt finish is awesome. No reflection and pain in eyes.DESIGN 2/53 side bezel less design gives an amazing look. Knew it can't be tilted vertically, but this one can hardly be titlted horizontally."
5,"Got the monitor for approx. 6000 during the sale. Replaced once (Details afterwards). Amazon sent me a used monitor, really disappointed at it. Even the invoice of the other person was there in the box.I ordered the 22 inch model because honestly there is no use of having a 24 inch monitor in Full HD resolution, it needs more resolution to get better ppi. The display quality of the monitor is excellent at the price range (even through VGA port). Color reproduction is very good & viewing angles are great too.3-side (top, left & right) bezels are quite thin & the bottom bezel is also of negligible thickness with LG branding. Overall thickness of the monitor is also quite less & aesthetically looks good with the curved stand.Navigating the monitor menu is easy with the joystick button provided at the bottom of the monitor.Now coming to the only flaw this monitor has, which basically is a flaw with the IPS technology. The monitor i received first had some yellow tint on the lower left corner of the screen (& quite negligible on the upper left & right corners) when viewing straight & increased/decreased on changing viewing angles & was only noticeably visible in dark backgrounds or playing games with dark scenes in a dim lit room. After research on the internet i found out that it was 'IPS Glow'. Do not confuse 'IPS Glow' with 'Backlight Bleeding', these are 2 different things. Backlight bleed doesn't change when viewing at an angle.After discussing with Amazon i replaced my monitor in hope of getting a piece with less of the IPS glow, but unfortunately faced the same with the new monitor too.This is the case with all IPS monitors, even high end ones. Low manufacturing quality i would say by all the companies. It's just a gamble that you will get a monitor with less or negligible IPS Glow. You can do things to lessen the effect of IPS glow virtually like, having ambient light around the monitor, low brightness, tilting the monitor as per your seating height or just use the monitor in well lit environment if you can. Moreover, IPS monitors are usually considered best for Multimedia purposes like photo/video editing, for which this monitor is a perfect fit.I use the monitor with my PS4 also & i would say the games look great But if you are a hardcore gamer, go for TN panel monitors. If you are looking for a mid-ground mixture of IPS & TN panel, then go for VA panel monitors.Overall, the monitor is perfect for average users with regular PC work, Multimedia usage, casual gaming (both PC-75hz & PS4-60hz) etc."
4,"If you want a 24 inch IPS display (measure screen diagonally ie. BottomLeft corner to TopRight corner) for entertainment like watching movies and serials etc, graphic work like Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator etc and also want to play FPS games (4ms ResponseTime, 1ms MBR, 75hz) like CSGO and PUBG and have a Rs10,000 budget then this is the screen for you.The delivery came in a double carton packaging...when you open a gift box and there is another smaller box inside the gift box..ya this amazon delivery packaging was something like that...the inside box was the original LG carton...i received a factory sealed brand new LG 24"" monitor.. assembled monitor stand, attached power and hdmi cables and changed Monitor Settings Screen Refresh Rate to 75hz (RightClickMouse> ScreenResolution> Advanced settings> Monitor> MonitorSettings ..change.. ScreenRefreshRate to 75Hertz) ..That's it and you are done. (If you using Nvidia then one more setting should be done: Open Nvidia ControlPanel..then under Manage3D Settings, Background Application Max Frame Rate, sellect ON and keep at 75 FPS...this will help screen tearing and playing games will be smooth..also suggest to keep V-Sync ON)If I am asked whether there is anything that I didn't like about the monitor I'll say everything about it is just great and thanks to LG..However if I'm told to find 3 faults on this particular LG monitor and that my life depends on it; then and only then I'd point out these three CONS:1. Even though Stand is wide, grippy and looks to be made of very high quality material and holds screen firmly anchored on the table...the screen is kinda wobbly on a RicketyTable..(like a bobblehead toy-figure on a cars dashboard: the figurine does not move or fall but the head is constantly wobbling) but do not fear my lads the built quality of this LG monitor is made of good quality material and look is SOLID.2. The sound is different..volume is loud and clear but something about it is wierdly different..no equalisers in settings only some MaxxAudio but enabling it made audio kinda hollow sounding so may have to twerk PC software equaliser settings.3. The HDMI cable plugs horizontally at the back so it protrudes defeating the very purpose of slim design and I wonder how someone can wall mount this screen.[Note: If you want to buy screen primarily for gaming CSGO, PUBG etc then suggest you to read difference between TN and IPS panel; TN panels have a better response time while IPS panels have better viewing angles and color reproduction.. my brother went for a 24"" ASUS brand TN panel monitor and it's ResponseTime is 0.5ms having 165hz and the difference in advantage is huge nearly cheating types but the problem is the screen is very dull looking so not much fun while doing graphic work and watching movies etc]"
1,Wrost products got damage piece and when I call to the customer service they made my replacement request but no one come it's 9 day from the date of odering what a normal person can do for this . This is insane I don't expect this type of service from amazon whenever I call them they say tomorrow the person will come between 7 to 7 I ask for the no. They say he will contact you .no specific time on the return window what can one do they say same thing everytime I call them . Pls amazon it's an humble request help us.
1,I have not used it so far but I am giving rating just because it's not 24 inch. It is 21 inch monitor to which company is claiming of 24 inch.
5,"After using it for nearly 15 days here is my review.1. Must say that product is a great value for money product. Serves my purpose of using it as a TV. I have been using Chromecast extensively from the day one.2. It has 2 HDMI ports and a VGA port which is greatly helpful in connecting multiple devices like computer, CCTV monitoring system, Chromecast and even set top box also.3. I personally have a F&D soundbar which I use for this purpose.  3.5 mm audio port works perfectly.4. I am not a gamer and and I use this monitor in entertainment purpose only and I'm more than happy with the picture quality.5.  the packaging could have been better by the seller but the delivery was great."
5,"Bought it to use  both as a work monitor and also for entertainment, the color production is excellent, no led bleeding and it has two 5 watt speakers which are good enough to meet your requirement without creating wire clutter for a set of speakers!  Comes with Vesa mount and two hdmi ports, which are again very useful features."
4,"display quality is good and everything is as u expect it to be but the built quality of the frame and the body is not that goodand the display panel wobbles a lot.I was using a dell fhd tn monitor before this and in comparison the so called ""IPS"" display, colors and the viewing angles are only slightly better.i guess it was my fault for expecting too much because this is my first ips diplay but still. and again as i said the build quality is not what i was expecting from a big brand like LG.The display also has backlight bleeding which is normal for ips monitors to be honest.i got this display for 9000 and in my opinion this display is not worth more than 7000-7500."
4,"Good monitor. Display quality is the best part. Stance is gorgeous. Two HDMI ports is a nice feature as I can switch between two laptops whenever I want without the need to unplug hdmi cable from one and connecting to other. (Note: it comes with only one HDMI cable as expected). Presets of picture modes helpful though there isn't an option to customize over them like on a tv set. For example reader mode is good but feels quite bright and, there is no way I can adjust it. Overall excellent purchase. LG scores very high on displays; be it TV or monitors. Met my expectations. It is a great addition to ease my work from home."
1,Dead pixel on a new monitor is the worst experience
4,"Since all the reviews are clubbed here for the various variants of this monitor, this review is for 22MK600M (Black). This model is one of the most recent models. The screen is good. Has AMD sync (works only with AMD processors not intel). Comes with an HDMI Cable, Power Cord & Table Stand.Note: This variant DOES NOT have the inbuilt LG screen-split software. One can use freeware software of the Windows 10 inbuilt split screen feature should suffice.The build is pretty decent given the price point (personally it felt little weak on the non bezel less ends, but nothing to worry). Screen tilt by certain degrees is possible.Over recommend this monitor given the price point, value for moneyThere are 2 USB ports, VGA port and audio out. It DOES NOT have inbuilt speakers."
1,"Don't buy this monitor and make a mistake like me. Go for the benq instead.Cons:-1) The text is pixelated even if you are at 2 feet away from monitor.2) Brightness is too high even at 30%. At 0% there is minimal dimming, behaves like 40% brightness of benq monitor. This strains the eyes if you game for prolonged sessions or work in night shifts.3) 75Hz refresh rate is not noticeable like 120 or 144Hz.4) Very high IPS glow.Pros:-1) The color reproduction in this panel is very good compared to my VA gaming monitor.2) No back light bleeding (but the ips glow is always there and it's too high)"
5,"This monitor is the best under 10K segment. Picture Quality is superb. On screen control is very useful, you can tweak whatever you want. Color quality and Viewing angles are immersive. Without even a single doubt you can go for it. Color is well calibrated and you will enjoy.10/10"
4,"Bought this monitor 10 days back. Working good till now. The picture quality is decent. There is a bit of back light bleeding, but very less. I guess its a normal phenomena for LCD monitors. If your unit has excessive back light bleeding consider replacing it.The only issue I see is the poor build quality. There are gaps at the bottom bezel, very delicate and overall fit and finish doesn't feel strong enough. This will eventually reduce the life of the product.Overall a decent monitor. If you have the money to spend, I would suggest to do more research and buy a monitor with a better build quality. Giving it 4 stars out of 5."
5,It's been almost a decade since I bought a monitor and am extremely happy I bought this one.The bezels are minimal and the matte is really effective.The monitor pops a little bit front from the stand and requires a little space at the back because the HDMI jack's pop out.
5,"The product is worth buying. It is really good in tearms of build quality and looks.Monitor comes pre color calibrated and due to ""Black Stabilizer"" like feature, people working 24/7 will not feel stress on eyes. (though you need to set brightness according to you). Monitor Stand is also Stylish, slim and sturdy with matte finish.  If compared with 22MQ68VQ i will still  recommend this monitor 22MK600M for buying as this is released after 22MQ68VQ and has nice Menu navigation.Cons :1. DVI port is absent. (But not all people need that. Its nice to have feature.)"
5,"I was looking for a mid range monitor, specifically, did not want to buy a bigger one as i had already one.I was also looking for monitor other than DELL, was got LG.Power cord is very slim and does not occupy much space which helps save space and clean is also easier...Thanks for such a sleek monitor and set was way to easy.Writing review after 15 days of purchase."
5,"Picture quality is great as colors are nicely calibrated. The speakers are standard and not extraordinary. But as the speakers are downward facing, it enhances the surround effect. Flicker free technology helps in reducing eye strain. The stand is made of metal and is sturdy. There is no backlight bleeding in this unit."
5,Great monitor the price.Using it as an extension monitor for the laptop. Full HD display with accurate colors.Plastic quality could have been better but given the price range this is absolutely fine.This has got anti reflection coating. I had a Dell monitor at work but this coating alone is sufficient for me to buy this as it reduces eye strain.
1,"The package was good but the product was poor quality. Maybe seller is selling only the defective items from LG. The first monitor I got had black spots on the middle of the display but thanks to Amazon, they replaced my monitor with second one, which has BACK LIGHT DIMMING issue on the BOTH LOWER CORNERS of the DISPLAY. Instead of replacing they told me to refund, but after much thinking I thought of keeping that defective item. Now I have to live with it for at least 5 years. :( Awful experience for me!!!If display quality is your primary concern please buy at your own risk."
5,Makes wfh a lot easier! This is an amazing buy!
4,"Meets all my requirement for a monitor for Home and Office use. Good picture and build quality. Good looking too. Its light weight too. The stand is elegant but not sufficient. I never intended to use the stand either. I will get a swivel arm to mount the monitor. Using HDMI, we can set up 1920x1080 at 75 Hz frame refresh rate. HDMI cable included in the box but is not very lengthy for my purpose. It has two HDMI ports. Not sure why. Need to explore that aspect."
4,This is a decent looking monitor. I purchased it for office work and suits well. Good part is installation and usage is quite easy. Fit and finish could be better as the bottom bezel has some gaps from screen. It supports HDMI (2 ports) and VGA which is a good thing as users may require support to both type of ports.I connected it with my android tv box (also connected to Bluetooth speakers for audio output) and worked absolutely fine. Overall a good product.
4,"The product packaging was so good. Super nice IPS panel resulting beautiful real colors and great viewing angles. Its mentioned on the production that the panel is capable to function on 75hz. But I can't find more 60hz RR..Nice monitor for casual gaming, watching movies, surfing internet and office stuff.. price lil bit higher but the quality will not let you down."
1,"See images, product is rated for an input of 1.5A and the power cord provided is rated for an input of 16A.You don't need 16A to power a 24"" 1080p monitor. Even a 55"" 4k TV with HDR doesn't need this much power. Plus the monitor is only rated for 21W, which is not much at all. Now I need to spend extra to either get an after market power cord which will essentially void my warranty or to spend extra on an electrician for the '16A' socket."
3,"No doubt the monitor is good for what I do but the package received had a 16A power plug(big one) which is totally unnecessary for this 21W monitor, and I hate to sit and work in kitchen or in the bathroom which is where we have these bigger sockets in home."
5,"I was strict on budget and the best options I found out were Dell s2421hn, Acer HA240Y and Acer Nitro. Acer offers speakers at same price point but I'm inclined to purchase Dell due to brand value and service as I wasn't sure how good is Acer service network. Out of above three best vfm is Acer Nitro you'll find it priced at 10k occasionally and try to grab it if you are willing to purchase Acer.Pros:- Perfect for office usage, movies and occasional gaming- Great display quality at this price point- Height is perfectly aligned to eye level- Inbuilt display customization. I use it at lowest brightness at most of the times and RTS color settings.Cons:- When compared to competitors specifically Acer, Ben Q they could have offered speakers as well. I use external speakers so it doesn't matter. If you need speakers in dell monitor go for S2421H model and for Height adjustment go for S2421HS (not sure if it's launched in India yet)- This isn't a con specifically it comes with 16 A socket. Research before purchasing instead of rating a product 1 star as the product and it's attachments aren't as you expected. External 6A-16A adapter will suffice and can be purchased at local store for 80 INR at max. depends on your localityIf you need additional usb ports opt for P2419H as it has 4 usb ports and comes with height adjust ability too.Overall I would say it's a bang for buck."
5,"- I needed a monitor for my home use since I am using laptops (Office and Personal) both side by side.- Since the Monitor has dual HDMI ports, it becomes easier to switch between two laptops.- The screen size of 24 inches is more than sufficient for office applications (Email, Office365, Teams etc) and excellent for Internet browsing, YouTube videos.- I am using this monitor in a bright room having ample of Sunlight and its very comfortable to use.- Current settings are set to medium brightness and contrast and it still gives very good results- I am not into gaming so cannot comment on that- Make sure you order a 5/6 amps pin computer cable as well, which I got for @200 on Amazon.- Screen bezels are very narrow and that keeps the physical size of monitor comparitively less.- Highly recommended for Home Office use. I am totally satisfied with the performance."
1,THIS PRODUCT SPEND EXTRA MONEY FOR 16A BOARD OR SOCKET
5,Very good quality monitor from dell. I primarily use it as secondary monitor for programming. The text is crisp and the monitor is really bright also this has a premium built quality unlike other monitors from samsung and benq in this price range.  Only con is the port situation. Research before buying if you are planning for a dual monitor setup.
3,Picture quality is Good not that great. There is too much Ghosting in monitor. Dell website states that this model has three Responce time; 8 ms (grey-to-grey normal); 5 ms (grey-to-grey fast); 4 ms (grey-to-grey extreme) For casual use like typing or watching video its ok. But 5ms and 4ms is non usable. You can't game or do 3d modeling in 8ms. Responce time of 5ms or 4ms gives Ghosting effect which is unbearable for me. I have attached Video for example.P.s I have asus mx239h which is 5 year old monitor and it has superior picture quality and no ghosting(4ms responce). And I bought it for 14500rs.. 5 years ago.
5,"This monitor is a descent screen with IPS panel, crisp images and text and serves the purpose well if you are looking for a monitor to do office work. looks are good and comes with a dell brand assurance .The 16A plug is not a deal breaker since you can get a 1A to 16A adapter anywhere in an electrical shop for Rs 70."
3,"Good product. 5/5. But the power cord is too large and don't fit sockets, so you have to buy another one."
3,I am worry about corner light although monitor was awesome
4,"Wrong Power Cord was sent that did not fitting any of the plug points. Upon intimation, the seller promptly sent correct power cord."
5,Good Monitor. As explained by other users 15 A Power cord is sent. which need to be replaced
5,"Very Good product from Dell,Excellent pixel clarity anti-glare display,Good Quality body material with metal stand,Good looking design with thin bezel EdgesGood Quality HDMI cable,Standard 16A Power cable"
4,"nice monitor, but why 16V plug?? so difficult to connect to normal socket. is it a high input device like ac, geyser?"
5,"Did a lot of research on monitors which could be 75hz, bezel less, sleek, good quality, perfect looking and having audio out. This is it, dell brings u everything in this monitor."
5,Nice look and super build quality
3,Power connector is 16A which is generally not required for monitors
5,One of the best purchases i have done in a recent time
5,"Amazing product, the least to say. Excellent quality product at fair price."
4,"Bought on 19 Jan 21, If a VGA port given, will be better, which cost additional amount upto Rs 400/-"
5,It also works in g-sync amazing picture quality.
5,Design is too good. Monitor servers well for my purpose.
5,Nice quality and sharp images. Really loved it.
5,studio
5,Amazing Bezelless design for a monitor of this range!
5,I think you can't get any better option in this price range..

5,"You can blindly trust Dell products but make sure you are buying them from a LEGIT seller. Because these monitors are just wow. FHD monitor for 8K. I really wanted to buy a dual monitor and earlier thinking about buying the Samsung curved one but checked reviews and found a lot of customers were complaining about color accuracy. Also, The price was comparatively higher. Hence, opt for these. Happy with the purchase but the power cord supplied with the monitor is a 16AMP. Usually, we don't have too many 16 A sockets in our house, Even I have tried getting a 16 A extension board also but didn't work out. Finally, I figured this out.Solution- Get a 16A to 6A converter that would cost you around 50 bucks. i am using CONA which is working perfectly fine for me."
2,"Most of the specifications given in the description is made up just for marketing & sale, this monitor work fine for general use. Not suitable for professional use where color reproduction & gamut range is important."
2,Terrible product is only thing that i can say1. Quality is not good monitor wobble2. you can't use it for more than 30min not sure what kind of colours they are usingThe quality of the product is not appreciated. The clarity is not up to mark.Kindly accept a return.
1,"I purchased this model not knowing it's a VA Panel. But then convinced me to use it. As soon as it's powered, I felt very bad buying this monitor. Firstly it was defective, there was an annoying green pattern on the display. In addition to that, Thunderbolt(USB C) did not work with MAC. After having a bad experience, called support to return the product. The support personnel wasn't patient enough, not even sympathetic. outright informed me to keep using the defective monitor. After a long escalation and multiple calls, finally, they accepted for replacement instead of return. Once again decided to give it a try. Received a second one, this time packaging and the box were in bad shape. Then anyway started to use the monitor. After an hour or two started noticing a green tint on the screen and the display going blank every 10 - 30 mins. It will remain there for over a second or two. It was really annoying as well. Then called the support and this time the support personal accepted the defect by seeing the picture and the return was completed.This is one of the bad experiences I had with Amazon. I would recommend staying away from the 32-inch model. 32UL750."
5,"This is an excellent 4K display and well worth the premium.  I use it with my M1 Mac Mini and the colour reproduction, brightness and quality of picture are excellent.  Even the speakers are surprisingly loud (don't expect it to be replace a high-quality external speaker like Bose Companion though).  It comes with an USB C port with pass-through power delivery.  I connect it to my work laptop (Dell Latitude 54i0) through its Thunderbolt 3 port and the experience is painless.  I have never done serious gaming in it - except for 1-2 Apple Arcade games, so I can't provide detailed comments on that. Overall, an excellent product - highly recommended."
5,"Wanted a LG 32UL950 with an IPS panel but settled for this instead due to no stock.Many people have complained about the panel being a VA and not an IPS. While I admit it's annoying that the luminance gets shifted a bit if viewing from odd angles, this is meant to be used as a monitor and not a TV. Therefore, despite its technological disadvantage I'm happy to sit in front of it and experience rather good picture quality.Pros:* This one monitor replaced my : 1) Laptop charger 2) USB-C dongle and hub 3) HDMI cables  4) multi-pin spike buster into a truly single cable solution. One plug to the wall, one cable to the laptop and everything works.* Display is huge, no stuck pixels, color reproduction is almost as good as a macbook pro* Integrated USB hub, plugged my keyboard/mouse there* Height adjust stand is pretty nice IMOCons:* There's some minor ghosting of white moving text on black backgrounds but its fine for casual gaming or movie watching* Large monitor surface and therefore some amount of glare can be visible on screen, have to turn up brightness during sunny days* Bezels are 1cm thick (thin?) since it's a VA panel but atleast its symmetrical on all sides so doesnt look too bad. Great for webcams that have a lip"
5,Good product. Its a 32 inch VA panel. Looks good. A bit overpriced though. Should be purchased during a sale.
5,Nice monitor value for money
2,"I was pretty surprised to see a sublet of Acer selling such a feature packed monitor at such a low price.And best of all they were using VA panel and not TN(which are usually the cheapest and the worst looking).Before i start my rant about its issues, let me say this, for this price you won't get Freesync and 144hz from any other brand, the blacks are pretty good and the panel gets decently bright.And overall can be a decent buy if the panel issues are sorted out which i will discuss next.So despite my apprehensions with this brand and Acer in general, i dived in and bought it, only to realize nothing ever comes cheap, and there is a reason why AOPEN monitors are so cheap, usually with monitors QA(Quality Assurance) plays a big factor when deciding the price. You see the more monitors you have to discard on the assembly line to maintain a certain level of quality, the more end users end up paying for that quality. I think by now you know why these monitors costs to less, for those who didn't get it, the QA department for such cheap monitors is pretty relaxed, they allow relatively bad looking panels to pass through to cut down the price.For some this might absolutely be a non issue, but for the discerning user who values quality, i will not recommend this monitor, the proof is in front of you folks, the pics i have attached here show how a complete black backgrounnd looks on this monitor, its really funny because my 8 year old TN panel monitor looks way better.It seems like we should expect less of panels now than we did 8 years ago(Added a comparison screenshot of this monitor vs my 8 year old TN panel, just look at the panel uniformity and backlight difference between the 2) !The panel uniformity is all over the place, and if you tell me to look the other way due to the price, i won't because even the costlier Predator series monitors have backlight bleed and uniformity issues.Ok enough talk about the first issue, moving to issue number 2.Typically and technically IPS panels have the best color reproduction, followed by VA and then TN.So i was expecting the monitor to have much richer and better colors than my TN panel, but sadly thats not the case, the colors are completely unrealistic, have an unnatural hue, and to add to that the monitor's edges are DIMLY LIT.Caliberating the monitor on your own helps a bit but its still not a good VA panel.Pros :-------Good Contrast ratioIntuitive OSDDecent Build Quality144hzFreesync(works with Nvidia gpus too now, but only with pascal and turing)Cons :--------Pathetic backlight issues with dim edgesReally bad color calibration out of the boxPanel uniformity issuesGiving it 2 star due to all of this, because in my eyes a monitor should have a solid foundation(The Panel) and then adding extra features adds value, if your panel is this poor then whats the point in having all those features."
5,"the best under 30k 144hz, va panel, curved viewing angles r good & after sales service will be given by acer so if someone has 30k budget u can go with this also bezels r so slim to be attracted"
5,Really good monitor with crisp image quality. Totally worth the price. 144hz refresh rate and 2k resolution is a treat at this price. Freesync also works pretty good. Only thing is the brightness is 250 nits which is good but a bit low compared to other va panels out there. Viewing angles and colour reproduction is really good. Navigation controls are pretty easy with the joystick provided at the back.Pros:-Cheapest 32 inch display-144 hz freesync works perfect-no dead pixels or backlight bleed-Curve on the screen gives immersive experienceCons:-Display brightness could have been better-No speaker-Cant swivel the monitor vertically 90 degrees-Stand is very small and not firm when tilting the display up and down
4,"If you have 20k around to spare for a new gaming monitor, This Aopen curve gaming monitor is one of the best options available. I am really happy with the purchase. It took only 15 hours to reach.Pros:1. 144hz, so buttery smooth frames.2.  4 ms response.3. Curve display.4. Has display port.5. 27 inch, quite a big displayCons:1. 27 inch 1080p looks a bit inadequate of pixels.2. 1ms response time would have been better, but considering this price damn I would have bought it with 5ms also.Peace."
4,"INTRODUCTION:I bought this monitor to replace an old TN panel that I'd been using forever. Its not without its issues but it does get quite a few things right. Hopefully this review will help you decide whether its worth your hard earned money.PRICE:I picked mine up during an Amazon sale when there was a discount offer and a lightning deal on the monitor. At that price, the feature set this monitor provides can't be beaten. The price seems to have gone up since then though.BUILD QUALITY:Build quality is solid. Stand is all metal, pretty sturdy and the monitor doesn't shake too easily. No swivel or height adjustment, but you can tilt the monitor from -5¬∞~ 20¬∞. No VESA mounts either. Bezels are not slim but not very thick either and have a slightly reflective finish. No stuck/dead pixels or any other visual defects to speak of.CURVATURE:The monitor has a curvature rating of 1800R. Curved monitors offer a larger perceived field of view. I had no problems going from a flat panel to a curved one, but it felt a little strange going back the other way once I got used to it.UI:UI is clean, easy to navigate and the exact same one found on the similarly priced Acer panel. Not surprising given AOpen is an Acer subsidiary. Fortunately, unlike the Acer panel which has normal buttons, this one uses a joystick which is much more convenient and intuitive but with one rather annoying design choice - turning off the screen requires you to keep it pressed for 5 seconds. Not ideal if you quickly want to turn off your screen before leaving the room.IMAGE QUALITY:Colors are ok out-of-the-box but you'll probably need to fiddle around with the settings a bit to get the picture you desire. I found the default presets a bit too warm for my liking so I had to tone it down a bit to get a more neutral image. You can switch the color temp between warm, cool, normal and lastly user mode which enables the RGB bias and gain sliders. The panel isn't very bright but a brightness level of 50-60 will be enough for most people. Blacks look pretty nice as they should be on a VA panel. All in all, with a bit of tweaking, you can get a pretty decent image out of the monitor.VIEWING ANGLES:There is gamma shift when looking at the screen at an angle. The image becomes washed out and less bright the further you move from the centre. But its not severe and its a non-issue if you sit right in front of the screen like most people do.144HZ:Now, onto the two biggest selling points of this monitor: 144Hz and FreeSync. You have to experience a 144Hz monitor to truly understand why so many people recommend one. Forget games for a second - your desktop experience is just so much better. Simple tasks like moving the mouse pointer, dragging a window around, scrolling up and down feel so much more fluid. And once you get used to 100+ fps in games especially FPS, going back down to 60 is something you'll want to avoid. Its not quite the horrible experience going from 60 to 30 but its still jarring.FREESYNC:As for FreeSync, the difference it makes is very evident. No more picking between screen tearing and input lag. And with the latest Nvidia drivers, you aren't restricted to AMD gpus anymore to use FreeSync. As long as you have a Pascal or later series card and a DPI cable, you're good to go. Just enable FreeSync in the monitor menu, then go to the Nvidia Control Panel, click on Set up GSync and tick Enable GSync, Gysnc compatible, Enable for windowed and full screen mode, and Enable settings for the selected display model. That's pretty much it. The FreeSync range is between 48-144Hz but you can extend it using CRU (Custom Resolution Utility). I have extended my range from 40-144Hz because FreeSync is even more beneficial at lower fps. 40fps on a FreeSync panel feels much smoother than 40fps on a non-FreeSync panel.BACKLIGHT BLEEDING:The biggest con, as others have mentioned, is that these monitors suffer from quite a bit of backlight bleeding. Its normal for IPS/VA panels to have a bit of backlight bleeding but its rather noticeable on these panels. I've had two of these, and on a completely black background or even when viewing a dark scene/image, you can see patches near the top and bottom that are brighter than the rest of the screen. Compared to my old TN panel, the black uniformity really isn't good. I mean if you stand far back enough from the screen, it kinda looks like there's a Batman logo on the screen. Of course, the severity of the issue ranges from unit to unit - the replacement I got was better than the original - but its still an issue albeit one that's only evident during dark scenes. If you get a decent unit, keep the brightness at sensible levels, and don't go looking at the edges of your screen every time the screen goes dark, its not something that will really bother you.CABLES:The DP cable that came with the first monitor was not only non-functional, it would stop my PC from even booting into Windows. I had to buy a separate DP cable to troubleshoot the issue. So if you're buying this monitor and plan on using FreeSync, keep a spare DP cable handy just in case. No issues with HDMI or DVI cables though.SUMMARY:Coming from an old 22"" TN panel, this monitor has definitely been a good upgrade. The pros sufficiently outweigh the cons in my opinion. Would I pay the current asking price for it? Probably not. But during a lightning deal and/or when there are discount offers, it certainly represents good value for money."
5,1.I Have search many monitor but any monitor does not have 144hz refresh rate at low price rate And Aopen is latest one i go only 21000rs2.144hz mindblowing.3.curved super4.eye saver5.High Performance any game without any issue6.21000 all feature i got curve..gaming...144hz...4ms smooooth perfomance7.best scene like watch any movie any side without any issue or blurr8.wqhd available :-)9.beast performance ....beautiful look10.finally Rating 9/1011.one point miss because amazon delivery service one day late(delivery boy not give my product my home address ..i collect product office:-( ) but amazon service and support very good12.amazon product and service always better than flipkart13.finally guys buy this product .....best for every you want
5,"Pros:Supports upto 4k 144Hz (custom resolution), although the text turns out to be copy as it's not designed for it.HDMI, DP, DVI, cables included within1920x1080 , 144Hz on DP1920X1080 , 120Hz on HDMIFree sync+gSync compatibleImmersive curvature of 1800RFast response time of 4MsColour correction menu from monitor nipple type button on the backNot too big side bezels~1cmImages quality is natural with sRGb colour profile and great viewing angles from sides.VA panel, which is a trade-off for picture quality from IPS panel and response time from TN panelsBright enough display with 250nitsCons:The stand takes some space in front of the screenHeight is non adjustable plus there is no wall mount of any standard Vesa or whatsoeverNot Windows HDR compatible, not that it hurts but it just doesn't support it.I love it.Here on I can not go back to 60hz ever again.Will be back to edit this review after a few weeks.If you're still thinking to buy this, just do it unless you could push your budget to 20k (which basically have the same traits but additional physical features like stand, looks, adjustable heights and all)After about 8 months I first noticed some backlight bleeding when the screen goes blank. I was starteled at first but when the screen is lit, there really is no difference.For gaming, you might need the overdrive to stay off in the monitor menu options > gaming to prevent ghosting effects of moving sharp images.the viewing angles are great and color reproduction still on point."
2,"Not even 4 months and the display started flickering, tried resetting, changing DP cables but still same issue, tried calling service number of Aopen 1800-11-4100 but number is coming as not available. Raised a ticket with Aopen for servicing the product in bangalore but no proper response yet, they keep telling they are looking into it.Can't figure out how to get the monitor serviced, can anyone help please?"
5,This pocket friendly but enthusiast level specs makes it very affordable gaming premium monitor. This is a right out of the box review and may be updated as i go. qhd +144hz+curved+32 inch at 25k that's a very interesting grab. 144hz definitely feels smoother. All the color tech people include in their reviews and tells how bad this display is .... forget it. on an average day when you are playing a game or watching your fav movie you wont sit actively to notice all those. display is fine. unless you want to cherry pick its minor color calibration or brightness issues.Curved display is actually much better than i thought for browsing and youtube than gaming and movies i noticed. the images or text on edges of the pages are a same distance as middle so thats gives a very comfortable view. So no regrets. its highly recommended. I shall update the review over the time.
4,"Unlike most people, I use this monitor with my laptop (which is very capable BTW) rather than a desktop. I would really recommend that you go for the 32-inch 2560x1440 version or the 24-inch 1920x1080 version as 1920x1080 is not really adequate for a 27-inch monitor. It is quite an immersive experience with the curved VA screen. On my unit, however, HDMI was very buggy. Video signal dropped to a blank screen pretty frequently which was very frustrating. Did not encounter this problem, however, with a DP to mini-DP cable (found a decent cable nowhere online except Amazon, the AmazonBasics version). The problem must be isolated as I have never heard anyone else have this problem. My specific unit has minor backlight bleed, fortunately. Could not figure out how to enable Freesync with a GTX 1060. Again, maybe it's just me.The good :-- Competitive price point.- Huge 32-inch TV-like real estate to work with, with features of a monitor.- Smooth 144Hz refresh rate.- VA panel. Other monitors in this range are mostly TN/IPS 60Hz - 75Hz/really small.- Freesync (Not useful to me, but useful for people with AMD GPUs, at least or those who could make it work with NVIDIA cards somehow).- Curved. Very immersive.- Relatively intuitive OSD.- Adequately deep black levels.The not so good :-- HDMI signal issues (at least on my unit).- Sub-par color calibration out of the box.- Minor backlight bleed on my unit (but tolerable).- One stuck/dead pixel right around the middle of the screen.- No 90 degree rotate/swivel.- No speakers, USB passthrough, etc (justified for the price, I guess).It's not perfect. But it's great overall, nonetheless. Totally worth a recommendation.Edit: Found one stuck pixel around the center of the screen. Edited the review accordingly."
5,"I found the display port image of 1440p 120hz on a radeon hd6970 fantastic.The other complain of backlight unevenness did not exist when your in front of it, if you go back far and see it from an angle then you see it.Black's are great and clarity fantastic to the pixel on dp only.A lot of calibration settings are there.Very impressive and I'm planning a 3 monitor setup for racing and flight sim as will as productivity.The border less frame feature is a joke, as the screen actually ends much before the illustrative thin border. There's almost 10-15mm of border."
5,"The monitor is excellent , very good picture quality , excellent colour production , the curved screen is a treat to eye and 144hz and freesync at this price range is commendableGo for 24 inch one if full hd resolutionI used to run my console on my tv and now moving to this monitor the increase is quality and performance is very measurable .As all the services and onsite warranty for this product will be provided by Acer there should me no doubt related to the durability of the product.The only con is that it lacks a speaker unit but that doesn't change anything.Go for it"
1,Acer is not written anywhere on the packaging box or on the monitor itself.1) The refresh rate is 119.98Hz and not 144Hx as mentioned in specifications.2) Monitor Speakers do not work.3) It's a local individual brand AOPEN and not Acer.The word Acer is only to be found on the order purchase on Amazon app and nowhere on the actual order. Scam.
4,"Received the monitor today.  Initial impression was quite good.  I was using a 21.5inch full HD Dell touch monitor. Going curved is a great boon with good peripheral vision. Now comes the bummer. Display has a patch of dead pixel at the edge and on standby I saw the screen in just one color, reddish with the entire display looking like a cobweb. Must have something majorly wrong with the piece. Requested for a replacement, hope mine is a odd piece and wont affect long term reliability. As others are have also mentioned similar issues looks more like a production line issue rather than one off.  Hoping for a full rectification of the problem with the replacement. If it works its an excellent monitor esp for work and playing. Being a larger monitor text is larger too which adds on to the eye comfort.Edit: Prompt replacement in just a day, didnt have to wait as the pick up and replacement happened together.  New display has no issues so far."
4,"Using this monitor for 3 months now and here is my review,The curved screen helps for better vision when facing direct.Viewing angles on this monitor are also excellent.Interface is simple to understand and use.In the box VGA, HDMI and DVI all cables are included with good quality built (My favourite thing)Brightness is way too high on this monitor, I keep it in the range of 30-40%Its 1080p but pixels are slightly visible when user mode is changed to gaming or movie.These are the things which are imp for you to know rest part you can check on youtube.Overall its worth the price."
4,"First day review - Got the monitor on the next day after order, box was in good condition, after unboxing the setup was easy it only requires 1 screw to be screwed in. Setting it up connected to the computer and checking there were no dead pixels and very slight amounts of back light bleed (which is to be expected at this price range and screen size), this what i meant by luck as i got lucky with the panel where as your experience might vary given that there are older reviews where people have much worse panels.Verdict - As it is a prime guarantee product and if it has all the features that you need then get it and test it out you might get really lucky with the panel too if not just return it/have it replaced as there is nothing better in the price range if it works well.feel free to ask questions.Edit 1: found a stuck pixel so 4 stars"
5,"This is one of the fantastic monitors you get in this price range.Pros:-> 144Hz display(You will really feel the smoothness once you jump from 60 or 75Hz display).-> VA panel gives great contrast as compared to typical TN panel found in other budget 144Hz Monitor.-> Simply a great Gaming Monitor in budget.Cons:-> When in dark black screen you can see the panel is not A+ grade panel(Doesn't matter as normally you won't be in having black screen all the time).-> Doesn't have Vesa mount option, that's a deal breaker for many(Unless they are fine with low monitor height or can buy monitor stand)Conclusion: If you are looking for a budget 144Hz gaming monitor with Freesync/G-sync support  and no vesa support doesn't bother you, then its a no brainier . Simply go for it. Highly Recommended."
1,Within a month it started to flicker now... I was not expecting such a poor quality.26/09/2020 - Also bought a 32 inch... It's quality is very sub standard fully made of plactic... Jus the bottom stand is of metal. Also have noticed dead pixels on the pannel.
1,"With high hopes, keeping in mind the price to features ratio I ordered this 27""  monitor. Within a month of use it has developed dead pixel. I asked Acer service center for resolution, this is what they replied ""As per your concern, your screen pixels issue comes under CID ( Customer Induce Damage ) so it will not cover under warranty."".I have been using this monitor with utmost care, sitting on desk with APC UPS, no voltage fluctuations or any damage(physical or otherwise)What's the use of 3 year warranty???Don't go for this brand, better buy some other good brand monitor, even If you have to pay little bit more"
5,After getting my replacement of my damaged display monitors i am very happy and after one year of rough usage the monitor works liye the first day it is the best mid ranged monitor and i am very happy to buy theseThank you Amazon my love for you will be always there
1,"I bought this monitor 4 months ago and not gonna lie the product was pretty good until one day the monitors screen got cracked. Honest mistake right? It could happen to anybody! So i did what anyone would do and called the toll free to ask for non warranty service, since they said that this cant be done under warranty. I have tried calling various service centers of acer and all of them tell me that they do not service monitors. I called the HO and try to issue a complain and the representative called me to tell me that if i gave it to them it'll cost as much as buying a new monitor. Honestly, i am still paying emi for this crap. This isnt really a review on how the product is but even if you buy this and by mistake something does happen to it . Say goodbye to your money. These ppl dont care after the product is sold. Think about it before buying because multiple brands are there and they'll probably give you a better service."
4,"Great 144hz affordable monitor. The VA is amazing in terms of colour production as compared to a TN panel.I play CS, PUBG and APEX nowadays. This monitor does the job pretty well.Don't get confused with 4ms response time. It doesn't make much of a difference as you can't even tell the difference.In a nutshell,+144hz+4ms+freesync+VA panel+curved monitor (new but great experience)+great colors compared to TN"
4,"So for those wondering about 1080p 144hz on hdmi ( u can get it but this monitor doesnt allow) so to get 144hz on hdmi go to nvidia control panel setup custom resolution change it to 144hz ,and change the dropdown menu to manual and u can run 144hz on hdmi because theoretically hdmi should support 144hz .THIS MAY VOID WARRANTY(I AM NOT SURE) SO DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK . And enjoy 144hz on hdmi laptop users.So , about backlight bleed i didn't have any backlight bleed i got very good panel and colors looks good but black looks weird. OSD controls are very good . If you get bleeding panel or some defects replace it worth it for the money. In just got it today so i cant say anything about longevity."
4,"PROS1) 144 Hz. (not adaptive) (constant)2) Curved 1800.3) Good brightness.4) Has separate headphone jack.CONS1) Has an adapter.2) VA panel, so colours are not good.3) In box cables give out static to GFX card (sometimes).4) Only 1 joystick in the back, no separate on/off button.5) Top and sides 1 cm bezels, not good for matrix display.6) 4 ms displayGOOD for beginner gamersCan go for 165 hz 1ms display"
5,"I have been using this curved monitor for a sometime now.THOUGHTS: Keep in mind that the product is targeted to budget consumers so do not expect to perform like an expensive monitor.COLOR/ACCURACY: It's a VA panel with 4ms of response. Acceptable for its price. Brightness and color accuracy is good but little inferior to msi or samsung monitors that I have used in the past. All within acceptable range.Custom profiles can be set to users liking.REFRESH RATE: Through hdmi upto 120hz output is available at 1080p. Refresh rate also varies on the version of hdmi cable being used (hdmi 1.0 or 2.0). Through display cable upto 144hz is available at 1080p.MONITOR TECHNOLOGY (FREESYNC & GSYNC): Yes it's a free-sync monitor and will work with all AMD cards. It works with gsync too. However there is one minor concern that can be easily ignored (not to be confused with a defect). When gsync is on, I observed faint screen flickering when using cinebench or gigabyte's system information viewer (to control fan speed/temperature). Only the black, grey and white areas of the screen would flicker as long as the programs are kept open on desktop. Your mileage may vary.SOLUTION: Turning off such programs or minimizing them will stop the flickering till you open the mentioned programs again. If you wish no flickering at all turning off gsync (from nvidia control panel) would solve it completely. Again It's not a defect. The VA panel used in the monitor has not been validated by nvidia to be used with gsync (as mentioned in nvidia control panel). For more information check out videos available in youtube. Nvidia is aware of this and has already addressed it in 2019. No flickering observed when playing games or using daily programs or watching movies/videos with gsync on.BACKLIGHT BLEEDING: Some users complained of receiving units with backlight bleeding. It's not a manufacturing defect...not necessarily. Sometimes a design flaw can also be the cause. It all depends on the manufacturing standards how they want to channel the light on screen with minimal leakage to the sides reducing bleeding effect. Mine works just fine.Overall a good product to be used as a daily driver."
5,"Best VFM 32 inch 1440p 144hz VA panel on the market, atleast in the Indian market that is. Nothing of equal spec monitor can be had for below 50k. Better alternatives maybe had for even less elsewhere but in India an alternative  monitor like this with similar spec can only be had for around 50k. Certain buyers experiencing horrible backlight bleeding, luckily for me no such case here. no noticeable ghosting either. deep rich black with was not possible with my 24 inch ips display."
5,"Was very skeptical to get this due to the range of negative reviews, but after lots of research decided to take the plunge and was pleasantly surprised with the quality (although my expectations were minimal due to the price). As usual Amazon's delivery was fast, got it with 10% discount for 11.7k. This is undoubtedly the best <20k 144Hz Curved Monitor, nothing comes close with all aspects considered. For the price you pay, you are getting an above average monitor which is simply scintillating (assuming you can get past minimal issues which do not affect your everyday use)"
5,"144 hz, 3-4 ms, free sync (compatible with both nvidia and amd), 27inch curve, va panel all these things approx 20000 rupees. No dead pixel spotted yet. Might be best budget monitor for students or games. My personal rating arePicture 10/9 (due to va panels)Response time 10/10Input lag 10/8Brightness 10/7Value for money 10/8 ( indian sellers sold their goods at higher prices compared with international sellers)Refresh rate 10/10Free sync 10/10 ( i have 1060 and it still working as gsync monitor)Note - light bleeding is an issue  - acer provide it‚Äôs warrantyBest alternative- samsung cfg73 model, asus vg279q (alltho these high in price)"
4,Good monitor.. one less star for one stuck pixel
1,"Heavy Backlight bleeding, it's very irritating to use monitor for low light pictures,games,movies..."
5,This monitor is a treasure left in open to be explored !!Initially I was not impressed by either the picture quality or gaming performance.But as I explored and played with settings !I can say for certain that this is the best all round 1080p monitor in market right now !!!1. For fps gaming turn pixel overdrive to extreme.2. For best picture/text clarity turn off pixel overdrive and set colours to normal.3.

4,"I'll keep this sort and simple. I'm not a tech reviewer, so I can't go into depth regarding blacks and nits, and other nitty gritty details a lot of you may be looking for. But I have been gaming for nearly two decades now, and this monitor is a freaking game changer.Set up was pretty easy, and apart from the display port cable that did not work out of the box, I had no issues setting this one up. However if like me, you do have to connect this monitor to an HDMI cable, set the refresh rate in your games to 120hz and NOT 144hz till you get a proper DP cable. My monitor kept losing temporary signal to my games till I dropped my refresh rate to 120.I've also never used a curved monitor before and was a bit apprehensive, but I was sold the minute I booted this one up. If anything, I started wondering how I've gamed on a non-curved monitor all my life.To test this monitor out, I ran the usual suspects like Doom Eternal and COD: MW, and they performed really well. Doom Eternal felt like a new freaking game and impressed me the most. I even tried out Division 2 and holy crap, that game looks mind blowing - especially during the night in New York. Finally, I loaded up some Forza Horizon 4 and didn't expect a higher refresh rate to really wow me, but damn, was I wrong. Racing through England's country side never felt better.Like many of you, I was on the fence for this monitor since I haven't read any credible reviews, but after spending a whole day with this monitor, I'm very happy so far. Guys I know have told me to hold off judgement for at least a month or so, so I guess I'll report back then. But in the meantime, I'm extremely happy with this purchase."
3,"There is heavy back-light bleeding all across the edges and cornersViewing angles are poor. Image quality is ok at 60Hz with a lot of tuning of image settings.At 120Hz it seems to switch to a TFT display mode and the colors are really bad.If you are looking for a budget display just for gaming, then this will do the job. Otherwise it is a waste of money...spend 30-40% more and get a better displayUpdate : Feb 2021Displays are just dumb mirrors of GPUs. After switching from gtx750Ti to rtx3070 and switching from an old hdmi cable to display port, I am able to get the maximum promised performance (144Hz@2K). Previously I used to get max 120Hz@1K and 60Hz@2K. Image quality is significantly better now with the 3070 card."
1,Pathetic monitor useless.It doesn't let me got into bios. Don't know why really did a mistake buying this really would not recommend it to anyone. First they send a defective piece and not I got a monitor I don't know what the hell is wrong. Seriously I can not my pc into bios from my old monitor but not from this
5,"Got delivered with in  2 days, decent packing pretty solid stand made with aluminium I think, more than satisfied with this monitor first time experiencing 144hz, iam using 1050ti with ryzen 5 1600 iam getting 100 to 120 fps average in every latest games at 1080p at low settings ( in box 1dp ,1 hdm,1dvi, 1 power cables available) I'll give more review after 1 month"
2,"Fully disappointed with the purchase, it has huge backlight bleeding issue, already replaced but same thing arrived, its using so called VA panel which I think is class B rated so the company offering soch a competitive price."
5,"I was sceptical about buying this monitor. As I read lots of bad reviews about dead pixels and screen quality issues. After lot‚Äôs of research i come down to three options aopen, lg ips with 75mhz refresh rate and Samsung curved quantum dot. Lg is cheapest one but it t has lots of bad reviews and has only 75mhz refresh rate that I don‚Äôt think as upgrade. Samsung one is too costly so decided to buy this. I m not sure but aopen and Samsung using same panels or screen technology . Brought this on diwali sale and wait for 20days too see if i come across any issues mentioned in other reviews. And i m glad that device is working fine. There are minor blacklight bleed but its not noticeable. As this one is not IPS panels is was worried about colour vividness. But when i test some YouTube video on this monitor i was impressed with its wide range or colour . Curve features of this monitor but is bit useless for at least 24‚Äù I guess if u buy 32inch screen it may feel more immersive with curve. Overall i can say product is good and definitely recommended."
4,Overall a good monitor for the price.Mine has one dead pixel but works great otherwise.
2,"This monitor is good only to watch HD videos and 2k videos or movies in a curved display. Will not recommend it for Gaming.I am using AMD 3600, GTX 1660, 16GB Ram, turned ON free sync and linked with G-sync as Nvidia started support all the adaptive displays. But game flickers a lot, if you have a AMD GPU you can give a try but you need also consider the backlight bleeding out of the box and black uniformity is not good. If you are watching dark scenes, it's messing up. I returned the product. You can check for Samsung 24 inch 144hz curved monitor on same price range or LG 24 Flat 144hz for same price."
5,"This monitor is just amazing for 11.7kPros:1. Great Colours2. 144hz super smooth screen3. Joystick controller on back4. Solid metal stand5. Curved screenCons:Only one: Doesnt come with vesa mount support.Other thoughts:Unlike many other reviewers, my model didnt have any backlight bleed issue. Also the review posted with backlight bleed issue is taken with full brightness(no one does that) and in a dark environment. When I do same as the review, I too see 'some' issues but not noticable at all when doing any other thing than whole black screen.Great deal I got there for 11.7k in a sale with debit card discount too. So I would advice you to wait for a sale as it happens usually every month."
4,"This monitor performs as well as my old samsung monitor but I'm disappointed with the power cable. It came with 16A big cable. I can't use it anywhere in my room. I have this 16A socket only in the kitchen. Now what do I do with it? If you plan to purchase this monitor, beware of this problem. You will have to buy an extra power cable from a computer shop nearby which would cost around Rs 200 or you have to connect it to an AC power socket if available or fix a new 16A box nearby your pc or get a 6A to 16A converter socket(Very unsafe ). When I tested this monitor with my watt meter, it measured only about 19W in movie mode with best brightness. I really wonder what the design team were thinking when they have decided to use a 16A plug which can carry over 3000W power when our requirement is only 19W power."
4,"Product:Edge to Edge Screen.Anti-Glare is Okay.You can dim the brightness and choose eye-protection if you are going to 24x7.Seller Issue:I had ordered for BenQ GW2475H 24 Inch on Deal of the day but, I got the 22Inch instead same model. Difference amount was around 700 in Indian Currency. I have asked them to replace the items, and they asked for 7 Days. Still, I didn't got any response from them."
4,"The product arrived in well secured package.I was able to connect with my macbook pro using type c to hdmi converter.  My first impression is it's a very good buy for those who are looking for office purpose or coding.I wanted 2 hdmi port monitor and doesn't want any speakers, so this was the correct pick for me.This have a tilt angle of maximum 20 degree.Please note that this comes with a 16A power cord , bigger than normal power plugs."
5,"First of all the amazon's packing was elegant and classic.About the monitor1. The picture quality is fantastic and you can watch almost all 4 k videos without a lag2. Viewing angle serves a better touch.3. About the brightness, you can adjust the settings according to how comfortable with your eye.4. Best for blogging and programming, and can play 1080p games with ease.Overall a better performance with this price range."
1,Worst experience..terrible amount of screen bleeding in main order and replacement as well
5,"Very much satisfied with this product. Picture quality and colours are really good. Image and text are crisp, colour saturation is neutral and adequate, 2 HDMI inputs, Low Blue light modes, anti-glare.. perfect for the price.. I've used other 24 inch models which are far more expensive, and this Benq model is in par with those ones!There's another higher price model GW2480 with inbuilt speakers and magic eye option (I really don't think it's a needed feature), and if you don't want these option, this model is the best you can get!"
5,"I needed a monitor to extend my laptop on a bigger screen and reduce some unusual strain on my eyes as well as use my PS3 in my room instead of the TV. Got this one as it is a 24"" IPS with dual HDMI and was priced just right @8999. Got it for approx Rs 8100 and it's a perfect VFM product. No dead pixels, no baclight leakage (just the usual IPS glow)The 16 amp power cord is an issue and I knew about it so got a cord locally beforehand for Rs 70. All good for this VFM monitor, picture looks good and colur and viewing angles too are good enough.Gaming on PS3 has been good with good colour reproduction & no noticeable ghosting or delay. No speakers in this one and it was known but I didn't go for the model with speaker which was priced 1K more as it nowhere read Dual HDMI which this one did and hence I traded off the speakers for Dual HDMI (Or so I believe but then speakers were never really important for me and Dual HDMI was a must)"
4,"The monitor is good for this price range. Especially if you have to use 2 hdmi ports then go for it.You can get it outside for less than what is quoted here.The brightness level is quite low even for max brightness.Overall it is a good product and would recommend it for the price. I didn't play any games or videos on this monitor, just normal viewing.The vga and hdmi ports work perfectly.Not very sure of the customer support in case of any problems."
5,"Everything as expected. Not sure if the eyecare thing actually does anything or if it's just a gimmick. But it is a high quality monitor. Great colors, clarity, brightness. Great for coding and general purpose monitor."
3,"It's overall a good monitor. But... I don't understand why in this earth, this monitor needs 16A socket to operate. My 350 litre refrigerator needs 6A, my 55 8jch Smart TV require 6A even my UPS & CPU need 6A to run, then why this monitor needs 16A current to run?"
5,Perfect on time delivery. Neatly packaged as well.Display is very good for the price. Also has an audio out port if you are using a ps4 or xbox with it.Overall a nice choice for this price.
5,Got this as my second monitor for the WFH setup. It's got VESA option and very slim bezel.
5,According to the picture quality it is perfect. Anti glare is also ok. Gaming I have not explore yet coz of different field.I read in the question and answer section that GW2475H is an improved version. GW2480H has some issues.
5,Purchased this in the Republic Sale and it got delivered to me in few days. Image Quality and colors seems very better on this as compared to other display's.
4,"Looks good but the only problem is with the plug,it comes with 16Amps big plug, won't fit to small sockets, need an adapter to get the job done."
5,"I am satisfied with all my expectations ‚ò∫Ô∏è, but if hdmi is connected I am getting the exact clarity, but when I connect vga cable ...I don't. Not too much of difference you could find. But it still worries me. Other than that everything is perfect and worth the money üí∏"

Never go for it I had a worst experience dealing with this product"
4,"This is good monitor.. however, power cable is 16 amp .. which will not fit in any UPS:).. I bought 5amp power cable separately.. not sure what benq was thinking while suppling 16 amp power cable :D"
5,"First impression. Liked it very much. Eye care technology is really soothing to the eyes. Good design. One thing to be noted is the cable comes along with the monitor is for 16A power plug. Worth every penny we spend, recommneded!"

5,"If you're the kind of person who is using it for watching movies(especially at night), for casual gaming, and for general purpose usage, this is the best 27"" monitor that you can find under 10kRegarding the VA panel, the colours are punchy, ink-y blacks with zero backlight bleed and viewing angles are decent to good.. I doubt you'll get the same level of blacks and contrast on an IPS panel at this price point let alone 27 inchesAnd yes, the ppi is terrible and is very noticeable while doing my office work, but setting the scale to 110% masks it to some extend and it's the only tradeoff you got to make in this panel.. and considering a 2k panel for slightly better sharpness is over 2x the price of this, it's simply not worth it.Also, this is not colour accurate or HDR compliant nor has HRR but for a general user, these compromises are acceptable for the price you're getting it. Also, it does not have inbuilt speakers and anyone who has a monitor with inbuilt speakers won't even consider it as a con as they're usually very feebleOverall, I'd recommend this monitor over any other 24"" monitor available at this price category just for the sheer VFM and quality panel that it offersAnd for people thinking about viewing angles as this is not IPS, check out the Lizard pic that I have attached in 3 different angles and trust me, it's not bad and it's definitely a great tradeoff for the deep blacks and zero backlight bleed that it shows head-on which no IPS panel in this price or even 2 levels higher cannot match. Also to note the fact that the monitor will be viewed head-on (+ or - 10 degrees) 95% of the time"
5,"Picture quality is superb, but you have to keep a distance of minimum 3 feet from the display.75Hz on hdmi doesnt seem any different from 60Hz.For continous hours of work, this monitor is perfect.For light gaming, its good.For videos, excellent.I havent tested heavy gaming, so no idea.The images are taken at one finger distance from display.(~3inch)Your eyes wont feel any stress reading/working on this monitor."
5,Fantastic monitor. I went with VA panel as I needed it for watching Netflix. No issues connecting to MacBook. It also works well with Apple TV. Turning off Apple TV puts it in standby mode. Picture quality is nice. I use DCR and the contrast is great. I use it on 60Hz through HDMI port. I couldn‚Äôt find 75Hz setting and don‚Äôt have VGA cable to test that.
5,Amazon & seller did a good jobExcellent monitorPicture clarity is greatThis monitor is anti-glareIt wasn't mentioned properly & no one was able to clarify either.60hzIt has AMD free syncI never thought Lenovo monitor will be this great. But it is. And I am happy recommend this to everyone.
4,"Guys I am using this monitor for more than 2 months now. Picture quality is absolutely great considering the price point. Obviously if you are graphic designer/ video editor or gamer then you may need a better refresh rate 4 K monitor, but if you need this for day to day work like WFH and using as secondary screen then go for it. I do watch you tube videos' on this as well no issue so far.3 sides bezel are really very minimal, so yeah its stylish looking monitor.Monitor base is actually bit big so pro is that it will give you monitor a strong base and con is it will take good amount of space at your desk. But for that you can go for any monitor stand.Overall Thumbs up."
5,The product is amazing. The screen can be customised to your personal preference. It can be wall mounted as it is Vesa capable. I have it mounted on the wall. It is very ergonomic as I can use it for both work and personal use. I am impressed at the monitor for the price. It is definitely value for money. The picture quality is amazing. I mainly wanted a monitor to be mounted on the wall and with my budget this was the only one offering this option.
1,"Product is very low quality. I received the product on 21April,2021 and it is less than 9days and screen is showing vertical lines.Vertical lines on screen are due to loose connection which do appear after years of usage but within 9days speaks about product quality.Please avoid this product."
5,"I wanted to wait one month before reviewing just to see how well it holds up, so far so good, can't complain for price to performance ratio you are getting what you pay for or even more, i got it in 10k and i would say that it's worth it, i have not tested for gaming but i consume lot of media i have hooked up MI Box and my laptop with Hdmi switch. So far the picture quality and colors are really nice. Worth a buy.."
5,All things are good in this monitor. But if they also provide inbuilt speakers then it would be too good.This monitor is good for programming with big 27‚Äù screen in low budget
4,"Value for money. Baught 27"" Lenovo D27-30 monitor at 9999/-. After using it for more than 2 weeks I am happy with the product. The picture quality is good although product quality should have better.Overall it is good monitor at this price to work from home for IT professionals."
5,"Picture quality will not disappoint you. FHD Resolution looks very good and impressive at both VGA&HDMI. You need to change display frequency to 75hz and it does work like charm. Cannot compare with UHD/4K resolution monitors but at this (10k) price, monitor is really good. Design and bezel less display is very attractive too and you won‚Äôt feel that your money is wasted."
1,"If you are looking for work from home setup, for God's sake please don't buy this product.- Video quality given by 1980 1080 is terrible.I'm basically a game developer. This display quality is never suited for purchase!Bought this today and my eyes have starts paining by sitting for about an hour!Please see to this product from somebody else before buying this."
2,Not apt for gaming or graphics designing. No true colours. Backlight seems high brightness. Just can use as a resource monitor/TV
5,Cant find a 27inch monitor for this price. Pretty decent for office work. No speakers included so you may need a separate speakers.
2,Black is not black on this monitor and the colors are not good. Useable only for documentation
5,"Value for money, this 27 inch monitor is pure fhd 1080, i played 4k videos on youtube, its crystal clear. And the main purpose of this monitor is to use as second screen for my laptop, which it performed V well and i am happy with the clarity and matt finish."
5,"I really like this screen. Easily syncs with your PC/Laptop. With price of 11K and 27"" screen size I did not find other better option in the market. Packaging was really good by the seller and picture quality of screen is really good."
5,At this price I can not think of anything better. Perfect in everyway.Also its actually more stylish than it looks in real life.
4,Good product. its been a month that i started using. No issues Till Date.Only issue was there were some minute gaps between the screen and the bottom frame. But the screen itself doesn`t seems to have any issues.
5,"Very reasonable . I searched a lot but in this price no 27"" monitor is available. Picture quality is very good for watching movies. Easy to assemble. Audio quality is ok."
4,"Product is no doubt offers a great value, build is decent considering the price. Only if it would have been made in india, I would have vowed for it ..."
5,"It's a good monitor for office work, I also occasionally use it to watch movies, audio out port is helpful to attach external speakers"
5,"The monitor does what it says in the description. It might not be the best 27"" FHD monitor you can buy, but it surely is very good value for money"
4,Good if Speakers could have been provided..‚òπÔ∏èüôÇ
1,I am unhappy with this monitor as it went non functional from the second day itself..
1,Just received the item and unboxed only to observe the power cable is missing!  have got the  display but unable to use it till I get the power cable.
5,Picture quality is thrilling. Only demerit is it doesn't have inbuilt speaker. 5/5
4,Good value for money monitor
5,Supper monitor
5,Product is good but not that great. At 11k range it's best option üëå
3,Monitor is good but power plug is very big and it won‚Äôt fit in normal and they have not mentioned this
4,"Pros:Easy to assemble. one of the best monitor with in 15K, Like three-sided ultrathin bezel design, 1920 x 1080 Full HD resolution, AMD FreeSync technology, T√úV-certified etc.I have purchase this for office work like coding and debugging not for gaming. really happy with the performance.Cons:Power socket is 16A, need to purchase an extra converter.No Hight adjustable"
5,The plug was the only problm with this monitor overall perfect for me
5,Nice product! Easy to install... already 3 months using the screen and no issue at all.
5,Best monitor  this segment but but delivery slow
5,Outstanding
5,Absolutely amazing!
5,Really good for Office work. Good quality
5,Value for money.
4,"I would have five star, but it came with a black stain on stand and I am not able to remove it. And also plug is bit one 20 amps it seems, it should have been mentioned in description.A part from this picture quality and performance is very good. And also remember this product dont have inbuilt speakers. So some extrnal speaker need to be connected."
5,"In the photos there is the side-by-side comparison between Dell P2419H & HP 24F. I own both. Here is is my subjective review focusing on the two purpose which I will be using the monitors for: programming and consumption of multimedia content.In favor of Dell:1. Deeper blacks.2. Lower IPS glow.3. More natural looking colors.4. USB hub (1 upstream, 4 downstream)5. DisplayPort 1.2 with DP cable included.6. Better functioning stand. (height, tilt and angle adjustment)7. Vesa mount compatible.8. Better calibration out of the box.9. Lower response time at 6ms vs 14ms on HP.10. Cleaner cable management (included stand can be used).11. Lesser color/brightness/contrast shift at extreme angles. (really knit picking at this point)12. Better build (HP has slight gap between bezel and display as visible in a corner closeup picture)13. Ever so slightly thinner bezels on Dell.In favor of HP:1. Looks sexy as hell. (thinner panel and modern looking stand)2. Brighter display at 300nits vs 250nits on the Dell.3. More vibrant colors. (but also less natural, so your choice)Also in favor of HP (but only if using for Gaming)4. Higher refresh rate at 75 Hz vs 60 Hz on the Dell (but remember, HP also has worse response time at 14ms vs 6ms on the Dell)5. AMD FreeSync support.Conclusion: Things that matter most to me are present on the Dell and hence, more love to Dell but no hate to HP either. You can't go wrong with either.Purchase: Costed me 14.5K before discounts and brilliant fast delivery by Amazon and ZRPL seller. Thank you!"
5,"Brilliant 24 inch monitor, have owned 5 Dell Monitors before this and this one is perfect and as usual Dell doesn't disappoint, my purpose is to use it as a vertical monitor in addition to my primary and secondary 24 and 20 inch Dells so I use it mostly to read books, browse and for stock market usage and my GTX 1070 is fully capable to run all three so I am taking maximum leverage out of my setup.Vertical monitors are a god send for browsing as you can see an entire page without much scrolling so a Landscape and Portrait monitor should be standard for everyone who is doing serious business with their PC, it's 2020 people wake up."
5,"I was looking for a monitor with adjustable height, portrait mode, and screen size enough for programming, and casual gaming. I have used Dell monitors at work, and found them of good build quality. This one fit the bill, very good build, with a sturdy and height adjustable stand. Very few monitors in this range with this thin bezels. Monitor can be rotated in portrait mode, useful during long programming / debugging sessions. Comes with 3 years Dell Advanced Exchange warranty, where they will replace the panel incase of any defect, which is awesome!Another plus is the built in USB hub, that is immensely helpful in avoiding cable clutter. This is especially true with the Macbook with the USB-C ports. I had to just buy a USB C to A adaptor, connect it to the monitor, and have all the peripherals connected to the monitor.I bought this from the seller KIDA Retail. The warranty has already started from Aug 2018, which the Dell support said they can change. However, the invoice Amazon provides doesn't mention the serial number and product tag. I'm working with them to get this rectified. The only other con is there is no HDMI cable included."
5,"If you're looking for a monitor for office or for general purpose work, I highly recommend this one. The colours are very rich, the stand it comes with is very high quality and it has a very thin top bezel - so gorgeous to look at. This is my first time buying a Dell monitor and i'm actually surprised it is of this quality. I'm glad I skipped the rest.There are no inbuilt stereo speakers with this model. HDMI cable does not come with this monitor. There is a bit of backlight bleed but I'm not bothered by it. If you are that guy with that perfect standard / paranoid you made a bad purchase, you can go replace it. It's a general problem with most IPS panels. Monitor does need a bit of calibration for optimal colour accuracy. This is not the model which comes with a USB-C port. Also, the model number in title and the description in this page differs - Answered in FAQ. So hopefully you know all that before buying.My options were originally Dell P2418 (Rs. 24,800 for 1440p on a 24'') - worried about scaling issues and Dell Ultra Sharp U2718Q (Rs. 56,000) - Very expensive. So I decided I'd just settle for Full HD as I'd be mostly using it for programming. For the price, this is a very good monitor."
1,I got this product for 13k. First one had Backlight Bleeding issue. I appreciate Amazon delivery but the second one too had the problem. As seen above right bottom is Backlight Bleeding
1,my Seller is M.V.S.N..... But Don't parcheges this Seller... because Package is not Prefect and Monitor All steckers Removed... i am parchege 22 December 2018. but Dell site saying You have August parcheges. I don't know but Monitor Working Prefect.
5,"Dell Monitors are best in the market. I had been using 1. Dell 2208WFP (almost 9 years old) and 2. Dell U2717D (few months old). I wanted to replace 2208WFP and came across this amazing monitor and awesome deal. You can't get this monitor in any stores at this price and of course I can bet on that! Apart from the price, quality is amazing. I am happy with the product. This monitor comes with 3 years of warranty from Dell.It came with the following cables:1. USB 3.1 upstream cable.2. Display Cable and3. Power Cable.One thing everyone needs to understand is - we all buy things keeping future in mind and also thinking that the things I can do with it. For. example I would order a monitor thinking that I would play  games on it but the real question is am I seriously going to play games or that's just one of the assumptions? Thought this monitor should work flawlessly on games too. It has beaten many monitors in 24 inch category heads down. The build quality is awesome too! I strongly recommend this monitor."
5,"With the onset of lockdown since March/April, 2020, I had to get monitor for mainly work from home purposes and for sure can be used for watching movies and videos. I did a lot of research, initially wanted to go for Benq 27 inch monior or Samsung curved 27 inch monitor (trending at that time), but later came to conclusion that this product of Dell is best of all for 1080p standards.Pros:1. If it is 1080p and if you are looking something around 13k, please avoid getting 27 inch monitor as it would NOT be good experience (trust me my friend got 27inch Benq at the same time with me); with increase in size of monitor your resolution defination should also increase. 1080p on 24 inch will be much better than on 27 inch as per my recent experiences. Also, I would recommend to avoid getting curved monitor ( had initially ordered samsung curved monitor but later cancelled it after researching more) , curved monitor will only add to value if size is more (Like atleast 34 inch) , also curved monitor has their own cons.2. 24 inch monitor should be sufficient enough and good to go for working from home perspectives and also watching movies/videos, unless you are looking something specific.3. Look and feel, brightness - Awesome4. Picture quality, Accuracy - Great5. Screen ia very good with thin bezels and matt finish, It has adjustable stand and is strong one.6. I got it around 14.5k but definitely this is worth it than other monitors ( like benq 27 inch, samsung curved 27 inch)7. There are different view modes, inshort if you are reading something or watching movies you can tune the mode for best experiences. Though I only use standard mode , makes most of itCons:1. Didn't find any until now, will update review if I find one. Though monitor lacks audio jack/speaker, I believe that facility shouldn't be part of it or even if it is getting in other monitor they aren't of good qualities.2. Regarding assets, I didn't get HDMI cable with this monitor, but got other two types of cable. They should support it giving HDMI cables ."
3,MRP on the box is 10K beware !!
1,"I never expected that Whole box will be damaged and come dirty filled with mud. When I opened the box just after product got delivered and switched on tv, I found that whole monitor display was broken. I suddenly took the video of everything. But very disappointed as I was waiting eagerly for this item and received this damaged items.Thanks Amazon for replacement option but again I need to wait for the item."
5,"Love this monitor, I am a developer and this monitor is good for development. I am using this as an external display, Works good.---- Issues but not a problem.- We have to rotate UI from OS for adjust in vertical display,- Found issue with dell wireless keyboard & mouse. Usb dongle not working properly with back 2 USBs. But works fine with Wired mouse. For that I have to return my Wireless dell Keyboard & mouse. And bought Amazonbasics keyboard mouse which are also good for speed typing."
5,Excellent full HD monitor. The height is adjustable to a great extent and can be tilted backward and forward. The monitor makes possible cable management easy. It comes with two USB 2 ports and two USB 3 ports. Even the power hungry external hard disks run smoothly with all the ports. It also comes with a display port cable and USB cable. HDMI cable is not available. I used Amazon Basics HDMI cable to connect my PC to the monitor. The packing was good and all the items in the package came intact.
5,"After 3 weeks of extensive effort I found this one to be the most appropriate Monitor for work. I am a full time developer, and I use this Monitor with my laptop.Good Things:1. Amazing Display2. Perfect Size3. Minimal Bezels4. 2 x USB 3.05. 2 x USB 2.06. 1 x Display Port7. 1 x HDMI8. 1 x VGA9. 1 x USB upstreamOutstanding Things:1.Rotating Display: The display rotates on the stand, you can use it in Portrait Mode while coding or viewing logs2. USB Hub: You can use all the USB ports on your screen as hub, you just need to plug the upstream cable from Monitor to your PC, after that all the USB ports on the monitor will work as if they were on your computer, just awesome3. Adjustable heights: You can adjust the height by sliding the display up/down on the stand4. Adjustable angles: You can tilt the screen forward or backward5. You get this at around 12k6. 5-8 ms response timeBad Things:Couldn't think of any so far, I mean the features you are getting at 12k INR for a 24Inch Full HD monitor you won't even find one product with such amazing offerings.Gaming?Games work perfectly for Beginner to Medium level players, as it is not a gaming monitor, it will be unfair to expect g-sync/free-sync and high refresh rates!Conclusion: Just go for it....Warning: If you are planning to buy LG Ultra gear or similar gaming monitor, please beware that those are not good for purposes other than gaming. If you are hardcore gamer, LG Ultragear is THE BUDGET MONITOR, but only for gaming."
4,I bought this Dell Monitor after my recently bought LG 24MP88HV 24 inch Monitor was accidentally broke. What I like about this Dell Model is you can freely adjust to any position you want 5 stars for that. but what i don't like is the quality of screen as compare to the previous LG monitor I had own. it doesn't mean this Dell monitor doesn't have good screen it's fabulous but my personal choice LG was a little better in terms of picture quality. Overall I am satisfied with this product.
1,"I bought this display as a secondary display connected to my Laptop. Build quality, packaging, delivery is good. but the color reproduction is Disappointing! you can see pics attached. blue comes out Green. Light blue comes out as light pink. white is yellowish white. color chart shows all colors displayed differently. Black comes out dark Gray....contrast is very poor...Rs12200 gone really waste......DELL is very disappointing. how can this be called professional series? this is not even good to see your family pics as it surprises you with different color of clothings, you never wore.... Replace window is up to 29nov 2020.Request Amazon to replace this Monitor as all return/replace options have been removed for this product and unable to call customer care"
2,"It is a good monitor for the price.  Not for the games and has a noticeable lag.  Not a primary monitor class, however, perfect as a secondary monitor. It struggles a bit with text antialiasing but raster images look great. However, should you require after-sale service please don't be dependent upon DELL service staff,  They suck at their job, I had to buy a new monitor because they refused to provide repair (it still had many months of valid warranty left)"
5,"Ordered two of them within a span of 2 weeks first one was from a seller Aapni Dukaan and second one from UniqueClick. First one was good, accurate color and all. Second one has defective panel. Yellowish tinge on all images, through all inputs (hdmi/vga) , have requested for replacement from UniqueClick, lets see how how the replacement monitor performs.Recently the Mrp has been increased. The monitor I bought from ApniDukan was 2019 import and had price tag of about 16k, the monitor I bought from UniqueClick was 2020 import and had revised price tag of about 18k+.  Its not the seller that is increasing price, its Dell who revised the Mrp. sellers are anyway selling below mrp.Pros:a. Wonderful Colourb. Usb 3.0 Hubc. Height adjustabled. I am an IT professional, coding in this monitor is breeze. Connected with Dell Laptop as well as MacBook Pro. Dell instantly recognised and set the correct colour profile, so did MacBook Pro. It will be a breeze coding on this monitor.e. Have connected amazon fire tv with it, works fine. Only thing is have to route the audio through bluetooth speakerf. Colors, ( I know I am saying it again :) ) oh my god they are beautiful. I have tested with 4k videos (though monitor can reproduce only full hd) they are wonderful. Wish my phone camera could capture the vivid colors it producesCons:a. An audio out Jack would be greatb. There are no hdmi or vga cable in the box. Dell doesn't provide it. They only provide one dp cablec. Made in China. I wish it was made in India :)PS:I am a hobby photographer , I plan to use my set up for photoshop and da Vinci resolve color grading. For an amature this monitor will do fine."
1,"Delivered today(12 Oct), and I was happy as delivered in 48 hours. When I unpacked it found there is no label and sticker available in the product also dust on the screen, it show that it is an used screen. Further, I have connected the screen and found there is a vertical red line is appearing on right side. I have purchased a new and fresh product not an used one. I have raised an request for replacement of the product. I never expect this type of delivery from Amazon. Not happy!13 Oct: got an replacement of the product but it is received in very bad condition, the broken screen. Hence returning the product and claimed my money back.It is very disappointing! :("
4,"I am writing this review after almost 1 week of use and I would like to share the feedback based on my personal expectations and features based on price range.I was madly searching about a good monitor which was supposed to serve my purposes as below:1- Coding 50% ( As I an a developer, I do spend a lot of time in coding )2- Video/Photo Editing 30% ( I do PHOTOGRAPHY sometimes and filmmaking too)3- Casual gaming and other activities  20% ( I play games sometimes like Sniper elite 4 , far cry 3 and CS GO , which does not require massive GPU and refresh rates )With Above requirements I was looking something like below specs to cater the all above purposesIPS screen , 60-75 ghz refresh rate , 22-24 inch display, AMD freeSync(for better sync with games), 1080p resolution(for better clarity of text while coding), Good color reproduction(srGB 90%+ / NTSC 70%+), Ports(hdmi)I did find few options like LG, ASUS, SAMSUNG but all of them had almost same specs. then I found DELL P2419H and when I compared it with all the options it stood out of all even though with slight more cost.What I liked about this?1- DELL being a robust LCD panel manufacturer and great after sales support.2- Dell monitors are heavily used over corporate offices for all sort of purposes hence it has got great feedbacks and improvements over the year , so it is quite stable product3- This model has massive positive reviews in both amazon and flipkart4- This model has unique features like Adjustable stand , tiltable and a stand that has cable management option5- It really has true color callibaration (not too much saturated like samsung, or not less )6- It has 75 ghz refresh rate which is enough for my gaming purposes(not for high end games)7- It has got nice Monitor settings and easy customized buttons for quick functions8- Amazing brightness ( I use 20% as it has enough brightness as I work long time so I dont want to strain my eye with more brightness) But I switch to gaming,movies modes when I need to for perfect brightness setting9- One of the best selling point of it is ports. It has 1 HDMI, 1 Display port(which nobody provides in 10-12k range), 2 usb 3,0 ports, 2 usb 2.0, 1 usb upstream port, 1 VGA. The best part is display port can be a great help for faster data display and due to its USB options u can use external mouse and key board along with pendrives or harddrives without having to be dependent with computer, as many laptops now a days have less usb ports  , macs pc even do not have at all. SO it gives a great USB hub feature built in.NOTE: to make USB ports work, please use USB upstream cable provided, and insert it to one of the usb ports in computer else usb ports in monitor won't work ( commom issues by customers)CONS:1- It does not have freesync where all of the models provide in this range. ( but this does not matter as this monitor is not meant for heavy gamers, for casual gamers as I mentioned names above , it does not require that sync as 75 is enough for that)So far I am really happy with performance and look is sexy, the borders are almosr bezelless .HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR: PROGRAMMERS, VIDEO EDITORS and CASUAL GAMERS!NO SCREEN BLEEDING ISSUE FOUND AND THESE NEW STOCKS ARE ALMOST COMING WITHOUT ISSUE OF SCREEN BLEEDING SO CHANCES ARE VERY VERY LESS."
4,"I have been using this monitor for 1.5 months now. The monitor's build is a little fragile. The panel behind the screen bends and make a sound when you try to turn the monitor. The monitor has adjustable height (can go down all the way down and can go up by about 20cm). The monitor can tilt, pivot (and go into potrait orientation) and rotate about the vertical axis about the base too (it can yaw, pitch and roll). It has a thin bezel, if that matters. I got it for Rs 14500 without any discounts.pros:1. Can adjust in every which way (which is why I bought it)2. Comes with USB out ports on the sides and back3. Good brightnessCons:1. It does not include a HDMI cable (had to buy that seperately), comes with a display port cable2. The quality of the plastic behind the screen is a bit on the lower side"
4,"HDMI cable was not supplied with it. Only display port cable, USB3 connector cable and power cable were there. Not all laptops have display port, so HDMI cable should be supplied with the monitor. Other than that, I have no complaints. Video is sharp. Lag is not noticeable. Colors are fine. No reflections in the screen. The main reason for using this monitor is the Stand. It can be raised or lowered and the monitor can be rotated both horizontally in either direction as well as vertically, for scrolling through large documents. Using the USB3 power cable, other USB devices (4) can be connected directly to the monitor. I am happy with the purchase."
3,"The monitor is good. But the cables given with the monitor  are petty  useless.  The power  cable is with a 16A plug. It doesn't  fit into a standard power  outlet.  The requirement is only 1.5A. No idea why a standard 10 A cable wasn't  just given. Also no HDMI cable provided.In the end I had to use cable I already had for power and hdmi connection. If you don't,  be prepared to buy them separately!"
4,"Extremely happy with the purchase. Main feature that I am impressed is, it's super adjustable. we can even flip it into portrait mode which most of the monitors do not offer in this price range. Picture quality is great with antiglare protection. One of the best Monitor for WFH and for people looking for a monitor with macbook's. I am using it as an extended monitor for my Macbook pro and the screen feels so sleek.Giving a star less as the packaging was little damaged from the outside and the monitor doesn't have an audio out and they doesn't provide a hdmi cable. My seller was ZRPL. I got it for 12.2k on amazon prime day sale"
1,"I received the product on the 3rd of April 2021. My initial impressions about it were quite good. It's commendable for office work, the display is clear, the anti-glare feature is an added advantage: had no hiccups setting it up. However, it has been just 47 days using it and it's gone KAPUT. It does not power up anymore. All the precautions taken w.r.t. the electrical connection and power surges and babying the monitor and what not, the damn thing just failed within 2 months of usage. The cherry on top is that, even though it is under DELL replacement warranty, as per DELL policies my BRAND NEW MONITOR will be replaced by a ""REFURBISHED MONITOR"" only.  Imagine the nightmare of receiving a refurbished replacement that may or may not be cosmetically pristine, against a BRAND NEW Product . My cheap as hell GATEWAY monitor of 12 years is still working perfectly and this piece of tech dies within months. My advice : STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM DELL."
5,"Loved the monitor.It's a Mat 1080P Full HD monitor. The picture quality is excellent. No light bleed at all. 250 nits peak brightness.The price is justified.The display panel is vivid. Wonderful experience for watching videos and movies.The major reason for me picking this monitor was the ""stand"". I am really impressed by the stand alone. Very few monitors have a stand that provides hight adjustment, along with all directional movement.I usually prefer the monitor to be as low to tbe table as possible.I am extremely happy with the build quality of tbe monitor as well. The stand is all metal and feels sturdy.Happy with my purchase. I would surely recommend this."
4,"Over all Good product product, built quality can be improved looks delicate over the edges as it as narro edges. So one has to be carefull moving the monitor and adjsting the angle. AND PLEASE STOP SENDING dp port hdmi CABLE it is such a e-waste go green either don't send cable or send cable with regular hdmi port. Or give option to user to select what kind of cable to select. 90% of the time cable you send is not usefull so Reduce carbon footprint. SAVE THIS WORLD"
5,"One of the best LED Monitor out there in the marketPros:1. Arrived in very good quality packing.2. Simple and ease of assembling the monitor and stand. Lightweight. You will get a page of detailed instructions on assembly inside.3. One power cable, DV cable and USB upstream cable included.4. The monitor has high grade HD Picture quality. No flickering or any disruptions.5. The power cable can be directly attached to the back. No extra DC convertor pack required.6. Multiple input options such as HDMI, DV and VGA7. 4 USB downstream ports which can be used by connecting the supplied USB Upstream cable from any USB port of your laptop/computer to the upstream port on the back of the monitor. Very convinient if you need to plug in extra USB devices.8. Nice viewing angle. Anti Glare.9. Can use Dell Display Manager software application to adjust the settings from Windows OS.10. Auto detection of source connected or you can select manually.Cons:1. No VGA cable included in the package.2. The adjustment switches are too small in the front, you barely feel it when you go over them.3. No sound output since there is no speakers present in the monitor.4. No 3.5 mm sound output connector at the back. If you are connecting an HDMI cable, there will be no option to play the sound carried by the HDMI cable. You have to connect a separate source from the sound source itself. I have selected a different  source for audio from my laptop through 3.5 mm slot.5. A bit higher on the cost side. While you can find competitor models at lower prices than this monitor.Overall judging by the performance and quality, it is a nice addition to your workstation."
5,"+ Display is good. I connected to MacBook Air and did RDC to Windows machine too.+ The screen can be adjusted to view it vertical- thats a great plus.+ The ComfortView preset mode really makes it gentle on eye when working for long durations, though obviously, because it filters out blue colors, you'll miss bright colors in this setting.- HDMI cable and Built-in audio would have made it a great package overall."
4,"Difficult to manage cables. They advertise as good for same, but not.I wanted to buy earlier version, as also using same at office desk, but thought to go for this USB3 and newer model.Olde model still much better!!USB uplink powers itself down on its own.For some reasons, when other light switches are flipped or electric door bell rings, this monitor shuts down for 3 seconds (even on power-strip/ups).Color reproduction is okay quality. Not professional quality. The only reason it seems to call itself Professional monitor is due to [1] Stand has height adjust, [2] perhaps better after sales service optionsI bought with GST transfer... however Dell refused warrantee transfer as seller did not honor the transfer (as per Dell's email reply to deny transfer)."
3,I was expecting better picture quality (blacks are not at all perfect. ) screen is brighter than expected in dark scenes...which kills the enjoyment. Tried various settings in brightness and contrast but not satisfied. Even I noticed high differences in picture quality with slight change of viewing angles... not sure all IPS is like this!
1,Received damaged product. There were thick white lines in the bottom of the monitor. Damaged product was delivered.
5,"Amazing experiance.. No bezzels on top and sides. Very good for professional use. 2 USB type A v3.1 ports on sides, 2 USB type A v2.x ports on back, 1 HDMI, 1 Display Port, 1 VGA port, 1 USB type B v3.1. What else you need?Only drawback is, no 3.5mm audio jack neither input nor output, Bcoz monitor doesn't have speaker."
1,"+ rotates 90 degrees- hard to use buttons- difficult to navigate menu- developed dead pixels, a huge blotch of dead pixels; right at the eye level.Won't recommend."
5,"My existing 21"" monitor of Dell which I was using for almost 4 years went out of order hence I was looking for a new monitor. I normally use it for office purpose. I selected this particular model but I was apprehensive about the quality and since there were few negative reviews.  However I still ordered for the DELL P2419H Monitor. I received the same in time and I am very happy about the product. The best thing is the extra USB Ports, even though you have to connected the monitor to the CPU with extra cable. The cable was provided in the packing. Overall a very nice product and received the product in good condition without any damage."
5,"Excellent picture quality. Good for work and watching videosUSB 3.0 port on the side is very fast and usefulLooks very nice and Easy setup.Only problem I'm finding is the Dell's software (Dell Display Manager) to calibrate the monitor is very lean on features - Cannot tweak many parameters like saturation, Blue reduction, response time etc, instead we have to use the hardware buttons to set these parameters."
5,"Unless you‚Äôre a graphics professional of any kind, this should suffice for your uses. It‚Äôs filled with USB ports, the height adjustable stand is fantastic, and it‚Äôs build and picture quality is great for the price.I really think the height adjustment feature is super worth it over other monitors. I‚Äôm in my late 20s and have developed back and neck muscle pains due to using fixed stand monitors for my last job. Do yourself a favour and make sure you get height adjusted for the best ergonomics. It will work out a lot cheaper in the long run and could avoid some doctor visits. This is doubly important if you spend most of your time on a computer for work like I do."
5,"Dell P2419H is an upgrade from P2417H. This monitor has decent Onscreen Display menu where you can control the inputs, brightness, contrast etc. I bought this monitor to use for programming primarily. After adjusting some of the brightness settings, it's perfect. I also played a couple of youtube videos and they looked great. So this could also be used occasionally to watch movies if you're interested.As other reviews mention, monitor comes with a Display cable, USB hub connector and a power cord. My laptop has a display port, so didn't have to buy vga/hdmi cables for connecting purposes.Product was delivered without any damage and arrived on time. Assembling the monitor was rather simple. It does come with a manual. But if you're a first time monitor buyer, you could look up an unboxing video on youtube and get a hang of it. The product I got was manufactured in April 2019. So I went to Dell website and initiated a warranty ownership transfer from the retailer to myself. You can verify whether it's registered on dell website with the ""service tag"" you receive with the product (it's stuck onto the package box).Considering other models and prices, if you're looking for a monitor to work on and occasionally use it for entertainment, this is the perfect choice. The product I received didn't have any backlight bleeding issue. The flexibility of the monitor is a great plus and makes it completely worth the price."
5,"I like the monitor, it exceeded my expectations, the color constrast, wide screen, easy installation, setups, height adjustment, horizontal and vertical rotation.Note: New 2021 model coming it with 16A plug, in India we need 10A plug (small). In any case if you received 16A plug, you Dont have to panic, please reach out your vendor on the same.In my case, I have contacted my vendor and I told about my issue. He quickly addressed issue and told him he is going to send new cable.I like the way the vendor addressed my issue, I am going to give thumbs up. Thanks"
4,"Bought it as my second monitor for my WFH office set-up post COVID.Though I am registered on DELL as a purchaser, selecting this monitor from the seller on Amazon was a no-brainer considering that DELL is fleecing customers by pricing the same monitor at more than double of what it is available for, here on Amazon. Kudos to the seller! (you might need to make an effort to register the product separately on DELL.com for warranty purposes.Easy to mount, install,  and works like a charm.Definitely worth a ""CONSIDER' if not a sure 'BUY' in this category.would definitely opt to buy one more, should there be a requirement!PS: Monitor is primarily used for work, hence gaming capabilities are unknown to me."
1,Last time I have given a five star review about the seller @StorazeBiz.Packing is good delivery is on time as committed product is physically ok But after five days of purchase I have notice that the backlight is bleeding from the bottom and left corner of the monitor. Then I talk to amazon expert Also Add All photo of regarding color bleeding issue. He gives me a replacement. But new one is also defective. Red light color several dot appear on the monitor bottom part. It is clearly visible on the dark screen. So I want to refund my money back..
5,"The colour accuracy is really great. Looks great with narrow bezzles. On paper, the brightness might be just 220 nits (theoretically lesser than its competitors). But upon using it, i found the brightness to be just perfect in a well lit room too.Good for professionals (CAD, 3D or photoshop work) as it boasts of 103 percent sRGB. (I didn't need a monitor for gaming which was above 60hz so this was just perfect for my use case)The only downside is that the plug/power cord provided within the box has a chinese plug head which means some of you would need a connector/spike guard to power it on. I didn't have that problem as my switch board has modular switches so it easily plugs in.The backlight bleed is negligible. Nothing to worry about there.Generally you get deep blacks with led displays and not ips displays. But believe me, while using this ips monitor, you won't feel anything odd. For it's price, it is offering much more than what you pay for.The height isn't adjustable but frankly, thats not something you do on a day to day basis. It has tilt option though. This 24 inch monitor has a standard height for itself which is perfect in terms of ergonomics.Overall i am totally satisfied with the purchase."
5,"I bought this monitor purely for the colour accuracy and I wasn't disappointed at all. It looks, feels, and works like a professional monitor right out of the box. It boasts of a 103% sRGB rating and is pretty much accurate. Aa a designer, I use it primarily for graphic designing and rendering applications. The brightness is perfect for an office or home setting. It has advanced options for setting up colour profiles if required. The only thing that could have been better was the contrast ratio. This monitor has the standard ratio of 1000:1. If it was 3000:1 it would have certainly been better but the panel technology won't allow for that I believe. Overall it's a great beginner monitor for professional and at this price (INR 9k) this is one of the best out there."
5,Display is so colourful and it's anti glare finish really amazing. Borderlands design really give it an edgy style. Overall for editing purpose I say go for it.Prefer lower brightness only. Some Filter settings may change the colour of the display.
5,The color accuracy is so good.This is best budget monitor for WFH.I was not sure when I ordered it.The build quality is good and best value for money.
5,"This is a really good monitor, the picture quality is good and response time is also spot on. No second thought on going for it."
5,Very nice product. brightness is very good and colour accuracy is super fine. Loved it.
5,One word awesome!
5,Best
5,"Only bummer is that, it's comes with a Flat pin power cord and not the traditional round pin. You can buy a converter."
4,Summary - It's a good monitorüëçNow the details‚Ä¢ It's a 1080p display for 24inch screen so if you're sitting any closer than 60 cm you'll notice pixelation .‚Ä¢ On Google you might find 102% sRGB (CIE 1976) but I truly prefer my eye vs the numbers so I don't think it is yaa it's accurate like 96% but not 102% cause only problem I noticed is the colors are a lil brighter .‚Ä¢ It's response time it 7ms and refresh rate 60hz so it's okay for casual gaming.My final verdict - It's really good for a home pc or a basic gaming pc . And to all the photographers yes the colors accuracy is good.For any other question Please text me on my Instagram - @pranjal_mikaelson
5,"102% SRGB AND IPS PANNELBORDERLESS ,Anti glare and wall mountableAWESOME PRODUCT , Strongly recommendNice packaging and slim PANNEL"
5,"Amazing Product, Superb Clarity, good for WFH and even office use. Proper size. Good product for web designer, coders, programmer."
5,Atlast a worthy monitor.I seletecd this monitor specifically for design & art.It's completly great.Make sure you use it in bright area.
1,"I had bought S2218H and used that since last 3 years. The texts are very smooth in that as well the picture quality is Full HD.Now needed to upgrade and bought this one, But this monitor which is a successor of S2218H, is not anything as compared to the old version. The texts in this monitor looks grainy. You can't read texts properly when looking from near.I don't know why Dell made this, This has no Speakers, the image quality is also very low. Had to return it.I think Dell's ""S"" model is the best quality, ""SE"" are the cheaper and low quality ones."
5,"Value for money.So Crisp in display.I used it as my daily monitor. I had CRT monitor so initially I connected this monitor using  a VGA Cable but then there was distortion present and the pic quality was low as well.So, I have added a basic Graphics card and using HDMI cable which got free with this monitor the display quality I got was far better.Its stylish and easy to assemble.Value for money, but before buying it make sure you have graphics card on your system."
1,Guys don't buy this monitor colour reproduction is average... just Go for Lg 22mp68vq which have superb colour quality. I returned this and bought lg monitor!!!
1,"The product received broken.When I opened the screen to fix it with my computer today, I found it's screen is internally broken."
1,"In the video I posted, the right one is a DELL SE2219hx bought from a store. It has almost accurate colour calibration. The one on the left is the same monitor bought from this seller. Right out of the gate you can see major difference in the monitor to the left. It even doesn‚Äôt match the symmetrical proportions of the one on the right. The colour produced is so dull and inaccurate. Now either the manufacturer Dell makes every one of their unit differently and doesn‚Äôt bother about their products authenticity or this seller is false!"
2,Who gives a power cord with a 15 ampere plug for a monitor?  All computer essentials come with 6 amp plugs.  What is wrong wiwtth Dell?  And Amazon won't even take it back!  So I'm stuck with a useless monitor until I find a 6 ampere power cord in these lockdown times!
1,"Good and fast delivery by amazon but when I opened the amazon box, saw the Dell monitor box seal was already broken, hence returned the product immediately.  Request to seller not to send such product to customers."
1,"This monitor doesn't have built in speakers. Display is little blurred, not a clear display.. please don't buy it.. there are better options available.. its not even returnable unless damaged.. Don't go for the 7 days return policy.."
4,Worth every penny. Too happy with the results. Only pathetic thing was that the dell box was damaged not sure if seal was tempered or what.So 2 star for packaging
2,Just Ok. Picture Quality is not satisfactory. Text on screen appears hazy. Not recommended. Better to go for S2218H. Feel cheated.
5,"Awesome productValue for moneyAnd must buy product üëçüëçüëçThis monitor is Very OP, The display was very good and it was handled to me with all the care. So I'm giving this monitor 5/5!"
1,I GOT OLD STOCK AND DAMEGED LED
5,"Sleek and handy, picture quality is very good"
5,Good monitor
5,Love it - very good for the price point - Dell as expected does the job
5,Clear good size and value for money.
1,Sending defective items and doesn't care to replace or refund.You have to call them and call will be continued to 7-8 days and so on but you will not get refund or replacement
5,I cannot recommend the product enough. I got it for a very reasonable price as compared to china made products. GO FOR IT.
5,"Some reviews say that picture is not proper, etc.. I think this could be related to problem with vga cable."
1,"This monitor is supplied with 16 amps cord, as if people use this monitor in kitchen or bathroom"
5,Using it for a few months now. Worth every penny. Best part is the matt finish. Helpa reduce stress on the eye
1,"I was cheated into buying this monitor as it said it was Made In India, however when I saw the Box later it turned out to be Made In China..!!"
5,I definitely like the sleek look that it has because of the thin bezel around the screen.
5,I really loved the monitor and it's picture quality. Delivery was prompt.
1,Don‚Äôt buy this. The product is very narrow and blinks every few minutes. And they won‚Äôt take the return.
5,"Cost was high compared to other brands with similar specs, but I am fully satisfied with product."
4,I like it after replacement. First they gave me used me monitor.

4,"Pros:Exactly 15.5 inches at 1280x800 as mentioned.Super bright and sharp panel.Many controls for color, brightness, etc...Both HDMI and VGA Ports works perfectly.Good quality HDMI cable is included with it.Good secure packaging.Wall mount supportCons:You will need to buy large extendable wall mount for mounting because the power connecter sticks 1 inch more from the monitor..19 inch widescreen TV in Picture but the product is 15.4"" 16:10 one.There are holes for speakers but no speaker is present.Contrast ratio is poor.Look only straight. Very bad viewing angles."
1,Picture quality good & brightness good but the size of monitor is smaller what we order.We replaced first time for size and another monitor came with same size. We amazed with fault delivery..
3,The monitor is good. It has 1 probleam that it is blury in high resolution. But thus probleam can be fixed when you incrrase rext up to 150%.
1,the product is defective and when turned on the screen is roolling and there are lines on the screen.The amazon guy mentioned that there is problem in verification of image which he has. but we have packed the same product as received.Kindly arrange to pick up the product and refund money.
2,"Screen quality is not so good and also in visual studio code, it is not totally black it also shown light black color you can see in image."
1,Very bad quality products. It developed lines and dits within 5 days. The seller has been unresponsive to messages about warranty and replacement.
2,Warranty card was not in the box. Light was leaking from sides and was not comfortable to use.Its so light in weight looks like it will fly off. So I returned the monitor.
5,"Brightness wrongly, pictures quality damage but exelant good product"
5,I have purchased for my CCTV camera monitor . Very good quality pictures are very clear and came with very safe packing .
5,Nice Monitor and no issue found from last six month. Working nicely. Such very light weight easy to carry monitor.
5,Secureye monitor is branded product
1,Defective product
5,Very nice üëå
5,OK this Monitor has model number KG241QS and there is similar monitor i mean exactly similar with model number KG241QP. Only the difference is that QS is a factory overclocked monitor.Here i will tell you everything about KG241QS which has 165hz refresh rate and 0.5ms response time. the similar KG241QP has 144hz refresh rate and 1ms response time.I have owned IPS panel monitor from LG ( 22mp68vq ) and before this monitor i owned Asus (VG258QE) that was a TN panel Monitor. I recently bought this monitor to actually check whats the difference in 25000rs tn panel and 12000rs tn panel. and when i received this monitor i compared it with side to side with Asus monitor and the difference between two was literally 0%. And comparing this with ips monitor i.e is LG there was a very unnoticable color difference which you will never even notice except white looking a very little yellowish type. And by very little i really mean very little.I am just writing such big review for you guys to just tell you dont waste your money on pricier TN panels you wont notice even a bit of difference. I am loving this monitor gaming is heaven in this monitor so if you are planning to upgrade your monitor buy this use this n i can assure you that i will not be disappointed if you have used IPS panel before. if you want to invest your money invest it in either getting a 2k or get yourself a beast graphic card.I am here mentioning the perfect OSD setting for both 144hz and 165hz models you will get best colors out of it.Brightness - 55contrast  - 40black boost - 06gamma  - 2.4blue light  - offACM  - offSuper sharpness - offcolor temp  - normaloverdrive  - normalfreesync  - onVRB  - off
5,"Well i was holding my purchase for past 3 months for 144Hz monitor and finally pulled trigger on 5th March 2020.And i must say 60Hz users please get 144Hz if you can already .I am not gonna devide this into just pros and cons as it completely neglactes whole user experience i have so you have to read everything.First things first let's get the facts out of the way-1) It is 144 Hz and 165 Hz out of the box; whichever mode can be set with windows or Nvidia Control Panel.2) Enable AMD FreeSync from OSD then you can set Vsync then Gsync easily on both Hz without any issues.  (To enable Vsync is not necessary)So i don't think much is needed to say for gamer at least as this is purely meant for gaming. Colours are accurate out of the box. One can down Green slider from OSD a little bit(48) to make it more accurate otherwise it's fine. Even for movie,too. there are 4 modes in OSD and 3 for gaming.Lastpicture in my review has ACER 165 on left and BenQ VZ2350H on right. I don't have any complain on either one but look at the acer sometime just giving more vibrant and still warmer colours...this is personal preference and one might like BenQ one but i would go with Acer as it is easy on eyes. And moreover u can tweak this easily form RGB menu,2 gamma presets -1.8,2.2 and 2.4 and colour temperature setting but don't do it randomely...find a scale first to measure.I mainly play Rocket League and PUBG lite online and  I tried Witcher 3 offline. 165Hz always and no ghosting or trailing effect. Resident Evil and Tomb Raider players...sorry i can't test that deep. Your user experience may very from mine. The monitor works flawless for even 6-7 hours straight.No issues in reading text but it stil looks pixelated from 60 c.m. distance. But for images and movies it's just doing fine.Ok...so why get something better if u can? Because this is TN panel and it's gonna show it's symptoms from time to time. As i have to seat in level of the display. Watch slightly from more height or more low it will affect sky and white colours resulting in washed out colour and black shadow respectively. On normal windows usage this is a issue because there is a Green tint all over the place when u see it from angle. But but but here me out; you are not gonna watch form that angle and operate your pc...U can still watch a movie from that angle and it is just showing good expected colours.For gaming this is great value for 12499 INR as this justify every feature it comes with. One might wonder why i didn't talk about 0.5 ms response time but it's marketing gimmick anyway in every gaming monitor and one have to measure actual GTG response time and i don't have that tool. For me it's just fine on 144Hz and 165Hz.U can get Acer's 144hz IPS variant but for gaming this is just fine for 60Hz to 144Hz upgrade. Sorry if i left something u wanted to hear but i don't have any issue about black level or anything. Backlight bleed? I have picture attached and it's equal on whole panel but on camera it looks somewhat bad.In reality it's perfectly fine if u watch it from straight. Any other questions feel free to ask here. I will replay and test if i can."
4,"I was lucky to have got this for 11,915 INR. I knew AS SOON AS I order it, the price would go up.Now let's talk about the performance of this monitor. Coming from a 4K monitor, it took me a while to get used to the 1080p resolution of this monitor. The brightness is far too much for me. Even after I turned Brightness and Contrast to Zero, it was still far too bright for me. Other than that, I think it's a good deal at 11,915 INR."
5,"Literally the best monitor you can find for gaming at this budget, I've been using this for about 6 months now and I'm really impressed by the display and the colours. POG"
1,"PLease do not fall for the outside cover which claims normal refresh rate at 144hz and overclock 165hz. In reality, when checked from system, it shows 119hz and 137 as normal and overclock refresh respectively. Absolutely shameful marketing from acer and being sold by amazon."
1,"Only had this for 5 months and already having to replace !!!!  I'm REALLY not happy.  I only use this occasionally (probably only 30 times since buying) and it is flickering away like anything.  Did experience a little flicker, a few seconds here and there, when it was only a few weeks old.  Changed cables and updated drivers and it didn't happen again for a while.  But now it just doesn't stop !!!  Changes cables, screen side (have dual display) and deleted and reinstalled drivers .... still flicking.  NOT HAPPY."
5,I purchased this monitor Rs 13840The monitor is really great and really awesomeNow let's cut the chase and come to the pro and consPros1.The display quality is really better if we compare with some Ips panels2.178 view angle I consider at 1703. respond this is accurate4. Its totally on matte finish and near to bezel less design5. For started just go to display setting and change from 59 or 60 hz to 144hz or 165 defends upon your flavorCons1. The stand is really good with glossy black bottom part with matte finish red But shaking you table make you  monitor a little bit shaker2. Color calibration is not done so do as for your flavorSo these are my thoughts on this monitor I hope this will really help all of you those who want to purchase for gamingHAPPY GAMING
2,"After 1 week of waiting i received a defective monitor although the monitor was working fine but something inside the back of the monitor was broken as i could clearly hear some metal plates (something like that) roaming freely inside the monitor which were hitting something inside and making that metel noise.Also i think the monitor was used because it already had freesync ,overdrive and gsync(in nvidia control panel) enabled already ,also it was already overclocked to 165 hz out of the box, or maybe im wrong and it is suposed to be like that  i ll update my review and rating once i received the proper replacemnet"
1,This monitor worked fine for 2 months and suddenly it stopped working. It is in warranty period so they told they will replace it. It's been more than 10 days now and I haven't got a replacement till now. Very poor service from Acer. No one is able to tell as to when they will get the product from their HO. Really disappointed!
5,"Ok first of all i am coming from IPS Panel 75hz so everyone told not to take TN Panel but i took the risk, but i must admit this monitor is superb.>Great Brightness and side view is good too (i thought it would be bad)>Color was little low but increased the vibrance to 75% in nvidia control panel.>Smoothest Experience literally i can feel the difference by scrolling amazon or fb you will not face any tearing n ol and in gaming like csgo, valorant just awesome..> Download color profile from acer.com and update it on device manager>Provided with Display port Cable (You have to change in nvidia resolution to 1920x1080 165hz)If anyone facing any issues for first time kindly  perform clean driver installation of nvidia or amd.Overall loved it let see how it performs in future, Hoping for Best!!!  <3"
3,"Think twice before you buy. The Monitor has a good refresh rate. But its not .5ms its 10ms and more over the screen alignment is slightly slant towards bottom right angle( i noted this on the third week) . The monitor I received looks like it is refurbished. If you are lucky , you may get a good one, try your luck and chance. However think twice!"
5,Nice quality monitor in such a low price. I have got this monitor at ‚Çπ13828. But now the price has increased. I want to purchase more but price is already increased. Please let me know about the same.
4,"There is no other monitors which is available at this price with 144 hz, I purchased this item for 11950/- and for average gaming purpose 24 inch far better. also the design of the stand and holder is very impressive. However the border of the screen is thicker. but we can ignore it when compared to the price . There is no need to think much this  if the price is on offer"
1,monitor was delivered on 17 aug and on 11 sept suddenly a blue line ran through the displayi am currently on a call with acer while writing this review and it has been 20 mins since the customer care has put me hold :)))))))ps : will update the review and write hows the acer service
5,"Best for gaming I bought it at a great value of 12300‚Çπ 144hz monitor u can switch it to 165hz and it is really awsm picture quality. 24inch is best for 1080 , 27inch monitor will decrease your pixel density for 1080 it will effect your user experience.Recommended for CS:GO players."
4,"I have waiting to buy 144hz monitor for almost year, but i was not able to afford till now. I searched for the cheapest and best feature full monitor at price of 13k. This is best monitor you can get at this pricePros:-1. 165/144 is works as mentioned in the discription2. Freesync is awesome for games. i play pubg pc alot and i usually get fps around 80-100 avg lag and stutter but after freesync turned on it feel butter smooth (free sync range 48hz-165hz )3. Brightness is good4. Stand is good no problem thereCons:-1. Viewing angles are shit if you look straight it looks fine but if you bend a little the monitor get dark in some region2. The Bezel size is too much but it doesn't matter too much. this is the best Monitor you can get at this price"
5,Very good monitor but colour not too much accurate compare to ips and side view angle colours are very very bad but am very enjoy with 144-165hz and 2k resolution gameplays.Pros.1. 144-165hz works very well.2. Freesync enable monitor also gsync support but u need to dp cable for this feature.3. Looking sexy nd stand is very attractive.4. Colours are good compare to others TN panel.5. Brightness are awesome yes it's too bright üîÜCons.1. Colours are not well don't expect much.2. Side view angle colours are very very bad images shows full dull and blackish.3. Monitor are not steady because stands is small and monitor is to weighted nd his moving by air comes from your ceiling fan and coolers.4. Monitor not support 2k 144hz on dp only work 2k 30hz but works on hdmi well. I don't know why but yeah am face this issue
5,"I have been using 60 hz monitor from last few years... and saw few videos on youtube for higher refresh rate for gaming and tempted to try one. Was on low budget and got this with discount.The higher refresh rate of 165 hz 0.5 delays (which is lowest) and 24 inch just changes the whole experience for gaming. Someone who is in to FPS games and plays daily has to have to monitor. Its a complete package at good price, vesa mount, dp HDMI port, different modes for gaming movies etc.The only thing i miss is speakers but you can anytime use external speakers.All in excellent product and delivery..... very happy."
5,"First I was saving for Acer 144hz monitor which costs around 13k on amazon but while I was browsing for it one day I saw this one and was surprised that it is just the same as it and has 165hz refresh rate and is also cheaper as I got it for 11,915. I immediately bought it and I am happy I did. Gaming performance is very good if you have a 60hz monitor please consider upgrading if you can. Viewing angles are surprisingly good for TN panel, you can see the display clearly even when sitting on the ground. The display has good brightness and color reproduction. You can tweak further by going into the Nvidia color panel according to your liking. Overall it is the best buy at this budget as no other 165hz monitor is near it in this range."
3,"I have been using this display for more than a month now, Here is my impression of it.The display quality is good and it can be easily used as a secondary display to your laptop or you can use it as your main monitor too.The color production is fantastic and the 165Hz that it provides is something you would love to experience, Keep in mind, Windows only allows 120Hz natively, So you would only get to experience 165Hz in games.The biggest CON of this monitor is its stand, The stand is so pathetic and is really not build sturdy enough. The display would constantly wobble like those bobblehead toys while you are typing on your keyboard on a table. It wobbles so much that it would be enough to annoy you into stop using the display altogether. The display even wobbling while I am writing this review. Giving three stars solely because of the stand."
4,The monitor came today with superb packing.Got a good initial feel even after un boxing but it didn't last after I booted the monitor. Got back light bleeding in the left middle screen and right bottom of the screen. Ordered a replacement and hope it'll be in my hands soon. But except that everything is fine but got irritated when playing black things.edited- got replaced today with a good panel monitor without any bleeding and counties enjoying ü§©üòç
1,"I fall in love when I first saw this I was like omg this is it <3 <3... I would 100% not recommend this to anyone, the worst monitor I have seen.. 165Hz? my phone feels faster lol..I loved it so much I would have given 0 stars if there was an option for it."
3,In dark areas the banding is horrible and takes you out of the immersionthe monitor has an unfixable forward tiltthe color accuracy is badthe only possible use for this is just office work and gaming upto 165 fps and nothing elseinvest more and buy a better monitor i wish i did that
5,"monitor is nice... 165 hz .. 1920x1080p.. 0.7ms .. 27 inches .. TN panel... as TN is best for gaming.. not for video editor and movie watcher as the color accuracy of TN is not good go for IPS then for that but for only gaming best monitor at budget just at 18000rs when i buy it .. remember the technology used for enjoying 0.7ms response time is MPRT , u have to turn on in monitor settings to enjoy.. btw turning on enhances experience but u can't able to change brightness contrast related stuff, freesync is also disabled in this mode.. the major thing u have to do with MPRT is to turn on every single time u boot ur pc... FREESYNC monitor but if u have nvidia card u can use GSYNC in this monitor as it is GSYNC Certified Freesync monitor (remember to connect display cable for 165hz Gsync/freesync support) btw nice monitor using for 7-8 months no problem at all in starting as it is 27 inches and i jumped to a 27 inch monitor from a 20 inches monitor but if u settled with it one time u cannot able to revert to a smaller monitor again.... and go for it if u get it in deal as over 20000 its not justify it price"
5,"First of All my expectations with this was high and it is fullfilled , in the picture the stand is black but u get red black combo which looks op üî•U can vary it's Refresh Rate from lowest to highest (165.003)Free DP Cable with Jaw LocksIt's 0.5 ms 165Hz Screen is so damn smoothRn I'm using it with my lappy and PS4 gonna build PC SoonOverall i just Love the product"
5,I bought this monitor checked everything it's great monitor just found one flaw of the monitor it has black colour defectiveness cos whenever black colour comes on display then tiny little white colour shows in display maybe stuck or hot pixel so I request for replacement but go for this monitor it's awesome overall üëç
4,"1.Best for 1920x1080 gaming. 2. 400Nits super bright.3.Accurate colors. (Need lily tweaking if preferred).4. With Gsync compatible FreeSync On 165hz monitor, you can play warzone high settings at 150Fps(min)  fixated provided you have 2070 super or above graphics"
5,"Got this on an offer for 10,700/-I am very happy i got this monitor. AMD freesync comes on by default. No need to go to the trouble to turn it on. Just go to your nvidia control panel or amd panel and change the refresh rate to 165 and see the magic. I play Dota 2 on my PC and earlier i used to play on 60hz. I switched to this and I can never go back. I am using GTX 1070 with this monitor but ill suggest get a AMD card for even better performance. But yeah even Nvidia cards work fine. The games run very smooth and it improvers your gameplay. Also videos and overall use becomes very smooth. I will definitely suggest this to everyone. (only viewing angles are bad so dont buy if you want to build a HTPC)"
5,"When I was buy the price was 12k it's really good too much bright I save my brightness level to 55, it's really good for gaming, it's a TN panel but the quality of the display, colour it really good, you don't face any problems with this display. It's also good for entertainment purposes, I didn't face any problems colour is good."
1,A big size monitor for gaming but when u connect hdmi cabel atleast 144hz should working but no its only working 75hz with hdmi and when u applay 165hz its not working anymore and when u apply more than 75hz then its flikring and some black line comes on screen so i refund it and give 1star so don‚Äôt buy this go with others. And picture quality is very poor very very poor
1,This monitor has a decent performance ..But the quality of product is too bad i got a damage product in which there was a gap between the panel and the bezel . I replaced the item and after one week i got the replaced monitor which has the same damage problem ..
5,bought a week back and when it arrived it was good and then while testing the screen i found a green pixel on the right side of the screen and requested for replacement and recieved new one and till now there hasnt been any defect with this but for thoseewho want to buy it and are coming from ips displays { i am on TN pannel for the last 3 years so i didnt notice it} the colours are good but they will change on viewing from other angles and it is G-sync compatible freesync monitor.
5,there is TN panel but viewing angel and color are good enough than my expectation. It gives true 144Hz and 165Hz .But you may see little ghosting issue that can be ignored. You noticed the issue if you focused on screen to see the ghosting. One problem is OSD application is not working properly. You need to use monitor button to adjust settings. Overall the monitor is a good choice for daily work and games.
4,"Its Good for Gaming and Entertainment,Only thing that i noticed is that this monitor's stand was like already used with scratches but it was beneath it and you cant even see it,Its 1ms gtg on 144hz but 0.5ms is a marketing gimmick,Input lag is pretty low good one for competitive gaming,also couldnt see much difference on 144 to 165hz,The other model KG241QP is the same with the basic features that u need while this ones got some additional features that some ppl doesnt even use,This ones Display port is kinda hard to connect and eject as it had a lock,Overall great monitor for 11997,If you want to save some bucks go for KG241QP as you dont wanna spend 1000 rs higher for 21Hz more which is literally unnoticable,Its a TN panel but colours are good for gaming as i tried it on rainbow six siege and can clearly see everything.I already bought a Samsung C24FG73 which has amazing colours when compared to this,But its marketed as a gaming monitor but its only for casual players as it has like 24ms response time bcoz of VA panel,If Casual and want more colours Go for C24FG73,as its great,also for ips consider Acer or MSI,But for competitive go for Acer or Benq zowie as TN panels are the Fastest of the lot. Also dont spend more than 15K for tn panels as they are not worth more than that."
2,"Do not buy TN panel unless you really want that competitive edge for FPS gaming, I went from a IPS 60hz display to this and colors suck compared to IPS display and honestly I can't see much difference between 60 hz and 144 hz. Better buy a IPS or LED even if its 75 hz."
5,"This review is after 8months of use...1. Monitor gets black screen in between.2. Monitor not have one more HDMI PORT, and USB port.3. Speakers are useless.4. Viewing angles are not good.5. IPS panel is best.This is main partAcer warranty is no use as no good response from services.Good @13800Buying at this price and leada to regretting...Solution Buy Samsung monitor or any"
4,"The screen display of the monitor and customisation according to the gaming is good but I am so negative and disappointed with the Audio system both the headset jack output, the audio clarity was poor on my philips external speakers and inbuilt speaker is too poor the 4W inbuilt speaker can't able to meet the performance of my laptop speakers...I strongly recommend for other products if you are looking for a monitor with inbuilt speakers...And I feel a remote or better user interface to operate with all those features..."
5,"This is how it describes - 165 hz.Feel the difference.After switching from 60 hz to 165 hz , there is nothing left in the product to complain about.I play Valorant and can see the frames like a silk cloth.Brightness is more than enough, viewing angles are not bad.Build quality is superb, especially stand.Must buy for budget-friendly seekers.I got it in 14.6k - 2 days delivery. Big thanks to Amazon."
4,"Might be good for gaming but if you are planning for office work - it's not good.The monitor can't scale up FHD to 27inch, so text becomes a lot pixellated. Circles are not proper, text lines are bold on one side, thin on other.Stick to 24 inch or less on FHD.Go for 27inch qhd or 4k if you want proper display"
1,The monitor that arrived was damaged or more likely as if it was completely submerged under some thick fluid.... Had to replace the item... It was really disappointing... Hopping this time they don't mess up... Will notify and edit after the replacement...
5,I bought this product because I edit videos for a living.I have a YouTube channel: KTNTECH (You'll find the unboxing and impressions video there)If you're a gamer do not go with this one.Because it's an IPS Panel the response times are a lil less and there are tad bit jelly effect while gaming.If you're a photo/video editor definitely this is for you at least on this budget.Thanks for reading.Don't forget to check out the channel :)
5,"Bought this monitor on 5th Jan 2018 at Rs. 15,499 in lightning dealFollowing are my observations:1) The first thing I noticed is that top and side bezels of the monitor are very thin which is aesthetically pleasing and gives it a premium look.2) Screen is decent and has good brightness and contrast. Not sure about color reproduction but it feels alright.3) Screen has a refresh rate of 60 Hz at 1920x1080 resolution. However it has an option of 75 Hz at 1024x768 resolution also.4) Even though this monitor has Eye Care (Bright Intelligence), I felt that the sensor adjusted brightness is on higher side for my liking.5) There is slight backlight bleed at top left corner of monitor which is noticeable only in very dark environments but overall has uniform IPS Glow.6) Response time mentioned on the box is 5ms (Gray to Gray) and I felt it to be good for FPS games. Overall, it's a good monitor for casual gaming.7) It comes with UK style power cord and needs a converter/adapter or a spike guard will work.8) The box also includes HDMI cable and the monitor has cable management as shown in product description which I felt is a nice addition to the package.Monitor has following ports:D-SubHDMI PortDisplay PortLine-in port and3.5 mm jack for plugging in earphonesThis monitor also has in-built speakers which are pointed downwards. The quality of audio from them is nothing to brag about and max volume is that of a typical tablet (my iPad Pro 12.9"" 2017 has better sound output than them) but no complaints here considering the price of the monitor.Overall this monitor is value for money product considering the price I got it for.Cheers to Amazon for on-time delivery.Feel free to ask any questions about the product, will be glad to help!"
5,"I have worked on many monitors (Dell, HP, Acer) in office and home. Never had a Benq. I will get this out of the way, my favourite brand is Dell (I have bought around 10 products). I was torn between the Dell (2717H), Viewsonic and Acer. For some reason I never had a good experience with products of HP.My requirement was a 27"" monitor. I am not a serious gamer only play casual games from time to time. The main purpose was to do programming and watching videos (and reading). This monitor suits perfectly.Pros:- Excellent display. It had a bit of light bleed on top right corner but it was just the glass a bit out. I just pressed it in and the bleed was gone.- Good contrast and viewing angles. I have not played any FPS games till now but overall the experience till now (10 days) has been smooth and consistent. The 5ms response time is good enough for me.- Although it is a 1080p display, the text and videos appear sharp, no pixelation or ghosting. Colours are uniform and even.- Bluelight filtering is good. Helps when reading a long book / article and puts less strain in the eyes.Cons:- The Eyecare feature is a bit aggressive. The display becomes too bright for the surrounding light. I just switched it to standard and set the brightness and contrast to levels I am comfortable with. The day/night light in my room doesn't differ much so I don't need to change the settings.Other monitors with similar features were around or over 20k, I got this for 17k. Overall a very good budget monitor. It also has 3 years warranty which is good and tells that I can expect a pretty long life from this.Let me know if you need to know more."
4,"I bought it mainly for its auto brightness. But, the brightness doesn't go too low there is no light around. So, I had to stop using the feature that I especially looked upon. Anyway, it's a value for money product. Good fit for someone who uses it occasionally. Not recommended for you are going to stare at the monitor for around or over 8 hours a day. For such use cases, better to go for Dell ultrasharp monitors. They are costly, but your eyes would thank you for sure."
5,"I was skeptical about this BenQ G480 eye care 24‚Äù inch monitor first. After a lot of research, I found this monitor too good for regular reading and office work. I previously had a DELL 21.5 inch monitor which that has a really thin bezel on the side and the top. Further, it is quite good in color production along with two fine speakers at the bottom.Now, for the last 1 year, I had this severe pain in my eyes as I mostly work in front of the screen. The pain gradually increased at times I couldn‚Äôt even stare at the screen perhaps, due to the harmful blue light emission. I was waiting for the shopping days to come up where I can buy a decent monitor(bigger size) and also that could help me get rid of severe eye strain.As I already use blue cut lenses I did not find the previous monitor abstain harmful blue light. And this time I have decided to buy the BenQ monitor 24 inches (Eye Care). I did not expect to be excellent in color production either I play games using this.After, I received the monitor which I purchased just for 7.8k during the festive season deal.I found the feature ‚ÄúLow blue light‚Äù and ‚ÄúBrightness intelligence technology‚Äù - uses a dedicated sensor to map out the ambient lighting to adjust the temperature and brightness of the screen which seriously I have never seen on budget monitors.Anyways, I am quite happy with the purchase I have tested and experienced no flicker issue neither extreme blue light emission after you have just switched to ‚ÄúLow blue light emission‚Äù.In addition, I received a major upgrade to 24 inches that allow me for seamless reading. Moreover, the monitor comes with 36 months of on-site warranty but sadly, you can register the monitor on their website there is no option to do that.I have seen people complaining about the screen bleeding issue. Fortunately, I did not face anything yet.I am in love with my new 24 inches BenQ monitor irrespective of having 5 ms response and limited to 60Hz refresh rate. This monitor is perfect for and reading, working for a longer duration but can‚Äôt say about photo or video editing work. I purchased the monitor mainly seeing the eye care technology that puts less strain on eyes even after continuous usage of 6 hours.I have attached several photos of the monitor and how it looks exactly. Also, I have tried to show the features that you can access using the buttons beneath the screen."
5,"This monitor is really good at this price point ( I got it for 9499 during amazon sale )Pros:1.Colors are much more Vibrant then normal LED's, i have a triple monitor Setup so i can compare this with other LED's  from dell.2.Dark and Bright values are much better differentiated.3.The best one is the price you cant get any thing better than this at this price Point...Kudos to Benq for that4. Brightness is way too much high5. Multiple connecting options ( i plugged it to my PC as well as my PS4)Cons1. There is some back light bleeding ( But that is ok even expensive monitors has minor light bleeds)At this price point i think Benq has done a great job.if you want a cheap IPS display then this monitor is for you."
3,"The monitor is well built.  Quality is also good.  However, It's painful for the eyes if you do text based stuff.  The fonts will look blurred.  It seems that 22inch or lower size monitors are best for Full HD Resolution.  24inch monitor will have larger pixels which will make text blurry and affect eyes.  If you just want a bigger monitor, spend more money and go for Ultra HD ones.  Otherwise, you may regret it as I have. Looking forward to selling mine!"
5,"The BenQ 27 is an amazing monitor the most interesting that I loved about this monitor is its slim bezels on the sides and top. I've connected it with Laptop and the output quality is uncompromised and looks good. it also has an inbuilt speaker (but I never used it because it's not good in my opinion).Moreover, the texture on the display is well finished with Matte so it could block glossiness and reflection. The monitor comes with a control panel to adjust different settings related to colors and sound. It also comes with a set of Color schemes preset, which are also customizable. Right beside the control panel buttons, it has a power LED indicator too.My overall experience with this monitor is amazing."
5,"Good product, performance is excellent and exceptional difference or upgrade in my viewing experience. Suggest the product to buy if anyone is thinking to buy one in budget, though I still have a doubt whether it is an LED or LCD as I received a manual saying LCD in the packet.I wish to buy one more if I get a clarity on this LCT/LED thing .."
5,"I bought this in late December 2019 for 12.9K. I had switched to this from a 22 inch LG monitor (model 22MP68VQ, to be precise). The color reproduction on that monitor was downright brilliant. So, when I plugged this one in out of the box, to be honest, I was somewhat disappointed. The colours looked so faded and unappealing, the blacks were nowhere near black and the overall panel appeared to be so low quality, that I almost contemplated returning it.However, when I tinkered with its settings, boy was I amazed. The color reproduction improved massively, including the contrast and brightness. I also made some changes to the Intel display driver's setting (mine is a Windows system), however, that might be different for you based on your system.First and foremost, go to ""Picture Advanced"" menu on the OSD (on-screen display), and set Picture Mode to ""User"". This will turn off all settings such as Bright Intelligence, Low Blue Light, etc. (Trust me, you don't want to keep them enabled for the best picture quality). Then navigate to ""Picture"" tab in the main menu. Here are the monitor's settings that worked really well for me:1. Brightness: 100 (you may lower it if it hurts your eyes)2. Contrast: 603. Sharpness: 54. Gamma: 55. Color Temperature: Normal6: Hue: 507. Saturation: 50Once you have tweaked settings to the above numbers, you will see it greatly improves the picture quality. However, if you have an Intel display driver like I do, you can tweak the settings there too for an even better picture. Here are the steps for that:1. Search ""Intel Graphics Command Center"" in start (this may be different for you if you're running an older driver). If you can't find it in start,  you should be able to right-click on your desktop and go to Intel Display Settings too.2. Navigate to the ""Display"" tab.3. Go to ""Color"" tab in the window.4. Leave ""Brightness Enhancement"" to default at 50.5. Change ""Contrast Enhancement"" to 48 from 50.6. Enable ""Luminance-based Color Model"". (THIS IS A MAJOR GAME CHANGER)And voila! Your these settings would breathe a new life into an otherwise dull default settings.One thing to note here is that the piece that I received had slight IPS glow / backlight bleed from upper left corner, mostly noticeable in very dark environments with 100% brightness (see attached picture). However, it is very common in IPS displays, and gets worse as the screen size increases. I didn't want to gamble with a replacement product, so I chose to stick with this one. Mine came with zero dead pixels, so I was worried about the replacement being worse (more backlight bleed / presence of dead pixels)."
5,"The product is very good. Eye care setting has options like Multimedia, Reading etc...  I usually keep Multimedia while playing games and Reading when I am coding and doing office work. I usually spend 8 hrs per day infront of PC, I didn't experience any eye strain. Vertical adjustment is not there, so if you have comfortable chair and table, it's good. Inbuilt speakers are good enough. Like other commented, I did not expect a home theatre like speakers from a monitor. Its suitable for hearing computer sounds and attending meetings with client. Build quality is good. I bought it for 7750Rs, Because of Corona pandemic prices are increasing, I don't have any option and didn't wait for the deals. I feel happy for purchasing this."
1,After using the monitor for 2 weeks I noticed that the top part of the screen has a white spot and also the edge of the monitor is open from the top (pic attached). The return date is now over. I feel cheated. Really upset with Amazon.
4,Pros:1. Tiny bezels2. Great colour composition3. Good collection of input options4. Vesa mount compatible5. Pocket friendlyCons:1. Inbuilt speakers are useless. They don't reproduce complete sound spectrum properly.2. Brightness is a bit low. Difficult sometimes in bright daylight3. Menu control system UI is very bad
5,"Display: I bought this monitor as a secondary display to aid my programming. The text display in Windows 10 is awfully pixelated and not at all crisp. If you are  buying this for text based usage, strictly stay away. I can't emphasize more. All the other display related features are absolutely miserable.Sound: The less we talk the better. The speaker volume and quality is fit for nothing absolutely pathetic sound. I don't know why this feature exists.The Bomb: You cannot return, can only replace. No matter how you try the display is ending up being garbageI gave 5 stars because most of the people only read 5 star ratings and I don't want my rating to slip through."
5,"Absolutely amazing monitor. Definitely recommended for the price. Best value for your money in the segment without a doubt. After days of research and enquiries for a 22"" monitor, and comparing it with Dell's & HP's, I ended up buying a pair of GW2283's for my video editing setup. What a delight to the eyes! Go for it without a doubt, I'm not regretting a single penny spent. Definitely at par with Dell's & HP's IPS 22"" monitors, saving you around 1k for the same performance and build quality. Maybe if you search this in your local market, you can buy it for a bit cheaper. But I had no option as such so went on via amazon.Pros-1. Although I have a dual-display setup, a single 22"" will be productive enough for most of the tasks, especially this having a 1080p res.2. This thing is built like a tank! So robust and heavy, i wasn't expecting it to be of this premium built-quality for the price I paid. This thing is HEAVY! Durability- 11/10.3. Really good panel. BENQ has been an understated brand but believe me, the actual display quality is no less than it's competition, even at comparatively lower prices. Brightness- 8/10 | Sharpness- 9/10 | Color Accuracy (in the segment)- 9/10 | Anti-glare Display- Good readability in direct light (though it reduces the overall brightness but the negotiation is worthy) | Great Viewing Angles and Adjustability- IPS panel, nothing more to say.4. I/O management deck- definitely helpful to keep things organised when you got crazy wiring all around as in my setup. Practical design.5. Also the overall packaging was really good. It came all foamed up in a double cardboard box. Good job Amazon. BENQ package was however far superior with all kinds of protection.Cons-1. No HDMi cable provided in the package, although the monitor itself has 2√ó HDMi ports. Just 1 VGA cable (of good quality) provided.2. Only tilt adjustment for the stand, no height and swivel adjustment, but that's just nit picking. Won't expect that from the segment.3. This thing is heavy. But definitely it has its benefits in terms of durability.4. The built-in speakers are just, meh! Not too loud, not too crisp and clear. Just average. Does the job. Sounds more like a mono rather than stereo, but I personally use headphones for my job so no big deal for me.5. It is not completely bezel-less design. There is a thin in-display bezel after the rim of the panel. Actually the overall bezel is more like 3mm from all sides when actually booted up. Its not absolutely bezeless as they show in the picture, but the crop is minimum.Verdict- Overall a great, robust, practical and powerful tool for your setup if you want durability, great display quality, performance and practicality. Nothing fancy, but still looks appealing, sleek and smooth to the eyes. Highly recommended to pick one of these uo, you wont regret for what you spend.1080p Res, 60Hz refresh rate, IPS panel features, robust design and build quality, premium looks, super practical. What else do you expect for 7.5k bucks?JUST GO FOR IT."
1,"Please don't buy if you are trying to buy it for macbook. It doesn't work with macbook pro even with original hdmi to type c adaptor. The resolution is not good.Benq technical teams recommendation to fix this issue was to ""use different hdmi to type-c adapter available in the market"" and pray that one of them works as they have verified it from other customers, but they are not ready to share which adapter to use. Wasted 2 weeks talking to benq customer but then they are not ready to help."
1,"Having used Dell Ultrasharp 24 in, I ordered this one after reading great reviews on it.  After trying all kinds of options for three days, it still tired my eyes in no time.  In comparison, I can work on DELL U2415 Display for hours!  I returned it after four days of wasted effort.  May be people who have given highly positive reviews for programming as well have not used Dell U2415.  The latter is pricey, but I am going to buy more of the same.  Nothing beats 24-inch (1920 x 1200) in crispness, quality, and very low eye strain!  The extra 200 pixels in width adds a lot to the comfort!Can't comment on gaming capabilities."
5,"I have been using multiple monitors over the year, I usually change the monitor in an year or so. This is just an amazing product. I have moved the TV and kept this monitor at its place as even my Sony bravia TV did not match the video quality of benq, I would give my 200% review for this product. If u like movies and want to watch 1080p videos on YouTube this is best. I am amazed that I spent 6000 rs almost twice a year buying bad monitors but this is best monitor with real life feeling of videos. Buy it u won't regret it.Anyone who has visited my house has said that this is a amazing And videos looks like life like video can't explain. But this is the closest I have gotten for the past 14 years to a monitor which is TRUE HD"
1,"After seeing so many good reviews, I got this monitor hoping I‚Äôll get a good product but was disappointed. Seller was Appario.Firstly, the amazon packaging was torn and damaged from one corner. It shows how carelessly they have handled a delicate product like this.Coming to monitor:1) I see the bottom bezels are not uniformly aligned to the screen, this was causing heavy screen bleeding from bottom.2) It claims it is an IPS display but it‚Äôs just a cheap LCD. The blacks and dark colours are horribly faded. Details are lost in shadowy parts of scenes.3) It claims to have 178 degrees viewing angle but if you‚Äôre sitting even 45 degrees from the centre the details start to get faded.4) And about speakers I‚Äôm still wondering why they even bothered putting that in the first place. Total wastage.I don‚Äôt know if all the monitors are like this or if I got a lemon. I‚Äôm starting to doubt that this is a refurbished monitor and used a cheap IPS or LCD panel which gives its such a faded look, but the other reviews said that it‚Äôs ok to have that much backlight bleed into their screen, so maybe it‚Äôs the product itself. Anyways I‚Äôm not happy about the product being an IPS display behaves like a 10 year old LCD models.Either ways I‚Äôm returning it never to buy this product again. I‚Äôll rather check the new LG or Samsung models which I hope would give the IPS display of the quality which they claim on their products."
3,"I have worked for fair amount on some really good monitors and this isn't one of them. Only reason I bought this is because of 5 star ratings. Most people who have rated it 5 stars have probably not used a good display before and they got amazed easily after purchasing this. But believe me DO NOT buy this if you have already used a good monitor like Dell or Apple. You can purchase two for dual monitor setups because both have mostly similar colours. Let me tell you why I'm saying this.Pros: Cheap, Sturdy construction, thin bezels, non glossy finish unlike Samsung's or LG's ugly shiny displays. Thats it.Cons: very poor color calibration, in some cases the colours are just worn out and in some cases it gets overexposed,Speakers...they suck 2/10 score,The ports, there should have been at least one display port.Brightness (it is too bright on its default settings, you can keep it that way if you want some more addition to your electricity bill)Saturation, hue options are useless and only makes it look worse.The eye care tech is nothing but a gimmick.I have been using a Dell 21.5 inches monitor for almost 7 years now and even now its a lot better than this Benq one. My Dell monitor has thin borderless bezels, accurate colours, a good display screen and even has the ability to overclock from default 60 hz...I've raised mine to 74hz.Honestly if Dell was selling this monitor right now, I would have purchased it without a second thought. I had to purchase Benq because I needed something cheaper.Instead of the useless speakers and stupid eye care tech, they should have made a better panel with accurate colours and brightness.I am disappointed.Update: After many-many trail and errors and web research, I am somewhat able to adjust the monitor's display to somewhat accurate colours. Still I won't recommend it to people who have already used a good display."
1,"I brought this product thinking the best and I made a great mistake, I picked this over DELL that I repent till now. The first 10 days the product was good after that spotted a small line in the middle of the screen. I have registered a complaint with the team REF: R200301312 and no one bothered to reach me till now. Escalation number 9560055022 was also not reachable. If you want to spend your hard-earned money put in a well-reputed brand."
1,"I ordered the item on 24th June and got delivery on Delivered 30-Jun-2020. Amazon Packing was excellent to avoid any damage to the item. I started using it on 6th July. On 12th day; Friday 17th of July, there was a flicker on the screen which was hardly noticed. On Sunday 19th July afternoon there appeared vertical lines covering 3/4 of the screen from bottom.  Reached Amazon to check what next; as 16 days replacement period after delivery date expired, I was advised to contact BenQ customer service. Sunday being a holiday for BenQ customer care; I opened a complaint with BenQ customer care, hoping to get a resolution.Manufacturing date of the product is April 2020 and product having 39 month warranty from manufacturing date or invoice date which ever is earlier is the only hope to get this one working again. Fingers crossed. I'm not giving any rating as of now; as it is too early to comment either pros and cons of the product. Will write a feedback after the product is fixed and continued usage for a month or so.&&&&&&&&&&&&& experience after monitor replacement.&&&&&&&&&&Replacement item received on 18th August. Using the item till then for 5 days a week almost 9 to 10 hours. It‚Äôs time to rate this product... it‚Äôs a great product and happy with the purchase. No issues with the replacement item at all. Overall I recommend this product if you are looking for a good monitor for daily use."
1,"I purchase this monitor on Oct 21,2020, I could not able to switch on the monitor due to  3 pin power cord(cable) is not able to insert any of my switch box or extension board which is big and not fitting and I contacted the Amazon customer care they said better to buy a power cable or plug separately which is really not expected from the Benq and I felt 16A cable unnecessary here, please consider this point while buying this monitor."
4,"Overall the monitor is great but there're a couple of issues I would like to point out.Being an IPS panel, this monitor suffers from back light glow.  Blacks are not fully black. This is not noticeable if one is working in well lit environment. However, in a dark environment at night it does cause eye strain.The buttons on the monitor are physical push buttons. It would have been great if they were touch buttons. Physical buttons tend to get defective over a period of time."
1,"When the product arrived, it was sealed in a thick box and multiple layers of plastic. But eventually when I got to the sealed tape, I found it had already been broken apart. I decided to test out the monitor instead of returning the opened box and that was the mistake I did. After 10 days, the top half of the screen on the monitor  became dimmer and duller for no reason. There is absolutely nothing great about this monitor to write about."
4,"This monitor has met all the features that I need for it's price. Here is my review for Benq GW2780.The good -- The monitor is well built and beautifully designed with all the matte surface and textured plastic. It looks clean and simple.- I am very happy to find no Backlight Bleed at any part of my monitor which is very prominent among IPS panel based monitors. There is just the ""IPS glow"" which is completely normal for an IPS panel.- The viewing angles are excellent.- The monitor size (27 inches) is big enough for all the entertainment needs.- It has a popular and standard resolution of 1920x1080 (Full HD). I'd say that this resolution for a 27 inch monitor with 81 PPI (Pixels per inch) isn't really that bad, which means it is good enough for text based content and other entertainment.- It has some inbuilt features called the ""Low Blue Light"" mode and ""Brightness Intelligence"", which works great in reducing strain if you work for several hours. Brightness Intelligence feature automatically adjusts the monitor's brightness by sensing the lighting conditions in the room without needing to change the brightness manually.- Many connectivity options including the DisplayPort, two HDMI ports and an audio port.- The pixel response times are really good. You can find no issues in fast paced FPS Games.The bad -- The inbuilt speakers sound really low.- There is some weird bug in the OSD (On-screen Display) menu of the monitor, where changing the Gamma value doesn't change anything in the picture. But, it doesn't really matter because the default Gamma value is the standard anyway.Conclusion - This is a nice, all feature packed PC Monitor for it's price, you will never find in other monitors, at least for now. You can go for it!"
4,"I purchased this monitor for the sole purpose of using it as a vertical monitor. My job requires me to read a lot on my PC, and ever since I started using one a few weeks ago, vertical monitors have become indispensable in my Work From Home setup. This is my second such monitor, the first one been a Dell P2419H, commendably serving my requirements in the office. At home, however, I felt the need for a slightly larger screen; one that can be kept at a distance, so that my study table isn't cluttered. The Dell P2719H was my first consideration. Its asking price, however, far exceeded the budget I had allocated for the purpose. My second option was the HP E273 - again, priced as much as the Dell, so was dropped. The third option was a model by AOC (a brand I didn't know a lot about). It seemed to tick all the boxes, and in fact I even ordered it. And that's when I came across this new Prime Day launch by BenQ. It was going at ‚Çπ17,500, a good ‚Çπ3500 less than the Dell's asking price. So it didn't take me long to convince myself to cancel my AOC order, and opt for this BenQ monitor instead.On its own, this is a good monitor, and one that does its job well. Its when you have the luxury to compare it with another IPS panel, that you notice the shortcomings. Like I said, the IPS panel on the BenQ GW2780T is good, but Dell's panel is better. The build quality is good, but Dell's is superior. The BenQ's speakers are rubbish, and my laptop's internal speakers are way better. No, seriously. The speakers on the BenQ are terrible, and aren't even loud enough to justify their inclusion. The Dell, on the other hand, did not even bother to mount any speakers, for better or worse; instead, Dell comes with a built-in USB hub, which is a far more useful feature to have. It has 2 USB 3.0 ports, and 2 USB 2.0 ports. The slower USB 2.0 ports are useful to plug in your wireless keyboard/mouse dongle, and the the USB 3.0 ports are always useful to have if you wish to leave your portable HDD plugged in (haven't tested their transfer speeds). Hands down I'd opt for Dell's USB hub feature over BenQ's terrible internal speakers. Both Dell and BenQ offer matte finish panels, which are inherently less reflective, unlike the HP E273, I think.EDIT: Please ignore the following paragraph. Turns out I am wrong. But it doesn't affect my final rating for the product.

Lesser backlight bleeding and better colour reproduction are two things that I immediately noticed. Also, the viewing angles are better on the Dell, although both BenQ and Dell house IPS panels. Then again, BenQ's panel is more than sufficient for my requirement, which is to read documents and articles in the vertical position. Both the panels appear to have a similar set of additional features, with one model offering something that the other doesn't, and vice versa.To sum up: but for the significant price difference, I would have opted for the 27"" version of Dell's offering. But that doesn't mean that BenQ's GW2780T is a bad monitor by any means. In fact, on its own, I think its a very capable monitor, and its capabilities match my requirements sufficiently. But if and when you do find the price difference to be negligible, I would suggest you opt for the Dell's offering. You will not go wrong in opting for this BenQ monitor. Its just that Dell is better, and it costs a lot more."
1,"Initially I ordered for 27"" monitor, and I received 24"". Then it got replaced. And then at very 14th day after I got the replaced product, It's main board got damaged and I was unable to connect using HDMI cable. When I complaint to BenQ Head office at Gurgaon, The team is totally incompetent. Their Manager Deepak Khurana is on leave, and his represent member Om Prakash himself says that he cant do anything without Deepak. Let him return from leave. The entire team just play email - email within their own team only, and the customer just watches the show as an Audience. It's almost a week now and I have still not got any result.I would urge every buyer to not buy this product ever as I have lost my 12k in this plus I am on leave for my office for not having monitor. These salary deductions are extra losses for me"
1,"The monitor is indeed good but of substandard build quality. I purchased it in August 2020 for 8k. Till a week back it was working fine and then suddenly when I wake up one morning there is a black line on the screen. I contacted customer support. They registered the call but when the technician visited he said it is damaged and I can't do anything, you better buy a new one as the cost to replace a panel is the same as this monitor (WHAT?). I was keeping the monitor really well and it did not fall at all, had it fallen it would have had some dents, there were zero dents and scratches. In this Oct sale, I purchased the Dell Monitor which should last longer than this BenQ thing. I really thought well of the product after reading the reviews but it indeed turns out of substandard build quality.Poor aftersales support."
5,"First Things First:You need to activate the Eye Care feature in the monitor. It is not ""ON"" by default. I realised it after 3-4 months of usage! :/Replacement under warranty:My initial monitor developed a vertical line after 3 months of usage. No particular reasons for the line. Raised a complain with the BenQ customer care in their prescribed format. They immediately accepted the fault and agreed to replace the monitor under warranty.Got the replacement of the monitor in 4-5 working days. No hassles, no paperwork. Appreciate the quick and professional response.Coming to the monitor:My usage is extensively for work purpose and seldom for watching movies.This monitor meets both my requirement. The Anti-glare feature is particularly impressive. I also work late at night, with the lights switched off. The monitor auto adjusts the display brightness according to the light in the room. However, this feature has to be activated from the menu in the monitor.Overall - Go for it if you are looking to buy for work purpose and little bit of videos/multimedia."
1,"Received unsealed / tampered pieceThe delivery agent has opened the seal to keep the invoice inside the box - yes sounds very stupid to hear to such stories used to cover up.By the way the Amazon invoice was found inside the box justifing the story, the Benq tv production team got a dream that I am gonna purchase through Amazon, so they typed my address etc on an Amazon invoice kept it in the box sealed it partially."
4,"The blue light filters works well and make it comfortable to read for long time... bezel is narrow...only issue I am facing is that when blue filter is enabled in reading mode monitor does not allow to vary brightness or other picture settings...it's prest...without filter enabled settings can be varied. The auto brightness adjust is an added feature, though it works... It does not make much difference to the picture....in addition to providing setting to vary sensitivity they should also have provided gain"
4,"I have purchased this item from Amazon, I have paid Rs.7890/-Pros:1. Design which will attract you first.2. Eye protection display3. Sensor to adjust brightness4. Dual HDMI5. It comes with a small speaker (Don't expect a good one, but within budget this is a good thing)6. Audio Jack if you needed.7. 3 Years warranty8. Cable management deckCons:1. Brightness is saturating when you watch netflix or youtube.2. No HDMI inside package, instead you will received old VGA cable.So basically it is perfect for budget.## If you are a Macbook user and want to use it as external display then go for it.Tested:1. MacBook Air 2015 (Os Catalina) - Working with (Amazon Basics Mini DP cable and Bluerigger)2. MacBook Air 2017 (High Sierra) - Working with ( same above )"
1,"i ordered my first monitor on 7th June and it had problem with the lcd it had a hairline crack near the right bezel of the display, as I saw the crack I immediately placed a replacement order and it came in just two days on 9th June but the replacement had a bigger issue the top bezel wasn't fully glued in so the dust would've sneaked the way into it destroying the display and thank god that I returned it quickly in my amazon return window cause benq customer care sucks I called them emailed them but no one helped me with this issue so I ended up returning it and getting my amount back, Now I've ordered dell P2419H I should've ordered it first hand cause dell has quite the reputation for the quality displays,picture quality is great if you can get a good monitor for them also color accuracy is great too but the light sensing feature is kinda buggy when you switch the color presets,go for this monitor if you have time and you believe in luck cause sure enough my luck wasn't the great with this monitor.i'd say that spend a couple thousand more and go for the dell or any reputed company which is recognized for its customer service.i hope this helps"
5,"**Update*After 2 months of use. got vignette effect on screen. Waiting for Benq Service center to fix it :(1. 27inch FHD IPS display is great to have for work.2. The Vertical monitor setup by rotating the monitor is also a good addition, I wish the screen rotates/changes from portrait to landscape automatically instead of setting the display settings on macbook pro.3. Swivel on 24 inch monitor rotates the neck of the monitor where as on 27 inch the neck doesn't rotate on swivel the monitor base has a movable pad so the entire monitor can be moved but not similar to the GW2480T (24 inch model)4. Cable management is good, I like the thoughtful ness went into the monitor handle on back, very handy one if you want to move monitor.5. Brighness intelligence with EyeCare features are great additions."
4,"Update:Bought it after some time and this unit seems to be defect free. Although its only 1 day, will test it for few more days but overall value for money device.I bought this one after a long research over Dell P2419H. The vertical mode is really useful for long document reading with less scrolls. Stand is really nice and build quality is good. It does not shake even at max height.Brightness and colors looked natural. Although I received a defective piece and in right 25% portion there was bluish tint. It is panel defect and can not be fixed. I returned on same day and now waiting for some time. because i believe if I order again they will send me one from same batch which can be faulty again."
1,"I purchased this monitor 6 months before, and now I am starting to see eye visible (70%) of the screen with yellow light bleed. I logged a complaint for replace and they just gave back the same monitor saying all is OK. I then logged another complaint, and called the company managing the support services, the person was not helpful just stubbon saying this is not a problem until the complete screen is dead. Absolutely useless BenQ support. It is not about photography monitor, its a simple IPS screen issue, I have used IPS monitors all my life and I know about light bleed. I have now given an order for Dell ultrasharp 24inch which has great warranty support stating ""Even if a single pixel is brighter we will replace the complete screen"". And hence I will always recommend buying dell monitors, please!!. I tried to find the receipts of Benq support, but I probabibly thown them into trash long ago."

5,First of all this is my very first product from Benq.I am not that much aware of this company. I am very much confused before buying this product anyway after continous search on Internet I made a list for the 27 inch monitors to be purchased. Almost all leading brands monitors are above 18000 rupees however I got this product below 15000 rupees. The performance of the product is awesome. I bought this monitor for reading purpose especially for the PDF reading in a very big screen. This screen serves the purpose with reduced glare and good clarity. Those who want to purchase a big screen with reduced price with good performance and good clarity you can buy this benq 27 inch monitor.
1,"Not that great,, because contrast is not that great ... Cause lots of eye strain !!! Full hd quality is not up to mark ... ... It's not smooth ..."
2,"I was really looking forward to use this monitor as it sounded perfect for each of my needs of work, leisure, gaming and large display*QHD resolution*IPS display*HDR""AMD Freesync*75Hz refresh rate and*32"" screen sizeTrusting LG and Amazon I ordered it on the day of launch only to be disappointed by the poor build quality(See images)Uneven panel gapsUnreasonably high screen(IPS) bleedingOne of the other reasons I opted for this monitor was the support of a feature called Dual Controller where one can control 2 machines with one set of keyboard and mouse basically magic! Sadly found out that a necessary part of using this feature called Picture by picture is not supported rendering the 'Dual controller' useless. Also dosent work with VPN connection which many of us need on work PCs"
5,"I bought this monitor a while back and here's my experience:The Good:1) Has IPS panel thus has excellent viewing angles.2) Anti glare coating3) Height , tilt and z-axis rotation4) Plenty of pre-configured picture modes5) Gaming mode with black stabilizer6) Multiple inputs7) Easy to use joystick controlThe bad:1) No y axis rotation.2) HDR is not that great, still looks premature and may wash out the colours a bit.3) No build in speakers.4) Very heavy"
5,"Iam quite happy with the performance of the monitor. LG 27UK650 4k IPS.I had bought a benq 32"" 4k VA monitor at 39k, but returned it due to poor performance. There was also a grey display bleed on it. The colour reproduction on it was not accurate, especially red. It was also too big for my eyes and got strain after using it. Remember that Pixel density matters and viewing distance. Decide for yourself on that.LG monitor with IPS panel is much better. Iam using it with macbookpro 15"" and didn't go for LG 27UK850 (43k price) as the only benefit in that is a usb-c port (and additional usb 3.0 ports often unused) with reverse charging. But if you use a single usb-c to HDMI port (good quality with 60hz at 3k price) it also works in the same way but no charging happens. And it is always good to use the original company charger for laptop for longer battery life than using low 60watts of reverse power in the case of LGUK850. Hence LGUK650 (33k price) was apt for me as I use an additional 2.1 speakers (better than ibuilt speakers), taking audio out from the monitor. The menu and the joystick is very intuitive and also easy for volume control. I also noted that audio switching in usb-c to usb-c sometimes doesn't work automatically (in benq) in utube.Colour reproduction in this LGUK650 is superb and is at par with my macbookpro. Good contrast ratio. Sleek design and white back makes it even stunning especially for my led light bounced on the wall. Stand is also sturdy as I use a height adjustable table. I haven't figured out how to run the mac in clamshell mode without connecting power cable to laptop. Probably it doesn't work.Go for LGUK850 only if you really need usb-c at that price point."
1,"Received the monitor today and I'm very impressed with the bright display and crisp colors, the text is sharp and clear, the color calibration is good out of the box.The build quality is also good.Unfortunately, I got a defective panel which has severe backlight bleed issue, I could have accepted it if the backlight bleeding was equal from all corners, but it is worst on the right side and affecting the color uniformity, as you can see in the attached white image, it has a red tone on the left side and blue tone on the right side, it is more visible in real.I'm giving 3 stars due to the mentioned issue and going to request a replacement, I'll update the review and give 5 stars if I get a good panel.If I get a defective panel again, I'll reduce it to 1 star.*Update after replacement-I have received the replacement, and surprisingly it has the same problem! I can accept the backlight bleed or IPS glow, but can't accept severe color variation on the screen, you can see the color variation in the attached image, color tones on the right side and left side are totally different, is this acceptable? Going to return it and I won't purchase any monitor from Amazon from now on."
1,Looking at the specs I ordered without any second thought. The first monitor had huge IPS glow. Thinking a defective piece requested for replacement. The second one had IPS glow and huge backlight bleeding. The stand material looks so cheap. I did not expect this from LG. I think they are selling defective products via Amazon.
3,"I've bought this for my Xbox One X.If you have premium console like Xbox one X and Ps4 Pro then go for it. For PC gaming 4K resolution is too much even for my GTX 970 card. If you want to buy this monitor other than gaming, its not true HDR even itsupports HDR10. Don't use HDR Effect feature for SDR content it looks ridiculous.After one year of usage corners are turning to red after watching for 3 hours then back to normal only after turning it off for 1 hour."
4,"Let me start by saying this first: This is a good SDR monitor which is decent for HDR usage - It is not great.I not going to waste time one reviewing the trivial stuff such as ergonomics and style - you can get that from anywhere on the web. I am going to focus on performance and colour reproductionSDR performance----------------This monitor has a really good SDR performance. It has good colour gamut and brightness and decent contrast ratio (1200:1 native). Colour really pop and it comes packed with several colour profiles. In my experience the most accurate - not the most good looking - profile is the SMPTE-C profile. However I switched to the 'Custom' profile and manually adjusted the other parameters like: colour temperature, rgb levels... and got a better result that has delta Es under 0.68.The panel has pretty good gray uniformity, but the black uniformity is not that impressive; but, it is not a deal breaker, and you have to expect it from any consumer grade IPS panel.HDR performance----------------The monitor does suppoer HDR signals on both HDMI and Display Ports. It is not a true 10 bit panel; it uses 8 bit panel with FRC. This is pretty common now a days while HDR is still in its infancy. The thing is you wouldn't notice much of difference between true 10 bit and 8 bit+FRC for consumer applications. A true 10 bit panel only makes a difference for true professionals such as Colour graders, those in the photography industry, and movie industry who generate HDR content. If you only want consume HDR games and movies 8 bit+FRC should not be a concern; in fact, there are other more important considerations such as: brightness, contrast levels and black levels.The peak brightness of this monitor is only 450 nits, while HDR specification requires at least 1000 nits. This is where it gets tricky. The HDR specification was originally developed with TVs in mind; they were not meant for PC monitors which sits much closer to your eyes. For PC monitor 1000nits brightness if unnecessary; such brightness levels could damage  your eyes. This is why VESA came up with the DisplayHDR specifications that are meant for PC monitors. This new spec has 3 levels DisplayHDR 400, 600 and 1000 - the number indicating the target brightness level. So this monitor KIND OF meets the entry level DisplayHDR 400. I says kind of because while it meets the brightness level requirement, it does not meet other criteria listed in the specification - so this is not a DisplayHDR certified monitor.Contrast levels should be around 10,000:1 for good HDR performance. This is required for showing details within dark areas; a lower contrast will result in the dark areas being too dark or grayish hiding away the details in them. Sadly, this monitor does not even come close to 10,000:1. The monitor only has 1200:1 contrast ratio. This is expected from IPS panels. VA panels on the other hand offers better contrast ratios and hence better rendering of black and dark scenes - but they suffer from bad viewing angles and does not provide great colour accuracy.The black levels on this monitor is also not that great. In a dark room, blacks appear dark grey. It is not much of a problem in a moderately lit room. This is due to the lack of local dimming. There are IPS monitors with local dimming, but they are insanely expensive.So the HDR performance is just decent. The main reasons by it fails to provide a great HDR experience are the lack of local dimming and average constrast ratio.That being said, let me remind you one thing: HDR on PC monitors is in a messy state. I have not found any monitor that meets all the HDR criteria yet. Some new panels are expected to come out by mid-2020 that could improve this. But at the moment there is no point in wasting a lot of money for better HDR performance as the gains don't justify the price.Gaming performance------------------Very good monitor for gaming; at 5ms the response times are really great for casual and semi-pro gamers. The only serious limitation is the 60Hz max FPS. But then again, running modern games at 4K at even 60Hz would require a beast of a PC; so, I wouldn't worry about that for now.If you are a professional gamer or mostly play fast paced games like CS, you should look elsewhere; this is not the monitor for you.Multi-media performance-----------------------This is a really great monitor for watching moives and streaming live sports coverage. The colours look really impressive and as long as you are not sitting in a really dark room, the black levels are also decent.Even though the monitor is limited in its HDR rendering capabilities, it does manage to make a significant difference. I have watched several 4K HDR Hollywood movies and they looked amazing. I have found that sitting in a slightly lit room gives you the best experience with this monitor.General usage performance-------------------------Becasue of the high pixel density of this monitor everything is crisp and clear. You will notice no aliasing with text. In Windows a scaling factor of 150% is required to make texts readable.Usual Issues with IPS-------------------------Backlight bleeding: Backlight bleeding is when the LED backlight steals its way through the panel into the foreground. This usually manifests as a whiter or yellow tint around the edges. Sadly almost every IPS panel has this problem. And the panel I got hs this issues, although not very serious. I can see a tint of yellow in places along the bottom border. This appears to be caused by the bezel pushing a bit too much into the panel; indicating a manufacturing oversight. However this only becomes visible when brightness is increased above 50. However when in HDR mode, the monitor switches to high brightness and this bleed becomes noticeable, especially when the scene is dark. If the content you are viewing - games or movies - is not too dark or black it is not an issues. But when you are watching  movie with top and bottom black bars, this yellow tint is a bit annoying.One thing to remember here is when it comes to IPS there is a thing called panel lottery: no two panels are the same, it will depend of your luck; you may end up with a really good or a bad one or something in the middle.IPS Glow: This monitor does have IPS glow as does any other IPS panel. Unless you are in really dark room and watching dark content at an angle, this wouldn't be a problemCheck the attached image: The whitish overlay is IPS glow. The yellow tint inside the red circle is Backlight bleed. NOTE: IPS glow and bleed always look exaggerated when photographed. It is not that profound when watched in person.Usual Questions Regarding HDR:1. Does this monitor support 4K HDR @ 60Hz over HDMI?Yes, it does. The HDMI ports on this monitor are HDMI 2.0 and supports HDR meta data. One thing to remember is to enable ULTRA HD Deep Color from the monitor settings for the HDMI port you are using.2. Does this monitor support 4K HDR @ 60Hz over Display Port?Again, yes. Now this is something a lot of people seem to be confused about. LG data sheet says that the monitor has DisplayPort v1.2. Now the version 1.2 originally did not have any specification for HDR meta data; this was added only in Display Port 1.4. Now the thing is there are no Display Port 1.2 or Display Port 1.4 devices. These numbers - 1.2, 1.4 - are just versions of Display Port specification document. So a manufacturer could implement a device with a Display Port and implement some features from v1.2 and some from v1.4. This is what LG has done. They have implemented support for HDR metadata into this monitor. So if you connect this monitor to the display port of a source device  (Console, PC ...) that also has implemented the HDR metadata support, it will accept 4K HDR signal at 60Hz. At the moment, GTX 10XX and newer cards support this. GTX 9 series does not have support for HDR meta data.3. How to enable HDR on the monitor?There is nothing to enable. When the monitor receives and HDR signal, it will automatically switch to HDR mode4. How to enable HDR on Windows 10?To use HDR on Windows, you have to first enable it. To do that go to Display Settings - you'll see a toggle there that says 'Play HDR Games and apps'. Just enabled it. Note that this will result in everything else in Windows will look washed out. This is normal and is a known problem when Windows tries to map SDR content to HDR colour space. Unfortunately there is no way around it. Hopefully Microsoft will come up with some solution.Alternatives:From my research, there is only one alternative around this price range:Benq EW3270U - This is a VA panel and provides much deeper blacks and contrast ratio. But it has very limited brightness and viewing angles.Summary:A very good monitor for the price asked. Does support HDR at 4K 60Hz. Has common IPS issues like IPS Glow and Backlight bleeding - but nothing too serious. Very good SDR colour gamut. HDR performance is limited due to average contrast and brightness levels. Great viewing angles and pixel density."
5,"Resolution is excellent, I use it as a secondary screen with my retina display MacBook pro and it puts the retina 15"" display to shame.I also use this as  my PS4 Pro monitor and the graphics are crisp and sharp at 60 Hz. Still waiting for games that can deliver true 4k and HDR.Price is high but compared to buying it in North America and lugging it all the way to India, the price is just right.Cons: I wish it had two display ports so that I could run both Gaming console and Computer on Display Port.10/10 in my books"
1,"It seems I've got a bad piece. There is backlight leakage from four different areas around the edges (see the attached image). At first, I tried to ignore it, but after watching 3-4 hours of Netflix, I noticed that light leakage was causing significant obfuscation of visuals in the affected areas. I have now requested a replacement and am hoping I'll get a substitute that is free of any defects. Will post an update about it. Other than light leakage, I am overall borderline satisfied with this piece. üòê**UPDATE (10.10.2019)**The replacement arrived this morning. And with it, frustration and apprehension. I received a defective piece originally, which got replaced by an even more defective piece üò° ü§¨. My mind just cannot grasp how it is possible for LG's Quality Control engineers to miss such defects during the testing phase, unless of course they deliberately ignored these faults. Please take a look at the attached images. The one marked ""Monitor No. 2"" is what I received in replacement. Even a 5-year old can take one look and tell that something's not right with the panel.I wonder if these big MNCs have completely abandoned all Quality Control checks from their operations. And it's not just me complaining; take a look at other monitor reviews on the internet, of not just this brand and model, but others too. Thousands of independent evaluators and users are reporting issues like severe backlight leakage, poor color reproduction, discoloration, and what not. Even Dell, the undisputed king of computer monitors a decade ago, is these days receiving flak from users for poor quality products. Shame on LG, Samsung, Asus, Acer, Dell, and all other manufacturers for selling defective products to unsuspecting customers. While we customers struggle with returns and refunds, they get to sit on their laurels and count our hard-earned money. Not fair. Poor quality control practices are a LOSE-LOSE prospect for everyone. The CUSTOMER loses his faith. The SELLER loses his business. MANUFACTURER loses customers' trust and profits. So, why do it?What now? For starters, I am not going to buy LG monitors anymore. Two failed products in a row is my threshold limit. I have neither patience nor money to waste on LG's junk anymore. I am also now totally apprehensive of buying any expensive products at Amazon because I am scared of putting myself through this tedious and uncertain process of returning/replacement/refund again. What if Amazon refuses to replace or return a defective product in future on some technicality in its policy? I'm starting to see disconcerting risk in it now. After many years, I am forced to reminisce the good old days when one could walk into a store; see a thing for what it is, touch it, feel it, use it; and if satisfied, order one for the household. In an email, I have appealed to Amazon to disclose return rates and/or other relevant data on product pages to enable customers to make informed decisions. This can also shame errant manufacturers into tightening their Quality Control checks. I hope Amazon's management will initiate positive and effective action in customers' interest.I have requested for a return of this defective monitor. As and when the process is completed and I have received my funds, I will post a final update. Until then, üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è."
5,"I have been splitting hair between 34 inch and 32 inch display. Having already used 32 inch monitor previously it was difficult for me to consider 27 inch. Interestingly there are way more options in 27 inch range. If you want IPS 4k panel, you will need 65k+ budget. In 34, if you go to 2k res it is again 68+k. I could see pixels in 32 inch full hd previously. Hence my criteria was 2k minimum with IPS. Frankly this was the only monitor that fits this criteria within budget. I am happy to report that with 2k res, everything is crisp. I love this ips panel, no light bleeding for me. Love the colors as well. You should know that this monitor runs at 60 H at 2K res and 75hz monitor at Full HD. This is NOT a 10 bit panel in case you were wondering. This is 8 bit panel and probably FRC to match 99% SRGB space. The monitor display is matt finish minimizing the reflection. The stand is sturdy and very well made. I did not like the HDR mode and prefer the standard mode. I bought this monitor for 25499 Rs. In USA this model is sold for much less(250 USD, 18000 INR). But that is the exact case for almost all monitor and electronic items. The monitor brightness is pretty good and i am running it at 77%. I like the dual controller where i can use the keyboard and mouse of pc1(hdmi1)to pc2(hdmi2). The box includes one hdmi and one display cable. The box delivered cleanly without any damage at all. The borders are really slim and that makes this monitor look beautiful. The matt screen floats front and the borders are inside the screen which looks so good. I have run the dead pixel and light bleeding test and happy to report my panel is flawless. I will use it for my office work and photo editing for which this monitor will be perfect. Remember 4k is going to be hard on your graphics card and 4k ips panels are crazy costly. So glad i got this finally. And if you are thinking about 34 inch dilemma like me do ask yourself is Full HD 34 ips or 2k 32 ips as they are similar budget. Attaching pictures to help you decide. Other reviews had not been helpful for me so i was in a doubt. I decided to make this review to help others like me. Get ready to spoil yourself. One thing i must note that when i connected external speakers via the headphone jack on the monitor the speakers were not very loud even at 100 percent, so i connected the speakers from the headphone jack from my laptop directly. One other thing is that the ports on the back is little flimsy as if you too much pressure to connect the HDMI, the entire port board seems to go inside, so just connect carefully."
1,"Quality is average,  dosent look like 10 bit hdr sceen. Blacks are not true black. ,the price is drop by 3k after Amazon August sale, this is frustrating and seller is clearly deceptive."
1,"After using one year:The monitor developed blind spots on all corners and the colors faded away. Many people reported this issue but I thought it was one of such issue. But not the case, this monitor not worth buying. Save your money on some other good one like Samsungs. Don't waster your money one this.Following is my initial review after purchase:This is the best monitor I have used so far. I was using Dell 24 inch full HD monitor and I want to upgrade to UHD just for the added real estate for my development environment. Here are some points I noted so far.- The monitor works only at 30 fps with HDMI 1.4 output on UHD. 30 fps means lots of blurryness and flickering. So if you need 60 fps output, make sure your system supports HDMI 2.0 or have displayport available.- If you are using Intel NUC, you may want to purchase mini-DP to DP conversion cable as NUC have only mini displayport.- The monitor comes with DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable & HDMI cable in the package.- The monitor can be tilted and height adjusted which is very convenient- HDR mode is just awesome, the colors popup and sharp- Since the edges are very narrow (near bezel-less), the size of monitor is same as my old 24 inch monitorSo overall, it is very good monitor and recommended for everyone."
5,"Bought monitor during non-sale time. Govt reduced gst for monitors. So price of the monitor gone down abit. I bought it for 34k and 1.5k cash back and zero cost 6 month EMI.Coming to the monitor, i always prefer LG monitors with IPS panel. My previous monitor was a LG IPS 24 inch monitor, which served me more than 3 years without any problems. Picture quality of this 4k panel is so good. 28 inch is perfect size for gaming. Played alots of 4k games with xbox one X, including RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2, witcher 3 etc. Colors pops up. Even though the peak brightness of the monitor is 450nits, colors pops with all HDR enabled games. Played horizon zero dawn PS4 god of war and so many PS4 games with HDR, and I am not going back playing SDR games. God of war looks phenomenal even with base PS4 with HDR enabled. If you are a console gamer like me who doesn't prefer TV, GET THIS MONITOR. Worth every rupee.There is small amount of bleeding in this monitor. Not noticeable generally.Overall, i am totally satisfied with this monitor."
3,Gr8 picture quality but too much of backlight bleeding in my monitor. Thought of getting replaced with new one but only refund is available. Loosing my offers now
4,"Packaging was good. Delivery was quick. Make sure you buy from Appario Business seller on Amazon.It was a surprisingly light weight box.My First Glance Review :1. I don‚Äôt think the panel supports HDR as Windows 10 refused to detect any HDR capabilities. HDR is listed only under effects as a kind of ‚Äúcolour filter‚Äù in the settings hence, HDR is not massively supported. This means, Netflix might not detect HDR capability in the display.2. Brightness is very good indoors and even 60-70% is more than enough. The display also has an anti glare coating (nowhere mentioned) which makes it worth every penny in a studio environment where I have a window at the back and flood lights everywhere.3. It‚Äôs a 75Hz panel that supports FreeSync1. Don‚Äôt expect smooth gaming but it is more than capable for office work, YouTube, emails, texts, media, etc.4. You‚Äôll love the real estate of the screen. It‚Äôs huge and Windows10 does a great job at scaling.Tip- Download LG‚Äôs OnScreen app to toggle modes on the fly.5. The all-in-one single button can feel a bit flimsy to use but it‚Äôs a nice implementation.6. The plastic body feels a bit cheap and scratchy however the brilliant display makes up for it.Overall, not amazing for gaming or for consuming HDR content but good for everything else.I‚Äôll update my review in a month to see if something changes."
5,"12 days review:Pros:* You get real QHD (2560√ó1440) resolution* Brightness is too good. Photo and video is shot at 5% brightness.* Good refresh rate. Videos at 60Hz runs smoothly.* Installation is super easy* Overall looks cool on my table* Video editing, web designing is a breeze with this IPS panel screen* 3 years of warrantyCons:* Doesn't have an inbuilt speaker. (Not a deal breaker)Haven't tested gaming yet, will update on AMD freesync and refresh rate once i run some games on this display."
4,"The monitor is really good and even the IPS glow/bleeding is minimal but I'm using it with a Macbook Pro M1 and the text is really blurry. I think that MacOS is not really detecting the OS, as it shows it as a 31.5 monitor, while its actually 27.Even the Onscreen Control app doesn't detect it. I'm waiting for an update from LG or from Apple.For now if you wish to use it with Mac OS, avoid it or look for a 4K monitor.Update:So I was able to update the LG onscreen control app. The laptop now works fine in full native resolution of 2560x1440 but there is not way to scale UI to 125%, so every thing is really small. Its something that Windows supports but MacOS only supports 200% scaling and that too on 4K displays.You can use SwitchResX to create a custom 1080p HiDpi resolution but it doesn‚Äôt work on new M1 macbooks, as of now 03-Feb 2021.Tried both display port and hdmi methods. No luck."
1,The LG 27UK650 Constantly flickers while watching Youtube and on XBOX ONE X...Appario Retail Private Ltd- Going to return it. Kindly replace this defective Monitor
5,"I researched a lot of monitors and narrowed to this and 32 inch from Lenovo. Both are quad HD. But this is way better - mainly with brightness and modes. Mine did not have any light bleeding or dead pixels - Luckily no issues.I went with Quad HD not only since 4k is costly, but you will need a Display Port to get higher than 60 Hz on 4k. My laptop only has HDMI. also having Quad HD is better than Full HD for my photo editing.Tips for work mode - I use with Reader mode and my eyes doesn't strain after few hours, like it used to do with my previous 24 inch. If you want really crisp text, set the resolution to Quad HD and then set the scaling to 200%. This way you can still work from 5/6 feet away and see clear text.Movies and videos are really vivid. Try some wildlife or sea related videos, you will really see the colors. I haven't tried gaming on this yet. But tried to set at 75 Hz and it is good.There are no individual buttons, but a single joystick like button to manage the settings. There is also OnScreen control software which you can download from LG website (there is nothing for this model, but you can install the software listed for some other model - it still works). For Windows OS, this is better than using joystick.With windows I found no issues. With linux usage, I found some screen tearing with intel drivers on Quad HD resolution (I'm still researching how to fix this)."
5,"I bought this monitor for 21.5k during lightning deal. Picture Quality is amazing. I use this monitor for 60% coding, 20% YouTube/Netflix, 20% Gaming. Overall very satisfied.Few good to have features that is missing:1. no height adjustment. So, you cannot keep your laptop in front of it and work.2. no usb C port. Need to buy Usb c to hdmi adapter for macbook.3. No inbuilt speakers. I connected my external speakers to TV using 3.5mm jack."
4,"Great Monitor...got this at 22999/- on great indian festival .... Using it for couple of days...First Impression : Wow , just wow... no edge bleed no dead pixel nothing everything is perfect... ips glow is balanced... HDR option is great but at 22k price what i got i am happy with it... bcs HDR is a pricy aspect... but you will be happy with it...Picture Quality: Is top notch... true ips panel with excellent viewing angle and color production ... true gem i can say...Display port cable and hdmi cable will be provided with the container .... so no need to worry.... just buy it without any second thought...  and yeah you can enable gsync with it... it has freesync version 2... so you can enable it with gsync via nvidia control panel...So Happy Puja... and stay safe and enjoy with your family and if you are a single like me then just enjoy by yourself üòâ..."
1,"Update Dec 2020:- After replacing display panel 3 times in just 2 months. LG replaced the unit in OCT 2020. Since then it is working fine. I will update review again if I face any issue. Also warranty is for 3 years not 1 Year which I assumed earlier.I have used Samsung, Dell and HP monitor in last 15 years. This LG monitor is worst. Cheap quality plastic has been used. Now the real issue. I have purchased the monitor in Sept 2019. After 2 months (Dec 2019). it started to show black line on right side. Since it was under warranty, Screen panel was replaced by LG.In March 2020, At the time when India (most of the world) is under lock down and we need to work from home. This LG Monitor stated to show red color in all four corners. As day starts it screen looks normal and as day progress red color started to spread and become darker. It is still in warranty so I will get it repair when lock down will be taken off.I didn't except 2 big issues in just 6 months of usage. I will push hard to refund or replace the whole monitor not the just part in it.Now my bigger concern is what will happen after 6 months when warranty will end. I think repair cost will be huge.PLEASE DONT BUY IT. EVEN YOUR ARE GETTING IT CHEAP UNDER ANY SALES & OFFERS."
5,"Bought this monitor on prime day sale and it's working flawlessly. Ppl who are saying it doesn't have HDR10 just bcz of 350 nits brightness they should get some hardware knowledge and can check this monitor specifications on LG website too. It's not a typical TN panel with 1000 nits brightness lol.So far it's working good , display and colour quality is gorgeous  , software is easy to use , multiple modes to suite your needs and many more."
5,"My unit has one dead pixel in the lower right corner when new.The stand is absolute rubbish. The monitor is always shaking, even while (for example) typing on a keyboard in close proximity.The panel itself (my sample at least) had minimal IPS glow and close to zero backlight bleeding. This was the major consideration to not return the monitor as there was never any guarantee that a replacement would not present those other issues.The colours are excellent and you get three- and six-colour adjustments which help get a more accurate presentation. The pixel pitch is just right for slightly older eyes - not so small as to make text hard to read, and individual pixels are just about indistinguishable at a couple of feet.The 75Hz limit is problematic for those looking for high-refresh panels, but this has no aspirations to gaming anyway, so it's a compromise. ARGB support is really the only thing that makes this uncompetitive with my Dell U3017, the colours are slightly off even with a wide-ish gamut. But that cost three times as much, so it's not a fair comparison."
2,"This was my first LG monitor(probably the last as well) and the first thing i noticed out of the box was the display was not calibrated as can be seen on the features page. So, took a while for me to set it up and trust me it was not easy. So, overall it was tedious process.The comes the backlight bleed test which was so uneven when seen from different angles. Primarily, the right half of the screen looked off which i assumed for IPS glow but then did some research, compared it side by side to some other IPS monitors only to find out this cannot be entirely IPS glow. This was a mix of IPS glow, backlight bleed and poor panel assembly. Hence, had to return it which was hassle free thanks to Amazon.The replacement was delivered the next day, and that was a complete disaster!! it was a used product with power on time of 37 hrs along with the issues listed above amplified which was quite obvious considering it was a used one. So, this is the first time facing this issue with the seller as its a reputed one and have previously purchased lot of products from this seller which were clean. So, not really sure what went wrong this time.So, coming to this product would say the build is good however the quality control by LG should have been much better. Would not discourage to go for it as all panels are not equally made so you never know you might get a good piece."
5,"Bought this for 27,000 Rs. The Monitor is an effective option at this price range for 32 inches as Acer is the only other manufacturer that decently prices monitors in India. Prior to this I had a 32"" Full HD Acer Monitor which was average. This monitor has a nice matte coating and its color reproduction is the best I've seen in an LG. No issues with PWM on low brightness. The viewing angles are good. There is no back light bleed on my unit or any dead pixels. Consider the speakers to be non-existent.The unit is very easy to setup after removing the packaging. Takes about three minutes to set it up. If your priority isn't FPS gaming or Art Editing, this monitor is probably the best 32"" choice you have in India as those two setups would anyway cost you more than a lakh. QHD is also a perfect resolution in this size for casual use such as office work, entertainment and gaming. 4K would be overkill and too graphic card and memory intensive at this point. The jump from 60 to 75 Hz is noticeably better though I didn't expect any change. As a film producer, I've seen and used a lot of professional equipment and know that this is a good purchase. Will give a 4.4/5"
5,"It works flawlessly with my PS4 pro with resolution set to max and HDR turned on without any hiccups. It has two HDMI Ports HDMI 1 & HDMI 2 you can easily connect PC in one port and console on other port and switch between them by pressing provided button going to input. It also have different kinds of display presets for gaming like FPS 1, FPS 2 and few other modes. You can customize as per your liking in the custom mode. It has audio jack just above DC adapter connection behind the panel. Through which you can connect your headphones/speakers without even needing the audio jack in the PC. Display is IPS, Res- 4K and supports HDR10, display latency- 5ms. So if you have a gaming PC or consoles like XBOX One X or PS4 PRO then this monitor would be your choice in this price segment."
5,"Using this for programming, video & photo editing.Very good colors, excellent balance of cost and quality for a 4K UHD computer monitor."
1,"Worst thing about this monitor is price bought it on prime day sale for 26k and current price is 24k....About screen - great viewing angles, good color reproduction... Its not true HDR, not meant for gaming... Bing problem is even FULLHD videos will not look great in this screen you need minimum 2k video.... For that u need good internet connection.... Love sports doesn't look best trust me even though I've 100mbps connection.... So consider these before buying"
5,"Let me begin saying that I use this 4K monitor as an external display for my 2018 MBP. The colors and contrast are just impeccable. I'm an engineer and a photographer by trade so I LOVE to see proper color reproduction and at the same clean, crisp, anti-aliased text when I am coding.The packaging on this is beautifully done! The product came in good shape and I haven't had any issues like other's complain. I'm sorry it has happened to you. Electronic items like these are a throw of dice sometimes.Anyhoo, right out the box the contrast, brightness and gamma didn't look that great so I tweaked the settings according to the lighting in my room to fit the bill. TIP: I try to match the display quality with my MBP's retina display to get that consistency. You could also go deeper into the color config of the monitor RGB's HS (hue and saturation) sliders if you want to ""fine tune"". If you are using this for your MacBook, please make sure you calibrate the display and create a profile for it (under System Preferences>Displays>Color).Cable management is neatly done behind the display panel I love how wireless my desk looks!Picture quality is rock solid. And for the price (~31-32k) it think it an amazing value for money. Also, if you guys are using MacBook Pro with this display, please buy a cable good enough to give you 60Hz frame rate on the Display Port (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07BBHCPXH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)"
1,"1. All HDR display flavours won't work except HDR effect, will not use vivid option in on screen support software from LG site2. When attached to type-c 4k 60htz the HDR video will stuck for fraction of second intermittently3. While using as a duan monitor with Lenovo yoga s740 or 750, the apps will crash with her enabled and with max resolution and dpi set to around 125%. I am sure about this testing because when I used 27UL500 on same laptops everything was stable.4. When split more is enabled for 4 windows then apps will flicker frequently.5. Using MS Teams for video or audio call in monitor screen will crash the application when it works fine on laptop main display itself and also work fine with LG 27UL500 model so offcourse it's ab issue with this monitor and it's compatibility with Lenovo yoga s740 4k ips laptop."
4,"I'm using this with a Ryzen 3700x and Geforce RTX 2070.Pros- Decent sharpness as you expect from LG- Stylish stand, thin bezels. Good for multi monitor setup- Color calibration is good for Photo/Video editing.- VESA mount compatible- Works with LG display software. Saves unnecessary button clicks.- Comes with both Display and HDMI cables.- Minimal branding. Great for aesthetics.- Audio outCons- Brightness issue. I have another 27inch LG27GL650F FHD monitor side by side and the brightness is lower compared to that. I had to spend a lot of time calibrating and trying out different profiles to reach an acceptable level of brightness. Problem seems to be in the firmware rather than the display itself.- Takes a lot of time to calibrate. Specially if you are connecting through HDMI, the brightness seems washed out.- Overpriced in India. Should not be more than 30-31K.- No G-Sync. Not suitable for competitive gaming if you have an Nvidia Card.- In FHD mode (125% zoom), icons gets pixelated. No super sampling.- Viewing angle is not that great this being an IPS panel. Expected better from LG.If you are looking for a 4K for media consumption, light gaming and decent Photo/Video editing, go for it. For anything more than that, you might want to go for a Samsung display."
2,"Best budget 4k @60Hz display for gaming(4k alert, RTX2080TI recommended), moderate lvl creativity(99% sRGB only) and HDR(entry level, but still very bright +350 nits, eyes strain alert). I was really doubtful about Indian stock quality after reading so many negative reviews. But I received a perfect screen with no back light bleed(as it should be). Although IPS glow(which is normal for IPS panels) is there and you might notice that in a dark room with a dark scene/image. But definitely not a deal breaker considering the selling price.Update: Display showing image retention issue. See pics. Selling lower quality monitors in India."
5,"I bought this monitor in sale in Nov/Dec 2019.It's refresh rate is advertised 60Hz but with it's cable provided and extra cables I had, it doesn't seem to work.After seeing review, I tried different cables,  USB type C hub etc etc.. but it didn't work as I expected and as it is advertised.What I tried:1. A dozen HDMI cable. USB Type C Hub.2. Provided HDMI and DP cable.Result:  Refresh rate at 30Hz with No HDR.  (See attached pictures).Expectation: Refresh Rate at 60 Hz with HDR as advertised here at Amazon or site.Advise: Avoid this  purchase if you are expecting 60 Hz and HDR as features on 4k.Oct 5, 2020: Sorry for creating confusion. My sincere apolise for above comments.1. It does support HDR and refresh rate 60Hz.My laptop supported HDMI 1.4 that's why it was not working. Buying a usb c to HDMI cable worked perfectly."
4,"This monitor works perfectly for office work and very light casual gaming.even if you are a moderate, it becomes extremely difficult to connect the monitor to your your PC as many PCs have different display ports like the mini display port, type c and HDMI. It is very difficult in India to find a reliable 4K converters for that matter even 4K cables. HDR in this monitor does not work that great so if you are looking for HDR effect then you will be hundred percent disappointed. The response rate of the monitor is fine.one more throwback for this monitor is that it does not get recognised as plug and play you have to manually download the software from LG website. I am using the latest version of windows 10 operating system but even then there is no plug and play."
2,"- The resolution is good but compatibility with various devices like firestick or even computers is not quite good. Cannot make the full use of the resolution.- Colors are not accurate straight out of the box. It is very hard to set it.- Menu/Software is not quite good to make the best use of the resolution. No manuals provided.- Headphone jack is of very cheap quality. Audio out of it is CRAPPY. There is also a small delay noticed.- Made of cheap plastic.- For watching TV, even 10K worth of TV would do much better.- Adaptive Response time is not quite good. Not smooth most of the time.- NO RETURN is so ridiculous. Forcing to keep a inferior quality product.- LG customer care of not quite prompt and does not sound knowledgeable."
5,"Best monitor you can buy in this price range. I wanted a QHD monitor since 4k is limited on content and need proper GPU to run smooth ( issue with office laptops). This monitor has excellent colors, contrast, viewing angles and ports. I got it for 25k and run great on 75Hz at 2k.HDR playback is also very good( tested on youtube), people saying you need 1000 nits for proper HDR need to check again since HDR has different standards. A reputed company like LG won't say its HDR without proper certification."
1,"Pathetic Seller he sold a defective piece and i had run behind LG for  getting it fixed. As per LG they will replace only with in 1 month of purchase and amazon also has the same policy so finally after repairing it, again with in 1 year of repair same issue resurfaces. now again i have to run behind LG. its been an year and not even a single apology or any concern from the seller. Always the same one liner we cant do anything its passed the replacement window from Amazon."
2,"The monitor is good if there are lots of bright stuff on screen and/or the room is well lit. Terrible backlight bleeding right from unpacking, not at all good for watching movies or anything with dark scenes or backgrounds. HDR is a gimmick at best on PC and doesn't work well, colors seemed washed out - you'd have to dig deep into nvidia settings and tweak to get a proper output for HDR content.Connects fine with HDMI but the display port does not support HDR. Xbox One detected HDR and switches to it while playing games or video."
4,"Orderd on 23 dec 20.Delivered 25 decide 20.Reviewed on 4 Jan 20.It is a good budget 2k (1440p) monitor. Received both dp and hdmi cable. Make sure while connecting your dp port don't have any part of cabinate coming out as obstacle for connection. Because the dp cable has larger connector part, otherwise you will see no display. Refresh rate is 75hz on 1440p resolution through dp cable, did not try on hdmi cable. Thankfully no dead pixel, no ips glow even in dark room. Also stand is not thay wobbly. Enjoying old games at 2k with dual core (pentium g4500) and r7 260x 1gb. Even crysis 2 is running good and 2k with highest setting. It has Freesync2 version and working great. No real hdr, it is just increasing brightness and adjusting the other parameter.Try contrast 60-70, brightness 50-57 to enjoy good colour and to protect eyes.Final verdict it is good to enjoy 2k gaming, watching movies for regular and casual user/ gamer."
2,"This model is ‚Äòok‚Äô at best. Nothing spectacular about this product. Picture quality seems good, but extremely thick bezels like a 2010 model. Looks are extremely bad, I got bored even in first day. Brightness is meh, just not good enough. Nothing specially good in this monitor.The HDMI cable can‚Äôt support 4K@60fps. You need display port for that.Few other points to consider:- Works with MacBook pro , you get full 4K resolution. But like I mentioned only 30fps through HDMI.- The monitor shakes quite a bit, the stand is not very sturdy. A light movement shakes the monitor. May want to invest on VESA mount if you want.- The cable length is decent, Easily more than 2m.- The monitor control is via a small 'joy stick', it's made of plastic and flimsy.- The control interface/software of monitor is old-school style. The design of software is not that appealing.- Didn't face any flickering so far."
5,"Must say the delivery was quick ,got it within 24hrs of order.Well just got the monitor everything seems to be good for now ,it goes very well with MacBook Pro .Will use the monitor for editing purpose and update my review again ."
4,"This is one of the budget monitor for a non-gamer who wants a 4K resolution for day 2 day tasks. Use Display port at monitor end to get 4K@60HZ. (i brought a USB-c to Display converter for additional 3K to connect my Laptop (both Apple Mac and Dell)). Use HDMI for full HD only for better results (using HDMI for my second dell 24 inch FullHD monitor)Using it for mostly switching btw office work, Watching movies, Photo-edits using Photoshop. Having been using it for 1 week and feel color accuracy is 80% Ok. HDR is not the best but still does job during Movies.The stand is pretty useless (no vertical/horizontal move (buy 27UK650). Just vertical tilt). Use a 100x100 vest mount based monitor desk mount for more friendly move and use."
2,"Within a day I felt my eyes are paining because of the quality issue of this product.This is not a true IPS, thought spec has it. It is only as an advanced TN panel.Reason -1. The color quality of the picture is varying in the non-straight angles.  Only the center viewing angle colors are sharp/bright and the not-straight angle is graying depending on the variance of the angle. Higher the angle, higher is the graying.2. The backlight bleeding is so high, my Sony Bravia HD IPS TV (2015 model - W series) does better than this monitor. FYI - I have compared this side-by-side.3. This is gone be the first and last LG product which I have purchased, reason - the item cannot be returned due to bad quality. The replacement will be the same product. I don't know if Amazon can help. I don't even dream that the company will accept this feedback into consideration and will give me an upgraded model as a replacement to sort the quality issue. (God = AWS- help my eyes!)4. I had wonderful LG panel reviews in my ears for years before I landed upon this. Practically, you are not able to maintain it or maybe like i-donot-care about the quality anymore. Plz LG, not just me but we all believe you have been leading the market with great products and innovation. Plz, continue to do so. Your monitors/TVs were great too!5. Of course, this monitor is good enough for bright color but dull or dark, very bad. I am a heavy computer user, I prefer dark mode/theme of Apps/software to reduce the eye stress during the night time. On this monitor, I avoid using the dark mode/themes. If I have too, then another eye stress comes. So this monitor is only good for me in the day time :) (I lost my 50% money ;p ). If I use them then clarity of dark color fonts/symbols is an issue and I have to change the angle to work on it, which means move to a straight angle to see the objects cleary. Good exercise for not feasible, coz the monitor screen is huge(for me)."
5,"First of all, I am not a professional. I use this monitor only for movies, videos and office. Very occasionally amateur photo editing. Did not use it for gaming. I used this monitor with mac mini(2018) and hp spectre. I did a lot of research before making this purchase. To sum up what I found out and my personal experience: This is an entry level 4k monitor. There are some 4k monitors which are cheaper than this, but they come with TN panel. The picture quality is great no doubt, but I found a few things a bit disappointing - Only 300 nits. For this price I feel atleast 350, if not 400 would be great. A little bit of glare. And finally, HDR. In my research I came to understand that this monitor 'supports' HDR, but it is not VESA certified DisplayHDR. You can find the list of HDR certified products online. In fact a different model 27UL600 has DisplayHDR 400 certification. I did play some HDR content that I have and I was disappointed a bit. But the resolution is excellent. I felt that the response time is a bit slow when I use this with mac mini.Anyway overall, very satisfied. If your budget allows, prefer the next models like 27UK650 or 27UL600, as they are HDR certified and have some international recognition."
5,"Bought this at Rs 28,994.I have just been using this monitor for the past 2 hours since it's delivery.To experience refresh rates of 60hz or higher, the HDMI interface won't cut it. You will need to use the Display Port interface.I am using a 2015 13inch Mac Book Pro.  I had pre-ordered a mini DPI to DPI cable along with the monitor so as to connect using the Mac's Thunderbolt port.This is what I am using.  https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B013PWQPFS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  if you want to experience 4K in all its glory.This same mini DP cable works with my office provided Lenovo T470. Most WinTel laptops come with at least a mini DP.For later generation Macs, Thinkpads, those with a USB-C type interface, you will need this cablehttps://www.amazon.in/DisplayPort-CableCreation-Gold-Plated-Thunderbolt-Compatible/dp/B08BY5VFKX/ref=asc_df_B08BY5VFKX/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397005680557&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11287787582426092915&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9061821&hvtargid=pla-970329435506&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hiOn a Mac, all text is crisp and clear. With a PPI that is almost Retina Level Quality. Honestly, the difference in clarity between the Mac Book Pro's retina screen Vs this LG screen is negligible and is probably only because the former is a smaller 13-inch display.I will also attach a few Windows Screenshots as well."
5,"This is my first monitor and I got a 4k monitor. The product is amazing. I am lucky I got a new package and 1 days delivery. The good thing with LG is it provides multiple cables including HDMI, DPI. Earlier I purchased a Acer 32"" 2k monitor. It was too big and eyes were paining to read text in such a big monitor which is not 4K. So, I decided to get 27"" and I chose LG. I felt the difference. You can read all day long with 4K display without discomfort to your eyes and watching movies on this display is amazing. I use it with my MacBook Air 2017 model. You should buy a miniDPI to DPI port cable. I spent another 1000 rupees for it but it worked well. Thank you, team Amazon!I will update after 2 months about the life of this monitor."
4,The monitor is awesome; has lots of preset levels for display and just perfect size for a 4x2 table for a work from home setup. This version has fixed stand and hence needs a VESA mount-clamp in order for height adjustment and tilt. Overall no complaints and been using since Mar-20 and its great !! Price is on a higher side compared to Samsung and Benq which you can get for 5K less.
4,"As this is my first 4K monitor I was mesmerized by it's display after watching 4K video at 60fps. I was using a LG 22"" display before so this 27"" inch display seems quite huge but at the same time comfortable , don't have to turn head which I think might be a problem with 32"" display.I think it's a great investment for someone spending a lot of time on screen as the resolution is soothing to eyes and very much comfortable for long hours of work.Pros--Picture Quality is amazing- Good reading mode-Delivered in less than 24 hours (Thanks Amazon)Cons(No major flaws )Fixed stand - No Screen Rotation /height adjustable (Not much big of an issue)Screen little wobbly because of the stand , It will be fine if the table is fixed and firm"
4,"This monitor is okay, its decent, since its a IPS display colors are good. 4k resolution at 27 inch looks very sharp. We dont have much options at the price range of 30K, So here is what i think about pros and consPros :- Decent Monitor for under 30K- Great Colors- Superb Response Time- Great Viewing Angles- Freesync support , lot of color preset options- 2 hdmi 2.0 and 1 display port with a great stand- Very good size to resolution ratio, perfect for 4k gaming on consoled and pcCons- HDR is just a checklist checked, Very poor HDR since it is a 8 bit+FRC panel- HDR just makes everything grayish and pinkish and looks dull . Tried all settings and compared it with a sony hdr tv. This monitor has a very poor HDR implemenation .- Poor Contrast Ratio , Dark Scenes dont look good. But there are no VA panels at this price as well- Not a 10 bit panel , thats a bummer ...- Under 400 nits of brightness is another reason for poor HDR , though 400 nits is bright enough when u sit upclose.What could have made it great... ?If LG can pull a 10 bit panel with a good contrast ratio over 1000:1 and retain all Pros i mentioned , this monitor would be a steal at 30K. Though for HDR local dimming zones , high brightness over 600 nits is essential,  a 10 bit panel would have made this monitor look great in HDR.If you are fine with poor HDR , and hdmi 2.1 monitors are still years away, this would still a great a buy for your consoles and pc."
1,"This monitor has some serious issues.I used it with my MacBook Pro as an external monitor, while the colors were all nice and vibrant but there‚Äôs something wrong.Before starting I‚Äôd like to tell all, I am no gamer. I am just an IT professional.The monitor was lagging a lot, I also tried using the display port cable to get 60 fps but that didn‚Äôt resolve the issue as well.The thing is Mac will scale it down to 1080p by default, that causes a lot of noticeable lag like when you are opening new windows, minimizing, maximizing.If you change the resolution to 3840x2160, the lag is gone but then everything becomes so small that its impossible to read.I almost got irritated with it and that‚Äôs when I decided to return it.I have a Hp 24es monitor, its 1080p with IPS Panel. It works butter smooth with my MacBook also the quality difference is unnoticeable. Shocking this is that is less than half of what this monitor costs.I had better expectations from Lg.Thanks to amazon for accepting my return."
5,"This is just the right monitor for my use.. I needed a bigger screen from my previous dell 21"" and wanted a bump in resolution for multitasking.. use windows scaling feature to 125-150% and voila it ticks all the requirements. color reproduction is good. I had to lower the brightness as it was causing strain. I am using a HDMI cable with 60Hz RR but no HDR without a DP."
4,"Absolutely lovely product. Prior to this I tried LG 29UM69g in which the text was pixelated so had to return it. The text sharpness in this is brilliant, I use it with Macbook Pro 2015, must say the text is as good as retina display. Anyone thinking of it for home office, you will definitely love it too.The only con I could find after using it for a week now is, it comes with HDMI cable but it only supports 30 fps rather than 60. This is the downside of it. Of course we can purchase the cable but what's the point of providing it with low rate than the monitor's capability. LG should address it."
5,"The picture quality is amazing with this 4K UHD monitor. Mind only one thing, before buying this or any 4K monitor make sure that your motherboard or graphics card has the latest HDMI port that support 4k at 60hz or higher. Some graphics cards also can't handle 4K, so before purchase make sure that your system is compatible.  If your mother board is cheap quality and doesn't have good HDMI port, it may cause problem while using 4K."
3,"It's kind of okay, found one dead pixel and 4K@60hz over hdmi only if your laptop supports hdmi v2.0.And I am pretty suspicious that this piece was used once because of the packaging and even the driver CD was not in the packaging, it was roaming open in the box and got all scratches on it.Edges of the panel seems like they are not fitted properly but that's my view, maybe that's how they do it.Got it for 28k, can't return because it's an emi purchase and I got struck down for rupees 4600 before on an emi purchase don't want to risk that happening again.The price should be 25k because of the quality checks."
4,"The peak brightness is too low to truly enjoy HDR content. But, otherwise, the display is great. No complaints. I played around with the software that LG provides that splits the screen into different zones and allows sharing of mouse and keyboard between computers, etc. I didn't really need it for my purposes, so I didn't spend too much time on it, but I can totally see someone relying on that for their setup/workflow."
5,I am using this 4k monitor for video editing and UI design the color calibration is prefect and gaming with HDR is excellent
5,"I am very pleased with this 4K monitor. It does not have USB connectivity (i.e. a USB hub); it does not have a height adjustable stand. Having those would have been nice, but that would also add to the price. For around ‚Çπ30,000 I think this monitor provides everything I *need* (great image quality, quick to wake up from standby) while not charging me for bells and whistles that I *want*. In my opinion, this monitor gets the basics right and that makes it a great value for money."
4,"The issue I felt is that it doesnt fit my Macbook, as connecting monitor using a dp port, was not good.It braks very often and I have to reconnect it, hence I am not sure if its a good to go with Mac."
2,I thought the resolution will be Very sharp like mac retina 4K display with laser sharp images but frankly it‚Äôs not very different from a regular 1980 by 1020 display don‚Äôt waste your money just buy a regular display it could that my laptop output is also not 4K
5,It has been 24hours since i'm using it and my initial impression is superb for this dispaly. It's fairly bright and colors are very natural and vivid. I'm using it with mi box 4k and I'm absolutely loving it. Though I've to test it for longer period of time.
4,The monitor looks old with its white back and big black plastic bezel. But switch it on and the 4K with HDR display is very good and you will quickly forget about the rest of the monitor design.At this price it‚Äôs probably the best panel you can get.(Connected to MacBook Pro using a USB-C to DP cable)
4,Works with macbook pro retina display. I was looking for the above features and this one proved to be the best choice.Cons:Its tilt is very bad. You can't work without buying a separate stand.It doesn't turn on with 4k display sometimes
1,"This product is not the quality as compared to its price  ,it is just forced on me you outrigtly rejected my request to return. It shows your callous and apathetic attitude towards me who had been a loyal customer for the last 15 or so years"
5,"I got it for 22K, and this is one of the best 4k monitors in this budget. The picture quality is excellent for this pricethe main problem is that I got only 30fps on 4k by HDMI. It is highly recommended to use display port because there is a lot of difference between 30fps and 60fps."
3,The monitor should be priced below 25k. The HDMI ports are close to the bulge at the back and hence I am not able to connect the firestick to this. I had to purchase an HDMI extension cable to connect the firetick.
3,I would recommend 27UK650 over this one if you can spend 2-3k more.
5,First 4k monitor truly impressed by the quality. Cannot see pixels. Good for programming. Cable length is bit on a shorter side.
4,"The product is really good, i love the picture quality and video quality. Its very light weight compared to my earlier screen and also pretty easy to assemble. The only issue is the height adjustment but that was known before i purchased. So no complaints so far!"
2,Mine came with a dead pixel line on the display out of the box. Ordered replacement.
5,"It's a good monitor, works like a charm but hdr support is not that good...also could use a little but lesser price around 25-26k at best."
5,Best in price. A real value for money product. Initially I was looking to buy around 22inch screen within 22k but than I check others review and also googled than I come to know this is much better in price and have great value for money.And after using 1 month I found very good.Just go for it.
1,The display quality is not good. There are minute white lines in almost half of the screen. You can check the picture.
1,received defective product..hence returned
3,"Picture sharpness is OK. No bleeder lights from the corners when no picture or black background.But when HDR is turned ON, the colour changes to a greenish /yellowish shade/tinge.  You will not see a pure white colour.Not happy with the product."
1,Found new piece with dead pixel vertical line.
5,the monitor lives up to expectation .fantastic display . I would have prefer a USB C but u get what you pay forI don't use speaker on monitor so I can't comment about it
5,Value for money and crisp pictures .Also good for casual gaming which does not need high refresh rate . I use my ps4
5,After 2 months of use. It's working awesome. picture quality is awesome. fully compatible with my MacBook pro.4k video supported and similarly work as a retina display. Overall good product. You can go for it.
5,"Have been using this from a month. Loving the display. Good for gaming, media and work. Good color accuracy and Good viewing angles. Doesn't come with adjustable stand. So a vesamount is recommended.Just wish it had USB type c as well."
4,Video quality and viewing angles are amazing for both watching movies and playing open world games!The colour accuracy also helps in my designing work and enjoy the open world scenarios detailing.
5,"Best in its price range, I needed two monitors, So I bought one of 144hz and another one of 75 hz. The build quality feels really good as well.It's MSI bro, Just go for it."
1,"I bought this product and received delivery on 11 november. Installed it. it is basically screw based mechanism without any tilt arrangement. Ideally we expect a height adjustment as well but tilt adjustment is such a basic feature to have to set a monitor ergonomically and work tirelessly.but unforturnately, this monitor is not even perfectly straight. it is tilted towards front/user. this makes viewing and working very diffuclt.apart from that there is blur in side edges which isnt upto an LG standards for monitors.buy a better product. and please know that amazon doesnt gives easy returns nowadays. they have some policies to issue refund only when they dont have a replacement available. they have told me to provide a return on some conditions, but am not pleased with their return policy, because when you make a buy they clearly write return or replacement available till 19 november, but will offer only replacement when you buy products..so please make a informed decision regarding electronic products. you decide for your hard earned money,"
5,"Just received this monitor today.I've never used a high quality display, this is my first 'real' display. The display of my laptop is pretty average. So, this review might be a little 'newbie'.I'm definitely satisfied with the screen quality. I was initially thinking that WFHD may look kinda pixelated on such a wide display but that's not the case. I brought this display primarily for multitasking. I'm a programmer and need a lot of screen real-estate. So, far I'm satisfied with the screen space.The joystick controls on the monitor are super easy to use.The speakers are decent. Definitely an upgrade from the speakers on my laptop.I will update this review after using this display for a month.Update: I've been using this display for 2.5 months now I have absolutely zero complaints.I've changed some display colors settings to make the display more warm to have some mercy on my eyes. It is soooo bright. I use the screen on 5% brightness."
4,"19th Dec 2020In my old review, I had reported that I am not able to tilt. I had logged a ticket with LG and they promptly sent a service engineer to provided a demo on how it can be tilted. Please see attached video. I am increasing the rating due to this.18th Dec 2020I have just started using this monitor and will continue to provide additional feedback. Here are few quick pointsCons: Ergonomics:1) No tilt adjust as per specs (or probably I do not know) Logged a case with LG as Amazon did not bother to help or even log a case. Appario retail did not bother to work with LG specify this on product page even after a user complained about this last month. With a pathetic return policy and needing monitor badly, i am not in a favorable position to return this.2) Monitor is tilted forward and causing lot of nausea. See pictures attached. If stand issue is not fixed, i will be forced to by a stand at an expense of Rs 2k+3) Order was for a black monitor but what was delivered was white. However it is not a major issue.4) Monitor material quality (Specifically surrounding plastic material) is cheap. Not a major issue though.5) Does not include display port cable. seriously? disappointed with that.6) No USB C port.Pros:1) Picture quality is great. HDR great. Loved it. However, if you wish to go for 34Inch, then I suggest 4k monitor.2) 7W speakers: Loved most. I am sure you will love them too.3) I bought this for productivity and screen split works great.4) I could not get 75 refresh rate at 2560X1080 but will find out and then update review on that.Recommendation to Manufacturer: I do not mind paying little extra for a built in HD camera."
4,"Coming from a 15 inch laptop and 22 inch monitors, this was a huge update for me. The initial impression are very good. I am not a gamer, just a programmer, and i like to work with multiple apps open. This provides ideal space for 2-3 apps to be open at a time. Usually i code in one app, terminal in another and browser in one. And the movies look crisp and well fit, i guess some cuts were on vertical side of film,.based on the viewr(youtube.,netflix, ..and it differs for each video i guess). I hope this works out well. Also audio is ok,.though i have external speakers which are way better(even cheaper ones are better than the monitor audio). I would recommend a nice desk space for monitor, i had a problem of managing since i have my external speakers,.a laptop, woofer, mouse with extension chords to keep on a desk it was quite hard."
5,"34 inch this and a cheaper model just have one difference speaker and price difference is around 5k  its like cheating people..hdmi is ok but if you are using it for gaming display port is must and mostly 3 display settings need display portWhatever ,i have faith on amazon.. so helpful to customers...  Thats why i buy small to big things from amazon.. seller kaisa bhi ho amazon solves my issue always"
5,"It has been a week since I bought 34WL50S monitor. I had purchased a 29 inch LG ultrawide last year and had a great experience using it while WFH. Gave that to my son for his online classes and decided to buy same 29 inch for my home office but then I saw 34 inch and went for it for more screen real estate. It has been a week and I am still getting used to of the large footprint. It is significantly bigger than 29 inch ultrawide. While I will get used to it and am already enjoyiny the huge screen, 29 inch is the sweetspot if you only use it for office. I got 34 inch to be used for home office and media consumption. It has two hdmi ports. I have my laptop connected with one port and fire tv stick with second port. If you want to get something for hybrid use, look no further and get 34 inch ultrawide. Some reviews complain about grainy text, etc., pls ignore them. It is perfect for home office (no issue whatsoever with text, image, video quality) as well as watching movies during leisure time. Highly recommended. I got it for 23499 so a good deal."
5,"This monitor is currently one of the best in this price range.1. The main advantage is it's ultrawide. Once you use ultrawide monitors, it's hard to go back.2. It has enough space to work on 3-4 windows side by side.3. The inbuilt speakers are also very good with good bass (keep maxx audio on).4. It is also very color accurate (99% SRGB).5. Only con is, ppi density could have been better. But that's to be expected in ultrawide monitor in this price range. You can either get a 2k 16:9 monitor or fhd+ 21:9 monitor (this one) in this price. I would suggest you to go for this one. This is a must for people who multitask.6. For entertainment also, this is better than 16:9, as most of the films are shot in 16:9 wide ratio. You can zoom in the video (use vlc) to remove the black bars at top and bottom, that we see on normal 16:9 tv or monitors.7. Connection is no issue, supplied hdmi cable works fine. Since it is not 2k or 4k, integrated laptop graphics can run it smoothly.8.  No issue for gamers also, as it supports upto 75 hz refresh rate.Overall it is very nice product to have for people who are looking for monitors below 20000 Rs. (If you wait for the sales, you can get it around 18000)(Note : many users have mentioned the monitor cannot be tilted. It is not true. You can adjust that. It can tilt around 10-15 degree. Just hold the middle portion of the monitor at both top and bottom and try to tilt. It will)."
1,"Not good. Don't waste moneyBad picture quality. You must tweak the settings as soon as you get it. Otherwise the colour reproduction is so sheety. It's just a fhd resolution. I can't watch any good resolution video in this and feel good. I hate it. So you're better off buying a 43 inch 4k TV instead of this monitor for this price. Using 43"" 4k tv as monitor is the best thing trust me. I'm not kidding."
3,Monitor is good for content creation but the build quality and plastic material is very bad did not expected from LG and I think there should be and height adjustment for this price point the plastic body is very low qualityDon't think twice if you want to do content creation work because the screen size is very BIG I think it's sufficient don't go for 34 inches save your money 29 inch is good enough just got today I am writing this review really will update in future the detailed review
1,"For the people, who are trying to buy this, let me tell you one thing, this is bigger than it looks in images. This is a good monitor overall.It is too big for my setup, so I wanted to return it the very same day.  But I cannot because Amazon has removed the return policy for all electronic products. So please be aware before you buy this. You cannot return it. I have to sell it at a secondhand price now. I guess it's a new way of milking as much money from customers."
5,"I am using LG monitors from years and this is third monitor I've purchased of LG. Picture and color quality is great and sound is great if you are not used to a 5.1 system. I am using both 5.1 sound system and monitor sound because this monitor can play clearer dialogues than 5.1. If you are using HDR10 setting in windows then some of the picture mode are disabled in this monitor. One other great feature of this monitor is that you can switch picture mode by windows software called ""Onscreen Control"" , so I can easily switching between picture modes from windows without touching physical key on monitor.  I am using low brightness and contrast in reading and browsing and switch it to cinema or gaming mode in viewing movies and playing game. I advice to use display port cable instead of HDMI cable comes with this monitor for less eye strain due to higher refresh rate."
5,"When I placed the order the monitor came and it was a faulty one as half of the screen was appearing as blurred you can see the attached picture, same day I requested a replacement and then it turn out to be great display with amazing sound quality. At this price point this 8s the best ultrawide monitor one can purchase.."
4,"Good --- Amazing picture quality || White Monitor with modern looks || White HDMI giving me 60Hz || White Adaptor which is slim (looks like an adaptor for laptop, btw fits into my Sony Vaio E as well)  || Good Speakers+ I really like this whenever I play XBOX, visuals and sound are amazing.Bad --- INR 18100 spent (almost 3000 more than other models of LG), but its ""Dual Control"" application (""Dual Controller 2.65 for Windows"") does not work at all. I checked with the LG Customer care, and explained this issue to several engineers, but nobody has replied me yet. (Looks that it does not have Picture By Picture (PBP) feature in 29 inch, btw not sure if 34 inch monitor has it or not)Visible screen length is 67.5 cm and height is 29 cm of the 29 inch monitor.Length is sufficient for 12+ hours daily work (b'cuz 34 inch monitor might be an issue for the eyes if you are online for more than 12 hours daily), but Height should be a bit more.It has two HDMI and one DisplayPort, Thanks!, but shuffling between two laptops is not so comfortable. Each time I had to click on the button and make the selection (it must be a single click feature).Hence, now I am using ""Farraige¬ÆHDMI Switch Splitter"""
5,"Must buy. I did a lot of research on what model to buy and what size.. 25 29 34 inchWN WL UM etc 500 600 69Finally narrowed down on WN600It looks small but is a perfect solution for what it's intended forThis is the 29"" 2020 model and should support dual controller (not tested yet)Ask me any questions that you may have"
3,"This is a good monitor considering a fact that there are very few options for ultra-wide monitors, especially at this price range. However, 1080p on a 29 inch monitor looks pixelated, especially more so as you‚Äôll be working closer to the monitor, in comparison with a TV.The HDR mode seems off-the-line a bit and sometimes over-saturates the colour to provide very bad image quality. I‚Äôd restrain from purchasing this if you‚Äôre working more on photo editing, gaming or video editing stuff. You get a lot of good 4K 16:9 monitors at this price point or better get a 25 inch one if you‚Äôre in need of an ultra-wide monitor."
5,I researched a lot and then decided to buy this even though there were some other alternatives from LG offered for a lower price but keep in mind that they are old models. It is working fine with my macbook pro 2019 with a usb c dock and I assume will work with a usbc to hdmi as well.The picture quality is really good and even the colours are nice. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend it if your main purpose is to watch movies or videos as it seems a bit odd to watch movies in this ratio.
5,superb.. clean and elegant .....üíØmultitaking -üíØyes they have inbuilt speakers..... good fr using at night when u dont need sound-sys's base.... üíØjoystick control....... üíØno flicker..no lags.. u cant trust on ths one.........üíØ2 pcs in one screen.....
5,"Saw the review & wanted to upgrade, trust me this is value for money . amazing screen clarityworth an upgrade"
4,"The screen is amazing , ultra wide I can easily work with multiple programs open which is a big plus in today‚Äôs work from home environment . Text is clear , graphics smooth . The inky reason I have not 5 starred is because the screen does not have inbuilt height adjustment which should be a given ."
5,"Really good monitor. No complaints till now. There is no back-light bleed. Using this for coding as well as gaming. Hdr is also good.Do note, don't turn on SUPERRESOLUTION. It just makes everything more pixelated."
5,Excellent quality. Changed my working style.
5,The product is good. I would say its better that any monitor in this price range. Go for it!
5,"Ment for multitasking. Ultrawide makes sense in 34"". Usability increases to a deferent level alltogether. Bezels are descently thick, would have appreciated bezelless design. Monitor sound is descent not great, can't expect more from a monitor speaker. Overall a nice good product, one of best Ultrawide monitors available at this price tag,"
5,"I am just amazed by the picture quality it has. I always wanted bigger screen and was looking for 27 inch monitor for multitasking, but after watching some reviews online, I decided to buy this and it has served the purpose 100% for me at least. Complete value for money!"
2,"Seemed like a good deal but doesn't work smoothly with my Macbook pro 15"". And after a month of slow use, the screen seems to have blanked out. Please help?!"
5,You want a wide screen dotn look futher. Just buy this. Just Excellent quality
5,1. Picture Quality is fine2. Value for Money3. Sound is not that good but according to the price its fine4. Design is good
3,If ou are more into picture quality then it's going to disappoint you case the picture quality is not upto the mark at the price offered but if you are not that into picture quality it's definitely a good ultra wide monitor at this point.Speakers are also good.
5,"Great display in this price range. If you want to save some bucks then go for it, otherwise for 34‚Äù displays you need to pay almost three times more than this one."
1,"Suddenly stopped working after 2 months, also doesn't have PIP mode"
4,"Have it for over a year, had trouble few months after purchasing where a green vertical bar was showing on the right side of picture, went off automatically, keeping fingers crossed as will be out of guarantee soon"
5,Great product with tilt option. Please visit lg.com search for this model and install two apps. On screen control and Dual Controller to connect mutiple pcs same time.
4,Good product overall and value for money ....would have been better and a 5 star if it had more ports...Although i sometimes feel it does give out more blue light than my laptop .... Otherwisw nice product at competitive price...
5,"Display is awesome to perform builty tasks on one untra width screen, it has in-build speaker and headphone jack output.completely affordable, and worth the price it's being offered - No other brand gives these specs, quality and price."
5,Value for money...good picture quality..HDR10... viewing angle also good...wide screen so full cinematic view...
4,no DP cable along with product. need to buy separately
5,Using it mostly for multi-tasking at work. Haven't tried for gaming but am sure its awesome. Definitely worth the price. The ultrawide screen allows you to be more productive and the PiP works all too well.
1,Very bad product.It has 7 days replacement policy. On 8th day screen showing as blur.So do not buy product. Very bad product.Waste for money. My entire money got wasted.Very sad
5,Last one month I am using and completely satisfied.
3,I have a Dell windows laptop with which it works seemlessly but with macbook pro the letters are not neet and clean.
2,The Monitor Is In Shape Of Square.I Had Given Two Stars As The Image Representation Is False.
1,"Dear All - Giving review after 1week of usage , first few days it was working fine but after 5days of normal use screen got white lines and now it's totally covered with white lines got very disappointed never expected this from Frontech and now return policy is also expired have to visit Service Center don't know who long I have to tackle this. Please guys think twice before buying hope my luck was not good."
4,A good monitor for the price except that it is almost square in shape and not rectangular
5,Like üëå...
5,Good product
5,BEST PRODUCT BEST COMPANY FRONTECH
4,Good for mid range desktop
1,Picture quality is bad.
1,Despite begging the seller that this is my hard earned money and requesting them to send me a non faulty product. I ended up getting a product which is screen bleeding like anything. So much disappointed. I am trying to connect with HP support but those guys can't even understand between just a monitor and a laptop despite telling them exclusively that this is a monitor and I need service for the monitor and not the laptop.
2,I actually ordered an HP 24fw model and what I got is HP 24f .After receiving I checked and turned on and there was a pixel burn.Not even months in first or technically and hours after buying I noticed a pixel burn .I recommend you to please verify the product before buying
5,"Looks beautiful.  In the few days I used it, performance was quite good"
2,"Picture quality is bad as I got USED Product. Looks like at least 3 month used.All cables in packaging are dirty, it has white paint spots like wall paint.Very disappointed from Amazon that they are sending used / refurbished product at cost of new product.I placed request for replacement."
2,"The refresh rate is low and could be frame drops while gaming. Quality of picture is saturated. Also height adjusting option is not available. And this not have the audio option (there is one more model in hp which comes with the audio option)Comes with both HDMI and VGA port, very quick and easy to install it.Anti glare is good and nice. Also design wise it is awesome and classy.Light weight and Build quality is nice but needs to be handled carefully.White is outstanding. I needed a gaming monitor with higher refresh rates hence returned."
5,"Just Awesome. The vividness in color reproduction is heart  stealing. Guys do not give second thought if you are thinking about sub 10,000/- category monitors. Build fantastic light gaming PC in 30,000/-. The combo is HP monitor + AMD 3200g Processor + Asus Micro ATX Motherboard+Circcle PSU + 8GB Kingston DDR4 RAM + Ant Esports Mid Tower Cabinet + Crucial 240 GB SSD + 500 GB 2.5 SATA HD (reused from my abandoned Dell 1525 Lap :) + creative pebble speaker) + Amketee Key Bord +Logiteck Keybord."
5,"It's a very good product with crisp picture, natural colours, very good viewing angle, anti glare screen, good contract ratio and with VGA & HDMI input ports.Although it has few disadvantages like the light from backlight is visible on the screen when the moniter is kept with very low brightness and contrast. Although it is not completely avoidable from IPS screen technology but the visibility of the said light is little bit more than my expectation. This may be because of high contrast ratio of this screen. And this high contrast ratio is generally not expected from IPS screen.Secondly, it has got no audio output jack to extract HDMI signal to analog 3.5 mm output.But overall performance of this monitor is fabulous, including watching of movies in vibrant colours.Regards,Arunava Jati"
5,"Pros:great looks, ultra thin and sleekThe image quality is also greatI do not use for gaming, for regular usages its perfectI use it in the reading mode, since my room has low ambient lightBut the standard setting is best, with vibrant picture qualityCons:The bezel is very narrow, around 5MM, so once I fixed my webcam on the monitor, it is eating into the displayThe sound is crisp but could have been louder. In some cases, when the sound level of a speech/ webinar is low, it is not audible, so I have attached separate speakers.Overall i am happy with the product, and certainly recommend for its display, not very much for the audio."
1,"1st Purchase - huge Backlight Bleeding issue.2nd replacement - got used product returned by other buyers, as there were multiple old receipts on the box. nd again backlight bleeding. The original tape was cut off and override with the new one.Amazon should have a quality control check on what sellers are selling. Because it wastes time and resources.I'm unsatisfied with the product.5star rating is for those who don't understand backlight bleeding."
5,Product looks very slim and cool. Over all performance is goodCons:Inbuilt speakers are not good
1,"light leakage , i have replaced the item via amazon, and in replacement also same thing happened. i received a defected item..worst product of HP.do not buy this...genuine feedback..rest is your choice.."
2,Product is good but mentioned model is fw which is inbuilt speaker. and delivered model don‚Äôt have speaker features. It‚Äôs a different model.
5,"My main purpose for this monitor was to use this as a secondary monitor for work - Excel, code, and the likes. The display is good, very sleek, easy to setup. The stand is compact but stable. The display is matte, the colours are not vibrant, as this is a model for the workplace, exactly what I wanted. 22"" is the right size for me. The height is not adjustable, the tilt is adjustable. There is a HDMI cable and a VGA cable provided in the package, which is great. Overall, highly recommended for work. If your main purpose is gaming or movies, get some other monitor."
5,"The monitor screen is very thin and it looks very decent for IT professionals like Work from Home. Can connect 1 HDMI and 1 VGA Port. Height is enough when we place the monitor on the desk.  Product package and delivery are super fast. Actually replaced the package due to the power cord missed. Amazon did the replacement within 4 days. That's really super fast replacement process.  Thank you, Amazon."
1,Poor screen quality. Installation is fairly quick. Came in a nice package with no damage or opened piece.Issue: screen shows lines when looked at closely. There is backlight leakage if you work more at night. Quality of HDMI wire provided is not that great and I suspect it will get cut very soon
1,There is a colour bleed on the Left corner in the Monitor. I have tried everything to reset it but the problem persists. I will contact HP for support. If the product can't work properly for 5 months then it deserves a ZERO STAR.
4,The Monitor is very nice and am happy with the display quality. I was hoping that the inbuilt speakers would make it unnecessary to have external audio devices. The internal speakers are practically useless as the maximum volume is barely audible.
4,"Product is definite value for money. Picture quality is above average, weighs less, looks classy.The class in picture quality is somehow missing. It is a full hd monitor no doubt but the expection was higher than what it delivers as picture quality."
4,"I purchased this 24"" monitor as I was spending a good amount of time on my laptop for my office work. So, for me, the purchase was not for gaming purpose. I am pretty happy with the output, the picture quality is good, screen is sleek, viewing angle is good (no changes even if you look from sides). The speaker volume could have been a bit louder but it's still ok. The only issue is it is not having height adjustment. It would have been better if there would have been an option of changing the height as per requirement.  Another issue is the monitor cover. It will be helpful if they can provide the cover along with the monitor so that one has not to struggle to get the cover for the exact dimensions."
3,I would not recommend this monitor for movies because of the IPS bleeding issues.I play games so it doesn't matter much.It is very annoying when dark background comes. Go for TN panel.
1,"Worst seller don't buy, first one o got replacement due to white dot in screen. Second one seeing lot of white blur in the screen. Advice not to be, don't feel after that. Amazon please stop this kind of sellers. Not find less than one stat totally waste of money"
5,I strongly recommend this monitor as it looks so premium and screen clarity is very good. I have been purchasing things on Amazon since many years but this is the first product for which i am writing review as I am much satisfied with this monitor. But be reminded of taking care of the screen as it is very slim. Apart from that I don't see any issue I would like to rate the full stars. Thanks for reading my review and hope you will have a very productive usage of your new monitor.
5,"I was looking for some good and sleek monitor which is good in work and stylish also.Looked many and shortlist this and ordered 2, I am fully satisfied. Easy setup too.I have also added photos of my setup, in the box items and unboxing video.In the box we get1) Monitor2) Stand3) Power cable4) Power adapter5) VGA cable6) HDMI cable7) Quick setup guide8) Warrantee card and manual"
5,"Seller arranged delivery nest day itself (with in 18 hrs of order). Price is almost same as market. No huge discount but door step delivery eases the load of lifting and carrying it by myself. Picture quality is great, comes with standard settings. I am using as secondary display along attached with my macbook pro. Delivered  as expected."
4,"its been more than 1 week using this screen for my work, i am mac user and i recommend this screen only for mac where as for windows i don't like it, i will go for Dell instead"
1,the glass in the monitor has come out in right top side I think this is the refurbished product you are sending doesn't want to complain also because I don't have time to wait in this things have through this monitor definitely will not recommend to any of my friends and family in present and future also very bad experience
3,Screen 10/10Sound 0/10You can't listen anything. Its extremely low and forget about connecting any sound device like woofer or bt speaker to the aux output at the back because it somehow eat all the sound.
1,Sharing pictures of HP monitor delivered. Pictures are attached. The box looks opened and re packed. If I am paying full cost for a new piece then I should get a new unopened one. Please look into this urgently
1,"Please please do not trust HP in India, specially customer service and management. Product provided was dead and replaced with old refurbished defected unit.Go for any brand but avoid HP"
1,Not to buy to delicate trust me dnt go for it just 15days my system feel like inner is broken no replacement not in warranty
5,"I ordered this and got it delivered quickly. Have used it for about a week now.I bought this monitor specifically as it has in-built speakers but the max. volume of the speaker is even lower than the laptop.Pros:- Sleek and looks classy- Has in-built speakers- Angle can be adjustedCons:- Volume of the speakers is too low- Its very thin, so much so that its swiggles with the fan on top of it- No option to adjust height but with the angle adjustment option, you wont need the height adjsutment"
5,This is good product I m using last 5 month no any problem questions very goodColor contras and pawor savenigLight wait
5,Overall it's a good buy.We cannot alter the height of the monitor though!
4,"The display is incredible and good color reproduction. But the only thing i don't like about this product is the backlight bleeding/glow, which is really annoying. I have plugged in my ps4 slim console and my laptop. The problems exists only when the game has a darker scene and playing in dark room. (But with brighter scene there is no such problem) With enough light in the room, the problem is negligible but it still there.My recommendation is that if you are using it for work then go ahead don't think. I would only suggest it for gaming and viewing movies if you don't care about the bleeding/glow issue"
2,The display shows prominent deep blue vertical lines on blue pictures. looks some vertical phase frequency is out of sync. I replaced but still looks the same. returned thr product therefore. IPS panel does not expect to deliver this quality.
3,"it is very good..But it is having the biggest disadvantage its too fragile.Once it has tumbled and stopped  working , their was not even a single scratchI have contacted the customer care they said physical damage not covered ...Its too delicate else it is an good product"
1,It's made in China.
4,Very good monitor if you spend lots of time on the screen. Just dont buy from Appario retails as they will send an item for which the warranty registration has already happened and you will loose 3-6 months of the overall warranty for sure. No returns too.
1,"I got this product damaged and broken, requested for replacement"
5,"It has one of the best color calibrated LED panel. Better than the LG and Benq 22 inch monitors in terms of aesthetics and panel quality. Though the pricing is 1-2k higher than both benq and lg, you get what you pay for. Has 75Hz freesync which works with Nvidia gsync too."
2,"I was pretty surprised to see a sublet of Acer selling such a feature packed monitor at such a low price.And best of all they were using VA panel and not TN(which are usually the cheapest and the worst looking).Before i start my rant about its issues, let me say this, for this price you won't get Freesync and 144hz from any other brand, the blacks are pretty good and the panel gets decently bright.And overall can be a decent buy if the panel issues are sorted out which i will discuss next.So despite my apprehensions with this brand and Acer in general, i dived in and bought it, only to realize nothing ever comes cheap, and there is a reason why AOPEN monitors are so cheap, usually with monitors QA(Quality Assurance) plays a big factor when deciding the price. You see the more monitors you have to discard on the assembly line to maintain a certain level of quality, the more end users end up paying for that quality. I think by now you know why these monitors costs to less, for those who didn't get it, the QA department for such cheap monitors is pretty relaxed, they allow relatively bad looking panels to pass through to cut down the price.For some this might absolutely be a non issue, but for the discerning user who values quality, i will not recommend this monitor, the proof is in front of you folks, the pics i have attached here show how a complete black backgrounnd looks on this monitor, its really funny because my 8 year old TN panel monitor looks way better.It seems like we should expect less of panels now than we did 8 years ago(Added a comparison screenshot of this monitor vs my 8 year old TN panel, just look at the panel uniformity and backlight difference between the 2) !The panel uniformity is all over the place, and if you tell me to look the other way due to the price, i won't because even the costlier Predator series monitors have backlight bleed and uniformity issues.Ok enough talk about the first issue, moving to issue number 2.Typically and technically IPS panels have the best color reproduction, followed by VA and then TN.So i was expecting the monitor to have much richer and better colors than my TN panel, but sadly thats not the case, the colors are completely unrealistic, have an unnatural hue, and to add to that the monitor's edges are DIMLY LIT.Caliberating the monitor on your own helps a bit but its still not a good VA panel.Pros :-------Good Contrast ratioIntuitive OSDDecent Build Quality144hzFreesync(works with Nvidia gpus too now, but only with pascal and turing)Cons :--------Pathetic backlight issues with dim edgesReally bad color calibration out of the boxPanel uniformity issuesGiving it 2 star due to all of this, because in my eyes a monitor should have a solid foundation(The Panel) and then adding extra features adds value, if your panel is this poor then whats the point in having all those features."
5,"the best under 30k 144hz, va panel, curved viewing angles r good & after sales service will be given by acer so if someone has 30k budget u can go with this also bezels r so slim to be attracted"
5,Really good monitor with crisp image quality. Totally worth the price. 144hz refresh rate and 2k resolution is a treat at this price. Freesync also works pretty good. Only thing is the brightness is 250 nits which is good but a bit low compared to other va panels out there. Viewing angles and colour reproduction is really good. Navigation controls are pretty easy with the joystick provided at the back.Pros:-Cheapest 32 inch display-144 hz freesync works perfect-no dead pixels or backlight bleed-Curve on the screen gives immersive experienceCons:-Display brightness could have been better-No speaker-Cant swivel the monitor vertically 90 degrees-Stand is very small and not firm when tilting the display up and down
4,"If you have 20k around to spare for a new gaming monitor, This Aopen curve gaming monitor is one of the best options available. I am really happy with the purchase. It took only 15 hours to reach.Pros:1. 144hz, so buttery smooth frames.2.  4 ms response.3. Curve display.4. Has display port.5. 27 inch, quite a big displayCons:1. 27 inch 1080p looks a bit inadequate of pixels.2. 1ms response time would have been better, but considering this price damn I would have bought it with 5ms also.Peace."
4,"INTRODUCTION:I bought this monitor to replace an old TN panel that I'd been using forever. Its not without its issues but it does get quite a few things right. Hopefully this review will help you decide whether its worth your hard earned money.PRICE:I picked mine up during an Amazon sale when there was a discount offer and a lightning deal on the monitor. At that price, the feature set this monitor provides can't be beaten. The price seems to have gone up since then though.BUILD QUALITY:Build quality is solid. Stand is all metal, pretty sturdy and the monitor doesn't shake too easily. No swivel or height adjustment, but you can tilt the monitor from -5¬∞~ 20¬∞. No VESA mounts either. Bezels are not slim but not very thick either and have a slightly reflective finish. No stuck/dead pixels or any other visual defects to speak of.CURVATURE:The monitor has a curvature rating of 1800R. Curved monitors offer a larger perceived field of view. I had no problems going from a flat panel to a curved one, but it felt a little strange going back the other way once I got used to it.UI:UI is clean, easy to navigate and the exact same one found on the similarly priced Acer panel. Not surprising given AOpen is an Acer subsidiary. Fortunately, unlike the Acer panel which has normal buttons, this one uses a joystick which is much more convenient and intuitive but with one rather annoying design choice - turning off the screen requires you to keep it pressed for 5 seconds. Not ideal if you quickly want to turn off your screen before leaving the room.IMAGE QUALITY:Colors are ok out-of-the-box but you'll probably need to fiddle around with the settings a bit to get the picture you desire. I found the default presets a bit too warm for my liking so I had to tone it down a bit to get a more neutral image. You can switch the color temp between warm, cool, normal and lastly user mode which enables the RGB bias and gain sliders. The panel isn't very bright but a brightness level of 50-60 will be enough for most people. Blacks look pretty nice as they should be on a VA panel. All in all, with a bit of tweaking, you can get a pretty decent image out of the monitor.VIEWING ANGLES:There is gamma shift when looking at the screen at an angle. The image becomes washed out and less bright the further you move from the centre. But its not severe and its a non-issue if you sit right in front of the screen like most people do.144HZ:Now, onto the two biggest selling points of this monitor: 144Hz and FreeSync. You have to experience a 144Hz monitor to truly understand why so many people recommend one. Forget games for a second - your desktop experience is just so much better. Simple tasks like moving the mouse pointer, dragging a window around, scrolling up and down feel so much more fluid. And once you get used to 100+ fps in games especially FPS, going back down to 60 is something you'll want to avoid. Its not quite the horrible experience going from 60 to 30 but its still jarring.FREESYNC:As for FreeSync, the difference it makes is very evident. No more picking between screen tearing and input lag. And with the latest Nvidia drivers, you aren't restricted to AMD gpus anymore to use FreeSync. As long as you have a Pascal or later series card and a DPI cable, you're good to go. Just enable FreeSync in the monitor menu, then go to the Nvidia Control Panel, click on Set up GSync and tick Enable GSync, Gysnc compatible, Enable for windowed and full screen mode, and Enable settings for the selected display model. That's pretty much it. The FreeSync range is between 48-144Hz but you can extend it using CRU (Custom Resolution Utility). I have extended my range from 40-144Hz because FreeSync is even more beneficial at lower fps. 40fps on a FreeSync panel feels much smoother than 40fps on a non-FreeSync panel.BACKLIGHT BLEEDING:The biggest con, as others have mentioned, is that these monitors suffer from quite a bit of backlight bleeding. Its normal for IPS/VA panels to have a bit of backlight bleeding but its rather noticeable on these panels. I've had two of these, and on a completely black background or even when viewing a dark scene/image, you can see patches near the top and bottom that are brighter than the rest of the screen. Compared to my old TN panel, the black uniformity really isn't good. I mean if you stand far back enough from the screen, it kinda looks like there's a Batman logo on the screen. Of course, the severity of the issue ranges from unit to unit - the replacement I got was better than the original - but its still an issue albeit one that's only evident during dark scenes. If you get a decent unit, keep the brightness at sensible levels, and don't go looking at the edges of your screen every time the screen goes dark, its not something that will really bother you.CABLES:The DP cable that came with the first monitor was not only non-functional, it would stop my PC from even booting into Windows. I had to buy a separate DP cable to troubleshoot the issue. So if you're buying this monitor and plan on using FreeSync, keep a spare DP cable handy just in case. No issues with HDMI or DVI cables though.SUMMARY:Coming from an old 22"" TN panel, this monitor has definitely been a good upgrade. The pros sufficiently outweigh the cons in my opinion. Would I pay the current asking price for it? Probably not. But during a lightning deal and/or when there are discount offers, it certainly represents good value for money."
5,1.I Have search many monitor but any monitor does not have 144hz refresh rate at low price rate And Aopen is latest one i go only 21000rs2.144hz mindblowing.3.curved super4.eye saver5.High Performance any game without any issue6.21000 all feature i got curve..gaming...144hz...4ms smooooth perfomance7.best scene like watch any movie any side without any issue or blurr8.wqhd available :-)9.beast performance ....beautiful look10.finally Rating 9/1011.one point miss because amazon delivery service one day late(delivery boy not give my product my home address ..i collect product office:-( ) but amazon service and support very good12.amazon product and service always better than flipkart13.finally guys buy this product .....best for every you want

I was starteled at first but when the screen is lit, there really is no difference.For gaming, you might need the overdrive to stay off in the monitor menu options > gaming to prevent ghosting effects of moving sharp images.the viewing angles are great and color reproduction still on point."
2,"Not even 4 months and the display started flickering, tried resetting, changing DP cables but still same issue, tried calling service number of Aopen 1800-11-4100 but number is coming as not available. Raised a ticket with Aopen for servicing the product in bangalore but no proper response yet, they keep telling they are looking into it.Can't figure out how to get the monitor serviced, can anyone help please?"
5,This pocket friendly but enthusiast level specs makes it very affordable gaming premium monitor. This is a right out of the box review and may be updated as i go. qhd +144hz+curved+32 inch at 25k that's a very interesting grab. 144hz definitely feels smoother. All the color tech people include in their reviews and tells how bad this display is .... forget it. on an average day when you are playing a game or watching your fav movie you wont sit actively to notice all those. display is fine. unless you want to cherry pick its minor color calibration or brightness issues.Curved display is actually much better than i thought for browsing and youtube than gaming and movies i noticed. the images or text on edges of the pages are a same distance as middle so thats gives a very comfortable view. So no regrets. its highly recommended. I shall update the review over the time.
4,"Unlike most people, I use this monitor with my laptop (which is very capable BTW) rather than a desktop. I would really recommend that you go for the 32-inch 2560x1440 version or the 24-inch 1920x1080 version as 1920x1080 is not really adequate for a 27-inch monitor. It is quite an immersive experience with the curved VA screen. On my unit, however, HDMI was very buggy. Video signal dropped to a blank screen pretty frequently which was very frustrating. Did not encounter this problem, however, with a DP to mini-DP cable (found a decent cable nowhere online except Amazon, the AmazonBasics version). The problem must be isolated as I have never heard anyone else have this problem. My specific unit has minor backlight bleed, fortunately. Could not figure out how to enable Freesync with a GTX 1060. Again, maybe it's just me.The good :-- Competitive price point.- Huge 32-inch TV-like real estate to work with, with features of a monitor.- Smooth 144Hz refresh rate.- VA panel. Other monitors in this range are mostly TN/IPS 60Hz - 75Hz/really small.- Freesync (Not useful to me, but useful for people with AMD GPUs, at least or those who could make it work with NVIDIA cards somehow).- Curved. Very immersive.- Relatively intuitive OSD.- Adequately deep black levels.The not so good :-- HDMI signal issues (at least on my unit).- Sub-par color calibration out of the box.- Minor backlight bleed on my unit (but tolerable).- One stuck/dead pixel right around the middle of the screen.- No 90 degree rotate/swivel.- No speakers, USB passthrough, etc (justified for the price, I guess).It's not perfect. But it's great overall, nonetheless. Totally worth a recommendation.Edit: Found one stuck pixel around the center of the screen. Edited the review accordingly."
5,"I found the display port image of 1440p 120hz on a radeon hd6970 fantastic.The other complain of backlight unevenness did not exist when your in front of it, if you go back far and see it from an angle then you see it.Black's are great and clarity fantastic to the pixel on dp only.A lot of calibration settings are there.Very impressive and I'm planning a 3 monitor setup for racing and flight sim as will as productivity.The border less frame feature is a joke, as the screen actually ends much before the illustrative thin border. There's almost 10-15mm of border."
5,"The monitor is excellent , very good picture quality , excellent colour production , the curved screen is a treat to eye and 144hz and freesync at this price range is commendableGo for 24 inch one if full hd resolutionI used to run my console on my tv and now moving to this monitor the increase is quality and performance is very measurable .As all the services and onsite warranty for this product will be provided by Acer there should me no doubt related to the durability of the product.The only con is that it lacks a speaker unit but that doesn't change anything.Go for it"
1,Acer is not written anywhere on the packaging box or on the monitor itself.1) The refresh rate is 119.98Hz and not 144Hx as mentioned in specifications.2) Monitor Speakers do not work.3) It's a local individual brand AOPEN and not Acer.The word Acer is only to be found on the order purchase on Amazon app and nowhere on the actual order. Scam.
4,"Received the monitor today.  Initial impression was quite good.  I was using a 21.5inch full HD Dell touch monitor. Going curved is a great boon with good peripheral vision. Now comes the bummer. Display has a patch of dead pixel at the edge and on standby I saw the screen in just one color, reddish with the entire display looking like a cobweb. Must have something majorly wrong with the piece. Requested for a replacement, hope mine is a odd piece and wont affect long term reliability. As others are have also mentioned similar issues looks more like a production line issue rather than one off.  Hoping for a full rectification of the problem with the replacement. If it works its an excellent monitor esp for work and playing. Being a larger monitor text is larger too which adds on to the eye comfort.Edit: Prompt replacement in just a day, didnt have to wait as the pick up and replacement happened together.  New display has no issues so far."
4,"Using this monitor for 3 months now and here is my review,The curved screen helps for better vision when facing direct.Viewing angles on this monitor are also excellent.Interface is simple to understand and use.In the box VGA, HDMI and DVI all cables are included with good quality built (My favourite thing)Brightness is way too high on this monitor, I keep it in the range of 30-40%Its 1080p but pixels are slightly visible when user mode is changed to gaming or movie.These are the things which are imp for you to know rest part you can check on youtube.Overall its worth the price."
4,"First day review - Got the monitor on the next day after order, box was in good condition, after unboxing the setup was easy it only requires 1 screw to be screwed in. Setting it up connected to the computer and checking there were no dead pixels and very slight amounts of back light bleed (which is to be expected at this price range and screen size), this what i meant by luck as i got lucky with the panel where as your experience might vary given that there are older reviews where people have much worse panels.Verdict - As it is a prime guarantee product and if it has all the features that you need then get it and test it out you might get really lucky with the panel too if not just return it/have it replaced as there is nothing better in the price range if it works well.feel free to ask questions.Edit 1: found a stuck pixel so 4 stars"
5,"This is one of the fantastic monitors you get in this price range.Pros:-> 144Hz display(You will really feel the smoothness once you jump from 60 or 75Hz display).-> VA panel gives great contrast as compared to typical TN panel found in other budget 144Hz Monitor.-> Simply a great Gaming Monitor in budget.Cons:-> When in dark black screen you can see the panel is not A+ grade panel(Doesn't matter as normally you won't be in having black screen all the time).-> Doesn't have Vesa mount option, that's a deal breaker for many(Unless they are fine with low monitor height or can buy monitor stand)Conclusion: If you are looking for a budget 144Hz gaming monitor with Freesync/G-sync support  and no vesa support doesn't bother you, then its a no brainier . Simply go for it. Highly Recommended."
1,Within a month it started to flicker now... I was not expecting such a poor quality.26/09/2020 - Also bought a 32 inch... It's quality is very sub standard fully made of plactic... Jus the bottom stand is of metal. Also have noticed dead pixels on the pannel.
1,"With high hopes, keeping in mind the price to features ratio I ordered this 27""  monitor. Within a month of use it has developed dead pixel. I asked Acer service center for resolution, this is what they replied ""As per your concern, your screen pixels issue comes under CID ( Customer Induce Damage ) so it will not cover under warranty."".I have been using this monitor with utmost care, sitting on desk with APC UPS, no voltage fluctuations or any damage(physical or otherwise)What's the use of 3 year warranty???Don't go for this brand, better buy some other good brand monitor, even If you have to pay little bit more"
5,After getting my replacement of my damaged display monitors i am very happy and after one year of rough usage the monitor works liye the first day it is the best mid ranged monitor and i am very happy to buy theseThank you Amazon my love for you will be always there
1,"I bought this monitor 4 months ago and not gonna lie the product was pretty good until one day the monitors screen got cracked. Honest mistake right? It could happen to anybody! So i did what anyone would do and called the toll free to ask for non warranty service, since they said that this cant be done under warranty. I have tried calling various service centers of acer and all of them tell me that they do not service monitors. I called the HO and try to issue a complain and the representative called me to tell me that if i gave it to them it'll cost as much as buying a new monitor. Honestly, i am still paying emi for this crap. This isnt really a review on how the product is but even if you buy this and by mistake something does happen to it . Say goodbye to your money. These ppl dont care after the product is sold. Think about it before buying because multiple brands are there and they'll probably give you a better service."
4,"Great 144hz affordable monitor. The VA is amazing in terms of colour production as compared to a TN panel.I play CS, PUBG and APEX nowadays. This monitor does the job pretty well.Don't get confused with 4ms response time. It doesn't make much of a difference as you can't even tell the difference.In a nutshell,+144hz+4ms+freesync+VA panel+curved monitor (new but great experience)+great colors compared to TN"
4,"So for those wondering about 1080p 144hz on hdmi ( u can get it but this monitor doesnt allow) so to get 144hz on hdmi go to nvidia control panel setup custom resolution change it to 144hz ,and change the dropdown menu to manual and u can run 144hz on hdmi because theoretically hdmi should support 144hz .THIS MAY VOID WARRANTY(I AM NOT SURE) SO DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK . And enjoy 144hz on hdmi laptop users.So , about backlight bleed i didn't have any backlight bleed i got very good panel and colors looks good but black looks weird. OSD controls are very good . If you get bleeding panel or some defects replace it worth it for the money. In just got it today so i cant say anything about longevity."
4,"PROS1) 144 Hz. (not adaptive) (constant)2) Curved 1800.3) Good brightness.4) Has separate headphone jack.CONS1) Has an adapter.2) VA panel, so colours are not good.3) In box cables give out static to GFX card (sometimes).4) Only 1 joystick in the back, no separate on/off button.5) Top and sides 1 cm bezels, not good for matrix display.6) 4 ms displayGOOD for beginner gamersCan go for 165 hz 1ms display"
5,"I have been using this curved monitor for a sometime now.THOUGHTS: Keep in mind that the product is targeted to budget consumers so do not expect to perform like an expensive monitor.COLOR/ACCURACY: It's a VA panel with 4ms of response. Acceptable for its price. Brightness and color accuracy is good but little inferior to msi or samsung monitors that I have used in the past. All within acceptable range.Custom profiles can be set to users liking.REFRESH RATE: Through hdmi upto 120hz output is available at 1080p. Refresh rate also varies on the version of hdmi cable being used (hdmi 1.0 or 2.0). Through display cable upto 144hz is available at 1080p.MONITOR TECHNOLOGY (FREESYNC & GSYNC): Yes it's a free-sync monitor and will work with all AMD cards. It works with gsync too. However there is one minor concern that can be easily ignored (not to be confused with a defect). When gsync is on, I observed faint screen flickering when using cinebench or gigabyte's system information viewer (to control fan speed/temperature). Only the black, grey and white areas of the screen would flicker as long as the programs are kept open on desktop. Your mileage may vary.SOLUTION: Turning off such programs or minimizing them will stop the flickering till you open the mentioned programs again. If you wish no flickering at all turning off gsync (from nvidia control panel) would solve it completely. Again It's not a defect. The VA panel used in the monitor has not been validated by nvidia to be used with gsync (as mentioned in nvidia control panel). For more information check out videos available in youtube. Nvidia is aware of this and has already addressed it in 2019. No flickering observed when playing games or using daily programs or watching movies/videos with gsync on.BACKLIGHT BLEEDING: Some users complained of receiving units with backlight bleeding. It's not a manufacturing defect...not necessarily. Sometimes a design flaw can also be the cause. It all depends on the manufacturing standards how they want to channel the light on screen with minimal leakage to the sides reducing bleeding effect. Mine works just fine.Overall a good product to be used as a daily driver."
5,"Best VFM 32 inch 1440p 144hz VA panel on the market, atleast in the Indian market that is. Nothing of equal spec monitor can be had for below 50k. Better alternatives maybe had for even less elsewhere but in India an alternative  monitor like this with similar spec can only be had for around 50k. Certain buyers experiencing horrible backlight bleeding, luckily for me no such case here. no noticeable ghosting either. deep rich black with was not possible with my 24 inch ips display."
5,"Was very skeptical to get this due to the range of negative reviews, but after lots of research decided to take the plunge and was pleasantly surprised with the quality (although my expectations were minimal due to the price). As usual Amazon's delivery was fast, got it with 10% discount for 11.7k. This is undoubtedly the best <20k 144Hz Curved Monitor, nothing comes close with all aspects considered. For the price you pay, you are getting an above average monitor which is simply scintillating (assuming you can get past minimal issues which do not affect your everyday use)"
5,"144 hz, 3-4 ms, free sync (compatible with both nvidia and amd), 27inch curve, va panel all these things approx 20000 rupees. No dead pixel spotted yet. Might be best budget monitor for students or games. My personal rating arePicture 10/9 (due to va panels)Response time 10/10Input lag 10/8Brightness 10/7Value for money 10/8 ( indian sellers sold their goods at higher prices compared with international sellers)Refresh rate 10/10Free sync 10/10 ( i have 1060 and it still working as gsync monitor)Note - light bleeding is an issue  - acer provide it‚Äôs warrantyBest alternative- samsung cfg73 model, asus vg279q (alltho these high in price)"
4,Good monitor.. one less star for one stuck pixel
1,"Heavy Backlight bleeding, it's very irritating to use monitor for low light pictures,games,movies..."
5,This monitor is a treasure left in open to be explored !!Initially I was not impressed by either the picture quality or gaming performance.But as I explored and played with settings !I can say for certain that this is the best all round 1080p monitor in market right now !!!1. For fps gaming turn pixel overdrive to extreme.2. For best picture/text clarity turn off pixel overdrive and set colours to normal.3. For super sharp movie content like 1080p /2k/4k content follow these settings:  ->Do things in step 2 and follow rest from below.....  a> turn contrast to 60.  b> balck boost to 5.  c> turn on super sharpness.  d> use normal colour mode.  e> set brightness to 80%+.  Ezzz best possible experience ever........
4,"I'll keep this sort and simple. I'm not a tech reviewer, so I can't go into depth regarding blacks and nits, and other nitty gritty details a lot of you may be looking for. But I have been gaming for nearly two decades now, and this monitor is a freaking game changer.Set up was pretty easy, and apart from the display port cable that did not work out of the box, I had no issues setting this one up. However if like me, you do have to connect this monitor to an HDMI cable, set the refresh rate in your games to 120hz and NOT 144hz till you get a proper DP cable. My monitor kept losing temporary signal to my games till I dropped my refresh rate to 120.I've also never used a curved monitor before and was a bit apprehensive, but I was sold the minute I booted this one up. If anything, I started wondering how I've gamed on a non-curved monitor all my life.To test this monitor out, I ran the usual suspects like Doom Eternal and COD: MW, and they performed really well. Doom Eternal felt like a new freaking game and impressed me the most. I even tried out Division 2 and holy crap, that game looks mind blowing - especially during the night in New York. Finally, I loaded up some Forza Horizon 4 and didn't expect a higher refresh rate to really wow me, but damn, was I wrong. Racing through England's country side never felt better.Like many of you, I was on the fence for this monitor since I haven't read any credible reviews, but after spending a whole day with this monitor, I'm very happy so far. Guys I know have told me to hold off judgement for at least a month or so, so I guess I'll report back then. But in the meantime, I'm extremely happy with this purchase."
3,"There is heavy back-light bleeding all across the edges and cornersViewing angles are poor. Image quality is ok at 60Hz with a lot of tuning of image settings.At 120Hz it seems to switch to a TFT display mode and the colors are really bad.If you are looking for a budget display just for gaming, then this will do the job. Otherwise it is a waste of money...spend 30-40% more and get a better displayUpdate : Feb 2021Displays are just dumb mirrors of GPUs. After switching from gtx750Ti to rtx3070 and switching from an old hdmi cable to display port, I am able to get the maximum promised performance (144Hz@2K). Previously I used to get max 120Hz@1K and 60Hz@2K. Image quality is significantly better now with the 3070 card."
1,Pathetic monitor useless.It doesn't let me got into bios. Don't know why really did a mistake buying this really would not recommend it to anyone. First they send a defective piece and not I got a monitor I don't know what the hell is wrong. Seriously I can not my pc into bios from my old monitor but not from this
5,"Got delivered with in  2 days, decent packing pretty solid stand made with aluminium I think, more than satisfied with this monitor first time experiencing 144hz, iam using 1050ti with ryzen 5 1600 iam getting 100 to 120 fps average in every latest games at 1080p at low settings ( in box 1dp ,1 hdm,1dvi, 1 power cables available) I'll give more review after 1 month"
2,"Fully disappointed with the purchase, it has huge backlight bleeding issue, already replaced but same thing arrived, its using so called VA panel which I think is class B rated so the company offering soch a competitive price."
5,"I was sceptical about buying this monitor. As I read lots of bad reviews about dead pixels and screen quality issues. After lot‚Äôs of research i come down to three options aopen, lg ips with 75mhz refresh rate and Samsung curved quantum dot. Lg is cheapest one but it t has lots of bad reviews and has only 75mhz refresh rate that I don‚Äôt think as upgrade. Samsung one is too costly so decided to buy this. I m not sure but aopen and Samsung using same panels or screen technology . Brought this on diwali sale and wait for 20days too see if i come across any issues mentioned in other reviews. And i m glad that device is working fine. There are minor blacklight bleed but its not noticeable. As this one is not IPS panels is was worried about colour vividness. But when i test some YouTube video on this monitor i was impressed with its wide range or colour . Curve features of this monitor but is bit useless for at least 24‚Äù I guess if u buy 32inch screen it may feel more immersive with curve. Overall i can say product is good and definitely recommended."
4,Overall a good monitor for the price.Mine has one dead pixel but works great otherwise.
2,"This monitor is good only to watch HD videos and 2k videos or movies in a curved display. Will not recommend it for Gaming.I am using AMD 3600, GTX 1660, 16GB Ram, turned ON free sync and linked with G-sync as Nvidia started support all the adaptive displays. But game flickers a lot, if you have a AMD GPU you can give a try but you need also consider the backlight bleeding out of the box and black uniformity is not good. If you are watching dark scenes, it's messing up. I returned the product. You can check for Samsung 24 inch 144hz curved monitor on same price range or LG 24 Flat 144hz for same price."
5,"This monitor is just amazing for 11.7kPros:1. Great Colours2. 144hz super smooth screen3. Joystick controller on back4. Solid metal stand5. Curved screenCons:Only one: Doesnt come with vesa mount support.Other thoughts:Unlike many other reviewers, my model didnt have any backlight bleed issue. Also the review posted with backlight bleed issue is taken with full brightness(no one does that) and in a dark environment. When I do same as the review, I too see 'some' issues but not noticable at all when doing any other thing than whole black screen.Great deal I got there for 11.7k in a sale with debit card discount too. So I would advice you to wait for a sale as it happens usually every month."
5,Superb choice...Samsung always best...
5,"Likes :1. Light weight and sleek. Very easy to operate2. HDMI cable is provided as part of the accessories3. Picture quality is very good, and there is option of shutting down extra blue lights..very good.4. For ~7K, this could be the best LED monitor. Most of this price band are LCD and heavy.Dislikes/Nice to have1. height adjustable stand. The current stand is only tilt adjustable2. Only one HDMI port."
4,The monitor is incredible.  Slim bezels ani 75 hz refresh rate and great display.However i have 2 complaints1)The screws holes that go with the stand and monitor are poor . It took a lot of force and wiggling here and there to fit the correctly even after that i am not sure its a perfect fit2) they havent included an audio port.Its 2020 cable management is of utmost importance imagine you need to connect your  laptop with the monitor you need connect both the audio and hdmi to the laptop.Hdmi transmits both audio and video!!the why dont companies make use of this feature !!!
1,"All my excitement fizzled out when I turned on the screen.There was white glow near top edge.I hoped it disappears after some time but it didn't.I complained to Amazon, and they decided to send a replacement.I will be very sad and broken if next one has same problem again. :( :("
5,"Good monitor does it's job well.. Did a lot of research and was very confused between several models.. Finally chose this as this is a recent model compared to others which are couple of years old...Good clarity, color reproduction and looks good.. Those who complain of light bleeding try to turn off the Eye saver mode, change Black level and check.. The eye saver mode purposefully emits background light to reduce contrast or something I guess... Overall satisfied with it"
4,"if you want to game or content creation this is not for you if you want an ips display that is cheap and comes from a reputed brand go for it.i have a benq rl2240he it has amazing blacks and grey to grey response of 1 ms this monitor is just a honda city in front of a Ferrari  //referral for current situation don't act out yes for sure there are better monitors than both what i listed but these are the ones i know and so i use them in my analogy //it is fine for content consumption or non fps or moba gaming but know this you would have to fiddle with setting to get the color accurate nerd in you satisfied, if you have no such predispositon feel free to buy without second look i got it for under ‚Çπ7500 and with direct vesa mount compatibilty this is a amazing screen for multi monitor setup. go for a 27 inch version that costs only ‚Çπ5 grand or so more than this one if you will be getting a single screen."
3,"No audio out put , no proper information about the product on the site"
2,The monitor stand is absolutely rigid. It cannot be adjusted for eyelevel or viewing angle at all.The product says bezel less - because glass reaches nearly till end of the monitor but it has half a inch thick dead pixel boundary all around - so definitely not bezel less.
3,"I needed an external monitor for my work from home setup. This serves my purpose. Since i work long hours in front of computer i need a screen with good eye saver mode, Its always ON. Cant tell much about sharpness of image as i keep it on eye saver mode.Use it only for work which does not rely much on color contrast like editing images on Adobe and etc.Even though there is a 1 pixel defect on my screen i was too reluctant to replace it, as i hardly effects my work."
5,"The only reason, I brought this monitor is for WFH. I am not disappointed from it. The picture quality and sharpness is really good and has exceeded my expectations. They should have offered a 3.5 mm jack which is missing.There is no heat emitted from the monitor at all. The brightness is a a bit to high even when set to 0, only in dark condition it may be discomforting. We have the option of eye care mode.The refresh rate is 60 fps, you can push to 75 fps with AMD free sync"
4,"I ordered this monitor , but  there is some issue in that monitor ( white spots on life and right side on top ) so I replace the monitor , after that second monitor I got on 13 Jan but also in this monitor same problem but white shadow , I think it is natural in LED monitors in under budget LED monitors , it ok got it in 7699-/"
5,"HONORABLE SIR, I HUMBLY AFFIRM AND CONFIRM THAT THIS IS A MONEY SAVING AND TIME SAVING EXPERIENCE FOR ME.  REQUEST : IF POSSIBLE, KINDLY REPLACE ONLY THE LEAD SENT BY YOU. I NEED A LEAD HAVING TWO SCREWS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE LEAD TO CONNECT THIS SAMSUNG MONITOR WITH THE C.P.U. IF NOT POSSIBLE, THEN NO PROBLEM. I ACCEPT THE ITEM AS IT IS. WITH BEST WISHES AND REGARD. THANKS."
4,"Misleading:  the country of origin is not India but Vietnam.Aside from that, it's a great monitor.The default refresh rate is 60hz but you can change it to 75 hz in display settings.Only Hdmi cable is included.Tilt is adjustable but only a little."
1,"1. Screen bleeding on the top edge & left edge on first purchase + on the replacement2. On the replacement, the left side of the panel seems like a little yellowish (and on the whole screen there is some yellowish tint thingy going on)NOW THIS IS FRUSTRATING."
5,Best you can get for ~7K.Awesome for casual gaming(upto 75 fps)  and media consumption. Response time is good and 3 side bezel less design looks very stylish.Go for it.
4,"I bought this for my PC, and trust me it works great. Its been 3 months now and i have no complaints. However, the stand is not adjustable and cannot tilt . It is a 75Hz pannel( make sure to change it in settings.) It has a eye saver mode which dims the display and makes it easier to see.Talking about the bezels, they are really thin and provide a good look to your setup."
5,"All Is Perfect, no doubt go for it üôÇ"
1,If you buy this product please check for power shock using the Electrical Screwdriver (Tester) near the HDMI port and VGA port after connecting to power cord. The Current shock transfers to my CPU as well through HDMI cable. I requested for replacement and the new product received also has same problem so I returned and bought different product which is working fine now. PLEASE BE CAREFUL GUYS by Tamil Nerdy Gamer YT
4,The problem is it‚Äôs thought to connect it. And it starts flickering if used the wrong HDMI cable (only works with the Samsung inbuilt cable). Thin bezels make it look good! Colour is good too. Worth the money. (Note it‚Äôs a FHD monitor which is 1080p)
4,Overall Product is very good. . Display Panel quality is fine .  the base is actually plastic but it looks good. .it only comes with HDMI Cable .no VGA cable Included in the package
3,I ordered and got it 3 days ago worked fine. but suddenly these white lights came up and in starting it was at one corner but slowly it started showing up on upper right hand and even below.No height adjustment or tilt.If you‚Äôre lucky you might get a better product.Has no speaker be aware of that fact.
5,The monitor is having both humidity as well as vga connectivity option the package includes a humidity cable the display is good and delivers what it promises in the specifications overall satisfactory  purchase.
2,Bleeding issue
3,Quality wise is good. But it would have been great if I could have flexibility of tilting or adjustable screen direction
5,"Just perfect, go for it, wont get better in <10K.The IPS LED Panel just blew me away."
5,This product is worth buying..... At this price range this LED monitor is top notch and have a premium quality experience monitor is full hd and its experience is unbelievably awesome.
5,Nice monitor and this monitor so slim so i suggetion budget this monitor compare to another monitor very small bleeding
3,This monitor is good. But bad thing is that panal is not very good quality. And also in this monitor has problems in top corners. There was white light bleeding. I read all comments on this monitor and i have same problem.
5,Nice product üññüèªüññ
5,Appropriate size for second screen
4,"Overall its nice, but for doing development work the size may be a bit small."
5,Monitor is good but It's no a AMD free sync monitorFor this reason its over priced I bought this 7699.In 4 jan
4,HDMI cable is included and the product is tilt adjustable.  Full HD and I use it for work and stare for 10 hours a day it‚Äôs easy on blue light.  A product value for your buck.
3,"Built and display quality is fine , and it looks good too but there was a deal pixel in the one I received as it was on lower bottom it was hardly noticeable"
5,Good Packing & Good monitor at this price range.
5,"Able to stream 4k HDR h.265 encodec video smoothly, have better saturation and contrast. Refresh rate is also good. I would have more like it if it also comes with a analogue cable along with HDMI cable."
4,Display is little brighter.. otherwise good product
5,"if you're in this budget range then with no doubt go for it. It has a really good display with free sync of course and for gaming, this size is decent."
5,Bought in 7000/- One of the best buyAH IPS OpThin bezzels Op75Hz OpLittle more Improvement needed in stand Quality And Little more Saturated üòá
3,Product is good and functioning very well. Found monitor screen full of finger print impressions. I think the vendor delivered product by opening and re packing.
5,"The monitor is great overall, there isn't any backlight bleed and the viewing angles are very great. Before finally buying this monitor I had 3 in mind and I'll tell you why I rejected those. First was Dell P2419H, the height adjustment feature was great but it was a 60Hz panel with 6-bit colour depth (6 bit+FRC), although it has a USB hub, but I had plenty of USB ports. So this was out of option.Next was the newly released Dell S2421HN, the refresh rate was 75Hz and 8-bit native colour depth also the monitor looked sleek and stylish. This was a viable option at 11K, but then I stumbled upon the BENQ EW2480, it had the same 8-bit native panel and 75Hz refresh rate but there were some other features also such as HDRi, Auto-Brightness mode and an e-paper mode. So my major motivation to spend an additional 2K (compared to Dell S2421HN) was HDR and e-paper mode. I'll talk about them one by one.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------HDRi:Here you get an emulated HDR mode and a CinemaHDR mode. First of all, when I tried out HDR it was not good, I mean it just enhanced the blacks and looked unrealistic (It was because I enabled HDR via the monitor's menu, you'll need to enable it both in Windows and in monitor's menu). After a bit of research, I found out that my Windows laptop ( i5-7200U) won't support HDR ( I don't remember the exact reason but it was that my inbuilt display supported HDR streaming but the monitor won't support it because it was a motherboard issue, i.e. some type of hardware or protocol is required in the motherboard itself). So, be ultimately sure before buying. It does work on PS4 and XBOX.Now interestingly, when viewing an SDR video the HDR feature would make it worse. But when I would watch an HDR content (on VLC of course), using the HDR feature really did gave some enhancement and colour boost. I liked it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Auto-Brightness (B.I.+):The monitor has a sensor at the bottom that auto-adjusts the monitor brightness according to the environment. I must admit that it actually works really well. Although in complete darkness(when no light is ON) I'll have to manually decrease brightness but other than that it works great.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------e-paper mode:Honestly, it is a plain and simple black and white mode. It's good for keeping you distraction-free, but I prefer the low-blue light mode better.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now I did not consider the speaker's quality while buying any monitor as I have an external speaker. But the speakers on this Benq EW2480 are significantly loud, it's louder than my laptop's inbuilt ones. Although it lacks bass, but the volume is more than enough for day to day tasks.Also, it has an ""eye-reminder"" mode; i.e. it'll give you a notification at every 30/45/60 minutes to take a break from continuous screen viewing. Useful for people who work a whole day on their monitors.Next Benq supports HDCP 2.2, while dell only supports HDCP 1.4; this may be useful for some content creators out there.Also, this monitor has a heavy and sturdy aluminium base. So it stays still and strong doesn't shake like some plastic body monitor stands."
5,"While going for a monitor and that too for entertainment and WFH purpose, the most important criteria for me is the colors. I checked some monitor at nearby store, but the problem that I see is they looked washed out. Later after going through reviews I came to know monitors are mainly focuses on showing true colors, and therefore while comparing picture quality for ex with a T.V they always looked washed out. I picked this monitor because of it's HDRi feature. In normal cases it works like charm but while watching movies and some videos I quickly turn on HDR mode and all the colors just pop out. However, its not perfect in all scenario. In some cases you might feel like switching off HDR mode is better. A dedicated button for this helps alot in switching HDRi mode.Another feature that I liked about this monitor is epaper mode, which turn the display into grey-scale mode. This feature helps out while reading books and doesn't put much stress on the eyes. Speaker quality is okay, don't keep your hope high with this speaker, for a reference you can compare the sound quality with a small bluetooth speaker.Two options are available 24 inch and 27 inch, if you are planning to code, read books frequently go with 24 inch model because you are going to get more PPI and overall text will look sharp. But watching movies and playing game is only requirement then you can prefer 27 inch model as well.Overall, I am quite happy with the monitor and you can blindly choose this."
5,"After tons of research between various monitors within the same price range, I Zeroed in on this product.  At first, I was a bit skeptical about this because of some of the negative reviews, but glad that I have a good experience with the product.  Details below starting with the Cons - cause that is what interests most buyersCONS:1. Worked well out of the box, but after a couple of weeks, my left speaker went Ka-put.  Now I am waiting for a replacement of the speaker, cause apparently the parts have to be shipped all the way from Taiwan as BENQ India doesn't have stock for it.  Go Figure !!!2. Bezel is almost nonexistent on the sides and the top, you have to be extra careful if you are someone who keeps changing positions and lug it around3. The Cinema HDRI and HDRI seems kinda forced and can be a bit overpowering4. Not so great with Gaming, my Gaming laptop as a 120 HZ refresh rate, and compared to it, this feels a bit off.  but overall does a good job still.  People who want to buy this for Gaming can look for better options from BenqPROS:1.  The Anit Blue mode works like a charm.  ASI put in long hours at work, I find that my eyes are not as tired as it used to be and is a pleasant experience2. The Speaker quality is good for a small room entertainment experience, both Voice and Music quality is great and helps when you are constantly on call.  Even with only 1 speak functional, it still throws out an impressive sound3. Viewing angles are great, no complaints there4. Overall Picture quality is great,c couldn't have asked for better5. Automatically adjusts the display brightness based on Ambient lighting - this is excellent and provides for an overall good experience6. And a screentime reminder which tells me to get some restAmazon Delivery:1.  Took longer than other products, but was still delivered within specified timelines with tight packing"
5,"Its a beautiful monitor. I dont know what to expect more for home use. I use it for my office work , got effective controls to provide ambient brightness for the work I do. There are 2 speakers at the back which are sufficient to fill an 15*15 room full of sound. The controls are good and easily accessible. I have enjoyed this from day 1 of purchase and has made my work from home more engaging. There are 3 HDMI ports and an Audio out.  I wanted to go for a 27 inch , finally backed out and go this for the epaper mode. Its really effective.  24 inch bezel less itself is massive. I added an HDMI switch and now the setup is complete. If you get a good price go for it , you wont be disappointed.  Not played too many games , dont see lag. Streaming videos are good , vivid.. and there is an enhanced HDR mode. The eye tracker is good.  Overall , I am happy for what I got ."
3,"Cons:1. To my surprise and disbelief, it has 15A power plug packaged inside the box, while the AC adapter input current rating is only 1.3A. Now I can't use it with regular plug socket unless I buy a separate power cord.2. While this is has VESA 100x100 wall mount support, you can't buy any random wall mount that supports VESA 100x100 configuration. The placement of ports is such  that all of them will be inaccessible if the holding plate is slightly larger.3. As it needs power plug to switch on, I could not yet connect to my computer at my work room. Yet to receive a regular power cord to be able to use. But to confirm it powers on, connected to a power plug at kitchen and verified. Observed light bleeding at the cornersRefer attached images.Pros:Light weightLook wise OK.-------------------------Update:After some struggle (due to lockdown restrictions) finally managed to get some 5A to 15A plug socket adapter/converter and got this going.Attached a sample photo and video with default settings.Sound is average. Not bad not great either."
5,"So many reasons to prefer EW2480 over the GW2480 but a GW2480 is cheaper and can also get the work done.HDRi / HDR emulated is not very impressive. The ePaper mode can be useful if you are into reading.For Gaming this one is better than GW2480 (75Hz, FreeSync)Speaker is okayish but better than GW2480, expect normal here.EW2480 is Certified Mac Compatible but GW2480 is not.Full HD 24inch Screen is better than a FullHD 27inch Screen. For a 27inch Screen you need atleast QuadHD or 4K."
5,One of the best monitors you can buy under 13k. Its great for CAD work. Had purchased GW2780 and returned it twice for non-uniform backlight and dead pixel issues. The first EW2480 came with backlight bleed of the left side of the screen. Gave a last chance to BenQ and requested a replacement. The replacement piece is great. I have almost no backlight bleed on this monitor. Feels like winning a lottery after three replacements :)  One thing I noticed is that the blacks were definitely better on the GW2780 with almost no IPS glow. EW2480 has a fair amount of IPS glow. I don't mind the IPS glow as 95 % of the time I will be viewing the monitor straight. The bezels are also slimmer than the GW series.  HDRi is awesome and so are the 2.5 x 2 speakers ( treVolo ). Text sharpness is decent as it has a matte finish. Eye care mode is great. The monitor is slimmer than the GW series and also looks better for sure with the HDRi logo and rounded rectangular stand. I have a Nvidia card and the monitor is detected as HDMI TV by default @ 60Hz. If you buy this monitor make sure that you set it at 1920x1080 @ 75hz PC mode from Nvidia Control panel. Appario Retail is a highly recommended seller and most of the stuff I buy comes from this seller. Monitor replacement was smooth process !
1,"I received a faulty unit today. The packaging seemed fine to me so I think a faulty unit was purposely sent to me by the seller. Amazon is sending me a replacement product. Let's see if it's any better. I went through a lot of reviews on Amazon and there were a lot of people who had also faced same sort of issues where they received a defective piece and then ordered a replacement piece only to find that one to be defective as well.I'm gonna update the review when the replacement arrivesUpdate:Been using the monitor for a while now. I'm content with it. Given the price point, it's a decent purchase. Not the very best and not the worst either."
3,"Came with large size power plug pin (Type-M: usually seen on Refrigerators, Water heaters, etc. heavy electrical gadgets with 16 amp rating) instead of regular small power plug (Type-C: 5 amp rating). My house has only two Type-M plugs - one in the kitchen and one in bathroom. So, where do I use my monitor?  Fortunately, I have a spare laptop power cable which is having Type-C power plug pin. So, I started using the monitor with this cable. Luckily, it is working too.Sound quality is acceptable. But there is no provision to turn off the picture and listen to only the music. When the power is turned off on the monitor, sound also gets muted. This is the disadvantage of having the built in speakers.I expected that e-paper mode will be comparable to that of Kindle devices, quality wise and power consumption wise. But it is not at all comparable. I am not satisfied with that feature.Having only HDMI and not other video/audio in ports is definitely a negative for this monitor.Cinema-HDR mode is very nice some of the movies."
5,"A good quality display, if it is to mention in a single line. Decent colour accuracy in this price segment.Pros :No backlight bleeding compared to other ips panels75hz free sync supported displayAnti glare coatingLow power consumption and eye care modesBi technologyHdr emulationHDCP 2.2 support and hdmi 2.0 portGood viewing anglesCons:Not much connectivity options.. only has hdmi portsSpeakers are not very loud.. but sound quality is okSlighty pricy model.. i would say.Not a real hdr..only emulation.. so windows wont detect a hdr display."
4,"its 8bit. This HDR is fake. Its more of software based. But its not bad.You will see very good pictures while gaming. But not suitable in dark regions of game. You have to constantly turn it on and off. Not suitable for movies at all, unless whole movie shooting took place in daylight (No night scenes)."
1,"My monitor had light bleeding out of the box.Benq refused to replace or provide refund by saying it is 'within the specification of IPS panel'.I understand the difference between IPS glow and light bleeding. But engineers from F1 info services and Benq were reluctant to accept. (Check pictures and videos).If you get a good monitor you are lucky, if it comes with a fault your money is in gutters. Not satisfied with customer experience. Would not recommend.PS:The picture quality and features are excellent in the monitor."
4,"Color reproduction - Good.Brightness - Decent.Color uniformity - OK.Bezel - Excellent.HDR - Emulated.Sound - Good.I have ordered this monitor after a lot of research. Couldn't find anything better at this price.Windows recognizes this monitor as a 75 Hz HDR display. However, this is not an actual HDR display. It does not have a HDR certification and the IPS panel supports peak brightness of 350 nits. But it artificially adjusts the contrast and color to produce a HDR like output. To my surprise, this works nicely for some video content.Overall, It's an amazing budget option and probably the best in this price category in 2020."
5,The product is good no doubt about it already lot of info and feedback is provided so I am not writing it anything new . The only thing i would like to mention that you need a 15 amp plug to connect the monitor or you can use a 5 to 15 amp converter which cost hardly Rs 100 rather than extension cord of 15 amp which cost rs approx 500
4,"I will first write the cons except which this is a great great purchase.Cons:1. Sound (not really good, but at least it is there, you have an audio out jack)2. Stand: no height adjustment + swivel + rotate. Pretty basic one. VESA mount holes are there which is a big plus.Something to just note which isn't that obvious but it's there in the product listing that this scree offers ""emulate HDR"" not real HDR. I feel that the cinema HDR emulation mode offers good viewing experience.Other than that this is a fantastic screen. Must buy at this price (11-13k)."
5,"*Perfect for a budget need monitor display*Thanks Benq this is what I was looking for. Not many products out there that gives many features like in built speakers, multi hdmi ports plus the vesa mount combo.The product works like a charm if you want to use it as an additional computer monitor or a wall mount tv or info display.In terms of performance  ,response rate is pretty good seamless, and no color bleeds in edges or unusual contrast in different viewing angles.Cons: the only con I could think of is it doesn't have swivel function but only up and down adjust."
2,"After thorough research and lot of waiting, was able to order the EW280.There is a supply shortage for this model, both, online and offline.Ordered on: Sept 1, 2020Seller: Appario Retial Private Limited. (at this point, this is the only seller on amazon.in selling this model)Price: INR 12,990.Arrived on: Sept 5 (as planned)Packaging:The amazon box packaging that it came in was damaged in transit, however, the product packaging box inside it was fine. Product was seal packed in manufacturer's packaging.Product build & finish:Out of the box, this product is great, premium looks.However, there was an uneven gap (<1mm) between the screen and the bottom strip of the monitor (where all buttons are mounted).Usability and features:Had bought this product over other brands for its features in this price range -1. BITech+ (Blue light control, auto flicker free, auto brightness and temperature control) - Works like a charm.2. HDRi - Did not test it with HDR source, however, when switched ON, the HD video becomes HDR emulated. This feature is basically, HDR enabled with BITech+.3. Pre-built brightness modes are great and work like a charm.4. Works flawlessly with Macbook.OSD navigation:The OSD menu and buttons are self-explanatory and easy to use.Two of these buttons are customizable shortcut keys.However, you will have to google for and download, user manual for better understanding, in case you don't have a CD drive. User manual comes on a CD pre-packaged.Sound:The speakers are good enough for monitor speakers. They hold good on max volume too. One will need to switch between the 3 mode equalizer - Voice/Dialog, Pop/Live, Cinema, depending on the need.The Disappointment:First thing I noticed after switching it ON and pulling out full screen notepad - There was a particle lodged inside the panel; it moved a little with gentle tapping near it.Very next day I have initiated return, however, would really be needing a new replacement."
4,I have ended up purchasing BENQ EW2480 over Dell P2419H and LG 24ML600M-S after a lot of research. I got this product for Rs 10791 (Republic Day Sale). Here are the things which I like about this Desktop.Pros:1) Intelligent Brightness (sensor induced)2) Slim with 3 HDMI ports3) Pixels are not noticeable i.e 92 PPI4) Color accurate5) Stereo speakers are loud and clear and does the job for most people6) HDRi (gimmick though) HDR works fine and exaggerates well and looks a lot vibrant which can be used for multimedia consumption. iCinema is an over-exaggeration of HDR not to my liking.7) Full HD for a 24-inch monitor is decent. 22 inch looks for sharper than 24 inches (102 PPI); 27 inches at Full HD may look pixelated.8) No Backlight Bleed at all.Cons:1) No height adjustment and swivel function on the stand. It is just a fixed stand that can do tilt up-down.2) No USB support3) For fully functional HDR the screen brightness should atleast reach 400 nits. The black on HDR looks crushed and the whites are blown out.
5,"Absolutely stunning. Tonnes of research doesnt go in vain. Perfect for a designer like me with strict budget.Go for it. Great colors, good brighness, little issue with color exggeration when HDR turned on. Overall fab purchase. Go for it without a second thought if you are a designer."
4,"Perfect product for general productivity. Using it as a secondary monitor and it works like a charm. Color gamut is balanced, quick changes can be made from normal to HDR mode using a separate button. IPS panel is great in terms of viewing angle."
4,"This monitor delivers what it promises.Perfect in this price range loaded with all necessary features. Note that this marketed as a multimedia monitor with a refresh rate of 75 HZ with AMD Freesync. It is not specifically a gaming monitor. If you intend to just play multiplayer FPS games, you should go for higher refresh monitor.Picture quality and colors - GoodFeatures - GoodProgramming - GoodWeb Surfing - GoodGaming - OK (Good for casual gaming)"
5,"Watching movies in HDR and HDRi (1080p) stunning, incredible picture quality, for gaming its fine and best value for money."
5,I use this monitor for editing and gaming. It's really good. Before this monitor i used 144hz TN pannel. Its good but colour accuracy is bad. That's why i bought this one. If you once click the HDR button. Then you'll love anything you watch on the monitor. It's  HDR10 pannel. Personally i love this monitor.
5,I bought this monitor for work purpose and I was surprised to see its default settings so good and bright.For Entertainment it is awesome. For working we need to change few settings so that it doesn't cause any harm for viewing longer hours
4,"Overall it is ok, I took an E-series monitor on March 14, 2021.  But if they can provide usb ports to the screeen, it will be useful to connect keyboard and mouse.  Next one is, even after changing all the settings laptop is not charging when we connect the monitor with laptop with the given HDMI cable, this should be considered while taking this monitor. Work condition wise it is good."
2,"Everything was great until I observed a horizontal line in the screen after 6 hours of use after it was delivered to me. Intiallally, it looked great but a purple color line appeared on the screen. I am not able to see any replacement option after I have purchased this. It's hardly been 12 hours since the product delivered to me."
5,Excellent monitor so far.. bought this as secondary monitor for my office laptop.. but now using it as primary screen. No glares... Not feeling any eye strain.. very good for all day use.. not tested any games to comment about the gaming performance..
5,"Purchased after a lot of research. Must say this has good design, wide bezel less display, brilliant picture quality, the eye care features work like a charm. Use it more than 9-10hrs everyday for office work. Stands true to its name and definitely performs the job for me."
5,"Good product, delivered on time. HDRi, is good. Good picture quality. Only HDMI (3) check before buying. If your CPU don't have HDMI post then this monitor non use"
1,I ordered monitor 5th May and received 7th May. But monitor back light bleeding increased in two days.
3,The usp of the monitor are the speakers. The picture quality is not great because pixels can be clearly seen.
1,"The monitor looks nice and stunning but I doubt it's lifetime.  As with in two days of usage there is red led bleeding always , so be careful while buying"
2,"worst sound, no clear sound,"
5,I got worried before ordering as I was not able to judge the fatness of the monitor.But it meets all my requirements and expectation for office work .
4,Monitor is goodOtherwise connectivity absolute cheapPlugs are loose connection in 2nd use also
5,Screen and product quality is very very goodI like it
4,HDR modes are simulted. My xbox detects this monitor as a non hdr supported one. Colours are weird on hdr mode.Rest all fine.
5,I bought the monitor as an extended display for my laptop for coding and for watching movies.It's been two days and the display looks really clean and crispy ..and the colors are good.So i would say go for it!
5,I can recommend this product....Go for it and you wont regret.
4,I like the product. There is a small amount of bleeding at the left corner edge. So I give it 4 stars. I have a 24 inch monitor and is pretty good considering the price. Go for it if you have a tight budget.
4,"The colours are great the refresh rate is smooth af.. scores 144 hz on ufo test with hdmi cable too havent  tested on the display cable coz the display cable given in the box doesnt fits on my laptop since most of the laptop have micro display cable you ll need to buy one micro display cable to dp cable adapter.....1080 p on 27 inch doesnt effect much if you are sitting too close to the monitor unless you will see some pixalation but you ll see it in any 27 inch 1080 monitor you buy  and it aint effect much i am a architecture student and i do many graphics related works and its works fine. Gamming is smooth ...preety much everything you need ...go for it . Giving 4 stars because of the display cable, .. the seller should have given a micro display  to dp port cable  too and it didnt have a hdmi cable too in the box i have to use an other hdmi cable for it thats why...rest the performance is nice i ll edit it if i have any problem in future"
5,"This is one of the best monitors I have used. I had benq xl2411 earlier which is a tn panel, this monitor is an ips but gaming performance wise I felt it to be on par with the benq monitor. I had some apprehensions earlier regarding 1080p resolution on 27 inch, but they are no more, the image looks very crisp and the colours makes everything on screen very beautiful. Different modes on the monitor actually help achieve different purposes, fps mode for instance was helpful in playing games like CS GO, where the things were smooth and dark areas visible with fps mode on. Likewise vivid mode brings out some good colours for viewing pleasures when you watch a movie. The HDR mode works, but it only slightly enhance the view over vivid mode.Overall this monitor with its price range is one of the best ones to get if you are into competitive gaming and don't want to compromise on visuals as well."
5,"I actually ordered the lg 24gl600 first but i was skeptical about the tn panel,then i saw this monitor got listed and i quickly cancelled that order and order this one mainly due to ips 144hz and hdr.The product delivered on time and the installation was super easy.Now coming to the monitor,the display is stunning for media consumption. I was worried about the 1080p on a 27 inch might look bad but its not unless u sit really close to the monitor then u can see the pixels.Games like Witcher 3 and Assassin's creed Odyssey  just look stunning.Gsync works great and the hdr option boost the color saturation too much that everything look like Borderlands.The monitor is very bright so i had to set the brightness at 6 . 1ms MBR mode works great but reduces the brightness a bit and i loved the joystick to change the osd settings.Lastly,switching from 60hz to 144 hz is a blessing to a competitive gamer and go for this monitor u won't be disappointed."
2,"When i unboxed the product it was really good. When i setup the monitor it looked good but the sharpness was very bad as compared to a 24 inch monitor , Everything feels soft and words are difficult to read . The HDR10 is also bad as expected . The colour calibration is difficult and it does not feel like an ips panel . If u are a gamer then go with a 24inch monitor. The colour accuracy is very bad. This for only those who want to watch movies and some users in office. The sharpness is very bad and freesync cannot be used with mbr. The response time is fine for normal users. If u look closely u can see the pixels. I am returning this monitor cause there is backlight bleeding too and sometimes ghosting. When mbr is on the brightness decreases too. Please only buy if u are on an budget and cannot afford an 1440p 27 inch monitor.I used this monitor with my rx 5700XT"
4,"Display is best you can get, and can easily compete with even top monitors.But text is another story, text is not as sharp, due to 1080p on 27', in my opinion 1080p is best suited for 24' below. But it is true for any full hd 27' monitor, pixelation will be there for text.It is excellent for gaming, csgo was an absolute delight on this panel.Now coming to stand - It was worst and kept shaking on accidental leg bump, any monitor will shake on leg bumps but duration of vibration was too much. It was a deal breaker for me and I returned it. (Maybe I got a faulty unit, but LG is notorious for shaky stands even on premium monitors). Buy a vesa stand or mount (they can be expensive).My Verdict : Excellent for media consumption and gaming, average for text, or coding (not a deal breaker)"
5,"First of all I'd like to mention that I purchased this monitor(27gl650f) for Rs. 19999 and its very well worth it. It is a 27 inch 1080P monitor so you really cant expect crisp images here. Many people here are complaining about its pixel density, any 27/32 inch monitor running on 1080p resolution will never give crisp images, if you want crisp images then go for 2k resolution for 27 inch and 4k resolution for 32 inch monitors. 27GL850 is a better monitor here but its almost 15k more expensive than 27gl650f so people who bought this monitor despite reading its a 1080p monitor dont have the right to come cry here for not getting crisp images, blame your own stupidity. Ok with that said, lemme start talking about what I liked and disliked about this monitor.What I liked -1) ZERO FLICKER - I've never once had a flicker issue, the screen ran flawlessly even when there were some power surges, my monitor isn't connected to my inverter-UPS line so most of the other monitors didnt handle this well.2) ZERO SCREEN TEARING ON NVIDIA GPU - I run this on my 2080super and this is one of the very few monitors that have G-SYNC at this price range so i've never faced any screen tearing issues.3) RESPONSE TIME @ Max Refresh Rate - make sure you keep RT at faster and not fastest, and the RT is roughly around 4ms but the 144hz definitely makes up for it.4) COLOR BLEED - am surprised reading that people say this has horrible backlight bleed, it has to be a defected piece because it has very low backlight and color bleed which is barely noticeable.5) REFLECTIONS - matte finish makes this monitor handle reflections very well6) IMAGE RETENTION - has 0 image retention. What I disliked -1) HDR 10 - its pretty bad, it looks more like a marketing gimmick but at this price point you cant really expect a great hdr 10 screen.2) Response time at 60Hz - its slow at this RT, average is around 12ms and its very surprising considering its avg 4ms speed at 144hz3) Build quality - not exactly a fan of ultragear build quality...most of it is plastic and the mount is pretty average. Good thing it has VESA 100x100 so wall mounting is always an option.Verdict: If pixel density is an issue then go for 27gl850 which has 2k resolution(1440p) and has better hdr10 display and better reflection handling when compared to 27gl650f but remember that it costs almost 33-35k so at this price point, this monitor is definitely worth the money."
5,"rainbow six siege, csgo just name it i play them in it and has been a good experience.color issues can be fixed through settings.my settings:1: game mode - gamer12. 1ms mbr- off3. freesync- on4. black stabilizer- 455. response time- fast6. crosshair- off7. brightness- 758. contrast- 799. sharpness- 6010. gamma- mode211. color temp- cool12. dfc- off13. smart energy saving- off14. power led- on15. automatic standby- off16. osd lock- off* black level cannot be accessed if you are running the display on display port it is only available on HDMI.*setting the displahy on response time - faster, there is slight visible ghosting which is kinda negligible but stiull if you are the quality perfection kinda guy then keep it at fast only which gets the job done blindly.*hdr is off coz the monitor is ips panel with srgb and when tweaked from NVIDIA control panel to 10bpc instead of 8bpc the quality blooms from better to best. to be specific hdr is barely needed for any genral use its just for eye candy delight and a extra feature for the product to stand out from the crowd thats it.*display port cable is 1.4 so yeah its the one to get the juice out of the product by hitting the 144 mark and also getting the gsync power if you are thinking about using HDMI then i will advice to gety a hdmi 2.0 or 2.1 cable to reach 144hz and the crisp quality that this ips can produce.*black-light bleeding is natural for ips panel so no need to cry over it things have advantage and disadvantage and this is it you have to accept it but the product i received had minimal bleed so yeah while ordering pray that you get a perfect panel or else replace is your only option.*its 27 inches  and 1080p is a question indeed as 1440p is the generic resolution that comes with 27 sizes but believe it or not LG did a great job with their engineering pixel density is less indeed but its barely an issue its perfect in its own way no doubt on image bursting or quality.upvote if helpful..take care."
4,"The Monitor (GL650F) out of the box is not color calibrated. Rated it on a low score because its HDR is washed out a bit, lots of blue tint to it, otherwise its a good monitor, if you ignore slight pixelated view due to low resolution.Here are some color calibration and Gaming related settings to get the most out of your monitor;Brightness : 68 / 0 prefered - your choiceContrast : 50Gama : Mode 2Picture Adjust -> Color Temp -> Custom,then Set R/G/B - Red = 56, Green = 48, Blue = 42Response Time : FastAMD Graphics Card : FreeSync = onNVIDIA Graphics Card : 1MS = onYou cant have both 1MS and FreeSync ON, unfortunately.This is a good monitor for consoles, but if you use it for PC gaming then its a disappointment (even the LG GL850, infact, all 1080P monitors in year 2020). If its for PC go for at-least 2K or 4K monitors minimum 75Hz refresh rate, if your graphics card is not strong to give 60FPS at that resolution or stick to 144Hz as consoles are going to be the next thing in future of Gaming thanks to Xbox Series X and Playstation 5."
1,"Product is ok, value for the money, but disappointed with the seller, there was no HDMI cable in the box, the I tried replacement still the seller sent the monitor without any HDMI cable even though it's mentioned that HDMI cable is included in the box and in the manual"
5,"Firstly the looks are superb red black theme. monitor is best for gaming, no pixelation at all while playing games or surfing the internet..1) hdr 10 support best for movies2) 144hz feels great while playing fps shooter games such as csgo my gameplay is greatly improved3) very little screen bleading from right bottom side corner not an issue at all not even noticible4) Gsync compatible as well as amd free sync for those having nividia gpu and amd gpu5) monitor stand height and tilt adjustable6) brightness is very bright no issues at all that too with really good colour and contrast ratio7) anti glare screen so u wont see any glares and reflections irritating"
4,"Bought it for my Dual monitor workstation+Gaming setup. Planning to add a 4K UK650 with it which seems to have similar Bezel structure.Pros -1. Cost effective (Got it for 20K during Prime Day sale. So wait for discount on this)2. Thin bezel. Almost 89%+ display area3. VESA Mount possible and comes with an excellent stand with height and tilt adjustment.4. Sharp and enough brightness5. 1ms response rate. You can feel it during competitive gaming.6. 1 day delivery (May change based on location)Cons -1. Can view individual pixels due to FHD resolution. Not a big problem unless you are a photographer.2. Doesn't work with LG monitor management software.3. Does not include an HDMI cable. Only Display cable included.4. Function Menu not intuitive.5. HDR mode is kinda OK, not great. (Although depends on your GPU)Overall a great monitor if you are planning for 1080p gaming, documents, office work and dual monitor setup with another 2K/4K monitor for streaming. Value for money and with LG's awesome support network across India, reliable."
5,"Perfect viewing experience. The reason i took this one was because of the entry level G-Sync capabilities (it also has AMD free sync). I have a Nvidia GPU so it only makes sense to go for G-Sync compatible monitors to fully explore the gaming experience (Farcry, Tomb raider, fifa etc). You can opt for AMD Free sync monitors if you have a AMD Radeon GPUs (these monitors will be less expensive than G-Sync ones).90 degree rotation for potrait mode is additional benefit apart from height adjustment and screen angles. No motion blur, screen tearing found."

2,"First i use Samsung 21.5inch tn panel display 60hz, so pixel is great in display bcoz 21-24inch is sweet spot for 1080p, but i need to upgrade the Monitor for better gaming. So i buy this 27gl650-f and my experience is not good bcoz of 27inch display. It doesn't mean display is bad, display is ultimate for watching movies,pictures and videos so i return bcoz my first priority is gaming, i habitual to playing in 22inch display, but i dont like 27inch for 1080p.So if u want best ultra sharp gaming 1080p buy 21-23 inch display ips with 144hz and a freesync/ g-sync compatible.I will give 5 star for best panelI will give 1.5 star for 1080p Gaming"

5,Jumping from 60 hz to 144 hz is awesome.just bought it already loving it smooth frames and awesome gameplay experience till now all over its is best in this segment nano ips 400 nits brightness.Allover my best gameplay expericence yet. morning it reached was play game till now and just like to share my experience till now.IF YOU HAVE THIS PRICE POINT IN MING JUST GO FOR IT YOU WILL THANK ME LATER:)
1,Dead pixels are for sure I returned once still got a dead pixelWorst service I had to go to the post office and ship it myself for return yes they gave me the money for it but still they could've picked it upTook more than one month for this process I had to call almost daily since they weren't acknowledging my problems
5,Disclaimer: I‚Äôm no gamer / doesn‚Äôt do editing so don‚Äôt take this review for granted if you are either of above two.:-)I‚Äôm a sucker for looks and this Monitor definitely meets the criteria. Did fair amount of research and was okay with 27‚Äù monitor for 1080P ( most of the pros suggested 24‚Äù for 1080p if you are a gamer/do editing work) as most of the work i do is as of now is from a laptop.Monitor is sturdy and strong. Easy to assemble and hassle free. Comes with a DP cable and not HDMI. NO IN-BUILT SPEAKERS.
5,"Perfect buy for gamers üî•üî•First of all the stand, which is very sturdy and magically weight balanced by the monitor itself, to adjust the height all you need to do Just one finger to adjust the height.Monitor: to get a precious 144hz refresh rate you have to use display port , hdmi can't able to provide 144hz , hdmi supports only upto 120hz, and you can see the noticeable difference between 120hz and 144hz refresh rate.. 144hz is a treasure for gamers, with a good graphics card you can easily reach 144hz in high refresh rate games. I personally play euro truck simulator with this monitor I have attached a pic from that game you can see the colour reproduction of the monitor, in real life the clarity is so realistic and crystal clear.IPS panel: viewing is so good there is no point to complaint and it also has 1ms response time which is equal to VA or TN panel..in VA or TN panel you have to sacrifice viewing angle bcoz in those VA and TN panel the viewing angles are worst.. but in this lg 27gl650f ips panel has the best viewing angle and best refresh rate and best 1ms response time for this price, which is awesome üî•HDR enabled monitor: which is actually true also it has many color modes, In that when you select HDR effect preset, you can see the colour difference magically I personally use the HDR effect which gives best colour by the monitor .G-sync and AMD free sync compatibility : no adjustments needed seperately for nvidia and AMD Radeon graphics card to adjust the monitor for graphics card output which is coolIt also has a adjustable response time, HDR (on / off), 1ms response time (on / off),cross hair function, you can adjust almost everything"
5,"This Monitor is Absolutely Bang for the Bucks. One if the Best 1080p monitors Available online.Pros:+ Clear Picture , Very accurate Colour.+ Viewing angle is more than perfect, you can even watch it from 140¬∞ angle and it won't fade any colour.+ Premium quality IPS Display.+ Solid build quality.+ Easily Provide 144Hz with 1ms Blue free Motion time.+ Adjustable Stand - supports tilt, pivot and Hight adjustment.Cons :- The Screen size is 27inch but the display is 1080p so the Pixel Density is Low.- You will see pixelation if you play 480p or 720p movies,videos. Only 1080p Content Recommended.- The Bazzels Should Have more Protective layers.- The box doesn't include HDMI Port, so if you want to use this as a secondary monitor for your laptop then you have to buy a HDMI cable Separately.- Only DP cable can support the full 144hz refresh rate, HDMI is limited to 120hz.- The HDR mode Slightly increase the Response time and You need a high end GPU to Run games with HDR and FreeSync or Gsync mode on.Overall It's a GOOD PRODUCT if you are planning to Buy a Monitor for all types of uses Including Gameplay, Watching Movies,And Editing."
4,Very good monitor got for 20.5kIf u haven't experienced 27inch 1440p in real life then u won't notice the 1080pStand is adjustable in all ways up down portrait etc but is wobbly keep that in mindColor accuracy is what u would expect from LG IPS response time is 4-7ms gsync only on DP cableNo hdmi in box 1ms response mode gets invert ghosting which is annoying and I use it at 4-7ms onlyPaired with 1660S and Chillin
1,"There is Bluish light at Left Side of the Monitor. It is more noticeable with white background. It disturbs when I do coding. I liked the Monitor But, the problem of the Monitor hunts me all time.Otherwise, With 144 Hz refresh Rate, it feels smooth when Gaming."
5,"I have never used a 144hz monitor before; this was my first.I have been gaming for the past 15 years. I predominantly play Apex Legends. I had a 21"" 60fps monitor for the last eight years, which was not great for fast-paced games like Apex. Secondly, shooting opponents far on 21 inches is tricky as you can not see them correctly on a 1x scope.Now about this monitor, I received 24lg650, which is pretty good for my standards. The movements feel smooth and strafing enemies can be tracked much easily. And I can feel the upgrade.My expectation was low for this NT panel, but surprisingly, the colour accuracy is not bad. There is a bit of ghosting in some specific colours combination, especially for light blue and light green objects that creates a dark brown trail. The kind of game I play did not affect me much. Also, keep in mind that by default, the refresh rate was 60hz. I had to set free sync to Extreme to make it 144hz"
5,"If you are using Laptop, make sure your laptop has a Type-C to display port converter to utilise 144hz because laptops don't have display port (hdmi will run at 120hz).Decent screen with custom stand for adjustable height. 27 inch is perfect if you are doing casual gaming and video editing/extra screen for coding."
5,"1) The Delivery was good.2) No defetcs3) 144hz is simply awesome4) Haven't tested FreeSync5) Perfect for gaming6) While coding, I was getting some eye strain staring at this big screen for a long time.There is no wrong with the product, I follwed these steps to overcome while coding.1) Please make sure that your sitting posture is right (check in youtube).2) Aligin the screen correctly.3) Maintain some distance from the screen and increase the coding console's  size.4) Reduce more brightness."
3,"The backlight under normal use conditions is a bit too much and hurts my eyes even at 50% brightness. If i lower it further it affects the color considerably and dark's become too dark in certain games and videos.However in general i need to keep the brightness at 30% or lower for it to acceptable not not completely strain my eyes.For me the eye strain is a deal breaker and thus it gets only 3 stars.  It is possible that other may be used to or comfortable with this  level of brightness,In all other situations this is an absolutely great monitor."
1,First of all 24inch is too much for me.second brightness is too high.144hz was giving me unforgettable headache.also its too bright and in menu button brightness can't be reduced at too low level.only price is plus.those who are migrating from small size monitor please demo before going to 24inch and 144 hz gives dizziness and headache.
1,Please note that the display port cable in the package is of low quality and will not give display (flickering).There is no HDMI cable in the package too which makes things much complicated.I tried with seperately bought hdmi cable which made the monitor work fine.
2,"The display quality of the monitor is good but there is back light bleeding on the right hand bottom corner. I tried to minimize the issue by reducing the back light brightness but it is of no use. It is quite distracting during dark scenes when watching videos. I am wondering whether to return it, because a replacement unit might have even worse bleed issue. LG needs up their quality control system. Overall I am disappointed and would not recommend others to buy this monitor.Update: I have decided to return the monitor as the back light bleed is getting worse over time."
4,"It is a great monitor.Blown away by the color accuracy and it is fluid 144hz display.Use the display port to get maximum out of this monitor.But I found one problem there is one tiny stuck pixel around center of screen and it lighted green but you won't notice it while gaming or consuming videos but you will find it when you run any dead pixel/stuck pixel finder program.I have seen so many others reported this problem.But since this seems not a big issue as I am not noticing it in normal usage I'm not gonna return this monitor.But I will take away one üåü just because of it.And for IPS bleed, I'm not noticing any major issue to get reported"
5,"Very, very good monitor. Would be even better if this supports 1440p resolution rather than 1080p. At this size 1440p is better. Apart from that, the resolution , brightness, colour calibration out of the box are all very good. Didn't see any dead pixels either. The monitor sent to me doesn't have noticeable backlight bleeding, but your mileage may vary.The 144Hz refresh rate adds to the value. Would like swivel adjustment for it, but at this price that maybe asking too much. Recommended buy, if it is on sale."
5,"Overall I'm happy with my purchase the picture quality is great HDR in games are good don't expect best at this price in videos average just one con the Balance between HDR and SDR content is not that good even if you sett brightness lowest for SDR it's little high and colors are little on cool side but overall all on this price very good monitor for gaming even it's 27"" the 1080p looks good no tearing issue just every thing is bigger cuz it's 27"" monitor and one more thing the anti glear coating on screen that's little bit less you can see little bit reflection but overall good product"
4,"Excellent Gaming Monitor Experience ‚ù§Ô∏èDefinitely should choose the one who want IPS Display with Gsync support in budget.. the one who is thinking abt Pixelization its wrong because i was worried abt that in full hd 1920x1080 may be get issue with Pixelization but seriously not even disturb u until observ deeply and i have tested 4K videos and it played so well, and it will be more good clarity when we sit back and watch.Gaming 10/10Videos 10/10Editing 10/10"
5,"First I was gonna buy an IPS panel. But in my budget only acer's IPS panel monitor was available with 144hz display. And review of those were not good. Though review of this LG panel was good, but it was TN panel. So I bought and I am enjoying playing games on this one. I got display cable instead of hdmi cable. So getting full 144hz refresh rate. Packaging was good. Color quality is good."
5,Such a amazing product from LG ultragear.picture quality is nice enough for 1080p monitor with adjustable brightness and other settings.Gaming is just amazing trying out cyberpunk 2077 and so far 144 RR works smooth...tilt angle is also nice addition...modes are also present with buildin presets..reading mode is also available.I connect it to my Lenovo legion laptop and to my PC.Coding with multiscreen support by installing software from LG website works very nicely.writing after 3 months of usage and its very sturdy with monitor stand. any 100x100 vesa mount is compatible for wall mount.just go for it!
4,"This is pretty thin for a monitor of this caliber:DThe g-sync compatibility really helps in competitive games as well as Multiple AAA titlesThis is a review after 1 week of usagePros :- 1. great viewing angles2.Gsync compatibility at this price range3. No pixel density issues4. Aux support5.sleek and slim design6.inbuilt hdr effect + hdr10 (this makes everything beautiful)Cons-1. Tilt is available only till 180‚Å∞2.Sometimes extra backlight is seen from different viewing angles3.it isnt smudge proof,so avoid touching the display during monsoon4.hdr effect sometimes messes up the pixel density5. It's a bit heavier than normal monitors so handle with caution .Tips :- 1.this monitor is a bit heavy than other monitors so handle with care AND dont forget to fix the screw at the base of the stand before mounting the monitor2.inorder to enable gsync , you need a nvidia graphics card which should be connected using a display port which is included in the box"
5,"This is really nice  monitor , has 144 hz and colours are great , and gaming is really good on this , though while watching other videos sometimes I could see pixels it's fine not that disturbing, over all its great and value for money and it's IPS if HD gaming is preferred this one is enough , this won't come with speakers mind that , display port cable is provided with the box which works fine with frame rates over all great purchase during great indian festival thank you Amazon !"
5,"Writing review after one month of use, very good monitor to use. I am not using for gaming purpose as of now. Very good finish and easy to use.  Arrived in very normal package, but company packing is awesome and pretty easy to install. One of the best in gaming monitor in this price range."
4,"Edit: Received defective product. Will change the review after getting the new piece.New review: Received a new one. Seems to have a lot of ghosting issue. Using it with mac and xbox. Xbox identifies this as a 4K TV which is messing up the fps. Not sure how to get around with it. If 4K is turned off, the HDR stops working (for Netflix in xbox).And yes, the 27 inch is a bit big for this resolution. Not a huge issue, you will end up seeing pixels once in while though."
3,the screen ha all the features physcially good refresh rate..good build quality..but the on screen display controls could have been with software instead of joystick and it would be excellent.the height adjustment could have been still lower for lowering..overall excellent choice for average gamer and very good ..not much to diagree with this one.go for it ifnu can get it below 20k
2,"The M5 32"" (‚Çπ 25000) appears to be a bang for the buck over the M7 32"" variant(‚Çπ 37000).The only two differences being -1. Screen resolution - 1080P (M5) vs 4K (M7)2. USB C to C option for 65W charging & connectivity is present in M7 & not in M5.  However the USB C to C cable is not included in the M7 OOTB package for which you will need to shed out another 1000 odd bucks to get the compatible cable and make use of the connectivity option. Huge disappointment on that front.M5 32"" is still a desirable monitor cum Tv @ ‚Çπ 25000 given the value proposition it offers while M7 falls flat, charging a bomb.For 37000, you can get a massive 4K HD LED IPS Redmi TV at 55"" against the minuscule 32"" inch 4K HD LED VGA Samsung M7 smart monitor, if you desire for a good TV. If you are just after the monitor & not the TV, 25K M5 variant would suffice more than needed.-------Detailed Review :What's in the box? üéÅ1. 32"" VGA Monitor & a stand with required screws. (Yeah you've seen it right, it's VGA and not IPS)2. Power Adapter3. HDMI - HDMI Cable4. Remote with batteriesWhat's not? üö´USB type C-C cable for 65W charging is NOT included as part of the M7 package and the feature in itself is not available in the M5 32""/27"".What's great? üòª1. TV + Monitor all in one interface, pre loaded with the YouTube/Prime/Netflix/Hotstar/Zee5/Apple TV+ apps.2. Display & visual calibration - Despite being a VGA panel, I've zero complaints on the display quality and the available calibration options. I haven't witnessed any ghosting/black bleeding regardless of the surrounding brightness. Eye Care & Adaptive Display calibration are good & I'm sure with the subsequent software updates, display options and calibrations will only grow from strength to strength.3. Seamless transition from Tv to Work & back : Thanks to the Tizen OS. All it takes is just a remote click and I'm already loving to swap between the TV & the Work Monitor without much ado or efforts.4. Remote - The best part of it all. Minimalistic yet effective. This makes the experience so rewarding. Offers the comfort from wherever you are.5. Audio quality - Oh boy, this blew me off! Nobody would've expected a monitor to perform so well in this area. The Amplification option is ""real loud"" and trust me you won't need to tune beyond 25 so not to invite the fury of your neighbours. Audio quality is exceptionally good given its price range. Hey but, don't expect the Atmos / Bass effect. It does it's job over and above. DOT. It even allows you to pair a bluetooth headset/speaker if in case you need. The BT headphone option for sure helps those late night binge watchers with parents/kids next room.6. AirPlay support - Perhaps the only non mac monitor to come up with an inbuilt AirPlay support. You can mirror your iOS / MacOs / iPadOs devices with an one time pairing. Works reasonably good although the efficacy lies in the strength of your Wifi.But make no mistake, the monitor doesn‚Äôt support HomePods / HomePods Mini yet for Audio streaming. I wish they enabled this feature. This monitor and HomePods for audio would‚Äôve summed up a quality entertainment.What's Meh? üòº1. Tizen/Samsung App Store is still evolving and you won't find a lot of Indian OTT/News apps in there yet. But all the major ones mentioned above are already available.2. Bixby Voice assistant is still mediocre.3. Not for ardent gamers. Screen refresh rate tanks at 60Hz.4. No Ethernet port making it entirely relying on Wifi. So unless you‚Äôve a strong Wifi, you can‚Äôt leverage the Tv features much.5. Wireless screen mirroring has a lag and that‚Äôs understandable.  However the wireless mirroring supports only the screen refresh rate of 30 Hz against the capable 60 Hz. As well the screen resolution is supported only at 720P / 1080P against the 4K."
5,"A perfect baby of 2 parents - a TV and a Monitor.Screen Quality - 10/10 (Best)Brigthness - 9/10Audio - 10/10 (Best)Connectivity - 1000/10Comes with an HDMI cable.This is the perfect monitor for entertainment and work.Value for money!Edit : M7 is better than M5 because 1080p on a 32 inch of M5 is pushing it too far.I would recommend to go for 27 inch M5 or the 32 inch M7, not the 32 inch M5!"
5,"Like-A dream tv cum monitor for all the workaholicsBigger screen, better view quality and easy installationDislike-Android instead of the Tizen software could have been betterNothing else on the dislikes part"
1,Received a defective pcs and now the offer is gone. Just one thing to Samsung they should really look on the stocks before launching the product. I have been waiting for it and in 30 days only couple of time I could find the product in stock.
5,"For Unboxing video, you can find it on my YouTube channel named - ""Thrifty Backpacker""What's in the box? üéÅ1. 32"" VGA Monitor & a stand with required screws.2. Power Adapter with Power Plug3. HDMI - HDMI Cable4. Remote with batteries5. User ManualBelow are Pros and Cons based on one month use:Pros:- Works pretty smooth with wonderful response time.- Performed tests mirroring iPhone 11 as well as used Airplay2 to project Phone videos, which worked pretty well. Video quality was good with no visible lag.- Majority of the OTT apps available and worked well.- Multiple control options available:1. Remote2. Using SmartThings app on Smartphones3. Using keyboard or mouse (Support of this is limited to certain applications)- Was able to connect to the Display wirelessly from PC with a minimal lag. Max frequency supported for wireless projection is 30Hz.- Even though the panel is VGA and not IPS, I found no significant difference between its viewing angle as well as picture quality.- Seamless transition if the input source is changed. Furthermore, If a Bluetooth paired device is turned on, you would get a prompt on the screen and its immediately connected once you acknowledge on-screen.- 6 batteries were included for remote, mouse and keyboard.- Efficiently able to access the web pages using the free Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.- Very strong stand.- Borderless Display with very thin Bezel.Cons:- USB type C to type C cable is not included for fast charging as well as for video transmission.- Was not able to use Mouse while accessing majority of features.- Display is not very bright when too many lights around are turned on.- Very limited applications available in app store compared to Android OS. To watch MX player, had to mirror laptop screen.- The Power Plug is 3 pin Power plug or M plug, similar to that of AC or Refrigerator Plug. You would need a plug converter for standard 3 pin Electric sockets."
5,"Pros:Display of SamsungTV with app, happy with tizen as it supports all streaming appsSamsung Dex: with supporting phone can use all appsFree keyboard and mice2 Hdmi ports, see to switch between laptop and desktopCons:Audio is okay for casual use...use external speakers or soundboard"
5,"- Excellent Monitor - Monitor Bhi TV Bhi- Surprisingly it has Airplay too on top other Apps, however those are limited in numbers. - Would be great, if Samsung allow us to add more Apps"
5,"There was a very thin line between smart tv and desktop monitors, and Samsung has bridged the gap with this affordable monitor. The 4K one (M7) is worth it if you have the budget, otherwise M5 is a value for money deal.Those who want a TV only, should not buy this though. 32"" is proper size for monitor, TVs nowadays looks better in 43+. There are many good display 43""+ 4K TV available in similar range. This stuff is primarily for regular computer monitor, with an additional benefit of a TV with remote. Its a pure joy watching ott content on your monitor with remote without the need to turn on your laptop. Picture quality is not that great, but good enough for computer monitor and your daily work. It has inbuilt speakers as well. Someone at Samsung really thought well about customers while designing this. Kudos to them.Hope Samsung will keep the price same as introductory price. That really makes it a value for money device. A higher price would confuse user between this and other TV models at this range.BTW, keyboard offer was great. Thanks Amazon. Thats not needed at all to interact with the monitor though, unless you use the inbuilt ms office 365, assuming most people will use it as a monitor for laptop/pc primarily."
5,"It is a big screen, even 27 inch it is big, I use it for office work and 2 documents can be opened side by side. Enjoy netflix in the evenings... sound from the monitor is also clear and loud... will need to increase volume to enjoy better... it is expensive by the benefits are also more... just one thing I got a 15 amp plug with the unit, and had to get an extension box for the same as my wall 15amp is far from where I want to place this..."
3,The monitor is great with decent sound. Only complaint that I have till now is that I can't see the device on MacBook Pro's Airplay/ Screen Mirroring.
5,"Excellent display quality, ease of assembling, great looks, competetive pricing, loaded features. Other than refresh rate I think nothing to complain."
5,"It's great experience to do all at one place at one smart monitor,  to watch TV shows, movies and news when you want to relax after office work."
4,Must buy if you love to learn new technology
5,Super
3,"There is two problem with these series of Monitor.1. If you connect it with Laptop and wireless mouse keyboard/mouse with monitor then you can not control Laptop from keyboard/mouse. For given office 365 access, you need to connect keyboard to Monitor.2. Your TV/Setup box remote can also access these monitors so if someone will increase volume of TV then monitor volume will also increase simultaneously and same with power-off/on.Pros:*Office 365, Remote desktop (you can connect any office desktop), speaker, HDMI PortsCons:*if you think that that it is completely replacement of TV then might be you are wrong. In this budget you can get very good 4K TV or monitor.*Most of features useless. Like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon you can also access from your laptop.  Most of monitor(with speaker) can act as TV with HDMI connection with setup box.* Some of smart features are missing like webcam, Ethernet port, audio port. You can also not control volume from remote. You have to use your mobile application for same and other features..Final verdict:It is good for professionals who is working from home. If you comparing with TV or any other monitor then it is very costly for given features."
1,"I bought through samsung store. As per promotional offer, they have give amazon prime, but, they haven't provided. Its kind of cheating the customer to sell the products. Now a days, Samsung products are no qulaity, i got two premium products as defects on arrival."
2,"A very smart product.But its a VA panel not IPS panel.IPS panel has vibrant screen very helpful for editing photos and videos because of color accuracy.For official and normal purpose,its a very good product.Samsung please include IPS panel and 4k for 27inch size."
2,So this thing costs so much and doesn't have a webcam? While being advertised as a wfh good to have?
2,"I bought M5 27' smart monitor. The endpoint of the Power cable that connects to the monitor is a bit loose.With the connector, its working fine. The sound and display are nice.I bought it with the sole purpose of using it with airplay. Too much Disapppointed."
5,Try once and get to know then tell of it has Google and other laptop features ...or otherwise it is just a tv...high in proce though
5,I bought this product because I edit videos for a living.I have a YouTube channel: KTNTECH (You'll find the unboxing and impressions video there)If you're a gamer do not go with this one.Because it's an IPS Panel the response times are a lil less and there are tad bit jelly effect while gaming.If you're a photo/video editor definitely this is for you at least on this budget.Thanks for reading.Don't forget to check out the channel :)
5,"Bought this monitor on 5th Jan 2018 at Rs. 15,499 in lightning dealFollowing are my observations:1) The first thing I noticed is that top and side bezels of the monitor are very thin which is aesthetically pleasing and gives it a premium look.2) Screen is decent and has good brightness and contrast. Not sure about color reproduction but it feels alright.3) Screen has a refresh rate of 60 Hz at 1920x1080 resolution. However it has an option of 75 Hz at 1024x768 resolution also.4) Even though this monitor has Eye Care (Bright Intelligence), I felt that the sensor adjusted brightness is on higher side for my liking.5) There is slight backlight bleed at top left corner of monitor which is noticeable only in very dark environments but overall has uniform IPS Glow.6) Response time mentioned on the box is 5ms (Gray to Gray) and I felt it to be good for FPS games. Overall, it's a good monitor for casual gaming.7) It comes with UK style power cord and needs a converter/adapter or a spike guard will work.8) The box also includes HDMI cable and the monitor has cable management as shown in product description which I felt is a nice addition to the package.Monitor has following ports:D-SubHDMI PortDisplay PortLine-in port and3.5 mm jack for plugging in earphonesThis monitor also has in-built speakers which are pointed downwards. The quality of audio from them is nothing to brag about and max volume is that of a typical tablet (my iPad Pro 12.9"" 2017 has better sound output than them) but no complaints here considering the price of the monitor.Overall this monitor is value for money product considering the price I got it for.Cheers to Amazon for on-time delivery.Feel free to ask any questions about the product, will be glad to help!"
5,"I have worked on many monitors (Dell, HP, Acer) in office and home. Never had a Benq. I will get this out of the way, my favourite brand is Dell (I have bought around 10 products). I was torn between the Dell (2717H), Viewsonic and Acer. For some reason I never had a good experience with products of HP.My requirement was a 27"" monitor. I am not a serious gamer only play casual games from time to time. The main purpose was to do programming and watching videos (and reading). This monitor suits perfectly.Pros:- Excellent display. It had a bit of light bleed on top right corner but it was just the glass a bit out. I just pressed it in and the bleed was gone.- Good contrast and viewing angles. I have not played any FPS games till now but overall the experience till now (10 days) has been smooth and consistent. The 5ms response time is good enough for me.- Although it is a 1080p display, the text and videos appear sharp, no pixelation or ghosting. Colours are uniform and even.- Bluelight filtering is good. Helps when reading a long book / article and puts less strain in the eyes.Cons:- The Eyecare feature is a bit aggressive. The display becomes too bright for the surrounding light. I just switched it to standard and set the brightness and contrast to levels I am comfortable with. The day/night light in my room doesn't differ much so I don't need to change the settings.Other monitors with similar features were around or over 20k, I got this for 17k. Overall a very good budget monitor. It also has 3 years warranty which is good and tells that I can expect a pretty long life from this.Let me know if you need to know more."
4,"I bought it mainly for its auto brightness. But, the brightness doesn't go too low there is no light around. So, I had to stop using the feature that I especially looked upon. Anyway, it's a value for money product. Good fit for someone who uses it occasionally. Not recommended for you are going to stare at the monitor for around or over 8 hours a day. For such use cases, better to go for Dell ultrasharp monitors. They are costly, but your eyes would thank you for sure."
5,"I was skeptical about this BenQ G480 eye care 24‚Äù inch monitor first. After a lot of research, I found this monitor too good for regular reading and office work. I previously had a DELL 21.5 inch monitor which that has a really thin bezel on the side and the top. Further, it is quite good in color production along with two fine speakers at the bottom.Now, for the last 1 year, I had this severe pain in my eyes as I mostly work in front of the screen. The pain gradually increased at times I couldn‚Äôt even stare at the screen perhaps, due to the harmful blue light emission. I was waiting for the shopping days to come up where I can buy a decent monitor(bigger size) and also that could help me get rid of severe eye strain.As I already use blue cut lenses I did not find the previous monitor abstain harmful blue light. And this time I have decided to buy the BenQ monitor 24 inches (Eye Care). I did not expect to be excellent in color production either I play games using this.After, I received the monitor which I purchased just for 7.8k during the festive season deal.I found the feature ‚ÄúLow blue light‚Äù and ‚ÄúBrightness intelligence technology‚Äù - uses a dedicated sensor to map out the ambient lighting to adjust the temperature and brightness of the screen which seriously I have never seen on budget monitors.Anyways, I am quite happy with the purchase I have tested and experienced no flicker issue neither extreme blue light emission after you have just switched to ‚ÄúLow blue light emission‚Äù.In addition, I received a major upgrade to 24 inches that allow me for seamless reading. Moreover, the monitor comes with 36 months of on-site warranty but sadly, you can register the monitor on their website there is no option to do that.I have seen people complaining about the screen bleeding issue. Fortunately, I did not face anything yet.I am in love with my new 24 inches BenQ monitor irrespective of having 5 ms response and limited to 60Hz refresh rate. This monitor is perfect for and reading, working for a longer duration but can‚Äôt say about photo or video editing work. I purchased the monitor mainly seeing the eye care technology that puts less strain on eyes even after continuous usage of 6 hours.I have attached several photos of the monitor and how it looks exactly. Also, I have tried to show the features that you can access using the buttons beneath the screen."
5,"This monitor is really good at this price point ( I got it for 9499 during amazon sale )Pros:1.Colors are much more Vibrant then normal LED's, i have a triple monitor Setup so i can compare this with other LED's  from dell.2.Dark and Bright values are much better differentiated.3.The best one is the price you cant get any thing better than this at this price Point...Kudos to Benq for that4. Brightness is way too much high5. Multiple connecting options ( i plugged it to my PC as well as my PS4)Cons1. There is some back light bleeding ( But that is ok even expensive monitors has minor light bleeds)At this price point i think Benq has done a great job.if you want a cheap IPS display then this monitor is for you."
3,"The monitor is well built.  Quality is also good.  However, It's painful for the eyes if you do text based stuff.  The fonts will look blurred.  It seems that 22inch or lower size monitors are best for Full HD Resolution.  24inch monitor will have larger pixels which will make text blurry and affect eyes.  If you just want a bigger monitor, spend more money and go for Ultra HD ones.  Otherwise, you may regret it as I have. Looking forward to selling mine!"
5,"The BenQ 27 is an amazing monitor the most interesting that I loved about this monitor is its slim bezels on the sides and top. I've connected it with Laptop and the output quality is uncompromised and looks good. it also has an inbuilt speaker (but I never used it because it's not good in my opinion).Moreover, the texture on the display is well finished with Matte so it could block glossiness and reflection. The monitor comes with a control panel to adjust different settings related to colors and sound. It also comes with a set of Color schemes preset, which are also customizable. Right beside the control panel buttons, it has a power LED indicator too.My overall experience with this monitor is amazing."
5,"Good product, performance is excellent and exceptional difference or upgrade in my viewing experience. Suggest the product to buy if anyone is thinking to buy one in budget, though I still have a doubt whether it is an LED or LCD as I received a manual saying LCD in the packet.I wish to buy one more if I get a clarity on this LCT/LED thing .."
5,"I bought this in late December 2019 for 12.9K. I had switched to this from a 22 inch LG monitor (model 22MP68VQ, to be precise). The color reproduction on that monitor was downright brilliant. So, when I plugged this one in out of the box, to be honest, I was somewhat disappointed. The colours looked so faded and unappealing, the blacks were nowhere near black and the overall panel appeared to be so low quality, that I almost contemplated returning it.However, when I tinkered with its settings, boy was I amazed. The color reproduction improved massively, including the contrast and brightness. I also made some changes to the Intel display driver's setting (mine is a Windows system), however, that might be different for you based on your system.First and foremost, go to ""Picture Advanced"" menu on the OSD (on-screen display), and set Picture Mode to ""User"". This will turn off all settings such as Bright Intelligence, Low Blue Light, etc. (Trust me, you don't want to keep them enabled for the best picture quality). Then navigate to ""Picture"" tab in the main menu. Here are the monitor's settings that worked really well for me:1. Brightness: 100 (you may lower it if it hurts your eyes)2. Contrast: 603. Sharpness: 54. Gamma: 55. Color Temperature: Normal6: Hue: 507. Saturation: 50Once you have tweaked settings to the above numbers, you will see it greatly improves the picture quality. However, if you have an Intel display driver like I do, you can tweak the settings there too for an even better picture. Here are the steps for that:1. Search ""Intel Graphics Command Center"" in start (this may be different for you if you're running an older driver). If you can't find it in start,  you should be able to right-click on your desktop and go to Intel Display Settings too.2. Navigate to the ""Display"" tab.3. Go to ""Color"" tab in the window.4. Leave ""Brightness Enhancement"" to default at 50.5. Change ""Contrast Enhancement"" to 48 from 50.6. Enable ""Luminance-based Color Model"". (THIS IS A MAJOR GAME CHANGER)And voila! Your these settings would breathe a new life into an otherwise dull default settings.One thing to note here is that the piece that I received had slight IPS glow / backlight bleed from upper left corner, mostly noticeable in very dark environments with 100% brightness (see attached picture). However, it is very common in IPS displays, and gets worse as the screen size increases. I didn't want to gamble with a replacement product, so I chose to stick with this one. Mine came with zero dead pixels, so I was worried about the replacement being worse (more backlight bleed / presence of dead pixels)."
5,"The product is very good. Eye care setting has options like Multimedia, Reading etc...  I usually keep Multimedia while playing games and Reading when I am coding and doing office work. I usually spend 8 hrs per day infront of PC, I didn't experience any eye strain. Vertical adjustment is not there, so if you have comfortable chair and table, it's good. Inbuilt speakers are good enough. Like other commented, I did not expect a home theatre like speakers from a monitor. Its suitable for hearing computer sounds and attending meetings with client. Build quality is good. I bought it for 7750Rs, Because of Corona pandemic prices are increasing, I don't have any option and didn't wait for the deals. I feel happy for purchasing this."
1,After using the monitor for 2 weeks I noticed that the top part of the screen has a white spot and also the edge of the monitor is open from the top (pic attached). The return date is now over. I feel cheated. Really upset with Amazon.
4,Pros:1. Tiny bezels2. Great colour composition3. Good collection of input options4. Vesa mount compatible5. Pocket friendlyCons:1. Inbuilt speakers are useless. They don't reproduce complete sound spectrum properly.2. Brightness is a bit low. Difficult sometimes in bright daylight3. Menu control system UI is very bad
5,"Display: I bought this monitor as a secondary display to aid my programming. The text display in Windows 10 is awfully pixelated and not at all crisp. If you are  buying this for text based usage, strictly stay away. I can't emphasize more. All the other display related features are absolutely miserable.Sound: The less we talk the better. The speaker volume and quality is fit for nothing absolutely pathetic sound. I don't know why this feature exists.The Bomb: You cannot return, can only replace. No matter how you try the display is ending up being garbageI gave 5 stars because most of the people only read 5 star ratings and I don't want my rating to slip through."
5,"Absolutely amazing monitor. Definitely recommended for the price. Best value for your money in the segment without a doubt. After days of research and enquiries for a 22"" monitor, and comparing it with Dell's & HP's, I ended up buying a pair of GW2283's for my video editing setup. What a delight to the eyes! Go for it without a doubt, I'm not regretting a single penny spent. Definitely at par with Dell's & HP's IPS 22"" monitors, saving you around 1k for the same performance and build quality. Maybe if you search this in your local market, you can buy it for a bit cheaper. But I had no option as such so went on via amazon.Pros-1. Although I have a dual-display setup, a single 22"" will be productive enough for most of the tasks, especially this having a 1080p res.2. This thing is built like a tank! So robust and heavy, i wasn't expecting it to be of this premium built-quality for the price I paid. This thing is HEAVY! Durability- 11/10.3. Really good panel. BENQ has been an understated brand but believe me, the actual display quality is no less than it's competition, even at comparatively lower prices. Brightness- 8/10 | Sharpness- 9/10 | Color Accuracy (in the segment)- 9/10 | Anti-glare Display- Good readability in direct light (though it reduces the overall brightness but the negotiation is worthy) | Great Viewing Angles and Adjustability- IPS panel, nothing more to say.4. I/O management deck- definitely helpful to keep things organised when you got crazy wiring all around as in my setup. Practical design.5. Also the overall packaging was really good. It came all foamed up in a double cardboard box. Good job Amazon. BENQ package was however far superior with all kinds of protection.Cons-1. No HDMi cable provided in the package, although the monitor itself has 2√ó HDMi ports. Just 1 VGA cable (of good quality) provided.2. Only tilt adjustment for the stand, no height and swivel adjustment, but that's just nit picking. Won't expect that from the segment.3. This thing is heavy. But definitely it has its benefits in terms of durability.4. The built-in speakers are just, meh! Not too loud, not too crisp and clear. Just average. Does the job. Sounds more like a mono rather than stereo, but I personally use headphones for my job so no big deal for me.5. It is not completely bezel-less design. There is a thin in-display bezel after the rim of the panel. Actually the overall bezel is more like 3mm from all sides when actually booted up. Its not absolutely bezeless as they show in the picture, but the crop is minimum.Verdict- Overall a great, robust, practical and powerful tool for your setup if you want durability, great display quality, performance and practicality. Nothing fancy, but still looks appealing, sleek and smooth to the eyes. Highly recommended to pick one of these uo, you wont regret for what you spend.1080p Res, 60Hz refresh rate, IPS panel features, robust design and build quality, premium looks, super practical. What else do you expect for 7.5k bucks?JUST GO FOR IT."
1,"Please don't buy if you are trying to buy it for macbook. It doesn't work with macbook pro even with original hdmi to type c adaptor. The resolution is not good.Benq technical teams recommendation to fix this issue was to ""use different hdmi to type-c adapter available in the market"" and pray that one of them works as they have verified it from other customers, but they are not ready to share which adapter to use. Wasted 2 weeks talking to benq customer but then they are not ready to help."
1,"Having used Dell Ultrasharp 24 in, I ordered this one after reading great reviews on it.  After trying all kinds of options for three days, it still tired my eyes in no time.  In comparison, I can work on DELL U2415 Display for hours!  I returned it after four days of wasted effort.  May be people who have given highly positive reviews for programming as well have not used Dell U2415.  The latter is pricey, but I am going to buy more of the same.  Nothing beats 24-inch (1920 x 1200) in crispness, quality, and very low eye strain!  The extra 200 pixels in width adds a lot to the comfort!Can't comment on gaming capabilities."
5,"I have been using multiple monitors over the year, I usually change the monitor in an year or so. This is just an amazing product. I have moved the TV and kept this monitor at its place as even my Sony bravia TV did not match the video quality of benq, I would give my 200% review for this product. If u like movies and want to watch 1080p videos on YouTube this is best. I am amazed that I spent 6000 rs almost twice a year buying bad monitors but this is best monitor with real life feeling of videos. Buy it u won't regret it.Anyone who has visited my house has said that this is a amazing And videos looks like life like video can't explain. But this is the closest I have gotten for the past 14 years to a monitor which is TRUE HD"
1,"After seeing so many good reviews, I got this monitor hoping I‚Äôll get a good product but was disappointed. Seller was Appario.Firstly, the amazon packaging was torn and damaged from one corner. It shows how carelessly they have handled a delicate product like this.Coming to monitor:1) I see the bottom bezels are not uniformly aligned to the screen, this was causing heavy screen bleeding from bottom.2) It claims it is an IPS display but it‚Äôs just a cheap LCD. The blacks and dark colours are horribly faded. Details are lost in shadowy parts of scenes.3) It claims to have 178 degrees viewing angle but if you‚Äôre sitting even 45 degrees from the centre the details start to get faded.4) And about speakers I‚Äôm still wondering why they even bothered putting that in the first place. Total wastage.I don‚Äôt know if all the monitors are like this or if I got a lemon. I‚Äôm starting to doubt that this is a refurbished monitor and used a cheap IPS or LCD panel which gives its such a faded look, but the other reviews said that it‚Äôs ok to have that much backlight bleed into their screen, so maybe it‚Äôs the product itself. Anyways I‚Äôm not happy about the product being an IPS display behaves like a 10 year old LCD models.Either ways I‚Äôm returning it never to buy this product again. I‚Äôll rather check the new LG or Samsung models which I hope would give the IPS display of the quality which they claim on their products."
3,"I have worked for fair amount on some really good monitors and this isn't one of them. Only reason I bought this is because of 5 star ratings. Most people who have rated it 5 stars have probably not used a good display before and they got amazed easily after purchasing this. But believe me DO NOT buy this if you have already used a good monitor like Dell or Apple. You can purchase two for dual monitor setups because both have mostly similar colours. Let me tell you why I'm saying this.Pros: Cheap, Sturdy construction, thin bezels, non glossy finish unlike Samsung's or LG's ugly shiny displays. Thats it.Cons: very poor color calibration, in some cases the colours are just worn out and in some cases it gets overexposed,Speakers...they suck 2/10 score,The ports, there should have been at least one display port.Brightness (it is too bright on its default settings, you can keep it that way if you want some more addition to your electricity bill)Saturation, hue options are useless and only makes it look worse.The eye care tech is nothing but a gimmick.I have been using a Dell 21.5 inches monitor for almost 7 years now and even now its a lot better than this Benq one. My Dell monitor has thin borderless bezels, accurate colours, a good display screen and even has the ability to overclock from default 60 hz...I've raised mine to 74hz.Honestly if Dell was selling this monitor right now, I would have purchased it without a second thought. I had to purchase Benq because I needed something cheaper.Instead of the useless speakers and stupid eye care tech, they should have made a better panel with accurate colours and brightness.I am disappointed.Update: After many-many trail and errors and web research, I am somewhat able to adjust the monitor's display to somewhat accurate colours. Still I won't recommend it to people who have already used a good display."
1,"I brought this product thinking the best and I made a great mistake, I picked this over DELL that I repent till now. The first 10 days the product was good after that spotted a small line in the middle of the screen. I have registered a complaint with the team REF: R200301312 and no one bothered to reach me till now. Escalation number 9560055022 was also not reachable. If you want to spend your hard-earned money put in a well-reputed brand."
1,"I ordered the item on 24th June and got delivery on Delivered 30-Jun-2020. Amazon Packing was excellent to avoid any damage to the item. I started using it on 6th July. On 12th day; Friday 17th of July, there was a flicker on the screen which was hardly noticed. On Sunday 19th July afternoon there appeared vertical lines covering 3/4 of the screen from bottom.  Reached Amazon to check what next; as 16 days replacement period after delivery date expired, I was advised to contact BenQ customer service. Sunday being a holiday for BenQ customer care; I opened a complaint with BenQ customer care, hoping to get a resolution.Manufacturing date of the product is April 2020 and product having 39 month warranty from manufacturing date or invoice date which ever is earlier is the only hope to get this one working again. Fingers crossed. I'm not giving any rating as of now; as it is too early to comment either pros and cons of the product. Will write a feedback after the product is fixed and continued usage for a month or so.&&&&&&&&&&&&& experience after monitor replacement.&&&&&&&&&&Replacement item received on 18th August. Using the item till then for 5 days a week almost 9 to 10 hours. It‚Äôs time to rate this product... it‚Äôs a great product and happy with the purchase. No issues with the replacement item at all. Overall I recommend this product if you are looking for a good monitor for daily use."
1,"I purchase this monitor on Oct 21,2020, I could not able to switch on the monitor due to  3 pin power cord(cable) is not able to insert any of my switch box or extension board which is big and not fitting and I contacted the Amazon customer care they said better to buy a power cable or plug separately which is really not expected from the Benq and I felt 16A cable unnecessary here, please consider this point while buying this monitor."
4,"Overall the monitor is great but there're a couple of issues I would like to point out.Being an IPS panel, this monitor suffers from back light glow.  Blacks are not fully black. This is not noticeable if one is working in well lit environment. However, in a dark environment at night it does cause eye strain.The buttons on the monitor are physical push buttons. It would have been great if they were touch buttons. Physical buttons tend to get defective over a period of time."
1,"When the product arrived, it was sealed in a thick box and multiple layers of plastic. But eventually when I got to the sealed tape, I found it had already been broken apart. I decided to test out the monitor instead of returning the opened box and that was the mistake I did. After 10 days, the top half of the screen on the monitor  became dimmer and duller for no reason. There is absolutely nothing great about this monitor to write about."
4,"This monitor has met all the features that I need for it's price. Here is my review for Benq GW2780.The good -- The monitor is well built and beautifully designed with all the matte surface and textured plastic. It looks clean and simple.- I am very happy to find no Backlight Bleed at any part of my monitor which is very prominent among IPS panel based monitors. There is just the ""IPS glow"" which is completely normal for an IPS panel.- The viewing angles are excellent.- The monitor size (27 inches) is big enough for all the entertainment needs.- It has a popular and standard resolution of 1920x1080 (Full HD). I'd say that this resolution for a 27 inch monitor with 81 PPI (Pixels per inch) isn't really that bad, which means it is good enough for text based content and other entertainment.- It has some inbuilt features called the ""Low Blue Light"" mode and ""Brightness Intelligence"", which works great in reducing strain if you work for several hours. Brightness Intelligence feature automatically adjusts the monitor's brightness by sensing the lighting conditions in the room without needing to change the brightness manually.- Many connectivity options including the DisplayPort, two HDMI ports and an audio port.- The pixel response times are really good. You can find no issues in fast paced FPS Games.The bad -- The inbuilt speakers sound really low.- There is some weird bug in the OSD (On-screen Display) menu of the monitor, where changing the Gamma value doesn't change anything in the picture. But, it doesn't really matter because the default Gamma value is the standard anyway.Conclusion - This is a nice, all feature packed PC Monitor for it's price, you will never find in other monitors, at least for now. You can go for it!"
4,"I purchased this monitor for the sole purpose of using it as a vertical monitor. My job requires me to read a lot on my PC, and ever since I started using one a few weeks ago, vertical monitors have become indispensable in my Work From Home setup. This is my second such monitor, the first one been a Dell P2419H, commendably serving my requirements in the office. At home, however, I felt the need for a slightly larger screen; one that can be kept at a distance, so that my study table isn't cluttered. The Dell P2719H was my first consideration. Its asking price, however, far exceeded the budget I had allocated for the purpose. My second option was the HP E273 - again, priced as much as the Dell, so was dropped. The third option was a model by AOC (a brand I didn't know a lot about). It seemed to tick all the boxes, and in fact I even ordered it. And that's when I came across this new Prime Day launch by BenQ. It was going at ‚Çπ17,500, a good ‚Çπ3500 less than the Dell's asking price. So it didn't take me long to convince myself to cancel my AOC order, and opt for this BenQ monitor instead.On its own, this is a good monitor, and one that does its job well. Its when you have the luxury to compare it with another IPS panel, that you notice the shortcomings. Like I said, the IPS panel on the BenQ GW2780T is good, but Dell's panel is better. The build quality is good, but Dell's is superior. The BenQ's speakers are rubbish, and my laptop's internal speakers are way better. No, seriously. The speakers on the BenQ are terrible, and aren't even loud enough to justify their inclusion. The Dell, on the other hand, did not even bother to mount any speakers, for better or worse; instead, Dell comes with a built-in USB hub, which is a far more useful feature to have. It has 2 USB 3.0 ports, and 2 USB 2.0 ports. The slower USB 2.0 ports are useful to plug in your wireless keyboard/mouse dongle, and the the USB 3.0 ports are always useful to have if you wish to leave your portable HDD plugged in (haven't tested their transfer speeds). Hands down I'd opt for Dell's USB hub feature over BenQ's terrible internal speakers. Both Dell and BenQ offer matte finish panels, which are inherently less reflective, unlike the HP E273, I think.EDIT: Please ignore the following paragraph. Turns out I am wrong. But it doesn't affect my final rating for the product.

Lesser backlight bleeding and better colour reproduction are two things that I immediately noticed. Also, the viewing angles are better on the Dell, although both BenQ and Dell house IPS panels. Then again, BenQ's panel is more than sufficient for my requirement, which is to read documents and articles in the vertical position. Both the panels appear to have a similar set of additional features, with one model offering something that the other doesn't, and vice versa.To sum up: but for the significant price difference, I would have opted for the 27"" version of Dell's offering. But that doesn't mean that BenQ's GW2780T is a bad monitor by any means. In fact, on its own, I think its a very capable monitor, and its capabilities match my requirements sufficiently. But if and when you do find the price difference to be negligible, I would suggest you opt for the Dell's offering. You will not go wrong in opting for this BenQ monitor. Its just that Dell is better, and it costs a lot more."
1,"Initially I ordered for 27"" monitor, and I received 24"". Then it got replaced. And then at very 14th day after I got the replaced product, It's main board got damaged and I was unable to connect using HDMI cable. When I complaint to BenQ Head office at Gurgaon, The team is totally incompetent. Their Manager Deepak Khurana is on leave, and his represent member Om Prakash himself says that he cant do anything without Deepak. Let him return from leave. The entire team just play email - email within their own team only, and the customer just watches the show as an Audience. It's almost a week now and I have still not got any result.I would urge every buyer to not buy this product ever as I have lost my 12k in this plus I am on leave for my office for not having monitor. These salary deductions are extra losses for me"
1,"The monitor is indeed good but of substandard build quality. I purchased it in August 2020 for 8k. Till a week back it was working fine and then suddenly when I wake up one morning there is a black line on the screen. I contacted customer support. They registered the call but when the technician visited he said it is damaged and I can't do anything, you better buy a new one as the cost to replace a panel is the same as this monitor (WHAT?). I was keeping the monitor really well and it did not fall at all, had it fallen it would have had some dents, there were zero dents and scratches. In this Oct sale, I purchased the Dell Monitor which should last longer than this BenQ thing. I really thought well of the product after reading the reviews but it indeed turns out of substandard build quality.Poor aftersales support."
5,"First Things First:You need to activate the Eye Care feature in the monitor. It is not ""ON"" by default. I realised it after 3-4 months of usage! :/Replacement under warranty:My initial monitor developed a vertical line after 3 months of usage. No particular reasons for the line. Raised a complain with the BenQ customer care in their prescribed format. They immediately accepted the fault and agreed to replace the monitor under warranty.Got the replacement of the monitor in 4-5 working days. No hassles, no paperwork. Appreciate the quick and professional response.Coming to the monitor:My usage is extensively for work purpose and seldom for watching movies.This monitor meets both my requirement. The Anti-glare feature is particularly impressive. I also work late at night, with the lights switched off. The monitor auto adjusts the display brightness according to the light in the room. However, this feature has to be activated from the menu in the monitor.Overall - Go for it if you are looking to buy for work purpose and little bit of videos/multimedia."
1,"Received unsealed / tampered pieceThe delivery agent has opened the seal to keep the invoice inside the box - yes sounds very stupid to hear to such stories used to cover up.By the way the Amazon invoice was found inside the box justifing the story, the Benq tv production team got a dream that I am gonna purchase through Amazon, so they typed my address etc on an Amazon invoice kept it in the box sealed it partially."
4,"The blue light filters works well and make it comfortable to read for long time... bezel is narrow...only issue I am facing is that when blue filter is enabled in reading mode monitor does not allow to vary brightness or other picture settings...it's prest...without filter enabled settings can be varied. The auto brightness adjust is an added feature, though it works... It does not make much difference to the picture....in addition to providing setting to vary sensitivity they should also have provided gain"
4,"I have purchased this item from Amazon, I have paid Rs.7890/-Pros:1. Design which will attract you first.2. Eye protection display3. Sensor to adjust brightness4. Dual HDMI5. It comes with a small speaker (Don't expect a good one, but within budget this is a good thing)6. Audio Jack if you needed.7. 3 Years warranty8. Cable management deckCons:1. Brightness is saturating when you watch netflix or youtube.2. No HDMI inside package, instead you will received old VGA cable.So basically it is perfect for budget.## If you are a Macbook user and want to use it as external display then go for it.Tested:1. MacBook Air 2015 (Os Catalina) - Working with (Amazon Basics Mini DP cable and Bluerigger)2. MacBook Air 2017 (High Sierra) - Working with ( same above )"
1,"i ordered my first monitor on 7th June and it had problem with the lcd it had a hairline crack near the right bezel of the display, as I saw the crack I immediately placed a replacement order and it came in just two days on 9th June but the replacement had a bigger issue the top bezel wasn't fully glued in so the dust would've sneaked the way into it destroying the display and thank god that I returned it quickly in my amazon return window cause benq customer care sucks I called them emailed them but no one helped me with this issue so I ended up returning it and getting my amount back, Now I've ordered dell P2419H I should've ordered it first hand cause dell has quite the reputation for the quality displays,picture quality is great if you can get a good monitor for them also color accuracy is great too but the light sensing feature is kinda buggy when you switch the color presets,go for this monitor if you have time and you believe in luck cause sure enough my luck wasn't the great with this monitor.i'd say that spend a couple thousand more and go for the dell or any reputed company which is recognized for its customer service.i hope this helps"
5,"**Update*After 2 months of use. got vignette effect on screen. Waiting for Benq Service center to fix it :(1. 27inch FHD IPS display is great to have for work.2. The Vertical monitor setup by rotating the monitor is also a good addition, I wish the screen rotates/changes from portrait to landscape automatically instead of setting the display settings on macbook pro.3. Swivel on 24 inch monitor rotates the neck of the monitor where as on 27 inch the neck doesn't rotate on swivel the monitor base has a movable pad so the entire monitor can be moved but not similar to the GW2480T (24 inch model)4. Cable management is good, I like the thoughtful ness went into the monitor handle on back, very handy one if you want to move monitor.5. Brighness intelligence with EyeCare features are great additions."
4,"Update:Bought it after some time and this unit seems to be defect free. Although its only 1 day, will test it for few more days but overall value for money device.I bought this one after a long research over Dell P2419H. The vertical mode is really useful for long document reading with less scrolls. Stand is really nice and build quality is good. It does not shake even at max height.Brightness and colors looked natural. Although I received a defective piece and in right 25% portion there was bluish tint. It is panel defect and can not be fixed. I returned on same day and now waiting for some time. because i believe if I order again they will send me one from same batch which can be faulty again."
1,"I purchased this monitor 6 months before, and now I am starting to see eye visible (70%) of the screen with yellow light bleed. I logged a complaint for replace and they just gave back the same monitor saying all is OK. I then logged another complaint, and called the company managing the support services, the person was not helpful just stubbon saying this is not a problem until the complete screen is dead. Absolutely useless BenQ support. It is not about photography monitor, its a simple IPS screen issue, I have used IPS monitors all my life and I know about light bleed. I have now given an order for Dell ultrasharp 24inch which has great warranty support stating ""Even if a single pixel is brighter we will replace the complete screen"". And hence I will always recommend buying dell monitors, please!!. I tried to find the receipts of Benq support, but I probabibly thown them into trash long ago."
5,"""A Normal (Not a Gamer or an Editor) User's Perspective""‚úÖDesign : Almost Bezel-less seems Attractive.‚úÖPanel Quality : Excellent (No bleeding and nice Blacks for an IPS).‚úÖPicture Quality : Excellent Colors (Can be tweaked up or tweaked down using Control buttons according to the preferences).‚úÖConnectivity : HDMI (In the box) and VGA.‚úÖAudio : Speaker is not worth it but 3.5mm Audio Jack is useful.‚úÖOther Features : Brightness, EyeCare Sensor (Some might find it useful)‚úÖAssembling : Fitting the Stand is a Two-Step process (Just follow the Manual) also Wall mounting is possible it seems.‚úÖMfg Date : March 2020.‚úÖSeller : Appario Retail Private Ltd (Safe Packaging and Quick Delivery)‚úÖConclusion : At ‚Çπ9490, it is ""THE BEST"" surpassing other so-called Tier-1 Brands atleast in terms of Features."
5,First of all this is my very first product from Benq.I am not that much aware of this company. I am very much confused before buying this product anyway after continous search on Internet I made a list for the 27 inch monitors to be purchased. Almost all leading brands monitors are above 18000 rupees however I got this product below 15000 rupees. The performance of the product is awesome. I bought this monitor for reading purpose especially for the PDF reading in a very big screen. This screen serves the purpose with reduced glare and good clarity. Those who want to purchase a big screen with reduced price with good performance and good clarity you can buy this benq 27 inch monitor.
1,"Not that great,, because contrast is not that great ... Cause lots of eye strain !!! Full hd quality is not up to mark ... ... It's not smooth ..."
4,I just lifted the monitor with both hands and placed it elsewhere for cleaning. When i powered the system on it is displaying like this. plesae dont buy this monitor unless you have exceptional handling skills. This monitor would not last an year with regular handling. I am generally very careful and aware the thin edge to edge design is fragile. But still the internal LED panel broke like chocolate wafer. The panel doesnt have any support. Sleek is good looking but not long lasting. HP refused to provide warranty service for this damage.
2,"The monitor worked flawlessly and I was very happy with it, till one fine morning it refused to power up. Though the LED at the rear power connector glows, the front LED and the screen show no signs of life.Being under warranty, I contacted HP Customer Care. They agreed to replace it within 3 business days. It has been 2 weeks now, and at every follow-up, I am being assured they have ordered a replacement, and it will be delivered. In my latest interaction, I have been told that the service center needs to replace a part and not the entire unit, and they do not have the part in stock yet. Such replies leave me speechless, with the rep. keen on closing the interaction.I am sure you will understand the frustration of a customer who is suffering for no fault of his and losing productivity. A brand as big as HP has failed in its commitments.Update: After several rounds of follow-up, I got a replacement monitor with 620 backlight used hours 19 days after reporting the issue."
2,Display is not proper at top left and on top screen. as displayed in image. Requested Amazon to replace it
1,Color problem.white not pure white black color not pure black.allover yellowish tint on screen.left side monitor is hp and right side is LG.LG monitor color is better then Hp
1,"This product has 3 years warranty period. All of a sudden the monitor started flickering. Reached out to HP customer service as it was under warranty period. I sent a few pics and the video to customer service for their initial validation. The customer service later told me there is physical damage as their internal technical team conveyed and they cannot give me onsite support. But simultaneously they don't give me any confirmation on the wrong diagnosis of physical damage. It means that HP's customer service is in doubt that there is a chance that their diagnosis is wrong. Ultimately they did not provide me any support despite multiple requests. In India, the legal system is so poor for consumers that this type of company takes benefit from it without any hesitation. I heard -ve feedback about HP customer service but today I faced it and believed it."
4,"Pros and Cons have been listed in lots of other reviews so you can check them out.For the price point, it's really nice. The IPS panels make things look really good. The colors are vivid and bright.Gaming:It's certainly not a gaming monitor as it's 60 mhz / 6 Ms display. But then again... You getting a 24 inch IPS 1080p monitor for under 10000.Work:Depending on what work you do, it could be best or waste. If you need high fps and low response then you should check another monitor else this is nice.General Use :For general purposes, it's really a nice monitor. For browsing, watching movie or something it's really good. Of only it had an Audio output, you could even use it as a TV.Verdict:For any purpose that doesn't require too much of frame rate or fast response speed, it's an awesome monitor"
2,I received a faulty product. The screen turns green upon waking from hibernation.
4,"Really sleek design with nearly invisible bevel. Very good value for money. Only limitation is neither the height nor the angle is adjustable. I prop up the monitor stand on a book to adjust it, spoils the looks"
5,"For the price, it's pretty much perfect. You don't get any of the fancy ergonomics adjustability of the more expensive monitors but frankly it's a easy tradeoff to make when you are getting a (mostly) bezel-less IPS display with great color reproduction.One caveat here, if you're connecting this to your PC, make sure the Dynamic Range is set to Full and not Limited. I thought the monitor was looking rather dull out of the box (and was pretty dissapointed tbh) but once I changed the setting in the Nvidia Control Panel (AMD/Intel users will have their own control panels), I was happy with the results and had no complaints after that."
4,"The product was delivered by amazon on time. Delivery was serviced by amazon so no complains. On opening the box, I found all the required attachments like stand, Power cable, HDMI cable, VGA cable out of the box. So no running around to buy cables. It was like a plug and play stuff. Picture quality is good, built material is great, pedestal is stable. No heating issue. It is good for programmer to open Visual studio, Android Studio or IDEs in big screen. Great for viewing Excel sheets. There is slight yellow glare, but that that is visible only when you put pictures on display. Great for technical users."
4,"Monitor is stunning and has excellent picture quality, I cannot give 5 coz it comes with a cheap China made power adapter. I had to replace one piece earlier as the power cable on this cheap power adapter was missing"
1,"Worst product ever. Noticed massive back light bleeding from day one . Put it on replace , the replaced screen i received was even more defective had dead pixels issue. Don‚Äôt ever buy monitors from Amazon."
3,"Pros1. Installation is easy.2. Simple plug and play feature. Comes with hdmi and vga cable.3. Simple design. Not too complicated features.Cons1. Picture quality is not very great. It says Full HD but I don't think it's best in class (in this price range) in terms of picture quality.2. Range of motion of monitor is very limited. it can tilt a little back and front that's it. Height cant be adjusted. Neither can orientation be adjusted.Overall:Although it's not the worst product, I am pretty sure at this price range you can get a better deal."
5,"Very Sleek and minimalist design.Great viewing angles and no Glare.Great Picture clarity and Brightness.Ideal for everyone.Just don't use HPEnhance+, it oversharpens and degrades image."
3,"Hello guys, here are the very genuine reviews:I ordered it on 4th june 2020 and was delivered to me on 10th june, but due to backlight bleeding issue I have to get this replaced. So on 18th june, the old one was taken by delivery agent and the new one was delivered. But still the new one was have little corner backlight bleeding issue.Now I have did a lot of research and got to know that many of the IPS display monitor have little of bleeding issue. This issue is not only on HP but for the other brands monitor I have almost read the same reviews.I am not sure if this blacklight bleeding gets increases with time. May if this would be the behaviour then I think 3 years warranty period is the backbone for such monitors."
2,"I made a bad choice to buy this monitor. This should not be called a monitor. A monitor is supposed to be watched from a close distance... 2 feet or so... And from this distance, you see pixel patitions. I am sure a monitor of 7-8K will give same or better quality than this. I ahve used Samsung, Benq in the past, which were better than this in quality for sureI tried to return it, but it only give me option to replace and not return... Which is again bad.By the way, I have tried all inbuilt settings of the product to see if I could correct the image quality somehow... But nothing helps."
5,I have been using my Lenovo think pad provided by my company and it was bit too small screen when I need to open multiple files and consoles to work on..... so thought to look out for a monitor and then zeroed down in this one HP 24es.... read reviews that this one is good for office work and wow this is superb looking and crystal clear picture quality.... I am loving it as soon as I setup it .will provide review post few days Usage . But first impression is that go for it . I had placed order on 25 aug 2020 At 10 pm and git it delivered 16 aug 2020 At 12 noon .... super fast delivery .
4,"Ok.. Screen is slim and stylish in look, but apart of being looking good screen also use to have good colours . But it seems like after the 1 month of use screen starts developing yellowish type colour spreading in the each corner of the screen.."
5,"Good monintor for home office use and basic coding setup, this is not a gaming monitor but can do basic games well but for games that need higher refresh rates please look else where.I use it mostly for home office use and that it does pretty well the screen pixels could have been better but overall a 4 star product."
3,"After i finished the physical setup i am setting the brightness, so i pressed the button below and i feel like the monitor is falling later i realised that there is a problem in the stand and i opted for replacement. But i had the same issue with the replaced monitor also.I had an hp 22f monitor in home which does not shake while pressing the buttons even it is 2 years oldWhat i want to conclude is this 24es series has this problem. Please dont buy this monitor unless you are ok with the shaking monitorOther that that its a great monitor from hp"
5,"Undoubtedly this is the best budget monitor. I got this in a deal for 11k bucks. It comes with power adapter, HDMI and VGA cable. Easy to assemble and configure, light weight. I would recommend getting a good dust cover to protect it. Perfect for multiple applications, I bought this for reading specially PDFs and surfing internet while being connected to laptop/iPad."
3,"Pixels are visible on screen, 1920√ó1080 pixels are not sufficient for 24 inches monitor..I returned and bought 21 inches monitor with same 1920x1080 pixels..Go for high resolution when you want big size monitor.. calculate pixels per inch and buy.."
5,Using this product for last six months. No issues.Pros:Picture quality is goodResolution is goodColour is vivid and contrast is goodStable supportGood pricingCons:No adjustable standPower cord becomes loose if we move the device while operating
5,Absolutely love this monitor from HP. Have purchased it twice. Knce before for my brother and totally satusfied with it. Comes with HDMI cable too. Easy to connect. The display is perfect
5,This is a nice sleek monitors. Colors and picture quality are as expected. The glare from the reflected lights from window are minimum. I use it for work so I have no experience if the refresh rate is good enough for gaming or sports videos but I did play some movie trailers on YouTube and they look good.
1,"Its very  low quality product. Not even LED. its LCD monitor with backlit led, dont go for thisI am not able to read , write code in this monitor. They dont accept returns also . very awful.spend few more penny and buy original LED ."
5,"Hi all,Well, this is first-ever HP 24inch PC I'm using right now which I brought last year frankly speaking this product from HP is truly awesome because of its awesome design, picture quality & overall look & feel is truly awesome. So I do like to recommend everyone to buy this awesome PC from HP in their 24inch monitor segment.Thanks,HP & AmazonSandeep RanaFront-End Developer"
5,I gave three stars for gaming as there are no in-built speakers.I mostly use it for photo editing.The edge to edge display looks nice.
4,In love with bezzelless design.rrally minimalistic design bt hp stand is all metal n built quailty is good..4 star bcoz find lil bit of colour bleed from behind f panel from edge of scrren.bt can be seen from certain agnle..not thw deepest black as comapred to my dell monitor.bt still great.no reflection whatsoever.helps in working against light.amazon service is good.thought once to replace it with dell  bt kept it as got it in awsm price of 10700 after discount over offer price of rs11900.. Even offline retailer said it will cost around 15k. So saved lot f money.thnx to amazon.
4,Looks good and display is also good. Didnt check with movies n all but to connect laptop and work its working fine . Up down screen rottation is there but just 30-50 degree. The only drawback is height adjustment is not there.More about it will come to know once we use it for 1-2 week
4,"The overall look for this monitor is fantastic and has a premium finish. But during the night, we can easily know the positions of the LEDs.  This is disappointing, especially with the brand like HP.  Also, it lacks vertical position adjustment feature, which lower brands are giving at a much lower price."
5,Pros:1. Great value for money2. Sturdy3. Picture quality is great4. Frameless design is good.Cons:1. Weight on little higher side.2. Controls should have been in bottom and not on the back side.
3,"LED Monitor is excellent in quality but delivery was totally dissatisfactory  , Since morning delivery boy was  ignoring the call . I received it after many complaints on customer care.Amazon cares but not Courier department  but anyway HP monitor is highly recommended."
5,I was confused between benQ 27 In and HP 24 Inch. but after using it for 5 days I am happy with my purchase and this screen size is perfect for you. Haven't used it for gaming tho.
5,"Great viewing angles and no Glare,Very Good and Great Picture clarity and Brightness.The edge to edge display looks nice,Ideal for everyone,I am happy with my purchase."
4,"Does what it says. FHD quality rich solid. Excellent design. Looks good while turned off, and even better when it comes alive. Viewing angles are pretty good. Got a great deal at 9100‚Çπ. Great alternative to the 22"" LG monitor if the price is comparable."
5,This monitor has great pixels with very little backlight bleeding and I don't know why others are saying so but this has a great value for money. It comes with an HDMI and a VGA cord however I only use it with the HDMI cord. It is also good for gaming as I just plugged in my PS4 and it worked like a charm with a great response time for an IPS monitor.SO FAR SO GOOD
5,Ordered this Monitor just before the COVID 19 WFH started... This product meets all my needs. Bezel are negligible and the monitor is good to view all your applications. I have not used this for gaming purpose or watching movie so irrelevant me to comment; but a very sophisticated product if you are looking for an additional monitor to work from home.
5,"Initial thoughts after 1 week of use -1. The screen quality is great. Renders sharp and colorful images.2. Matte finish on the screen helps with high-lighting environments.3. Screen size is ideal for home/office use by engineers, growth folks, marketers, readers etc."
5,Loved the monitor. There is no lag while using and also it looks beautiful. Not too heavy to move around if needed also. Plug into power and connect a hdmi or vga port with your laptop and you are all set. No complicated set up needed.
5,Monitor is stunning and has excellent picture quality
5,"Hi Dear,I am very happy to buy this Monitor. Picture quality is good. I was waiting for last three months for amount to be reduced. Finally it is reduced from Rs. 9500 to Rs. 7999. Then 10% cashback offer in My AMEX card.* Picture quality is good* Looking fancy and decent design.* I was brought for this developing purpose. So now feeling good for my eyes working in late night.* HDMI Cable not available only VGA Cable.* Edges are not properly fitted. But okay."
4,"Slim and very stylish monitor. Picture quality is good. I am using macbook so cannot compare to retina display. But at this price point, I would say this is a excellent piece.The highlight is the metal stand which is stylish and sturdy. Many monitors don't have metal Base. I love the Matt finish on the stand and love the black finish.Just got it today. I will see how it goes and update my review if I see anything strange.This product is China made so had to  sterilise it before using. üòÇ. Just joking."
5,Best product
5,This is the best monitor I could have purchased in a decent budget. I have compared this monitor with every other branded monitor and bought it. It has all the features that a branded monitor has and is budget friendly. It comes with an almost 24 inch wide screen. This is the best find and has an HD resolution with 1980 *1980 pixels. It has a sleek design and comes in silver colour. It can be mounted on a wall or can be put on desk. VGA and HDMI cable is supported. Though the inbuilt speaker is not as good as one can expect but overall a great product from zebronics. If one is looking for a sleek and budget friendly monitor then this product should be one's first choice.
5,"It's good for daily use.Everything is perfect with it.the design with almost zero bezel.no bleeding.But the colours are not vibrant for a Full HD display.not recommend for photo/video editing, gaming etc.best for casual daily use, reading, surfing through net,trading,movies etc.Recommend."
5,Sleek design.. White color makes more stylish.. Picture quality is awesome. Tried both as a TV and monitor.. 1) As a TV: picture quality is very much cool but In built speaker doesn't sounds good. Made only for notification sounds and not much loud.. 2) As a monitor: Blue light filter is much helpful for work from home purpose.. Perfect choice for ppl who are working from home
4,I bought this Monitor couple of days back and delivered it swiftly. Thanks for Amazon prime.Pros:Good display sizeGood picture qualityEasy setupCons:Can be provided with better speakerYou can't adjust the viewing angleOverall it's worth the price less than 8K and has a better picture quality than expected. Ran through couple of display test video from YouTube. Passed all test and HD resolution is good.Finally packaging was good small and adequate. Easy to carry for shifting purpose.
5,My Monitor is suddenly not working properly. Developed Screen resolution patch from below screen. nearly 75%. I need replacement for this. It is under Warranty.
5,Awesome productImage quality is goodVery satisfied with the product
5,An excellent monitor for the price.  Pictures are sharp and steady at high resolution.
5,Good product
5,Good

5,Great stylish looking monitor! I am using as a extended screen with my laptop.
5,I would say just buy it.Best qualityVery cheapAmazing
5,Monitor is osm btt some light rays comes out from the display brezzels..and electric current passes out through a screw.. value for money ....
5,Very good clariy and brightness is good and very satisfied

5,Worth it.. Just by if u are a normal user.
5,The product is meeting the expected quality.The form factor is good.Integrate Webcam to make this product in the customer delight category.
4,"Excellent design, especially back side.Very narrow Basel and slim.Good finishing and colour, useful in offices where it is visible from backside too.In built speakers.Only one thing, all the connection sockets are backward, so wall fixing difficult.No indicator in front side."
5,monitor at a good price and its value for money
5,Goog
5,Best display. But if you want to buy it for speaker look for any other monitor.
5,Overall best
5,Best best
5,Gud looking clear pic quality & lowest cost worthy of purchase
5,Nice üëç
4,Moniter is good one but stand is not adjustable. Screen is looking some in band position. When seating in front of screen it is very awkward position to work on monitor. My samsung monitor was adjustable. And one more thing wall mountain clamp was not received
1,"By comparing the 1. Pics from the product description, 2. Pics posted by other customers in the review section and 3. Pics I have attached with this review, it would be evident that the product I received is completely different. i.e the back projection is bigger than the original, stand fixing arrangements are different, shape/size and cutout in the stand are different, description on the adaptor is different.How can a product from a branded company like zebronics differ when the model no. in the product description on amazon and on the product I received is the same. This proves that clearly, I have received a duplicate/first copy products.Further, if you can see the 4th pic I uploaded, the screw hole given to fix the stand is useless, as the hole is inside the monitor body and the screw can't be inserted."
5,Super picture Quality worth buy
5,Good quality
5,Nice product.
5,SERVES THE PURPOSE VERY WELL AS THE PICTURE QUALITY IS UPTO THE MARK AND THE MONITOR IS REALLY VERY SLIM IT LOOKS FANTASTIC.
5,Awasum monitor
4,"Excellent for multitasking.Able to work with 3 windows at the same timeThe Speakers are really good for monitor speakers.HDR works as advertised.FHD in 29 inches is not enough. I'm able to see individual pixels though and movies are not sharp.I think this is relatively not popular model, as I couldn't find the Softwares and Drivers in LG website for this monitor.When contacted, they provided drivers of other monitor to use for this monitor..To conclude, just don't see Youtuber's setup video and buy an ultrawide monitor.You can always buy two 22 inch best monitors for this price and use as Dual screen. Believe me this isn't worth for normal users."
4,"Make sure you perform proper setup in you GPU suite to run this at 75hzCons:(1) the stand could be more sturdy. The panel tends to wobble a bit when moved.(2) the display panel has some flex and moves on application of some pressure.(3) The built-in speakers, like most built-in speakers, are trash and should be used only as a contingency.(4) The freesync version in this monitor isn‚Äôt compatible with my Nvidia 1660 super. Not a deal breaker but something to keep in mind.Pros:(1) the pixel density is good. I switched from a 21inch 1080p IPS monitor to this and I don‚Äôt notice any softness.(2) The design is much more sophisticated than one of LGs older 29inch ultrawide monitor.(3) An HDMi cable is included in the box(4) The navigation button is easy and intuitive to use(5) Experience ultrawide gaming glory without breaking the bank."
5,This one is excellent. Good for work from home. The actual screen size is 32 cm x 70 cm. This is good for software people. Video play is also good.
2,"good monitor although most of the laptops will not support the 2560:1080 resolution settings.There is no firmware available from LG support sites.so better dont buy it, unless you have 2560:1080 LG firmware for WINDOWS/MAC"
4,Value for money !! Ultrawide
4,"Size - Height wise it's same as regular 22"" monitor but still feels bigger. With 2560x1080 resolution you can still see the pixels if you get close. 7/10 for normal use, 10/10 if it's at distance or you use it as TV to watch movies.Gaming- Upto 75Hz refresh rate is pretty nice, 5ms response rate is quite good for casual gaming. Wider resolution does mean though that you will need a powerful machine to play latest games.-8/10 It's more immersive and perfectly suitable for mid-high range cpus.HDR- 8/10, used it for games, looks good.Build- It is a little delicate, recommended that you don't move it around much. 6/10.Bezels are not the narrowest we see these days.Brightness and antiglare - 10/10.Speakers - 8/10 - loud enough for silent room, good quality.Package includes a HDMI cable."
5,"I mainly bought it for productivity since I am WFH. It's also good for photo and video editing as it produces awesome colour quality with anti glare. Tilt is very limited,but considering the size, it offers the maximum tilt. I would recommend getting a mounting stand if you want more tilt.It has different modes, so if you want to use it for gaming and then regular use it can change according and hence conserve some power. I saw some reviews mentioning backlight leakage, it's not as bad as it shows in the photos, no LCD screen can provide 0 leakage. I believe 29"" is better than 34"" because the resolution is almost the same. So for crisp images 29"" is the better buy."
5,"Technically good one. Justice for the LG brand. But, at this price I could have availed three good monitors. I only went for this on screen control in my mind. Though the feature is good and flawless, it does not suit my needs... I've always at least five or six instances of IDEs open  with regular software suites such as browser, office 355 suites and application server consoles."
5,Absolute value for money. Using this as my work monitor . It has a crisp display and 75hz is enough for work. It‚Äôs sleek and the benefit of the headphone jack inbuilt is amazing.For now no flickering  or any display related issues plague this unit. It‚Äôs free sync enabled so if needed I can game. But I don‚Äôt game on this monitor.
5,"The monitor cannot be tilted; it remains permanently fixed in forward angle which is very awkward. I have to position the monitor above my head and look up continuously. Hence, I wish to return this monitor. Seller agreed to take back and refund. The screen and picture quality is very good."
4,Monitor is overall good but i can't find on screen control for this monitor.
2,"Before I used Samsung QLED monitor, Samsung is very good monitor in picture quality and resolution. But now I am using this really I felt bad why I am taking this LG monitor. Waste of money. If anyone use LG monitor as a first monitor they think it good. But I used so many monitors according to that knowledge LG monitor is not worthy. In YouTube and Netflix we got only 1080 resolution, 4K and 2k are not available for this LG monitors. Coming to Speaker totally waste. Sound coming from speaker like a China mobile. Don‚Äôt go with this product."
4,"Value for money monitor. Easily one of the best monitor under 20k.Pros: Good picture quality, great for multitasking. Speakers are also good, good enough for a mid sized living room.Cons: No usb c or thundebolt support. May not be good for high end gaming as it supports upto 75hz max."
5,"At this price range, you will either get high refresh rate or ultrawide. Now if you choose this, I must say you wont regret it.The only cons I have noticed thus far is that its bit shaky, but I don't mind that."
5,paired it and using it with my Mac mini M1.no issues till now.
5,"Initially I was hesitant about the product, but when I received the product it was the perfect fit for all my requirement. It is wide(perfect width) enough for multi-tasking, no backlight bleeding, nice speakers etc."
3,"All good but for 2 things:1. No drivers available for Mac OS. So, Some of the apps don't support split view without a driver.2. No specific wall mount available. One needs to do a lot of searching to get the one that fits this monitor"
1,"The monitor worked for a month and then it did not switch on . Due to covid  replacement adapter came after 5 weeks delay . When technician came for fixing with new adapter, it switched on . Now again not working after 5 days with new adapter. Looks like sunb quality üòê"
5,Ultra wide resolution best for multi tasking also best best for photo or video editing. Inbuilt audio quality is awesome. Overall the best monitor with LG's quality and trust.
5,Its great! Using it for my music production purpose and I'm in love with the ultra wide view!I saw some reviews on picture quality being not that good. But that's not true at all! Trust me just go for it!
4,Its Great but misses out on hieght adjustment
5,Nice Product
5,"Made working so easy, loving it."
5,I am using it for WFH and its good productive monitor.
5,The product is awesome. Definitely good quality and value for money
5,Using for multi screen tasks
5,GREAT MONITOR FOR ULTRAWIDE GAMING.
5,Awesome monitor for multi tasking
5,Budget friendly monitor for multitasking
5,Good for multiple working
4,Nice
5,"Excellent monitor. Awsome, just loved it.This monitor is mainly use full for those who are working videography, photography editing softwares.And main thing is its videos experience,just superb.And the inbuilt speakers are best.Totally loved it. üòç"
5,"Good Quality, Nice Picture.(Surajit Saha)"
4,"I recently bought this monitor with the intention of having the below mentioned requirements:* Have VGA & HDMI input* Tilt facility* Wall mount option* Inbuilt speaker* On top of it, should be comparatively cheaper :-)I found all the above in this monitor except inbuilt speakerThe monitor comes with* Base stand* Power adapter for 240V* HDMI port* VGA port* Audio out portThe max resolution  that we get is 1366x768. it is sufficient for basic computer usage or surveillance monitor.This comes with Vesa wall mount screw options but no wall mount.I havent yet explored with the PIP features. will update the review once i explore more"
4,Very good in this price segment LG and HDMI port is very useful you can use as a TV from the setup box and you can use computer from the VGA port everything is fine but only the mistake is viewing angles are not fine very less using angle you are get some shade and different different colours from the ceiling from the left and right side of the view
5,LG 19 Inch LED Monitor - Asked Around & Everyone Recommended This For CCTV Useage - Budget Friendly.Been Using It For About A Month Basically For Our CCTV Security System (24x7 Always ON). No Problems Till Now. The Picture Quality Is OK & Its Seems Sturdy.
5,Okay product
5,In a budget of 5420rs
1,Very bad.....picture quality not good. Main thing is that if you view even at slight angles all are negative like picture. Please don't buy.
4,Decent monitor for basic office use for non multimedia applications. The viewing angle is limited as mentioned in most reviews and it's not a full HD screen.It came bundled with a hdmi cable and has an audio out jack to connect a speaker or headphones to listen to the sound sent to the hdmi cable. Sound quality is of flat response and hence useful only for basic listening.
5,I am a age old patron of LG products. But I haven't had an LG led PC monitor before because my LG CRT monitor is running for Last 15 years without any issues. Believe me or not but this is the truth. Now this monitor is being used for my daughter's PC which I have gifted her. Picture quality is superb having 3 modes of display with energy saving automatic power mode. It's a green eco friendly monitor having accurate sensors  built-in. Very sleek and modern in design and has reader modes to protect eyes . It has both HDMI & VGA inputs from PC so that playing games at 60 Hertz is all time favourite for my child.
5,"For 5k, fabulous HDMI supported screen. The set up took all of 30 seconds :) love it"
4,"I received a opened product and found a big scratch in the screen, good we now a days taking video while opening any package for our safety.. But amazon didn't asked any question and replaced it with a new one.Pros: Resolution, Refresh rate, qualityCons: Stand and look"
1,"Don't be fooled my fellow Indians. This product is cheap in quality as well as price.Points to note before buying:-1) You don't get a VGA cable. Only HDMI cable+power supply cable2) The monitor is ""LCD screen with LED backlights"". It's not full LED. So the white glow problems associated with LCD monitors exist with this product.3) In the monitor there was no ""LED"" written at the bottom-left of the monitor as shown in display picture4) It's 18.5 inches, not 19inches as mentioned in product title.5) No replacement. Only refund policy. It's weird. I contacted customer care, they told the same thing.6) The materials used for manufacturing is cheap(quite obvious with this price). Thus the whole thing feels clunky.7) I couldn't find the warranty papers. Sigh.DONT GET FOOLED BY THE LOW PRICE. ITS ALWAYS A TRADE-OFF."
1,"1.They didn't send the main cable. Only HDMI was sent. This is callousness to core.2. The Warranty card did not have sellers' seal. It says without seal it is not valid. Again very disappointed.3. Invoice copy is damaged. It is torn to half and only one half is sent to me. This is outright ridiculous!Though the product was delivered very promptly and the monitor is functioning well with good display (display, the pi tire quality is good good but not excellent. I used my old LGmonitors power cable as they have not sent the cable.Now after just 1 and a half months all colors have become pale.Monitor looks like Blue tinted black and white monitor!!!!üòêWorst product."
1,"You'll feel like you are in 90's if you use this monitor...so it's for nostalgia and nothing else.Note that maximum resolution for this is 1366 x 768, which is NOT enough at all for a monitor of this size. I am having a hard time reading even Powerpoint text in it. At best, I might be able to watch a movie on it.The display is quite whitewashed...again, looks like a monitor from 90's.Also, note that you CAN'T return this item, you can only replace it.Overall, I am losing my faith on quality of recommendations on Amazon. They don't mean much it seems."
2,I had to wait 5 days for this product to get delivered even though I am a prime customer. The built is cheap and the quality is ok but not as clear as 1080p. When i bought it I thought it was 1080p but the picture quality is much worse than that. Why did amazon mention HD monitor on the description and its not 1080p. Its 2019 and not 2009. HD these days means 1080p to a normal person
5,"Received it on. Initially was confused to buy as I was looking for a cheaper alternative around 3 or 4k and found adcom 18.5 inch one as the best based on my research but the estimated date of delivery was showing after a week with no hdmi cable which would have costed me some 4400 Rs along with the hdmi cable. So, I decided to go with this as LG is a trusted brand and was slightly costlier and was delivered the next day. My laptop screen is not showing proper colors, So I needed an alternative.Talking about this monitor, I'm surprised with the picture quality, colors look really nice and it feels really good to look at it. It is light weight and the bezels are quite fine, it looks very modern for the price it is selling at.So, I'm completely satisfied with the product."
4,"Its cheap and not very good. I use it for work as a second monitor. I think the picture quality is bad, i am not tech savy, but the screen is bad.I bought it before the lockdown, i needed it to work from home. I am glad i did. But quality is bad.If you are looking for a make do second monitor, this is good. Overall, its okay."
4,This monitor is good I can use both as my desktop and as a tv with my airtel hd dth via hdmi. Reason for not five stars is viewing angle is poor
3,"Lg brand, hdmi input with audio jack and 3 year warranty so a good deal.Made this a small tv. On Hdmi with settop box and added speakers to the audio jack."
5,"Better than average product.  And yes i am pretty sure it will last for long,i still uses lg 18.5 lcd monitor for my desktop, for the past 10years n its working without any problems.I bought it for my friends sister. She's all happy with it."
4,"Had ordered to work as a second monitor for WFH. An HDMI cable is included in the box. In case your laptop/cpu does not have an HDMI port, you would need a connector. Monitor is good and was delivered properly by Amazon. Only issue (if it can be called as such) to note is the display resolution is 1366x768. While this works for general use, normal laptop screen resolutions are higher. So difference is noticable. Also windows screen apprears slightly bigger size on this resolution. Higher resolution monitors are available at higher price. So this is more of a cost vs benefit decision to make prior to purchase."
3,The product isgood . But built quality does not seem like LG. Seems cheap And switches to sleep mode very fast. Hope this is not a defect or my money is wasted.
1,The image is whitewashed. The images on the right bottom corner will super blown out by the backlight whereas everywhere else it's not Bright. This is a very very bad design. I just bought this monitor for occasional use but still doesn't serve the purpose. Garbage. And more over I am unable to return this junk. Just look at the black images I've uploaded
1,"I purchased this monitor on 28 the June 2020. When I connected with CPU, screen flickering issue noticed. But within a few days that screen changed to grey colour. By that time return policy date expired.Now I have given the monitor to the service centre and they told board complaint and needs to be replaced. They don't have any spare available with them.Now I feel that the seller might have given some refurbished product otherwise day I one onwards display flickering issue will not be there."
1,"Disappointed because of the display. It is whitewashed and the display colours change even from a slightly different viewing angle. This is a major issue, and I haven't found anythung yet. Didn't expect such a poor product from LG. This monitor doesn't look like an LED monitor, rather feels like an age old LCD display. My privious monitor had a better display than this one, actuslly most of the monitors these days have a good display. I am unsatisfied with the purchase."
5,This monitor can be used as TV as well as computer Monitor. HDMI to Set Top Box and VGA output to computer. One Head phone output available which can be used as speaker output from set top box(with HDMI cable). I like this product. Thank you Amazon for quick delivery and good quality product.
1,worst product I purchased this product on 21 May 2018 and warranty of this product is 3 years but screen is not working only I can hear voice with the help of speaker no use of monitor I want to return this product
2,"This may useful for traditional cpu, but not to connect with laptops. Resolution is very odd with laptops."
4,Nice monitor but windows 10 users must set your cpu picture size 60hz 1300x760. If it is not it won't be connect. For Windows 7 user no need to worry perfectly fine it will automatically adjusts. Thank you
4,"I bought this mainly for editing photos and playing games. a good color correction. If you are a programmer or a budget gamer, i highly recommend this monitor. Readers mode works like a charm when you feel tired working or reading for long time. screen size is perfect in this 19"" monitor. Saves space and do the work.Response time is good when playing online multiplayer games like dota 2 and counter strike. but for people looking for monitors highly for gaming, better look for 1ms response time when buying one.AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLEReally satisfied with this product!"
5,Initially the LED display looked rather too bright and I was afraid that it should not affect my eyes.  Though bright it is not sensitive to the eye; so no discomfort was experienced. I like it more than the previous displays I had.
4,"i searched several days in Amazon for a good monitor. Finally i selected this LG 19 M 38 HB model. 19 inches LCD not LED. When we look the picture in side angle  it looks like ghost film. when we sit before monitor and work on in a straight angle it looks fine. i am absolutely satisfied with this price. Easy to fix the stand. As per their description I received base stand, Power adapter, HDMI port, VGA port. I also received guarantee card. I satisfied every thing. This is a good product for my personal, household purpose. Thanks to Amazon and delivered personnel."
3,Average Product.You might a better product in means of screen resolution. Does not support even 1080p 4K videos.Product is not durable if not handled carefully. The side cover can break easily if the monitor fall down on your table.The stand is adjustable.Okay for office work.Not okay for HD movie experience or gaming.Good thing is that it has an audio jack which you can connect to an external speaker.
5,This is a very nice product received from amazon. Thank you very much for the same. My son enjoying drawing and colouring very much. The only thing is VGA cable is not available as HDMI cable is there.Thank you again Amazon for timely delivery.
2,"Don't buy if you want to do any of following on this monitor1. Watch Movies2. Graphics work3. Play Games4. Anything to do with images.The colour reproduction is horrible, the gamma is way off, so even the grays on normal monitor are washed out to white. So all your image colours are wrong, movies look weird.You have some presets which you can choose from, but all the preset only make the image look worse."
5,Overall a great monitor. Viewing range limited as from distance or angle looks blurred. But then you work always in front of monitor so no issues..
5,"First thing is very good packing by seller,HDMI is working fine @720pVGA also working fineGood picture quality , LG you can trust for service and better product,"
5,Execellent and super quality with hdmi and sound out put is working very nice. Use both  hdmi dish tv and vgi cable for desktop  2in1
5,"Hi everyone, I am writing this review after using for around one month. I think LG is the only company which is offering split screen feature although you have to install seperate software for that. Split screen feature is great only problem is if you are planning for split screen feature go for 32 inch or more since it looks so small in this."
4,Has a poorly designed power socket which resulted in intermittent power supply to the monitor. I had to return the initially supplied piece. Even the replacement has similar issues though to a lesser degree. Other features are satisfactory
1,"Amazon delivered the product after 6 days of ordering, the Monitor worked for few days and suddenly the display went off. Tried all the ways, but display was not working. So, i requested for replacement and the one which was received it did not even switch on, even the power light was not appearing, so returned the item completely. Beware when you purchase from amazon, there is no quality checks done. And moreover it is China made and no guarantee.I tried to register this product online in LG website, but no warranty was applied for this. It was showing Zero warranty. There is lot of complaints about this product, the softwares which comes in CD which is provided with this product not does not detect this monitor when connected to laptop, so the onscreen control functions does not work as they display in add. I googled a lot about this and found that most of them is facing this issue. Purchase from LG directly to get the warranty."
1,"Third class product, after someday display showing blank not working, BEFORE PURCHASE It was showing 3 Year warranty AFTER PURCHASE it's showing NO WARRANTY ü§íüò°üò°üò°"
4,"*Update: Working flawless after almost two years.First of all, never buy a 25"" ultra-wide as it will be a downgrade for you from a 22"" 1920x1080 monitor because of less length (vertical). You need a very good quality GPU if you are planning to play latest titles at moderate to high setting as it is 33% more demanding than running a game in a 1920x1080 pixel display.In the box it comes with,1. Monitor2. Power Brick (similar to a average laptop)3. 1 HDMI & 1 DisplayPort Cable4. Stand & removable cable clip5. Calibration certificate and other product documentation6. A CD with type-c display driver and a software to adjust display settings on screen and a software to set/snap windows as per user defined frames (like 3 side by side windows). But you can do somewhat similar without this software with windows 10.Here is my pros and cons,Pros:1. Cheap FreeSync monitor and you can enjoy no screen tearing with a capable AMD GPU with a sync range from 40 to 75Hz. That means during movement you will not notice any screen tearing that normally occurs if monitor refresh rate not matches with GPU frame time.2. It is very big sized and you can also enjoy lot of standard movies on this display without top and bottom black bars which is normally there in any 1920x1080 i.e. 16:9 display.3. In game you can see extra space compared to 1920x1080 display. It is like using two 4:3 monitor side by side (not exactly). But it is fun when you experience it. Your field of view increases greatly. Best for video editing and multitasking. As you can open multiple windows side by side.4. VESA mount option is just fantastic for desk mount. I will post few photos of my setup. It helps to clean lot of space on the desk.6. If you have a NVIDIA card then free-sync is not officially supported. But even then you can set the refresh rate to 75Hz and enjoy extra 15 frames each second for added smoothness in games.Update: I have tested few games with nvidia GTX 1080 and free sync on @75Hz. But surprisingly free sync is working and I have not noticed and considerable screen tearing. There is a website which tests free sync vs vsync performance with the help of a moving image. When I run this test, I have found that the free sync is working with my nvidia card. Then searched you tube and found few videos where other  people also claiming that it is adding some smoothness with nvidia as well. But I want to make it very clear, this free sync might be adding some smoothness but it is not officially supported for nvidia and it is not supposed to work like a AMD card.7. It comes with factory color calibration and display is just top notch in terms of color saturation and contrast. You can not simply get a better monitor for its price in terms of default color profile preset straight out of the box.8. Decent set of speakers and Maxaudio which is simply some extra control to adjust bass, treble, stereo imaging to enhance the sound. Indeed it sounds much better than other monitor speakers. Just buy a headphone while you game. Otherwise the speakers are just decent for basic listening.Cons:The plastic feels cheap and the finishing is not smooth every edges. The construction and integrity is not robust enough. But not a big no no as it is a cheap ultrawide monitor.Verdict:If you have a decent GPU at least GTX 1060, then you can buy this. But even then you can not set setting to high in latest titles to maintain 60 fps avg. I have tested with my over-clocked Aorus GTX 1080 and even then, some of the very demanding titles, I can not set all to ultra for a smooth 60 fps (e.g. Ghost Recon Wildlands). This might be the poor optimization but this is what it is. Just to give you an idea, check your current fps in games 1920x1080 res and reduce it by 30%. This will be the rough fps you will be getting on this display as the pixel count is roughly 33% higher than 1920x1080.But if you have money then get this monitor with GTX1070 or above and you can not go back to 1920x1080 again. I also own LG 25UM65 which is 25"" even with that monitor the experience is much better than a 1920x1080 monitor for sure. If you have any other question you may comment and I shall get back to you."
5,"I have purchased it for the development purpose, It seems suitable for long development hours with wide screen screen.The correct product info is :2560x1080 FHD+ Matt Finish DisplayIPS PanelTwo HDMI Input PortsHeadphone Jack"
4,"Please note this is not a technical spec review but more of an experience in finalising this particular monitor and the reasons behind purchasing it. I am not a gamer or nor do I work on graphics/video editing..I am just another guy who uses multiple applications at work and weekend learning on Udemy (which again requires that while you learn on one screen, the other screen can run the video lesson).When I decided to buy a monitor primarily for office work, it had to be a slightly larger screen than the ones at office (typically 21"" to 24""); simply for the reason that stacking primary screens (3-4 applications) can be done easily with more screen real estate, as compared to switching between screens all of the time.There were few other factors as well in the purchase of an ""ideal"" monitor for my work..- amount of space that could be reserved for a large monitor in addition to  Mac Book, keyboard, mouse and powerstrip with chargers at the work table- viewing distance between my seating position and the monitor- finally not spending more than 15K INR for such a monitor (if there was really a good product that costed more - I could stretch by another 20%..""max"" - no more!! I said to myself).All of the above considered, narrowed down 3 monitors between 27"" to 29"" screen size.. one was a 27"" monitor(Benq), second was 29"" monitor(Dell) and lastly this 29"" ultrawide monitor(LG).I had seen a colleague in another team use a slightly smaller but curved screen, that was nice in terms of space for windows side by side..For all practical purposes, the 29"" ultrawide reviews appealed more to me except for one fact which I had read - ultra wide screen monitors tend to lesser in height as compared to normal screens..however having seen the specs and literally read/seen multiple tech reviews, I was convinced, this was the monitor for the job.Monitor ordered; it arrived as per schedule. Opened the package, did a quick check and found all parts in place ; except that :( I couldn't help get over the feeling that someone had opened the box and had either done a check of the parts before shipping or it was opened with some other intent..well, I brushed this thought aside and did a quick check of the display by connecting it to the Mac book Pro's USB type C port using power cable of Mac book's adapter which was USB type-C as well.Sadly it didn't work; few moments of frustration..got my brother's Dell laptop which was running Windows and connected it to the display with HDMI cable..oh wow! the display came to life..quickly stacked a bunch of documents, applications side by side and extended the monitor..was happy that expectations were met..Opened a large excel sheet..I could see from Column A to Column AJ..oh joy..no more scrolling..stacked a set of 3 work related application screens side by side..tested few other combinations..monitor was awesome, text clarity was good..colors were great.Installed Onscreen app from LG website..gives you another bunch of screen stacking options.Did a bit of searching on why USB Type C cable didnt work..even though monitor supported it..found the answer on Apple's community website..the typeC USB cable needed to be gen 3.2 version and one from Belkin costs close to Rs.2500/- :( although Amazon had one option for Rs.1000/- So, bought a separate adapter [Portronics C-Konnect a 3-in-1 USB Type C Adapter ] for use with bundled HDMI cable available in the package and thats how I am using this monitor.Hope this review was useful.."
5,"TL;DR:In short, the monitor is just awesome! Very good color reproduction with the factory settings out of the box. Good for gaming. Noticed no noticeable ghosting and the 75hz refresh rate is really helpful.It is a really good monitor for both gamers and designers at this price point.Long story:* Display quality - It is really good at this price point. Color reproduction is very good out of the box. I just turned down the brightness to 50%. The blacks are decent with minimum/uniform IPS glow/backlight bleed which is common to IPS monitors. I ran the EIZO monitor test and it performed pretty solid. Anti-Flickering is also very good. It can be very good for both designers and gamers at this price point.* Gaming - Very immersive and satisfied. Ran Battlefield 5, Assassin's Creed Origins, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Witcher 3, Batman Arkham Knight at 2560x1080 at 75hz and it feels really good with the ultrawide experience. Did not try 1ms MBR or the Black Stabilizer, as there was no noticeable ghosting.* Graphic Designing - Decent monitor for graphic designing at this price point. ~99%sRGB palette reproduces colors very good. Although it is a 6bit+FRC monitor (and not a true 8bit panel), there is no issue with differentiating the colors with minor variation. Gradients are also very nice and colors feel natural as my earlier Dell monitor.* Build quality - Decent. Though some users may report its wobbly, it's not much of a deal breaker. The plastic on the LCD panel is seamlessly well fitted without any loose ends.* Speakers - Decent. But you would definitely want to pair it with an external sound system.* Accessories - 1 display port and 1 HDMI cable are really good to have.As a conclusion, if someone wants to enjoy an ultrawide experience without spending a lot, then this is definitely the monitor to go for. You just need to have a decent GPU GTX 1060/RX 460 to fully get this monitor going. Graphic designers and gamers both can undoubtedly opt for this monitor."
4,Great gaming monitor in good price! Even audio also very good!
5,"Screen looks amazing. Thin bezels, high quality material and bright and dynamic display. RGB rating is 99% and it shows. Perfect for graphic designing. Also finish is matte so barely any reflections.Note before buying:1. The height will be smaller than regular 25 inch displays and 25 inches are measured diagonally.2. No automatic brightness adjustment.3. No Audio, just an audio jack which I never use.Being the most affordable ultrawide display out there, it's perfect if you're on a budget."
4,"Bought this keyboard for making a sick setup with my MacBook Pro. At first I thought, 25 inch is going to be small but it's way too big for me (maybe because I'm seeing one for first time). The IPS panel have really good colors and also the black stabilizer helps a lot in bringing out quite blacks. Overall, go for it."
5,"The main reason I bought this one is because it comes with USB-C port.Before buying, I was kind of worrying because there are so many type-c compatibility issues.Now I can tell to all buyers that ""No Worries, USB-C Works"". Which means I can connect monitor to MacBook using only one cable and its should be able to Project Video, Audio and Charge the laptop at the same time.I use this monitor for Coding purpose.It's the best monitor for coding. Cant review games because I hardly play any! I can fit 3 tabs open at a time! Thats a joy :D. It's size it perfect for desktop monitor. Anything bigger than this would require more than just a monitor stand.Display:Superb. Its IPS panel, it's super bright. For me its at 50% brightness at daytime and 10-20% at night. No issues related to the screen. Movies are fun to watch on this screen! (Even if you read this line 1000 times, you'll still be surprised with the way how 21:9 display works).Audio:Its like a laptop audio experience. Mac's audio is far better in terms of quality. It's there just for sake. Still if you want to use those for general purpose; not bad.CONS:1. USB C power output is 5v-1.5A which is I think half than what MacBook needs. Which means you will still have to connect a charger ;) Battery drains slowly but IT DOES.2. Doesn't come with USB-C cable. This monitor comes with unnecessary HDMI + DP cables which are obsolete today I think. I had to buy a separate cable for this purpose.NOTE:The cables which came with your MacBook/iPad are not capable of transmitting video+audio signals.Here is the link to make your life easier, I am using this cable:https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07KFGCK45/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00"
5,Good product . Value for money .perfect for  Audio video editing & graphic works and photoshop etc.
5,"I'd held off from buying a monitor as most manufacturers in India play their customers for fools- 768p (HD) monitors of 19+"" sizes at the same prices where international customers get FHD, and FHD at those prices where international customers get QHD and above.I had done some high school maths on monitor dimensions and deduced that the best balance between monitor size and text sharpness was when I have 1080p at the height of a 16:9l 17"" monitor.I tried out a couple of Zebronics monitors before this. They were very light and I was very impressed with their after-sale service. But the viewing angles were horrible.Eye strain during the lock-down forced me to consider this one.My main considerations were:1- Brand: yet to own an LG product which I was not happy with (mobiles excluded)2- Size: Because of the 21:9 aspect ratio, this 25"" monitor is only as high as a 17"" monitor of the normal 16:9 ratio.3- Pixel pitch: 1080p in the height of a normal 17"" monitor should give text that is acceptably sharp. I read newspapers and magazines online; and work on large documents and spreadsheets- so text clarity was a big thing for me.4- Price: this one is the cheapest you can get for this quality of display (~17"" FHD at ‚Çπ 12,000)My experience:1- Price: 3 STAR. The LG site price is ‚Çπ 12,100, and I got this for around 2k higher. Maybe it was because of the cost of shipping, or extra demand after lockdown. Cost was high, but I guess that is acceptable now because of he risks of local shopping.2- product Quality: 4 STAR. A big difference compared to Zebronics, but still not quite what LG used to give. The sides of the panels are delicate and the monitor needs to be held in a certain way to avoid accidental damage. This is mentioned in the small manual. Do read it carefully.3- Connectivity: 5 STAR: 2 HDMI, 1 Headphone and 1 Power (single brick 3 Pin, like an Asus Laptop Charger)4- Image Quality: Good brightness and contrast. Colour hue is not bluish like most laptops. It is slightly brown and fairly easy on the eye. Screen is matte so no reflections. No bright indicators in the front.5- Text Quality: 4 STAR: Text is sharp as can be for this pixel pitch. Much better than FHD monitors, but not as good as Acer FHD laptop screens. Text rendition is a mix of the display quality and the adjustments in Windows ClearType and Display Gamma. Even after extensive adjustment, it is okay. But lacks the contrast needed for hours of comfortable viewing. Hue is very good.6- Display Aspect: 5 STAR: The 21:9 aspect is a revelation. The 1080p, small size (17"" type height) and extra width mean that you can easily view 2 windows at side by side.7- Mounting: 5 STAR: I mounted it on an existing AmazonBasics Monitor Mount. Mounts and balances like a charm. Just at eye level.VERDICT: Priced higher than MRP, but is the best you can get (and use) at this price. Buy it without thinking, you will not regret it.Those who are in the productive field (office use, number crunching, multi-tasking) will find it a boon."
5,"I wanted a professional monitor for programming. Read a lot about benefits of ultra wide monitor but also was sceptical about it especially whether it skew the text because of pixels. But then its really clear. Note that I tried a 32inch TV (not full hd) and was really very afraid if the monitor would turn out like that.  But am really impressed with the clarify and options to adjust the screen for work. Cannot ask more.Also Was not sure whether to buy the 27th inch regular monitor or but a 29inch ultra wide. But note that ultra wide 29inch is not just 2 inches bigger than than 27inch. It is very wide screen and at the same time till within the reach of the eye. The wide screen gives a really awesome experience if you ask me. I can easily work with 6 way split and still text is crystal clear. This monitor really worth every penny.  I use it as desktop for my lenovo t480 laptop, no need for extended, because i dont think i need the laptops screen space after this much real estate.If given a chance I would buy the same monitor again and never buy a regular monitor ever. Its a dream for programmers and especially the lg software you can download online for the On Screen Manager. Really worth buy for someone looking for working purpose. Note that it is a gaming monitor as well which is really an extra and I do not use it for gaming. So this review is just about the professional monitor usage. Really no brainer to buy this great piece from LG and LG is really good when it comes to customer experience especially in cities. Once again thanks LG for this genuinely useful product. Also saw a few movies and since its 21:9 format which is what netflix movies (not tv series) play and is the format used in movie theatres, its really good for this monitor costs. For me these are just extras. main purpose for me is work. I think I have shared enough information and hope it helps."
5,"I was lucky enough to receive a working unit, and this monitor is gorgeous. For those of you who are unable to figure what 29"" on a UW monitor means, This monitor would be a 23"" monitor if it was a regular 16:9 screen. I bought this monitor to hook it up to my laptop, and it has been a purchase worth the money.For those worried about color gamut, I used an app called 'DisplayHDR Test' from the Microsoft Store, it works on the software side of things and it reported a 99.9% sRGB, 87.1% Adobe RGB, 83.6% DCI-P3 coverage.The Screen:The panel is nice and bright, FreeSync by default is disabled and Windows sets the refresh rate to 59Hz, so once that was sorted, everything was good to go. I sit around 45-60 cm away from the monitor, so I do see slight pixelation (It is a 95.8 DPI panel). Backlight bleed isn't too bad. I personally don't notice it until it is dark in the room and screen goes black. I'd say it's a solid A- when it comes to bleed.PS: the monitor recommended 60Hz rather than 75Hz, and FreeSync is kind of wonky. My best guess is this is due to HDMI. I will try to connect via DisplayPort and update my review.The Speakers:I expected the speakers to be useless, but these are pretty decent speakers. I use it to listen to music.UPDATE: few weeks later, I now prefer the speakers on the monitor to my older speaker setup. These are very usable speakers. The speakers have no bass at all, but I wasn't expecting that in the first place. The clarity on the speaker is really good.Extras:The OSD is controlled by a very neat little Joystick that is below the monitor in the center. It is good design in the sense that it doesn't need more buttons, just one joystick."
5,"Great monitor for the price. I use it only for photo and video editing. Not so much for gaming.The speakers are nothing great, at least to my standards. They are loud enough, however, since they are firing downwards, there is no clarity. However, with tuning the max audio settings, you can get a pretty decent output.Apart from this its a treat to watch movies on this.. you get a really immersive experience. And the multi window setup is like having 2 laptops at the same time.I recommend it."
5,"I got this product for about 16k (17k-10%HDFC discount) on Amazon sale.¬∞ Will definitely boost your productivity as it being an ultrawide has a lot of screen space.  I can now review/write/code as i am watching a video about a topic (photo attached)¬∞ On VS code you can easily view the variable explorer and jupyter notebook on the right along with the main code on the left without any issue (photo attached).¬∞Gaming experience is also really great here. The monitor being 75hz and supports Freesync. This for those players who play a lot of multiplayer fps(non professionals as no 144hz) and single player story games. I play csgo occasionally and it supports 2560x1080 resolution. The resolution gives you a better fov(field of vision) but make sure your graphics card can support the resolution the monitor offers (If not you can lower the game resolution and play on stretched mode that's ok too).¬∞ But for gaming i have to say playing story mode games give you just another experience that in my opinion just can't be had in a regular monitor. (Screenshot of Myrdalssandur Island).¬∞ The speakers are also not bad actually. They are definitely loud they are on the back so that could be a minor issue but yeah it's fine.¬∞ Watching YouTube will give you black bars as most of the videos are not in the monitors resolution. However, again the screen is so big it doesn't even matter. (Screenshot attached).I would say if you are looking to buy a professional / casual gaming monitor go for these ultrawide monitors. You may not see a reason to buy it initially like i did but you will see how it improves your experience overall."
5,"29 inches are just perfect. Everything is in front of you, you don't have to keep moving your head. And, color reproduction is great. My only gripe is that I can't use 75hz refresh rate. Maybe something wrong with my system. But, this thing is great. Movies and games are just too much fun. In built speakers are good too if you don't have anything. But, i hardly use them."
5,One awesome monitor for my programming and gaming needs.Budget monitor for 22kIt won't look Big in the pic but boy you sit 1 feet away from the monitor you need to move your head left to right.Awesome colour. Gaming yet to try.
5,"As a new stock trader, I wanted to get the best setup that my little profits could buy. After a lot of research and reviews I settled on 2 ultrawide monitors rather than multiple smaller monitors.The LG 34 inch ultrawide provided the most bang for the buck and I am not disappointed with the purchase. The setup and installation was effortless. Over the past 6 months, both the monitors have performed perfectly - connected to a Macbook Pro. The average day starts around 9AM (Indian markets open) and goes on till 1:30AM at night (US market close)They perform like a workhorse with no complains.I also have Windows 10 (bootcamp) on my macbook. I am not sure whether its the Macbook hardware or windows drivers, but the highest resolution is not available when I am logged on to windows. Tried all driver downloads from LG and Microsoft. On the Macintosh, it works like magic.Overall a great product at a very reasonable price."
3,"First time i received wrong product with open package. The monitor inside was different. Not sure whether problem was from seller end or in transit. I had to wait for another week for replacement. Replacement had proper packing.I have tested HDMI and DP port and it works fine. However, Type C does not work, not even with apple macbook air. If you want to buy this for type c like me, this is not for you."
3,"Display is amazing but the build quality is pathetic. Had to return twice, both the times top panel of diplay was popping out. LG seriously need to work on their quality control.As usual Amazon return and refund process was flawless. Got the refund within 2 weeks. Despite loving the display I need to search for other brands now."
5,"75hz. It shows very good colors.Excellent for watching movies.Inbuilt speakers not good, may gets the job done.Best for multitasking but little problem because it is a flat display, if you sit closer to display you feel corners are very far.Near means below one nd half feet.No other issues.Daily it wakes with me - sleeps with me.At least 18hours a day- screen ON time."
5,"I purchased two of these ultrawide monitors from AMAZON at great price of 18000 x 2 = 36000If you see the pic I have vesa mounted them , and they are absolutely georgious. overall I have tried multiple games still not seeing any real issue. both of them are connected to my NVIDIA gtx 1080 one through dvi and the other through display port. still now have not faced any issue only time will tell .... what happens."
5,"One of the primary reasons I got this monitor apart from its ultrawide nature was the presence of a USB C port. I had a few doubts beforehand including whether this would work with the M1 Macbook. I am delighted to say that it works provided you have the right cable. I am using a USB 3.1 gen 2 cable and it works like a charm. Another doubt I had was if the monitor would be able to charge the Macbook. When I connected for the first time, the charging symbol came up but I noticed that the laptop was discharging slowly. I realized that this monitor wasn't capable of supplying enough wattage to charge the Mac. Having said that, if you close the MacBook's lid and just use this monitor, it is capable of charging it without any issues.The picture quality is awesome and the monitor I got has no screen bleed except for a very tiny area on the top right-hand corner. Couldn't ask for more at this budget"
4,"I bought an LG Ultrawide 29 inch monitor during this Dasara sale. The price was 17K INR. I bought this monitor mainly for office work since I've to find more workspace for multiple applications run side by side. Few points I would like to share.Windows 10 OS:I've connected DP cable to LG 29"" ultra-wide monitor. Downloaded Onscreen application from the LG support page. The experience is good. Work fine. Also, the inbuilt speakers do a great job. No problem.Ubuntu 20.04 LTS OS:I've another laptop, runs on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. I did extend the display via HDMI cable. I don't see an Onscreen driver available for Ubuntu, so there is no split-screen stuff to do. However, HDMI does a great job with extended display and audio output too. That's also fine and satisfying.MacBook Air 2019:I gave a USB C (since USB C input was provided) connection from my MacBook Air device to the LG 29"" ultrawide monitor. Unfortunately, MacBook Air did not recognize the monitor. After Googling, I understood this monitor resolution does not fit with MacBook. This made me unsatisfied as it did not work as I expected.However, I gave another try connecting MacBook Air using a display converter. USB C to HDMI converter and HDMI to LG Monitor. This worked fine. LG should've mentioned this in the description.Anyway, its been two weeks since I unpacked this device. So far it is doing good. I hope it works fine without any problem.Coming to delivery packaging, I received a direct LG box being shipped to my address. I was wondering, why Amazon did not take extra care to give additional cardboard package for safety concerns.  What if the LG box gets damaged due to any jolt during logistic shipment. Although my shipment showed few scratches, fortunately, the monitor inside wasn't damaged."
5,Being a video editor this monitor do serve the purpose.First of all I was confused to buy a regular 16:9 ratio 27inch monitor or an ultrawide.I own a 21 inch monitor and a side by side photo with ultrawide is available.This one is 29 inch model. Also available in 34inch and 25 inch variant. The reason I haven't gone with 34 is lack of vesa mount option as I want my monitor on arm. Currently its not but it would be. And many says 25 inch would be too small.1. This monitor is colour calibrated but I haven't found written in description. But it is cause there is certificate inside box which proves that.Colour calibration is important for video editor in colour grading.You would be amazed how great the picture look due color in person.2. Most people says and ultrawide helps in video editing. Which I truly agree. I have photos of using davinci resolve timeline both in ultrawide and normal 21 inch monitor.3. I  do have tested out few games. The black stabilizer is amazing when game is quite dark. With black stabilizer you can see everything.4. My graphic card is 750ti OC for who are concerned if you need really high end graphics card.5. The screen is matte finish and not glossy. And since my 21 inch monitor is glossy finish I haven't really need how much great a matte finish monitor is. You can work with your window open without any problem.6. I recommend few software and setting to make the full use of this monitor.a) use displayfusion software. There is photo of taskbar with multiple icon. Which is great for arranging windows.  Really great if you use 2 or more monitor setup.b) use utrawideo chrome extension. It helps to remove black side bars. And make overall look more immersive. There's again pictures of it. It may not suitable for all types of videos.c) use crop on vlc player. Again for immersive look.7. Does this monitor help in general productivity? Yes it does. Opening two Windows side by side is much better then and a normal 16:9 monitor.8. Who should buy this monitor? If you are a video editor or graphic design really great monitor. And since it have low response rate in black stabilizer really great for gaming. If you are planning to use a single monitor buy a ultrawide. If you are a laptop user and want external display this is great.
5,"It's amazing monitor in short.I was waiting for a deal and finally, I got this one for 14400 in the sale.I am using this monitor with ""MacBook pro 13"" mid 2012"" and unfortunately, my pc is not supporting the full resolution required for this monitor. if you look into the 2nd picture, You can see the black space on left and right. However, this is not a problem with the monitor. I tried connecting other pc and it just worked fine.+1 for the inbuilt speakers which are far better than my pc speakers.+1 for the cables provided in the box - HDMI, Display Port.Inputs: HDMI, Display Port, Type COutputs: AuxI used a VESA Mount to hold this guy in place which allows rotating the screen.Link to vesa mount: https://www.amazon.in/FLEXIMOUNTS-Monitor-Screen-Height-adjustable/dp/B075RZ44VL/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=vesa+mount&qid=1571111566&smid=A3DNRLV37D436R&sr=8-10"
5,"Thanks AmazonI got this product earlyüòòI'm using this monitor mainly for FL studioAnd making contents ..It has variety of picture modes like Reader,Photo,gaming and many moreThe monitor looks so glossy..You may think this monitor is a bezzeless display but actual when you turn on this you can see the bezzelsAnd the monitor is not that bigFor a price of 11k It's definitely worth buying üòòüëç"
5,"It's great for coders and designers. The fonts appearance is very clear. Those who do jobs from their PC like designing, coding or any other job that requires PC, then this monitor is for them. I can watch videos online and do coding at the same time. It is as if you have two different monitors in a single monitor.I am happy with this product because it got my job done.Thanks :)"
5,29 inch was good enough for 3 split windows. cheap option @17300. I used Mini DP to DP wire to connect my surface pro 4.  netflix quality was good from 2 feet distance and trading graphs readable and straight lines are sharp. no syrain to hrs as ai sit on an average 3 to 5 hrs daily. good buy
5,"I am an IT professional and this Monitor just straight up works !Box comes with all the right cords and power cables required, except Thunderbolt cable, as Thunderbolt connectivity for Monitors is not as mainstream as HDMI or Display Port.  29"" Monitor supports 2560x1080 pixels, and give you a wide and immersive view (21:9 Aspect Ratio).The Monitor has online software available that helps you split the viewing screen into different sections as required, and gives a lot of parallel productivity. For Multitasking, the amount of space available is just better !And 75 Hz Refresh rate is not at all bad. If you have the current next gen consoles like XBox Series X or PS5, they will support this monitor, but the only bottleneck will be the Monitor, as these consoles push 100+ FPS, and the monitor will only support 75 Hz refresh rate. AMD Freesync is also available, an added advantage. If you are using Xbox Series S Console, this may be just the perfect match for this Monitor. But if you are using last gen consoles like Xbox One or PS4, they only support 16:9 aspect ratio which can cause some black bars in either sides. But it can be bypassed at the expense of Clarity by using Ultra Wide configuration in the monitor. The use of Ultra wide image option on 16:9 Aspect ratio can cause Pixel tearing in viewing at 21:9 Aspect ratio resulting in reduced clarity and a bit wide graphics.Overall, current AAA title games support Ultrawide, and this can be the sweet spot for work as well as gaming !"
4,"The monitor provides excellent picture quality with great colors and brightness. I run mine at about 65% brightness as any thing beyond that is too bright for my eyes. Response time is good, no apparent ghosting. The control joystick is intuitive and the onscreen controls are a big help. There are a few cons however with this model1. Bezels are too big at about 1/3rd of an inch2. No height adjustmentIn general, the Ultra wide format is also slightly problematic for general use. Browsing on fullscreen is a strain, so you should stick to a normal window size. YouTube videos will not fill the screen and have black bars at the side. Some games can't handle ultra wide, so they will also have black bars or just cover the normal aspect ratio.But for productivity, the facility to run side by side windows when writing code, music/video editing or game design is a big plus.I would recommend 29in minimum for decent verical height and at 19k, it's hard to beat. 32in if it becomes priced comparative to this one vs the ridiculous 72k price tag right now."
5,Best monitor in this price rangeGood for video editing and watching movies.This is actually very small. Dont go by 25 inch number
5,"I have been using this monitor for the last 2 months and initially I was little skeptical about ordering this monitor after going through all the negative reviews, where someone have doubt about the quality of the product and defective piece got delivered.But, now I can say that this is the right monitor for all types of works as per my opinion. I have been mostly using this monitor for doing software development work from home and it has increased my productivity quite a lot. I am not using the Onscreen control software which comes along with this monitor for dividing the screens, but I am using Powertoys, which provide some shortcuts keys to organize the windows and it is quite good."
1,"does the monitor have in built speaker?  there are so many posts in the internet about no sound,  can you help?Called LG, they say there is no speaker on the monitor, there is no clarity in the product details for this.  I see so many people like me got confused and spent hours to fix like me.I very upset Amazon refuses to take the product back and provide a different model replacement (though I am going to pay the differential).  Why I am being force to take a product which is of no use to me,  very poor service from Amazon.  I called customer service, been in call with them for sometime, no luck yet."
4,"Using since 10-15 days now.Bought for home office and was very keen on split screen feature. I had no gaming intentions.Works fine, sleak design, good picture quality and wide enough for splitting the screen.Can get a good view of outlook on one side and visual studio/excel on the other.I did try playing NFS and it worked fine too without any lags. Didn't try very high end combat games though.All in all, if you are looking for home office then it's a good value for money at 25k. Go for it."
4,"I would have given this monitor 3 stars, but because of the utility it serves and the colour reproduction perhaps, I am giving it one more star.I had to replace the monitor because the first one had pixel defects - like a bunch of pixels were dimmer than surrounding pixels and it looked like a dead pixel - like a pin head dark spot - once you know it exists you cannot un-notice it. I mean in 2019, no one should have to deal with pixel defects. I paid for 2560x1080 perfect pixels, not (2560x1080 minus one). If you get pixel defects like dead pixels get it replaced immediately because LG will not honour warranty simply for one or two dead pixels - may be you will need 5 dead pixels to get it replaced through manufacturer. In this regard, at least Amazon allows one replacement and then a refund. Computer shops in India will simply wash their hands off and say they sold you a ""factory sealed"" piece and leave you to deal with the manufacturer.I would have expected a bit more sturdy build quality. Let's see - although it comes with a 3 year warranty. The replacement thankfully (till now) does not have pixel defects, but has some backlight bleed, but this is within acceptable limits - and considering backlight bleed is usually an issue in IPS panels, its not noticeable generally.For the price I got it in The Great Indian Festival Sale that concluded recently, its just about okay. I mainly bought it for coding purpose - for side by side diffs. Also you can watch 21:9 videos in 2K resolution (1440p). Check youtube."
4,"They should have added 2 HDMIs and a height adjustable stand. Nothing so great, but serves the purpose. Size and screen ratio are very appropriate for those who want to see multiple things all at once on the screen. Price is a bit pumped up now probably because of high demand. Hoping it will get back to the old one so that I can buy one more."
5,I got this at an amazing price during the Diwali sale and ordered it and received the product the next day.The issue was that it was shrink wrapped making the two holes in the box invisible that damages the monitor.After opening the box and while setting up the crack and hole in screen was visible. I've ordered for replacement and would be receiving the product in two days.Will be sharing my review and the replacement experience in a couple of days.So got the product replaced the next day and man what an amazing monitor it is.Earlier I thought that i woukd use it for multiple apps but really happy with the extra real estate it provides with wide viewing.Amazing product from Amazon. I am thinking to buy one more :)
5,Its value for money.I recently purchased this monitor and getting seamless performance.My task got more easier and quicker. Works well with windows 10 and MacBook Pro.The LG split screen is a good tool to manage our windows.LG Dual controller software makes it more convenient to work on two devices at a time which is a show stopper.Looks premium and build quality is good.Suggest to go for table mounting stand.
5,"Model VG240YS - 144/165hz (OC), 0.1 MS VRB, Native 2MS (Mentioned). Comes with Display Port Cable. And also got Speakers. Got two slots of HDMI 2.0 and With headphone jack.Upgraded from Zeb 15.6 to this Acer24 inch Monitor - Huge Difference.I do 3d Works, Graphic design, and long hours of Gaming. So I went for this model.Got a fresh product. No defects so far. No IPS-Glow / Bleeding effect. No dead pixels.This IPS display is Perfect with Great vibrant colors and Crisp Display. Fonts are sharp. Nice contrast. A lot of Brightness.  10-Bit color can be enabled through Nvidia control panel - Resolution settings (Below)With DP cable - 165,144 Hz is working fine. It also supports HDR same time. Freesync working with G Sync.HDR is Entry level. In HDR mode colors are good. But white exposure is over a bit. And cant change the Gamma, Brightness, Contrast with HDR mode. In Windows display setting - Windows HD color gives a slider to adjust HDR-SDR level, it helps.For Casual Gaming - Overdrive normal with Freesync is working fine with 144/165hz. The colors are so good and So smooth response. No visible ghosting or trails.For Competitive Gaming - VRB is awesome. Ultra fast response. I tried with Extreme. With extreme VRB - the brightness goes down, not that much still colors are enough. And it turns OFF freesync. Even though it turned OFF no tears visible. This is much like a side effect with IPS I think. But it is manageable.Acer widget software allows us to tweak settings without monitor inputs. But the monitor joystick is nice to use.With 15K we are getting a lot these things with an IPS panel. So can easily go for it. üëåüòä"
5,"**I had BLUE LIGHT FILTER turned on when i clicked the images so it may have a little yellowish tinge**I'm an ordinary middleclass boy who reads lot of reviews and does extensive research online before buying because i'm too scared to buy anything online due to floating reviews everywhere so kindly read the full unbiased review. Fantastic gaming monitor under 20k...TRUE IPS DISPLAY...I had 27inch Benq TN Panel(BenQ Zowie RL2755 ) which also costs around 14k and i have also used Acer KG271C 144HZ TN Panel(which i have returned on amazon)...but this acer blows it away in terms of picture quality...i bought it for competitive gaming but i was shocked to see the picture quality...i started to newly discover both single player and multiplayer games...brightness color contrast and everything else is outstanding....i had to lower brightness to 30 per cent to make it suitable...very good for video editing and watching movies also. People will say that IPS HAS BETTER VIEWING ANGLES BUT ITS NOT COMPLETELY TRUE, I DID DUAL AND TRIPLE MOITOR SETUP And ALSO TESTED WITH SINGLE SETUP and ALL THE THREE PERSONALLY BECAUSE I HAVE RTX 2060 AND COMPARED IT WITH MY TN PANELS (SIDE BY SIDE VIEWING FROM NORMAL SITTING DISTANCE) .THIS MONITOR BLOWS AWAY THE OTHER TWO MONITORS COMPLETELY ITS NO CONTEST AT ALL....VIEWING ANGLES ARE TOO BAD ON TN BUT EVEN ON NORMAL VIEWING THE IPS PROVIDES MUCH MORE...I WOULD SAY A LOT MORE COLOUR ACCURACY DEPTH, CONTRAST AND BRIGHTNESS THAN TN.I play Valorant and the performance it provides is outstanding...i upgraded from 60 to 165...i would like to describe it has BUTTERY SMOOTH PERFORMANCE no lags at all...only flick and one tap head now !! I was stuck on Iron 3 - Bronze 2 but now I'm Gold 1.My gaming settings - OVERDRIVE - normal, FREESYNC - off coz i have RTX 2060 gpu, VRB - normal. The brightness is too high so after enabling vrb to normal there is only 1% drop on brightness only...don't trust other stupid reviews which say screen becomes very dim. Even with vrb on the brightness can hurt your eyes so i set brightness to 30% only.Speakers are nothing special and I don't even care because I have headphones and speakers already.Stand is very good and sturdy and keeps the monitor steady even if your table shakes a little bit.Built quality is surprisingly very good...almost as good as my Benq Monitor which is quite expensive.(Benq monitors gaming/normal are actually slightly more expensive than other brands).I bought from seller XTRONICSAPP for 14k on Republic Day sale and got 1 day delivery so i absolutely recommend this seller...the first piece which i got had some issues with the stand(it was too stiff) and slight back light bleed on the bottom side of the left side....but it was not absolutely horrible or unbearable, a minor glow....it was absolutely fine when being used for gaming and other purposes but somehow the back light bleed started to bother me ...every time i turned on the monitor i could see a certain place glowing excessively with a white light type effect and it appeared as if its spreading over and becoming more prominent so i asked for replacement as i had used it for only 1 day...got next day delivery and replacement immediately on the next day. I have shared the backlight bleed issue with some of my friends, some said it was very minor and they wont't have oped for replacement but some said to replace and get a new coz the bleeding could spread as its a defective panel after all...more or less.New piece which i received is working perfectly fine...not a single issue and i'm absolutely loving this monitor. I have done UFO Test - framerate, ghosting, refresh rate(all the other ufo tests) and dead pixel test and it passed all of them...If u r buying monitor online from Amazon then u can absolutely trust seller XTRONICSAPP. He will provide high quality and new sealed product...and will provide quick replacement incase anything goes wrong. Cheers"
5,"165Hz as promised, worked with an old HDMI cable, my laptop has a modest Gtx 1650. (Comes with a DP cable no HDMI in the box). I've kept the OSD counter ON from the Monitor; both Windows and Nvidia control panel concurred that's its indeed at 165Hz. It was 144Hz by default on Windows 10 with an option to bump it upto 165, which I did. Unless you sit in a very brightly lit room or have sunshine on your desk, the brightness is very good!. I use it at only 30% since I'm a vampire when it comes to ambient light. The delivery took a good 3 and a Half days to deliver to the centre of Mumbai (geographical centre) which could've been faster but it was packed and handled well. Bought it for FPS games (currently hooked on Valorant which isnt very demanding) and it works perfectly with a modest Gtx 1650, i5 9th Gen and 8GB RAM. I've put no caps on the framerate so my modest machine is pushing it to a good 180 odd Frames/sec on Medium settings at 1080p (I dont like playing on low players eyebrows disappear :D so lame). Wont comment on colour accuracy since I'm not in that field but its definitely better than the IPS display built into my Laptop. A height adjustment would be too much to ask for at this price point of 17k in the last week on September, 2020, its unavailable now so I may have bought the last one in stock."
5,"Got this monitor for work from home. I'll play game occasionally. My main purpose is coding in this. Texts are crisp and clear. This IPS panel is really good and colour accurate. I won't say it has perfect viewing angles. You can set the black levels between normal and low. I've played Dota 2 and CS: GO in this and the experience is really good. Since my MacBook adaptor has no DP port I've used HDMI cable to connect this. Under HDMI connection the refresh rate is capped at 120hz. So cannot able to test the overdrive of 165Hz. The unit comes with a DP cable along with it. It has HDR 10 support at this price but don't expect a very good result from that. Mine has normal bleeding in the corners and that's usual in IPS panels. To mention it has Free Sync comes with it.For this price, it's really a good monitor."
5,"Great monitor, unfortunately got defective unit, applied for replacement.Update : got it replaced and the new one is good, no issues whatsoever. Perfect for me."
4,"This is my first monitor that is above 60hz. Also, first 1080p. Sad story, I know.One thing I noticed first, this isn't 23.8 inch at all. I measured it, and it's 21 inches. Including the box that it came with it may become 24 inch. I don't know why it says that on the description. And it's not completely bezel less. Yes there's no visible bezel when it's turned off except at the bottom. But when turned on it has a bezel of a couple centimeters. The display isn't fully edge to edge. Any tv or monitor you buy these days has the same issue. Actual product is a bit less in size than what it says in the description.Is it a huge disappointment? No, doesn't bother me.Anyway, I got the product. Brightness is great. Felt like I'll go blind at the default settings. I stay with 50 brightness on the monitor then fiddle with Nvidia control panel.G sync compatible, AMD freesync is turned on by default. Gets turned off automatically when you turn on VRB. Also Overdrive is available, which is pretty nice. If  you have never experienced VRB or Overdrive, you probably won't notice any difference by turning them on or off at first. But once you get used to the high refresh rate and play competitive games, you'll know why it's there.The panel I received has one dead pixel at the very top left corner side. But It's so small I didn't notice it first.  A very slight bleeding at the top, also didn't notice. It's very negligible. Don't know if this much bleeding is normal or not, but it's there. Wouldn't have noticed anything if I didn't do in depth monitor test. I do recommend to check out ezio.be and testufo.com after you buy any monitor. If there's any fault, you'll definitely notice it there.So will I return it? No, I'll probably forget that it's even there.Anyhow, gaming experience has been smooth so far (obviously). After experiencing 165hz, I threw my previous half dead 60hz 768p monitor from the roof and didn't look back. If your GPU isn't capable of pushing out more than 144 frames then don't bother. My 1660s can do that, for most of the games that I play. Have I gotten better at games? Definitely. Went from 10 kills avg. to 13 kills avg on Valorant, on iron 2. So yeah, absolutely worth it.Colors are pretty accurate. Huge upgrade from my shitty tn panel to ips. HDR is pretty garbage in my opinion, not much different than normal mode, except you can't change any setting in HDR. Only good side is that you don't get washed out colors if you watch a HDR movie. Not expected at this price, not needed.Speakers, if you can call those that, are... just there. They are very bad, no low frequency, but nice to have. Got a headphone jack, if you plug in your sound system, you'll get the sound through Nvidia sound panel instead of Realtek. They sound the same.Those are probably there as honorable mentions.Didn't test the hdmi ports, don't have a hdmi 2.0 cable, getting all the benefits from dp cable, why bother.So overall, a pretty great upgrade for me. Go for higher price range if you want. Why didn't I? well... Money of course, what else. At this price, this is a great product with many features, some of them are not essential, but nice to have. If you're hesitating, don't. There's no reason to. Great monitor for the price. BUY it. You know you want to.Still gonna play Red Dead Redemption 2 @ 30fps with motion blur on with every setting maxed out though. Because that's how I roll. GG bois"
4,"Colors are accurate and white is actually purest I have seen in any monitor.Only problem I have is with overdrive settings there is no difference between normal overdrive and overdrive off .First time I started a game I thought in game motion blur is on so I checked settings and realised that problem is with monitor, it can't handle blur very well.Again in extreme overdrive mode it performs on par with my old 144hz tn panel monitor (acer gn246hl) no motion blur at all and also very responsive.There is a little overshoot visible on brighter area in game or in the texts if you scroll down.So, basically blurry normal overdrive to no blur at all in extreme overdrive It feels like there is a missing overdrive option between normal and extreme.Freesync supported via display port with nvidia cards.Very basic 48-165hz range. Also you can't change overdrive when freesync is on. There is a way to bypass that but you will get crazy pixel overshoot in game.( Turn off Gsync in nvidia control panel set overdrive to extreme in monitor OSD then turn Gsync back on)No local dimming or 10bit panel so HDR is not that good. (Don't even try it, you will be disappointed)ConclusionThis monitor could have been the best gaming monitor if it only had a little diverse overdrive settings."
1,"Worst customer service from Acer. I received the product on 25 the October and on opening i saw this orangish patch on the upper side of the monitor. I filed a complaint against this to acer because i couldn't return it as the price has increased by then. And guess what, they told me that this patch is not covered under warranty. They just washed their hands away from this. I mean seriously? If a Company like acer can do this then i have lost the trust in it.Very bad customer service experience. Worst!!!!!Do not buy it!"
5,"The VG240YS is the best balanced 1080p monitor at its price range. I have been using this for the past 3 days & so far I have not faced any issues with it. There are no hot spots on the monitor's front or back even after 8-10 hours of use. In Standby mode the orange LED glows & it take 5 seconds for the display to enter active mode & it also take 5 seconds for the display to turn on. But every time it enters Active mode from Standby mode the display turn on & off & then on.Its power draw at standby is 0.5W. Its power draw is 18W in ECO mode (44% Brightness), 21W in Standard mode (70% Brightness) & 25W in HDR mode (100% Brightness) w/ AMD FreeSync On; when idle & in use. The power draw remains the same in static wallpapers as well as in live wallpaper from the Steam Wallpaper Engine. The power draw remains the same in games such as GTA V, CSGO, Horizon Zero Dawn, etc.But there are a few things that bug me about this monitor;1. The product model & the official Acer website name & spec of this monitor mismatch. The monitor does have the features that are mentioned in the amazon page. In Windows 10 its name is detected as VG240Y V.2. The speaker quality is not good; even worse than 300INR speakers.3. When I shake the monitor it rattles.4. The power LED indicator is blue in color. But it would have been better for the aesthetics to be red in color as the monitor has red accents. Or else white would have been a more neutral option.5. It has an internal power adapter & thus if it fails you will have to get it serviced at an Acer authorized service center. But having internal power adapter is also a good thing as it more tidy. Although this makes the monitor a bit thick.I know that this is not a traditional pros & cons review. And I have done so because its pros are well mentioned by the amazon product page & other reviews. The cons that I have presented are nit-picked. But the pros outweigh the cons & I would recommend anyone to buy this monitor if 17k is their budget."
5,Well this product is for those who want great gaming performance but with good media playback like it's IPS panel to watch movies or to do video editing but IPS panel is very much like standard IPS not like high end IPS it doesn't have high color accuray colours like high budget ips panels but good enough to enjoy movies and gaming too for the amazing price and I thought that it's the same panel that listed on Amazon like in 144hz same monitor but overclocked but turnedout to its different model from acer it comes with factory 165 hz refresh rate.Really happy that I buyed it on Prime sale in 15k 165hz +It supports G-Sync And AMD Freesync too And it comes With display port Cable as well So happy that I bought this instead of 144hz panel.If you are looking for budget IPS with 165 hz with G-Sync and AMD freesync And which comes with Display port Cable too this is just perfect wait for the offer and buy it in 15k.Enjoy.Thanks Amazon and acer and seller.
1,It has heavy backlight bleeding. Heavy ips glow.Edit 1 : Even after replacement there are more issues than the previous one. Many dead pixels. Requested for refund.
5,"I was looking for a 144hz ips panel monitor.There were very few options in this price segment.The final two were Msi g241 & this one.After lot of searching I found out both are exactly same (panel).Acer advantage : 1.)OSD app.2. Can goto 165hz on hdmi3. Lower price than msig241However there selling price of both monitor is same in US ( check Amazon.com not .in)I finalized this monitor.after 15 days of use I can say I made a good choiceLook stylish.VRB is a gimmick.Brightness is super high 250nits is more than enough.only issue I faced is "" Sometimes screen goes black for 3 secs , rarely but it happened.Not doubt go for this.I extend my laptop to this & It can goto 165hz np."
4,"This monitor has to be  the best money  you ever spent on a monitor. This monitor has a lot of options for customizing the settings and has an optional downloadable widget to control the UI .Refresh rate and the response time are the best for your money in this price range.Although there are a few drawbacks for a price like this.There is no cable management system near the stand so all your cables are loose. The stand  has no rotation give whatsoever and so it only stays in one postion .It cannot be adjusted to one's height,desk or chair for a comfortable arrangement.It is what it is.The stand is also fully made up of plastic.The monitor comes off very easily off the stand so in case of an earthquake there's a high chanve that your monitor will get damaged."
5,1080p 165hz ips display at 14k is amazing deal. After 1 month of usage everything is fine picture quality is too good and also u get support for gsync through free sync.U can set refresh rate to 165hz or 144hz.There is also acer widget software where u can use instead of buttons on monitor that's is too good10/10 for gaming10/10 for picture qualitySpeakers are decent.IMPThe first monitor received had some backlight bleeding issues at top left corner so I exchanged it and ordered new the new one is fine amazon return service was goodALWAYS SET A PURE BLACK WALLPAPER AND CHECK FOR BACKLIGHT BLEED ISSUES N OTHER DEFECTS IN DARK ROOM WHEN EVER U PURCHASECQNY DISPLAY.This monitor is too good at this price point loved it even design is gaming type good design if u get it for 14k or less just go for it(U GET A DISPLAY CABLE WITH MONITOR NO HDMI CABLE) so make sure ur graphics card or motherboard got one DP port.
1,"Cheap low Quality monitor, huge Backlight bleed, even after replacement, Horrible IPS Glow. go for benq or lG even viewsonic Just Don't Go For ACER!!"
1,Amazon scam 2020. Selling heavily backlight bleeding models with stuck pixels with no warranty.
3,Monitor shows burning effect when YouTube videos are played in ultra HD or higher mode. Colours are close to real but not real. I repent for not buying it's rival msi monitor. Actually I thought Acer had better experience on making monitors. Of better experience about Acer earlier. Got very disappointed. It's very slow in responding too.
5,Ultimate monitor for anything. Colours are accurate enough. Refresh rate is damn good. You dont need 165hz though 144hz is enough. Gaming at 120hz is amazing. Build quality not that good but not that bad either. For the price it's on top of the game.
5,"Acer products and their pricing has always been great. I had the same version of the monitor but on a lower side of hertz which I bought from a local store. This model has proved me Acer always provides quality products.PROS:> Easy as hell to setup.> Everything is included in the box> Colors out of the box is just good unless you are in a very bright room, you might want to tune the brightness.CONS:> Tilting the monitor has always been very tough for me. It is very hard and I am pretty scared to put pressure just to tilt the monitor up or down.> The monitor had a down tilt out of the box, which I was not able to tilt back up and hence I had to lower my seating. (I know this is like a illogical solution.. but hey.. you do you ;) I would be glad if someone could help me with the tilt :DOverall, the best ""gaming"" monitor you can buy for this price range."
5,I am not a professional gamer but monitor is doing great . Built quality is good and over all product is good.
4,"This is my first gaming monitor and have listed down my thoughts below.Pros:- Monitor feels big with the thin bezels on 3 sides - - Very bright screen. Colors look vibrant enough and no ghosting issues seen yet.- 2x HDMI 2.0 portsCons:- RECIEVED FAULTY POWER CABLE. The cable was loose and not fitting into the unit tightly. I ended up buying an after market one.- Noticed one pixel was always emitting blue light and later some flickering. But it got normal after couple of mins. Not sure what caused this, maybe HDMI cable issue ? But i don't see this as a big probApart from faulty power chord is a issue. Would definitely would recommend this monitor.Hope acer improves quality control."
5,"I just bought it in October 2020. I was looking for 144hz ips budget monitor with 1080p.I found acer vg240ys one and vg240yp .Both are same but jut a minor differences.Vg240yp has 144hz, 1ms response time (vrb on) and no mic output.Vg240ys has 165hz ,0.5ms response time (2ms is actual response time) and microphone output.Design wise this is great product consider it's price range. No other brands give us ips with 144hz at this price. Tn is very cheap quality display look. I personally suggest to buy ips moniter like vg240ys .Stand is very good quality.Overall value for money products.Just buy it you don't want to see any videos or review for this monitor. Just buy it. I got this at 16999/- rs.Availablity is little issue but I hope in future it will resolve."
4,I have tried everything from windows settings but it just doesn't show a higher refresh rate than 120Hz. I keep checking but I don't get an option for it. I am using a laptop to connect to my screen and only keep second screen (that is this screen) active. Even when I try the refresh-num option in the settings it shows 120.
4,"Good Monitor, its been 2 days of use so far and im using it on Path of Exile, Apex Legends etc. The FPS certainly does go to 144. My only gripe with this was i got a power cable of 15A instead of the standard so i had to switch it out with one i had already. So people who wish to buy it please bear this in mind.(For those who dont know, its the large plug cable for power outlets, not usual plug used for most PC components)"
4,I placed a request for replacement because the one i got was showing green screen while alt tabAnd alt tab is too slow like vry slowHope i get a good replacementGot the replacement today I'll update review in  few days
5,"Connected it with laptop , laptop started to render everything at 165hz . This display is perfect for watching anime and playing games . There is only one downside that is , even at lowest brightness its still too bright but the monitor's is perfect otherwise . Since there is no defect in the monitor and pricing is good it definitely deserves 5 stars . (If your processor is good but screen is 60hz , just buy this monitor everything will run at 165fps , game fps depend on how strong your gpu is ) ."
4,"Gud vibrant colors , brightness is more Than sufficient . It has free sync works gud with my 1660 super .Colors are not accurate for professional works. Speaks are decent for a in built  setup. Weirdly its sounds load in hdmi mode than in dp mode not sure why. 165 hz works great out of the box (NOTE 165 HZ OR 144HZ WORKS ONLY WITH DP CABLE NOT WITH HDMI ) .Its a decent monitor for the price better than MSI MAG 24  at this price."
5,I'm using this monitor with my ASUS ROG gaming laptop.1. I got a FPS boost.2. I got 144 and 165 Hz with the Amazon Basics 2.0 HDMI cable.3. Moving from 60Hz to 165 can't be put into words.4. Go for it.
1,Please don't buy got a death pixel in middle of the screen at 11days
4,I'm using this with my laptop with GTX 1060 6gb.NB if you are using on laptop dont forget to buy a mini dp to dp convertor.I am getting full 165 fps in Rainbow 6 and around 90-100 fps in PUBG.The quality is not noisy compared to laptop screen but manageable. By default super sharpness is on so turn it off else it makes everything look terrible.
5,"It's a value for money product.. Going great after 24hrs usage, colours look bright & its look are good than others..."
4,"Product is as discriberd , working flawlessly with my ps4 and PC, but not sure about the warranty, Acer India official Prague does not have this monitor maybe its a imported product.PROS:IPS 165hzGr8 viewing anglesResponse time is far better than Samsung or other monitors priced under 25k or even 30kLots of ports 2 HDMI 2.0 and 1 display port with one 3.5 mm jackCons : not sure about wwarrenty.Typical IPS glow, which is present in almost every IPS monitor"
5,"Got this monitor for around 14k for 24 inch/165hz and it was totally worth it....comes with a vibrant IPS panel with great viewing angles and almost no bezels on 3 sides. Also, it is freaking smooth, I mean if you are going from 60hz to this, you'll surely feel the difference. It has a joystick for navigating in the inbuilt menu which is a great plus! You can also connect your headphones to it if you want. The inbuilt speakers are okayish, but who uses the inbuilt speakers anyway.One thing that is missing is the height adjustment. Could have been a plus...but rest of the things are totally worth going for! Good going acer!"
5,"Best product! I bought it @15,499Rs and very happy with it's performance. I'm using it with my Asus TUF A15 with HDMI at 165Hz (Yes, it has hdmi 2.0 which supports 165Hz refresh rate) and display looks amazing!"
4,"Great product indeedPros:- very good 165hz refresh rate- comes with speakers- viewing angles are pretty good- amazing picture qualityCons:- doesn‚Äôt come with adjustable stand- typical ips glow- takes some time detecting input from sourceOverall, it‚Äôs a steal for gamers and regular productivityCompared to MSI g241, it‚Äôs a tough competition but the acer takes the lead in terms of price.If you‚Äôre willing to spend 2-4K extra, go for the G241."
5,Pros:- really good price-ips accurate colour mode provided-nipple menu controls(best imo)-better build quality than other budget offerings-no tearing whatsoever even when gsync is globally offCons:- brightness unadjustable while using VRB modes-screen is bleeding a bit at the edges (only noticable when the screen is full black tho)-amd freesync premium just crashes the drivers completely and have to restart pc to fix (maybe a NVIDIA glitch probably)-colour presets are non saveable
5,"Amazing display quality monitor with upto 165hz via Display port.Sadly, my laptop only has HDMI, so I can only go upto 120Hz , however I tested 165Hz with a different laptop and it looks amazing.Just enable the low latency mode in Gaming settings and you'll love the display"
4,"Everything is fine with the monitor and I am very much satisfied with the crisp picture quality. The brightness and colour accuracy is also as expected. If you use HDMI 2.0 you will receive 165hz display. However, HDMI 2.0 cable is not given in the box. You can even use the hdmi cable given with tata sky set up box which is hdmi 2.0. Apart from all this praise there is one major problem with my unit. There is a stuck pixel just around the border. Amazon told me that the replacement is not possible in my location. So, now I‚Äôll have to fix this through acer‚Äôs one year warranty. Fingers crossed."
5,A good Display. Won‚Äôt recommend for use with HDR. Rest a good value for money.But If you really want a high response rate monitor don‚Äôt go with the IPS screen. There‚Äôs another variant with VA/TA panel (I‚Äôm not sure) available on amazon for 12 or 13k.
5,Totally worth it purchase...Great IPS display quality with High resolution165hz with free sync is a great experienceAcer totally reached to my expectations and added bunch of cool features like black boost and easy display settings control in one click.The box comes with a display cable instead of a HDMI cable.The stand is really strong and easily adjustable.
5,With this price it is workable
1,"please don't buy this product , its very poor quality productand they also don't give refund on return for defective product  (only replacement , ""even if you get any defective product in replacement  replacement cycle runs infinite as per customer care advise ....."")"
3,Narrow viewing angle and colours are not vibrant. The overall finish is not no where near that of HP monitor I am using for my desk top. The stand is  light a gust of wind or gerk  may topple the monitor. Over all  it is just average and not very happy with this purchase but still may keep it as I am using it as cc tv monitor where viewing angles are not that imp. Definitely will not be purchasing again.
1,But this product only if you solely want to use this for work purpose sitting in front of it.But for viewing movies or videos this can't be used as the viewing angle is very low approx 90H and 90V and not as mentioned in product description. Incorrect information mentioned in product and I rate less than average for this product
1,This product is a monitor it is a junk material half of screen is blank and other half has lines which are clear from the pi cute  product was delievered to me .I wrote immediately to replace it  but after ten days there is  no positive response I was msgedby.A line was below product May replace on 11feb2021but only a uncertain promise which remained unfullfilledPlzlet me definely when you wii replace the product for which I paid in advance  infaith that such a big company will no failBut u have shattererd my faithYou promised on your man will visit my place on 11feb 2021 but no bodycameNow what abt its solution letme know
2,the product in itself is good. but has real bad viewing angles. additionally The one i received was damaged. the box was fine though. no replacement could be provided as there was no stock. Ive now opted for the MSI 24 inch monitor full HD for about 3k more and im glad.
3,"The monitor is really sturdy, has good viewing angles (for the price), is the only monitor at this price point with 1600√ó900 resolution, the colour contrast is really good. All in all, a bargain in this price bracket. Don't know about longitivity so I'll update this review if I ever have any problems with the monitorEdit - within 2 days, the monitor has got a dead pixel. Not a huge deal but its annoying to look at."
5,"Got the 19.5‚Äù model for ‚Çπ3999 which is a great deal. Monitor supports 1600*900px resolution max, which is excellent. Brightness and colours are good. However the monitor is quite lightweight and the stand feels somewhat flimsy. Be careful when using the buttons on the back side of the monitor as even touching the monitor lightly makes it wobble. Also monitor angle cannot be adjusted. However for the price paid this is a great deal, since most 19.5‚Äù / 20‚Äù monitors cost around ‚Çπ6000/7000."
4,Product is great. And valur it is value for money. But 1 pixel is not good . The image of  damage pixel i have added .And VGA and HDMI PORT SLOT IS WEEK
4,The product is of good quality. Using it in office with DOS based accounting software. Does the job of showing numbers properly. A very good monitor for basic office work. The fit and finish is also good. Nothing to complain about. It is a plastic body monitor with an added benefit of hdmi port.
1,"Monitor stopped working in less than two months. Since last two weeks, service center request is open but there is no call and update even after following up again and agian. Zebronics's products is a mistake to buy."
5,Very nice
1,Please do not buy very worst experience there is no display on monitor also very bad customer service from Amazon & Appario retail pvt ltd this item come with 10 days replacement but in my case they not fulfill this commitment Amazon not take responsibility and give me fulish arguments very worst response
1,"Both original and replacement had the same manufacturing defect.. The display was not fully attached to the frame of the monitor. Very much disappointed, for the first time in Amazon"
1,Power cord doesn't suit. Unable to use the product. Pleased order for return. No one came and picked up. Very poor response Not satisfied with this product and not recommending as well.
3,"Product is good for price! No complains at all.But seller didn't mentioned Panel type in description which is really bad. I wntd IPS, but this model was TN paneled. Not that satisfied with this product, but giving 3 stars as this is good quality at the price! Not very bad! Seller needs to update description clearly. Thank you for reading!"
2,The picture quality is not good. The only good thing is price but spending little more is a better option than this. The worst thing is we cant return it.
2,Was very surprised that there is no remote.How can u sell a tv product without a remote .Kindly send the remote to the same address as soon as possibleThank u
1,Pathetic experience. The monitor was delivered defective. It had a permanent vertical white/magenta line at the center of screen.No response after registering complaints.And the monitor cannot be wall mounted because of design defects. Can't believe a bogus company with such poor designing of products can even survive in the market.
5,1) very good to connect. both ports work fine.2) pictire quality is good but if you want a better contract alternative this is not for you.
1,It is unsuitable for wall mounting. The monitor is too thick and cables are on the back side due to which mounting is not possible. No mounting part provided either.
4,Good product thickness and sheerness are good I'm happy üòä
1,LED SCREEN WAS DEFECTIVE WHEN I SAW I WAS SHOCKED. ITEM PRICE IS ALSO HIGH ACORDING TO LOCAL MARKET RATE.
3,Worth for money. but display quality some what inferior than Samsung / benq
3,Good to buy for CCTV
4,It's OK but internal sound not available.
4,"Working gud üëå packages was well done by the seller, propmpt delivery in gud condition"
1,"Smaller Size is 46 cms i.e 18 inch and display that good , it just ok"
4,"Very good value for money, useful for specific use cases. But picutr quality is what you'd expect from a cheap monitor."
1,"Defective pics received, returned"
5,Product is nice but display is not so good for playing games
1,Pathetic product.Came with a crack screen . When started couldnot use it.Applied for refund . Still refund not given .This is daylight roberry. Dont buy this product. Go for a standard product
5,"I like the monitir,but emi is not yet sent by bankIn fact my cc statement charges the full amiunt of 4000plusI do not want to return this itemOnly want emi to be generated"
3,"Very light weight and poor build  quality Monitor stand is so delicate that even with small movement, the monitor wobbles heavily."
5,Product looks good and display is also good.
4,It is good but view angle not satisfied
4,"The monitor will do its job no issue as such, you can go ahead and buy if you just want an extra screen for your working needs"
1,Brightness is not reducing at all.. Even though set it to 0
3,Good to buy. But the monitor screen cable was not properly fixed. After fixing that with service  it is good. Good service by zebronics
5,Nice screen value for money
5,Value for money.
5,Good quality
5,The display is cheapest in price and quality is equal to benq so changes can be made eco-friendly same like other monitor with blue light filters
5,I will give 5 start...solid and very premium built quality with great HDR..colors r very vibrent and aslo produce very sharp images with super resolution features..no any other brand will give this package in this price. Extra 4000/- is worth for HDR when compare with GW2780. Size is perfect for gamers. And yes its sounds Is good like small Bluetooth speakers.earlier i was concerned about brightness bcoz it have 250 nits but in person its great and more than enough...fully setesfied with the purchase.
1,"Received while on tour. When back, unpacked and noticed that the screen was cracked. As the packaging and the housing showed no dent, this must have been packed and shipped with fraudulent intent.And it worked out, as the brief return window had just closed the day before my return.Joys of online shopping.Otherwise good product, purchased already multiple."
5,"Its really a good monitor at this price with HDR and other features. It has good amount of brightness and contrast perfectly suited for watching videos and movies as well. Its built in speaker is small but produces a good amount of sound, however dont expect the outcome like from a TV. It has headphone port which could be connected to external monitors.It has 3 HDMI ports so that multiple devices can be connected to it at same time, however no other type of ports like DVI, VGA or Display ports. However you can use converter cables from these type of ports to HDMI.Regarding the color reproduction, its really awesome and accurate. It has several eyecare features and settings, however i like the reading mode which makes the entire screen grayscale.Nice product for this price."
1,"Nice budget monitor, edge bleeding issue. overall ok. also i would not recommend this one for gaming.Speaker quality is decent.Update 1: I had to replace it as the edge bleeding was getting worse & distracting day by day. Strangely the replacement product I got from Amazon is even WORSE than my previous one!! & It seems like it's not a fresh produce either it's a renewed one or used .So I contacted Amazon & they can't exchange it again so they will return it & refund my money!So something I learnt from this & it might help you-* Try to avoid buying stuff in this kind of festival offers or anykind of major offers. As thare is a higher chances to get defective or old products in less price.(For example I bought this monitor in 15,204. Which is a good deal , but as it's defective & they refunded my money , I can't buy that product in same price! The price is higher now!)* If you get a defective product , don't replace it, just return it, thare is a higher chance to get even more defective product in the replacement!* when you get your product delivered, Try to capture a unboxing video of the product for your own defence & proof.Update 2:Refund received today, got my refund within 24 hrs, thanks to Amazon for that.But I will try to stay away from this brand (Benq) & it's products!!"
5,"This is my first impressions/weeks take on the BenQ EW2780 monitor.I am currently using a Dell S2240L that I purchased in 2013.The Dell monitor has given me stellar service and I have zero complaints...except that it's a 22"" monitor, which over the years was getting a little cramped.My Dell monitor has a glossy screen, so picture/color reproduction is absolutely top notch.(way better than some other matte screen monitors that I have seen.)So the main reason for the upgrade was to get more screen area to use.Upgrading from a 22"" to a 24"" monitor seemed like a minor incremental upgrade at best, while upgrading to a 27"" monitor is a major upgrade (in terms of usable area).The only issue with a 27"" monitor ""seemed"" to be the drop in pixel density from 103(for a 22"") to 82(for a 27""), and the resulting loss in clarity/sharpness on texts and pictures.I did physically check out a few 27"" monitors in showrooms (big ones like Croma or other big shops will not have any 27"" monitors on display, so I checked out some smaller ones in my neighborhood.)At least for me, I hardly saw any major degradation in the clarity/sharpness on texts and pictures from around 2 feet distance, so I knew that going in for a 27"" made sense.I use monitor for general purpose.....word,excel,web surfing,movies and games.I don't care for high refresh rates and faster response times as I play SP games, so 60 hz was more than enough for me.(the EW2780 tops out at 75 Hz.)So I needed a 27"" 1080p (60hz) monitor.(Was looking for a glossy monitor but couldn't get any. I think no one makes glossy monitors now a days.)Initially I did look at a few monitors from Dell,HP,Philips and BenQ.HP 27f/27fw/27er are very sleek but are also a good 3k more than comparable Dell and BenQ.The Philips 276E9QJAB is around 3k cheaper but looked a bit cheap in build quality...and has very few reviews on the net.Dell SE2719HR also seemed good (though the panel quality of the SE series is a tad lower than the regular S series from Dell), but its the same price as the BenQ EW2780 which has the additional HDRi feature.The BenQ GW2780 is a good 3k cheaper than the EW2780 but also doesn't have the HDRi feature.Other reviews for the BenQ EW2780 on the net seemed good so I decided to order this one.First impressions after assembly were very good. The monitor looks minimalist and very premium with a solid well designed metal base.It's almost bezel less and looks beautiful. (but this is the norm now for all monitors.)I did compare it's picture/text quality against the Dell, and am very pleased with the results.The picture quality matches and even surpasses in quite a few instances.Even the text is crisp and clear. (For people with a very good eyesight, maybe this might be an issue, but it certainly wasn't for me.)For me personally the HDRi (simulated HDR) was a hit and miss, as I was able to see a good amount of contrast in certain games with it switched on, while it was a bit too dark in others.I tested Metro Exodus, Dishonored 2, Styx for HDR, as these games have a lot of dark and lit areas next to each other.The HDR works fairly well in Exodus and Dishonored 2, as the dark areas were suitably darkened without going overboard and the overall experience was very good.For Styx, the HDR made things a bit too dark for my taste and I preferred to keep it on Cinema HDRi or just switch it off.I tested Ori & the Will of the Wisps for color pop and vibrancy, which was on point and everything looked absolutely beautiful.Generally speaking, Cinema HDRi makes the scenes more vibrant, while HDR darkens the dark areas and provides a deeper contrast.The OSD controls are fairly comprehensive.Didn't test the inbuilt speakers as I have separate ones.There seems to be minor back light bleed on the left corner but its not too distracting.Imo the upgrade was totally worth it.The large screen fills your vision and I cant believe why I didn't think of moving to 27"" earlier.The 27"" 1080p screens give a very pleasant experience (for both pictures and text), as long as you are not into professional graphics designing and editing, and are at least around 1.5/2 feet away from the monitor.For regular day to day office use, net surfing, movies and SP gaming, it suits my needs perfectly."
5,"Picture quality is crisp and amazing given its ips an panel. The in built speakers does a great job and it's very clean. Do not expect anything beyond sound of a  decent phone speakers. Perfect for work from home setups and for ppl looking for a daily use, binge watching, and gaming."
3,"EXPECTIONS vs. REALLITYEXPECTATIONS: I wanted a decent monitor for WFH programming job.So I looked around on the internet, there were lot of options some were too expensive and some were cheap too. I ain't a gamer at all so my specific demand was a full HD IPS panel with good colours and built in speakers. I found this model and did a huge R&D about it, like blogs, YouTube videos etc... The specs on paper looked really promising to me. Finally made up my mind despite of having a bit overpriced (17k), I bought it.REALITY1. The packaging was ridiculously done..2. Felt like it was opened before. As if someone returned it or replaced it already.3. Picture quality was good I would say, just like I saw in the YouTube videos.4. Speakers were decent but within two weeks, they started to distort badly. Really pissed off on this one...CONCLUSIONDisplay quality is a plus point. Blacks are really blacks and yes I do feel comfortable using it all day for work since it has some eye filters. Overall is a bit overpriced for the specs. Speakers are worst part about this monitor. If you are getting this monitor for less than15k then go for it otherwise I would say go for it's lower model which is worth 13k.THIS IS NOT FOR GAMERS"
2,Pixelated image and text on 27 inch FHD. Better go with 24 inch or Qhd monitor. PPI is less than 90 which in general is quite bad. Purchased it due to positive reviews but I can't return it now. This monitor may be good to watch movies and little bit of gaming. For programming a big NO!
1,"I noticed a air bubble within days of its purchase but didn't pay an attention. However that air bubble turned into big black spot at right side of the monitor on 12th day of its purchase. Since I already crossed 10 days replacement timelines, I can't replace it on Amazon and BenQ customer care is claiming it as physical damage. There's absolutely no outside physical damage but BenQ customer care isn't sending a technician to verify my claim. They're asking to pay 90% of total monitor cost to repair it. This monitor was fun until it lasted only 2 weeks. Understandably I'm totally disappointed after burning my pocket by 17000/- for 2 weeks fun."
5,I would like to say it is the best monitor in this budget. Few things that I would highlight:Excellent displayNo grey spotsI am not a gamer so wont comment on that.My use is mostly for office work.You can read the documents very easily without any eye strain.Though it is a 27 inch screen but no blurring effect.Amazon delivery is just too good.
5,"Before buying this monitor for my home office, I had to do a full research on what would best suit my needs. I‚Äôm not a gamer, so I needed a monitor that‚Äôs good for web surfing, working and occasionally watching YouTube/Netflix.This is a 27 inch 1080p HDRi monitor. The highest recommended size for 1080p would be 24 inch monitors but as I occasionally watch movies, I had to push it by a bit. It‚Äôs a fair trade off for me because 2k/4K monitors are substantially more expensive than this one.Now coming to review of this product, initially I received a faulty product which was replaced by amazon within a day. Apart from that, the monitor has some really nice features that are hard to find like ambient light sensor that works really well, low blue light filter. Both these features really help me reduce eye fatigue post sunset. Apart from that there‚Äôs a hot key for changing the mode from low blue light to HDRi and suddenly everything is vibrant and good for watching YouTube/Netflix.The monitor also has timer which pops up nicely in the bottom left corner reminding us to take breaks in the intervals that we choose from the available options.While this monitor also comes with inbuilt speakers, I haven‚Äôt used them much as I have external 5.1 speakers. One thing that I noticed is the inbuilt speakers are louder and sound better than my work laptop.Apart from this, the panel is matte finish and doesn‚Äôt have any reflections, and the monitor height is also decent provided you are an average height person. For someone that‚Äôs taller than 6 feet, they might need a VESA stand to adjust the height of the monitor to avoid strain on neck."
4,"I won't give a technical review, you can find that in couple of other review posts. I will be posting what I did not find in other posts or something of value in my own experience of purchase.1. Audio quality is good not great because of the limited volume. Given you are going to use it as an extended monitor or nearby PlayStation experience the volume should suffice. For a rich music experience, you might need to plug into a set of external speakers.2. The monitor mount is metallic and very sturdy. Nice and sleek.3. I had to raise an exchange due to the issue of light bleeding and the exchange turned out to be fine. Although, I am pretty sure the seller tried to ship me a defective unit for the first time. For the first time, the seal tape by BenQ visible in the attached image was missing. The seller in my case was Appario Retail Private Ltd.4. I started from a sub 10k budget and pushed to this monitor for 16.5K on a strong recommendation by a friend and I am glad I did it.The sweetest deal for this price."
4,Monitor is good for movie watching. It has good sound. Lot of colors.But if you are planning to work/code with it. then I would suggest to go for other monitor and not this one.
5,"I have been using this monitor for a month now for my home office. This i must say is an awesome monitor and does the job perfectly. 27 inch size is pretty good for your work. I found monitors from other company with almost same functions at much higher price. I am happy to have this one. 36 months warranty is good enough, though competitors are also giving the same warranty. Although monitor is not meant for audio but i found audio quality decent enough. I can attend my meetings without headset using monitor's audio. Overall a good deal, if someone is planning to buy a monitor go for it without second thought."
5,"I didn't need 4k or 144hz refresh rate. I wanted a simple monitor with good colour and 1080p. And I found this. This has HDRi as well. It is perfect. Has 3 hdmi inputs..if I want to shift from windows to my mac, its hassle-free. ...even I can quickly shift to my gaming console. The screen is tiltable and can be easily adjusted to the viewing angle. Overall very good product. Very very easy to set it up in the provided stand. And looks very modern."
4,"Overall it's a nice product in this price range, the build quality is clean and finish is good, the placement of buttons and cable ports are neat, though it has speakers, I prefer my 2.1 Bose, so don't want to comment on the sound. Font readability is crips and good, image reproduction is good, only I will suggest that the Color reproduction is good but that great when compared to my Dell UltraSharp, hence I am using this Monitor as secondary, as I deal mostly with colors."
1,"It has a very dim display panel, not suitable to be used in a well lit room, irrespective of day or night. Colour reproduction is awry, whites appear grey, no colour calibration of any kind. I am very disappointed with this EW2780 monitor. It is waste of money, not reconnended at all.  This monitor does not even compete with significantly lower priced monitor e.g. Lenovo, ones wich cost around 10K which I am using in our office.Since, there is no straight option to return it, I tried to rectify these issues by all possible settings i.e. from montior and PC software/driver.  But it could not come close to even my laptop screen display reproduction, which is by the way a TFT screen and not an IPS.I previously had an LG 27"" FHD monitor which worked great but it did not age well. After 5 years of usage, the brightness got dim and it developed a vertical line in the middle which intermittently appeared at times. Still, it had a good run and i was happy with the purchase. Personally, I am okay to compromise on such con than living every day with very bad colour reproduction, significantly low brightness and really bad colour calibration out of the box.I would recommend to choose LG monitors instead of Benq. Even though the IPS glow is more evedent in LG monitors than the Benq one, but this con is nothing compared to what issues we get with Benq EW2780.I went through a lot of trouble but got my Benq monitor return approved. After this, I purchased an LG monitor with which I am very happy. One more suggestion I could give is to go for panel brightness no less than 350 nits and if budget permits go for QHD monitor."
5,Very Good monitor with great picture quality and speaker output is also decent better than My LG 24 inch
5,"After 1 month of usage, I can surely say this is the best budget monitor you can get in this range.The colors are mesmerising, HDR doesn't wash the image up if it is supported by the stream. Brightness and Contrast can be a little too high for low brightness users like me. Rec.709 mode is the best color mode to get perfect blacks and minimal backlight bleed.Does suffer from backlight bleed (so does a 1L+ alienware) but is not visible in a dimply or brightly lit room. You can only notice it if you are looking at a pitch black screen in a dark room and searching for it. IPS glow is minimal and not prevalent in games or a lit room.Refresh rate is 60HZ so not recommended for FPS gaming especially if your system can give more than 60 HZ. I play Cyberpunk2077 and GTA V on it and I can say that you will get that zowie (Benq's gaming range) feel with the right settings.Does support upto 75HZ as exposed by some tweaking softwares but would not recommend overclocking as it would void the warranty.For development purposes, the standard stand hight is efficient for viewing colors at the correct angles and swivelling is also less sensitive so you can swivel it down a bit if you are getting too much glow.For watching movies, well if you want immersive images, Cinema HDRi will bring that cinema feel to you and it doesn't hurt the eye as well. Otherwise rec.709 is recommended for dark and horror movies.From a Gamer and a developer's point of view, just go for it."
1,"Please do dead pixel test after getting this monitor. I observed after the return date. I raised a request with Benq India for EW2780 dead pixel issue - R200800739. They said as ""As per BenQ Pixel policy it will not support under warranty"".I don't know now what to do. If anyone faced same kind of issue and resolved the problem, please share details."
3,Best qualities:brightness intelligence - helps to set reminder for eye protection and automatically adjusts the brightness according to the room light.Ease of use - multi-picture mode. You can set mode according to the usage that would give you appropriate brightness and blue light managementThings which are not good:Sound quality is not so great. highest volume is 50% that u can hear it feebly only around 50mts when  your atmosphere is quiet. otherwise volume is very low. If you are looking for some monitor which has good sound quality then you should consider other products. Otherwise this is great to office work usage.
3,"Resolution is not quite good. Better go for 24 inch model, as the Resolution is much better with the same 1080p.Also the movie watching experience is not quite good as the frames are not smooth.The 16 plug for power is ridiculous.Only positive thing is the HDR, provided the source is good."
5,"power cords of benq are very big 3pin and It usually won't fit Normal 3 pin socket that we have in Indian houses. Buy a connector from ur local electrical shop and you're good to go.Cona 3 pin Universal connector will cost u around 150bucks.Refer the pic..And you're welcome..Monitor is good. I used it for coding, photo editing and video editing.. all in one with hdr features.Advantages. :SlimNo edge screenIn built speakersmultiple HDMI portHdr-iDisadvantages :Cannot be rotated 180¬∞No webcam."
5,Loved it!!!!Stunning looks and display
5,"Bought this for WFH use, I'm a developer using Macbook Pro 16, with this display as my primary display. Coming from mac display this is definetly a downgrade but can't expect much from 1080p monitor. I got it for 16k, which gave me 27inch display with good colors. HDR mode is kinda useful sometimes. The major selling point for me is the auto-brightness feature using light sensor at the bottom of the display. Since I'm always infront of it, I wanted something that would have less harm on my eyes. This works nice. Speakers are also good..not great but good"
1,The screen looks like patchy ! It looks like there is cloth behindThis monitor HDR is nothing but oversaturationThey can't claim it as HDR !It's not even HDR1027 inches screen with 1080 p resolution is like over scaling ! Also heavy backlight as it's an LCD screen
4,This is an amazing monitor with amazing low price. Got this during amazon sale. The monitor has got 4 HDMI ports (but it do lack USB port) along with one Aux and other connector. I would recommend this monitor for those who work and also do a gaming. I personally do both. The color saturation is amazing and contrast too at this price point. Colors are bright with amazing blacks too and it has got lot of options for the type of screen one wants. All in all an amazing product. Go for it.
4,"I was horrified seeing it did not switch on even on powering the monitor, after multiple checks found that the power plug is loose. After pushing in a little more, it worked but everytime the cable moves a bit the monitor looses power, So I had to make sure the power cable is fixed in a place and doesn't move while I work.. Let me know if some one has a solution for it.Except for this issue, it is a great monitor to work on!"
5,I recently switched from samsung 22inch to Benq 27inch and the change is noticeable. Brilliant color reproduction and sharpness. If you want to step up from samsung or LG then this will be the right choice. This screen may not satisfy a pro gamer but it definitely provide a good gaming experience for gamers like me. I mostly do the designing and video editing work and for that this screen is absolutely perfect.
5,I loved the screen. Bought it for WFH and also for my daughter's online class. reduces strain on eyes after long working hours. Only one element that I felt could have been better was the stand height. The stand is sleek and good. It may work for others though.
2,Build quality is good. Picture quality is not so good. It‚Äôs good for watching movies. If you are a coder then you will see pixels in the texts.I dint find any good use of HDRi technology in this.
5,"Its really a good monitor at this price with HDRi and other features. It has good amount of brightness and contrast perfectly suited for watching videos and movies as well. Its built in speaker is small but produces a good amount of sound, however don't expect the outcome like from a TV. It has headphone port which could be connected to external monitors."
3,"Do not expect good sound quality from the inbuilt speakers, its average and not very loudPicture quality is ok, again not that crisp. Since I am used to Mac screen, this looks pretty average."
5,"The monitor with a bezel-less design, clear picture quality, crisp speaker, and budget-friendly.  I am satisfied with this premium monitor from Benq. As defined in their description, this monitor fulfills all the commitments it has made in the paper."
4,Great picture quality..... Soothing to the eye..... Irritation to the eyes are significantly less than other screens for someone who has 6 to 7 hours of office work. Only the sound quality is a little drawback.... Could've given a better quality speaket but can be made up with a normal audio device. Price for what you will get is a little on the premium side given this is a newer product. Overall satisfied with my purchase.
3,"Nice monitor for general purpose. The unit delivered to me had dead pixel, even the replacement had the same issue. Didn't purchase eventually."
5,"Perfect for Engineers üë©‚Äçüíª Especially I love the eye care feature, sensor works perfect !! Apart from this picture quality is very good, refresh rate is good , so overall happy with the product."
5,"Go blindly for BenQ products due to their sheer durability. 21.5"" monitor lasted 5 years and 2 laptops. This is a thin monitor with extremely sharp picture quality and focus. Multiple inbuilt viewing modes give a pleasurable viewing experience. I have both the benq 27"" models - with HDR (this one) and without HDR(GW model). I would suggest go for this one for a superior experience."
5,The best in budget monitor with eye care technology and HDRI color output. Best for gaming and watching movies. Very Sharp image output for digital documents. Thin bezzels on screen makes it beautiful and eye catching. Not good for editing . Must buy for gaming and intertainment.
4,picture quality and everything is amazing but the left speaker has got distortion and its so bad that I stopped using the built in speakers.
2,"The M5 32"" (‚Çπ 25000) appears to be a bang for the buck over the M7 32"" variant(‚Çπ 37000).The only two differences being -1. Screen resolution - 1080P (M5) vs 4K (M7)2. USB C to C option for 65W charging & connectivity is present in M7 & not in M5.  However the USB C to C cable is not included in the M7 OOTB package for which you will need to shed out another 1000 odd bucks to get the compatible cable and make use of the connectivity option. Huge disappointment on that front.M5 32"" is still a desirable monitor cum Tv @ ‚Çπ 25000 given the value proposition it offers while M7 falls flat, charging a bomb.For 37000, you can get a massive 4K HD LED IPS Redmi TV at 55"" against the minuscule 32"" inch 4K HD LED VGA Samsung M7 smart monitor, if you desire for a good TV. If you are just after the monitor & not the TV, 25K M5 variant would suffice more than needed.-------Detailed Review :What's in the box? üéÅ1. 32"" VGA Monitor & a stand with required screws. (Yeah you've seen it right, it's VGA and not IPS)2. Power Adapter3. HDMI - HDMI Cable4. Remote with batteriesWhat's not? üö´USB type C-C cable for 65W charging is NOT included as part of the M7 package and the feature in itself is not available in the M5 32""/27"".What's great? üòª1. TV + Monitor all in one interface, pre loaded with the YouTube/Prime/Netflix/Hotstar/Zee5/Apple TV+ apps.2. Display & visual calibration - Despite being a VGA panel, I've zero complaints on the display quality and the available calibration options. I haven't witnessed any ghosting/black bleeding regardless of the surrounding brightness. Eye Care & Adaptive Display calibration are good & I'm sure with the subsequent software updates, display options and calibrations will only grow from strength to strength.3. Seamless transition from Tv to Work & back : Thanks to the Tizen OS. All it takes is just a remote click and I'm already loving to swap between the TV & the Work Monitor without much ado or efforts.4. Remote - The best part of it all. Minimalistic yet effective. This makes the experience so rewarding. Offers the comfort from wherever you are.5. Audio quality - Oh boy, this blew me off! Nobody would've expected a monitor to perform so well in this area. The Amplification option is ""real loud"" and trust me you won't need to tune beyond 25 so not to invite the fury of your neighbours. Audio quality is exceptionally good given its price range. Hey but, don't expect the Atmos / Bass effect. It does it's job over and above. DOT. It even allows you to pair a bluetooth headset/speaker if in case you need. The BT headphone option for sure helps those late night binge watchers with parents/kids next room.6. AirPlay support - Perhaps the only non mac monitor to come up with an inbuilt AirPlay support. You can mirror your iOS / MacOs / iPadOs devices with an one time pairing. Works reasonably good although the efficacy lies in the strength of your Wifi.But make no mistake, the monitor doesn‚Äôt support HomePods / HomePods Mini yet for Audio streaming. I wish they enabled this feature. This monitor and HomePods for audio would‚Äôve summed up a quality entertainment.What's Meh? üòº1. Tizen/Samsung App Store is still evolving and you won't find a lot of Indian OTT/News apps in there yet. But all the major ones mentioned above are already available.2. Bixby Voice assistant is still mediocre.3. Not for ardent gamers. Screen refresh rate tanks at 60Hz.4. No Ethernet port making it entirely relying on Wifi. So unless you‚Äôve a strong Wifi, you can‚Äôt leverage the Tv features much.5. Wireless screen mirroring has a lag and that‚Äôs understandable.  However the wireless mirroring supports only the screen refresh rate of 30 Hz against the capable 60 Hz. As well the screen resolution is supported only at 720P / 1080P against the 4K."
5,"A perfect baby of 2 parents - a TV and a Monitor.Screen Quality - 10/10 (Best)Brigthness - 9/10Audio - 10/10 (Best)Connectivity - 1000/10Comes with an HDMI cable.This is the perfect monitor for entertainment and work.Value for money!Edit : M7 is better than M5 because 1080p on a 32 inch of M5 is pushing it too far.I would recommend to go for 27 inch M5 or the 32 inch M7, not the 32 inch M5!"
5,"Like-A dream tv cum monitor for all the workaholicsBigger screen, better view quality and easy installationDislike-Android instead of the Tizen software could have been betterNothing else on the dislikes part"
1,Received a defective pcs and now the offer is gone. Just one thing to Samsung they should really look on the stocks before launching the product. I have been waiting for it and in 30 days only couple of time I could find the product in stock.
5,"For Unboxing video, you can find it on my YouTube channel named - ""Thrifty Backpacker""What's in the box? üéÅ1. 32"" VGA Monitor & a stand with required screws.2. Power Adapter with Power Plug3. HDMI - HDMI Cable4. Remote with batteries5. User ManualBelow are Pros and Cons based on one month use:Pros:- Works pretty smooth with wonderful response time.- Performed tests mirroring iPhone 11 as well as used Airplay2 to project Phone videos, which worked pretty well. Video quality was good with no visible lag.- Majority of the OTT apps available and worked well.- Multiple control options available:1. Remote2. Using SmartThings app on Smartphones3. Using keyboard or mouse (Support of this is limited to certain applications)- Was able to connect to the Display wirelessly from PC with a minimal lag. Max frequency supported for wireless projection is 30Hz.- Even though the panel is VGA and not IPS, I found no significant difference between its viewing angle as well as picture quality.- Seamless transition if the input source is changed. Furthermore, If a Bluetooth paired device is turned on, you would get a prompt on the screen and its immediately connected once you acknowledge on-screen.- 6 batteries were included for remote, mouse and keyboard.- Efficiently able to access the web pages using the free Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.- Very strong stand.- Borderless Display with very thin Bezel.Cons:- USB type C to type C cable is not included for fast charging as well as for video transmission.- Was not able to use Mouse while accessing majority of features.- Display is not very bright when too many lights around are turned on.- Very limited applications available in app store compared to Android OS. To watch MX player, had to mirror laptop screen.- The Power Plug is 3 pin Power plug or M plug, similar to that of AC or Refrigerator Plug. You would need a plug converter for standard 3 pin Electric sockets."
5,"Pros:Display of SamsungTV with app, happy with tizen as it supports all streaming appsSamsung Dex: with supporting phone can use all appsFree keyboard and mice2 Hdmi ports, see to switch between laptop and desktopCons:Audio is okay for casual use...use external speakers or soundboard"
5,"- Excellent Monitor - Monitor Bhi TV Bhi- Surprisingly it has Airplay too on top other Apps, however those are limited in numbers. - Would be great, if Samsung allow us to add more Apps"
5,"There was a very thin line between smart tv and desktop monitors, and Samsung has bridged the gap with this affordable monitor. The 4K one (M7) is worth it if you have the budget, otherwise M5 is a value for money deal.Those who want a TV only, should not buy this though. 32"" is proper size for monitor, TVs nowadays looks better in 43+. There are many good display 43""+ 4K TV available in similar range. This stuff is primarily for regular computer monitor, with an additional benefit of a TV with remote. Its a pure joy watching ott content on your monitor with remote without the need to turn on your laptop. Picture quality is not that great, but good enough for computer monitor and your daily work. It has inbuilt speakers as well. Someone at Samsung really thought well about customers while designing this. Kudos to them.Hope Samsung will keep the price same as introductory price. That really makes it a value for money device. A higher price would confuse user between this and other TV models at this range.BTW, keyboard offer was great. Thanks Amazon. Thats not needed at all to interact with the monitor though, unless you use the inbuilt ms office 365, assuming most people will use it as a monitor for laptop/pc primarily."
5,"It is a big screen, even 27 inch it is big, I use it for office work and 2 documents can be opened side by side. Enjoy netflix in the evenings... sound from the monitor is also clear and loud... will need to increase volume to enjoy better... it is expensive by the benefits are also more... just one thing I got a 15 amp plug with the unit, and had to get an extension box for the same as my wall 15amp is far from where I want to place this..."
3,The monitor is great with decent sound. Only complaint that I have till now is that I can't see the device on MacBook Pro's Airplay/ Screen Mirroring.
5,"Excellent display quality, ease of assembling, great looks, competetive pricing, loaded features. Other than refresh rate I think nothing to complain."
5,"It's great experience to do all at one place at one smart monitor,  to watch TV shows, movies and news when you want to relax after office work."
4,Must buy if you love to learn new technology
5,Super
3,"There is two problem with these series of Monitor.1. If you connect it with Laptop and wireless mouse keyboard/mouse with monitor then you can not control Laptop from keyboard/mouse. For given office 365 access, you need to connect keyboard to Monitor.2. Your TV/Setup box remote can also access these monitors so if someone will increase volume of TV then monitor volume will also increase simultaneously and same with power-off/on.Pros:*Office 365, Remote desktop (you can connect any office desktop), speaker, HDMI PortsCons:*if you think that that it is completely replacement of TV then might be you are wrong. In this budget you can get very good 4K TV or monitor.*Most of features useless. Like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon you can also access from your laptop.  Most of monitor(with speaker) can act as TV with HDMI connection with setup box.* Some of smart features are missing like webcam, Ethernet port, audio port. You can also not control volume from remote. You have to use your mobile application for same and other features..Final verdict:It is good for professionals who is working from home. If you comparing with TV or any other monitor then it is very costly for given features."
1,"I bought through samsung store. As per promotional offer, they have give amazon prime, but, they haven't provided. Its kind of cheating the customer to sell the products. Now a days, Samsung products are no qulaity, i got two premium products as defects on arrival."
2,"A very smart product.But its a VA panel not IPS panel.IPS panel has vibrant screen very helpful for editing photos and videos because of color accuracy.For official and normal purpose,its a very good product.Samsung please include IPS panel and 4k for 27inch size."
2,So this thing costs so much and doesn't have a webcam? While being advertised as a wfh good to have?
2,"I bought M5 27' smart monitor. The endpoint of the Power cable that connects to the monitor is a bit loose.With the connector, its working fine. The sound and display are nice.I bought it with the sole purpose of using it with airplay. Too much Disapppointed."
5,Try once and get to know then tell of it has Google and other laptop features ...or otherwise it is just a tv...high in proce though
4,"Size of monitor is decent, looks big.Clarity of the picture is not so great, you can see that in the attached image.I have played a 4k YouTube video, clarity looks pretty good but it's not same with the image.Installation the monitor is pretty straightforward and easy installation.Monitor comes along with HDMI cable, power adaptor."
5,VERY Clean & Crisp Picture Quality.You can choose what picture quality you want.Totally Love it!!!‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
5,First I want to thank Amazon for delivering the product one day before the alloted time.Packaging of the product was very niceScreen was much bigger than I expectedPerformance wise I would not be able to comment untyi use to for fee more days.
4,The power cable received with the monitor is larger in size and doesn't fit into any household socket. I had to buy a new one.Otherwise monitor is awesome.
5,"As expected.... Brand is always a brand.. Dell is goodScreen clarity is goodWide viewing angelAnti glare is okGaming.. Am not gamer, but I play very less graphic games, it's work well in itOverall worth buying"
5,They have mentioned ---Hardware Interface USB Type CBut there's nothing as TYPE CLED is good no doubt
2,If you are selling product in india then make sure you provide commonly used power cable size .....Power cord is not compatible with home sockets ...if so many negative review about power cord then why don't provide appropriate cable
5,"Very nice monitor, worth the buy. This review is being written on the second day after buying. Shall update if things change over a period of time.Delivery and packaging was neat. Assembling the stand is pretty straight forward and easy.Only problem is that the plug is bigger for a normal household plug point. Had to buy a converter pin."
5,"Bought it for WFH, I use as a 2nd bigger screen to project content from my work Laptop and it servers the purpose very well. Will recommend the product."
4,It has good clearity and good colour production but keep in mind it has big plug of 16 ampere so you have to prepare for it
4,Awesome
5,One of the best products bought from Amazon. Gives Tv like feeling.. No complaints till now.
5,Delivery was before time and the product came well packed. I purchased it for my home office and its serving the purpose well.
1,"I am not able to connect this monitor to my desktop but when I connected other monitor its connected, request you to please exchange the monitor or take the monitor return."
4,Good monitor... But didn't understand why the 15amp power cord.
5,Product is good but the seller isn't good as I got invoice with different serial number which is not good.
2,White seems to be yellow. Not good screen. Dell should work on quality or should scrap this product.
5,Good Monitor
3,Picture quality is not that good.
5,Eyes don't get tired even after full day use!! Awesome product of Dell
5,As advertised
1,Accessories like power cord is not working and not mentioned in product details
1,The plug is not compatible with my indian plugs
3,Few resize options. Suitable for gaming.
1,Power cable comes with 16A
5,Good Product and timely delivery!
5,Good
5,All are OK
5,good
4,"Major issues: (1) like other recent reviewer mentions, a wrong oversized pin is attached to the monitor power cord - the one generally used with washing machines for a 15A power source. What is needed is a smaller, 5A pin. (2) the monitor does not have audio speakers. Still, when iPad is connected over HDMI, its audio along with video is sent to the monitor for playback. This mutes audio on the device and since the monitor has no speaker, essentially the audio is lost. This is bad on part of Dell to incorrectly configure the monitor's EDID to tell the connecting device that it is capable of playing audio as well. This issue is not experienced on Windows. If you want to avoid this hassle, go for a monitor that comes with speakers built-in. While buying I knew this specific monitor doesn't have speakers, but had read on some technical forums that if the monitor has correctly configured EDID, this issue shouldn't be faced.A minor issue: when a faster response time (5ms) is selected from the display's own on-screen menu, the text in a document shows trailing ghost images when scrolled. The ghost effect reduces when a slower response time (8ms) is selected. The monitor has only two response time options. I don't know how other monitors handle this.Other than these issues, the monitor is value for money. Pleasing still picture and video, both."
4,I bought this monitor from other source . This monitor gives me more of eye strain than normal which I use in office
2,"Most the specifications mentioned in the description are twisted and false. However, the monitor work fine but may not be suitable for professional use where color reproduction & gamut range is important."
4,It‚Äôs LCD NOT LED. Don‚Äôt confuse with the product description.
4,"Bought for daily use like multimedia, docs editing and light gaming.At this price point don't expect mind blowing display on this monitor.Pros- Easy and clean setup.- Good Picture Quality. Blacks are especially good. ( Need to set that via OSD settings)- Curved Display for a monitor in this size and price range.- Anti Glare matte black screen.- Very Thin Bezels on three sides. Bottom is also fairly thin and very minimalist looking.Cons- Perhaps the biggest con I felt was that it didn't come with an included manual. Had a really bad time, spending almost half a day to adjust its OSD settings as it has only 1 power button for everything. After a while I figured out the power button alone controls all the OSD settings. Even in its online manual this is not mentioned and I found it in another related model's manual.- Only HDMI and DVI port. ( But what do you expect at this price range anyway ?)- The back cover feels a bit cheap sometimes and its not so easy to take off and on all the time. ( Wont be a problem if you close and just use the monitor.)-Missing height adjustment option. Need to keep some material below to raise it up.Overall is a good priced curved Monitor if you are a light pc user looking for curved display at this price and size. 4/5.Edit: Also its LCD not LED."
4,"Great monitors, nice curve and using them both at the same time is a great experience. Quality is good and everything is working fine. I am not a gamer, so using them for office and home purposes.ProsCurved, almost bezel less, good qualityCons,1. No vesa mount which is fine at this cost2. Very slight - Pixels can be seen and not as crisp as other monitors again which is fine putting the cost in mindI loved it and using then everyday without any issues so far. Will post a long term review after a month"
2,"The pixel density matters. More than 22"" monitor always needs higher resolution. This monitor will give you maximum of 1080P resolution. That is why you will not be able to read texts. All are blurry. Go for a QHD monitor for above 22"" or 4K if your pocket permits."
5,"Firstly, Its a LCD VA Panel with a LED backlightPros:Good Contrast Ratio,Deep blacks,75hz refresh rate,Build quality is good,No backlight bleeding what so ever in my unit,Felt very smooth while playing Cs Go and Valorant with 4ms response timeCons:Colours are not very punchy out fo the box specially in videos . (Need to change the settings for that)The brighteness at the lowest is a bit highOverall the panel itslef is good considering its a VA Panel  with deep blacks and you can change the settings for a more punchy look but not for content creators"
5,"Awesome picture quality, excellent contrast, Curvature looks nice,especially deep blacks look like OLED!Previously, i owned IPS monitor, but after seeing this, i fall in love with this monitor ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èI think this VA monitor is far better than any IPS Monitor in this price range."
5,Good picture quality. Tried some videos in Amazon prime and it was good.
5,really nice display I got it for 9000 and I am happy with it so far.colours are excellentgood blacksit has some very little manufacturing defects but what do you expect from a cheap curved monitorrefresh rate is 75hzI find it too bright at the lowest brightness too so that's the only complaintoverall I am happy with the purchase.
4,"The button to control the settings is actually a joystick under the belly of the display right below the logo of AOC. It's very fragile. Quality could have been improved, but for this price it's a decent product."
4,Surely looks more expensive than the price. Feels somewhat washed out even with the adjustments
4,cd was broken in thw box. and tha panel of LCD was not pasted accordingly. strap is coming out from the main body
1,"I ordered the product on 16th March, 2020 and I found a dot in my screen. On raising a service request at AOC on 19th March, they said after lockdown they will attend. Today I called the customer care and found the request was closed on 5th Aug without even telling me.Even the screen has different brightness levelThe issue is in panel. Brand new Monitor had panel issues.Also on talking to customer care, they informed installation should have happened for the same. But nothing was provided for meI wonder how Amazon is authorizing such sales of the defective monitor"
1,Had oder this aoc monitor ... And it got cracked from inside  within 14days. Its 100% faulty product by amzon india.  product has 3 years of warranty but aoc india is refusing to warranty they doesnt have good customer services .and thier email system is bot replying.. Customer calling service is very very bad they are very confusing ... They only tell to mail which is bot actuallly which is telling us to pay n repair then why 3 years warranty . This monitor is very cheap parts from inside very very cheap.. Had lost now 10600rs now be carefull guys before buying ... I am in big losss now its just 14 days only 14 days and amzon cant even replace it .. Guys its just 14 days ...
5,"I have been using this monitor for more than 2months and the display quality is really good.....best for programming ,gaming as well for watching full HD videos......no regrets.....you can buy it without thinking....really awesome product"
5,Nice look and good picture quality. Worth for the price offered for this product. Every AOC monitor comes with 3 years of warranty and peace of mind. My previous AOC monitor git replaced under warranty after 2 years.
5,Superb product realistic view ..I am very much happy with this product.
1,ok monitor looks great it is made of plastic but looks quite premium because of its build quality and white colour. picture quality is also good brightness level is high enough. display doesnt reflect lot of lights either. only reason why i gave one star is because it is defective one it turn on and off itself making a weird electric current sound from the back wire. i have ordered replacement i hope i dont get defective one again
5,Don't go for Samsung 24 inch curved monitor which costs same as this but has thick bezels and back light bleeding issue.
1,"Not led display, this is old led display, don't buy this."
5,I purchased this curved monitor on 30\09\2020 i have say that i am not gone on reviews i picked up this monitor becoz its style and uniqueness is very much i like before Samsung Curve monitor working fine and very well. I recomment everybody go for it and last but not the least special thanks to seller and amazon
4,"It's a great product. total worth for the money spent. one problem is that, if you are watching it in dark, or with dim lights on, then it's kinda too bright for the eye, I completely reduced all of the brightness. I still find it too bright."
5,Worth spending money
4,Picture quality is good. And it even has speakers which are too low but good..as there is no mention of speaker I thought I got the wrong one but it's the same one.build quality is average but for this price it's good.
2,Noticeable Manufacturing defects... Which you don't expect from such an old Brand like AOC
2,Overall this product looks good but expensive for a LCD montior. Also wrong product description here
1,This product is not LED it's LCD. Inbuilt speakers not working
5,nyc product and also value for money . but no user guide in the box. after all good product thnk u amazon
5,I am happy this monitor is so good and super picture quality. Thank you
5,One of a best monitor in market ... without hesitating just go for it...
4,"All good, but one tiny led is not working, staying pink all the timeü§ï"
5,Very nice monitor...Looking awesome üòâ....Nice Picture Quality...
5,Nice picture quality
4,This is the 1st product I am using from AOC.. fulfill the requirements for this cost..

2,"The M5 32"" (‚Çπ 25000) appears to be a bang for the buck over the M7 32"" variant(‚Çπ 37000).The only two differences being -1. Screen resolution - 1080P (M5) vs 4K (M7)2. USB C to C option for 65W charging & connectivity is present in M7 & not in M5.  However the USB C to C cable is not included in the M7 OOTB package for which you will need to shed out another 1000 odd bucks to get the compatible cable and make use of the connectivity option. Huge disappointment on that front.M5 32"" is still a desirable monitor cum Tv @ ‚Çπ 25000 given the value proposition it offers while M7 falls flat, charging a bomb.For 37000, you can get a massive 4K HD LED IPS Redmi TV at 55"" against the minuscule 32"" inch 4K HD LED VGA Samsung M7 smart monitor, if you desire for a good TV. If you are just after the monitor & not the TV, 25K M5 variant would suffice more than needed.-------Detailed Review :What's in the box? üéÅ1. 32"" VGA Monitor & a stand with required screws. (Yeah you've seen it right, it's VGA and not IPS)2. Power Adapter3. HDMI - HDMI Cable4. Remote with batteriesWhat's not? üö´USB type C-C cable for 65W charging is NOT included as part of the M7 package and the feature in itself is not available in the M5 32""/27"".What's great? üòª1. TV + Monitor all in one interface, pre loaded with the YouTube/Prime/Netflix/Hotstar/Zee5/Apple TV+ apps.2. Display & visual calibration - Despite being a VGA panel, I've zero complaints on the display quality and the available calibration options. I haven't witnessed any ghosting/black bleeding regardless of the surrounding brightness. Eye Care & Adaptive Display calibration are good & I'm sure with the subsequent software updates, display options and calibrations will only grow from strength to strength.3. Seamless transition from Tv to Work & back : Thanks to the Tizen OS. All it takes is just a remote click and I'm already loving to swap between the TV & the Work Monitor without much ado or efforts.4. Remote - The best part of it all. Minimalistic yet effective. This makes the experience so rewarding. Offers the comfort from wherever you are.5. Audio quality - Oh boy, this blew me off! Nobody would've expected a monitor to perform so well in this area. The Amplification option is ""real loud"" and trust me you won't need to tune beyond 25 so not to invite the fury of your neighbours. Audio quality is exceptionally good given its price range. Hey but, don't expect the Atmos / Bass effect. It does it's job over and above. DOT. It even allows you to pair a bluetooth headset/speaker if in case you need. The BT headphone option for sure helps those late night binge watchers with parents/kids next room.6. AirPlay support - Perhaps the only non mac monitor to come up with an inbuilt AirPlay support. You can mirror your iOS / MacOs / iPadOs devices with an one time pairing. Works reasonably good although the efficacy lies in the strength of your Wifi.But make no mistake, the monitor doesn‚Äôt support HomePods / HomePods Mini yet for Audio streaming. I wish they enabled this feature. This monitor and HomePods for audio would‚Äôve summed up a quality entertainment.What's Meh? üòº1. Tizen/Samsung App Store is still evolving and you won't find a lot of Indian OTT/News apps in there yet. But all the major ones mentioned above are already available.2. Bixby Voice assistant is still mediocre.3. Not for ardent gamers. Screen refresh rate tanks at 60Hz.4. No Ethernet port making it entirely relying on Wifi. So unless you‚Äôve a strong Wifi, you can‚Äôt leverage the Tv features much.5. Wireless screen mirroring has a lag and that‚Äôs understandable.  However the wireless mirroring supports only the screen refresh rate of 30 Hz against the capable 60 Hz. As well the screen resolution is supported only at 720P / 1080P against the 4K."
5,"A perfect baby of 2 parents - a TV and a Monitor.Screen Quality - 10/10 (Best)Brigthness - 9/10Audio - 10/10 (Best)Connectivity - 1000/10Comes with an HDMI cable.This is the perfect monitor for entertainment and work.Value for money!Edit : M7 is better than M5 because 1080p on a 32 inch of M5 is pushing it too far.I would recommend to go for 27 inch M5 or the 32 inch M7, not the 32 inch M5!"
5,"Like-A dream tv cum monitor for all the workaholicsBigger screen, better view quality and easy installationDislike-Android instead of the Tizen software could have been betterNothing else on the dislikes part"
1,Received a defective pcs and now the offer is gone. Just one thing to Samsung they should really look on the stocks before launching the product. I have been waiting for it and in 30 days only couple of time I could find the product in stock.
5,"For Unboxing video, you can find it on my YouTube channel named - ""Thrifty Backpacker""What's in the box? üéÅ1. 32"" VGA Monitor & a stand with required screws.2. Power Adapter with Power Plug3. HDMI - HDMI Cable4. Remote with batteries5. User ManualBelow are Pros and Cons based on one month use:Pros:- Works pretty smooth with wonderful response time.- Performed tests mirroring iPhone 11 as well as used Airplay2 to project Phone videos, which worked pretty well. Video quality was good with no visible lag.- Majority of the OTT apps available and worked well.- Multiple control options available:1. Remote2. Using SmartThings app on Smartphones3. Using keyboard or mouse (Support of this is limited to certain applications)- Was able to connect to the Display wirelessly from PC with a minimal lag. Max frequency supported for wireless projection is 30Hz.- Even though the panel is VGA and not IPS, I found no significant difference between its viewing angle as well as picture quality.- Seamless transition if the input source is changed. Furthermore, If a Bluetooth paired device is turned on, you would get a prompt on the screen and its immediately connected once you acknowledge on-screen.- 6 batteries were included for remote, mouse and keyboard.- Efficiently able to access the web pages using the free Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.- Very strong stand.- Borderless Display with very thin Bezel.Cons:- USB type C to type C cable is not included for fast charging as well as for video transmission.- Was not able to use Mouse while accessing majority of features.- Display is not very bright when too many lights around are turned on.- Very limited applications available in app store compared to Android OS. To watch MX player, had to mirror laptop screen.- The Power Plug is 3 pin Power plug or M plug, similar to that of AC or Refrigerator Plug. You would need a plug converter for standard 3 pin Electric sockets."
5,"Pros:Display of SamsungTV with app, happy with tizen as it supports all streaming appsSamsung Dex: with supporting phone can use all appsFree keyboard and mice2 Hdmi ports, see to switch between laptop and desktopCons:Audio is okay for casual use...use external speakers or soundboard"
5,"- Excellent Monitor - Monitor Bhi TV Bhi- Surprisingly it has Airplay too on top other Apps, however those are limited in numbers. - Would be great, if Samsung allow us to add more Apps"
5,"There was a very thin line between smart tv and desktop monitors, and Samsung has bridged the gap with this affordable monitor. The 4K one (M7) is worth it if you have the budget, otherwise M5 is a value for money deal.Those who want a TV only, should not buy this though. 32"" is proper size for monitor, TVs nowadays looks better in 43+. There are many good display 43""+ 4K TV available in similar range. This stuff is primarily for regular computer monitor, with an additional benefit of a TV with remote. Its a pure joy watching ott content on your monitor with remote without the need to turn on your laptop. Picture quality is not that great, but good enough for computer monitor and your daily work. It has inbuilt speakers as well. Someone at Samsung really thought well about customers while designing this. Kudos to them.Hope Samsung will keep the price same as introductory price. That really makes it a value for money device. A higher price would confuse user between this and other TV models at this range.BTW, keyboard offer was great. Thanks Amazon. Thats not needed at all to interact with the monitor though, unless you use the inbuilt ms office 365, assuming most people will use it as a monitor for laptop/pc primarily."
5,"It is a big screen, even 27 inch it is big, I use it for office work and 2 documents can be opened side by side. Enjoy netflix in the evenings... sound from the monitor is also clear and loud... will need to increase volume to enjoy better... it is expensive by the benefits are also more... just one thing I got a 15 amp plug with the unit, and had to get an extension box for the same as my wall 15amp is far from where I want to place this..."
3,The monitor is great with decent sound. Only complaint that I have till now is that I can't see the device on MacBook Pro's Airplay/ Screen Mirroring.
5,"Excellent display quality, ease of assembling, great looks, competetive pricing, loaded features. Other than refresh rate I think nothing to complain."
5,"It's great experience to do all at one place at one smart monitor,  to watch TV shows, movies and news when you want to relax after office work."
4,Must buy if you love to learn new technology
5,Super
3,"There is two problem with these series of Monitor.1. If you connect it with Laptop and wireless mouse keyboard/mouse with monitor then you can not control Laptop from keyboard/mouse. For given office 365 access, you need to connect keyboard to Monitor.2. Your TV/Setup box remote can also access these monitors so if someone will increase volume of TV then monitor volume will also increase simultaneously and same with power-off/on.Pros:*Office 365, Remote desktop (you can connect any office desktop), speaker, HDMI PortsCons:*if you think that that it is completely replacement of TV then might be you are wrong. In this budget you can get very good 4K TV or monitor.*Most of features useless. Like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon you can also access from your laptop.  Most of monitor(with speaker) can act as TV with HDMI connection with setup box.* Some of smart features are missing like webcam, Ethernet port, audio port. You can also not control volume from remote. You have to use your mobile application for same and other features..Final verdict:It is good for professionals who is working from home. If you comparing with TV or any other monitor then it is very costly for given features."
1,"I bought through samsung store. As per promotional offer, they have give amazon prime, but, they haven't provided. Its kind of cheating the customer to sell the products. Now a days, Samsung products are no qulaity, i got two premium products as defects on arrival."
2,"A very smart product.But its a VA panel not IPS panel.IPS panel has vibrant screen very helpful for editing photos and videos because of color accuracy.For official and normal purpose,its a very good product.Samsung please include IPS panel and 4k for 27inch size."
2,So this thing costs so much and doesn't have a webcam? While being advertised as a wfh good to have?
2,"I bought M5 27' smart monitor. The endpoint of the Power cable that connects to the monitor is a bit loose.With the connector, its working fine. The sound and display are nice.I bought it with the sole purpose of using it with airplay. Too much Disapppointed."
5,Try once and get to know then tell of it has Google and other laptop features ...or otherwise it is just a tv...high in proce though
5,"First of all It‚Äôs the best 1080P 22‚Äù 75Hz in it‚Äôs price(7500) and I‚Äôm saying it after my research based purchase and after purchase experience.Contents:- came with Monitor!, 2 piece modular stand, VGA cable, HDMI cable thankfully!, AUX cable nice!, power cord and power brick, some paperwork*************************Ports:- HDMI, VGA, AUX input(can‚Äôt be used as output when sound is coming from HDMI), power input*************************Looks and feel:-It‚Äôs so different and better looking than those full black monitor and on the inside it‚Äôs 75Hz display so it‚Äôs a totally different experience inside and out with this monitor, the white portion of this monitor stands out beautifully, the main display is half as thick as a usb plug display is matt finish so it doesn't matter if there‚Äôs light source in front of it*************************Display:-Vibrant output, Beautiful color production, No dead pixels and no color bleedingSome people had issue with color bleeding but not me, supports freesync and capable of 75 FPS output, I haven‚Äôt noticed any stain on eyes 10+ continuous hours and I‚Äôm a guy with glasses.It‚Äôs a  75 hz display, i‚Äôve used 60Hz display for 11 years and it makes a difference it‚Äôs only display in this price range with this feature and sealed the deal for me.You can game on it no problems just know that this monitor doesn't sell as gaming monitor  and gsync and display overclocking support is not available, it has 4 MS response time and is better at gaming than other similar monitors and some expensive monitors too**********************Speaker and sound:-it has 2, 2 watt speakers in the bottom which is not loud at all and lacks basic bass I'm not asking for much just enough, for reference my poco F1 has loud and clear speaker than this dual speaker monitor it‚Äôs just there and you shouldn't rely on it but is a nice addition, something is better than nothingFor speaker to work you can give input by HDMI cable and if you are using VGA there‚Äôs aux input too***************************Manual setting suggestion:-This is a 75 Hz display so first of all check that your graphics unit has enabled 75Hz from normally 60Hz refresh rate to enjoy it‚Äôs full capabilityFactory display setting of this monitor was with a warm color to give feelings of blue light protection which was not looking normal so you may have to tweak the settings to fit your needs***************************One thing to keep in mind that it‚Äôs a 21.5 inch 1080P monitor which has a 102.46 per inch that means if you use it in its native resolution text might be smaller for you, text is totally readable and clear but small so I have custom scaled this monitor to 109% now everything is fine for the monitor but windows OS is bad at scaling some text are blurry like chrome suggestion which is totally not a big deal but something to keep in mind and if you buy 24 inch monitor the price of that is just shy of double the price of this monitor.*****If we are talking about eye care than this monitor doesn‚Äôt put strain on eyes just set it to comfortable brightness and use a blue light filter like flu.x or use windows 10‚Äôs night light feature"
5,Best budget monitor in this price
4,It's a good gaming monitor with 4ms response time and 75hz refresh rate. And the screen is amazing. The only issue is backlight bleeding along the edges which noticeable when the screen display dark colors. Doesn't get distracting tho.
5,"So, here it is guys‚ô•Ô∏èGot it for ‚Çπ8999 on amazon saleI posted about this on Facebook earlier after ordering from Amazon that if is it okay and everyone like ""Hell No"" go for LG or this is not a good monitor.I just bought it at my own risk as it don't have much reviews on Youtube nither on Amazon (Only 45 reviews)Whatever,I just wanna say this is a underrated White beast/beauty.4ms 75hz out of the box, Ultra Thin.Most Loved AMD Free-sync.No major backlight bleeding issue like LG and Samsung have.(I attached a photo of dark scene to detect any bleeding)And the colour reproduction quality is just insane üî•Also comes with 2 piece of 2w speaker though it's not loud but it's better to have those.The white colour is just giving it a look of extraordinary.It don't comes with a DP port so the HDMI port is 2.0 unlike 1.4 on other monitors (Free-sync supports only via HDMI 2.0)At last , I just want that youtubers should review this underrated monitor."
2,I like packaging! And no damage as i expected!About led Its work amazing but back light bleeding...Its start flicking so i try to return 2 time.i recognized it was a problem with windows 10 auto color picking..Thumbs Up for great product ....Its worth for money 14K but i think its comes to 12K for good
1,"Its nice, 75hz refresh rate, good colors, average contrast , BUT it has some backlight bleed, check carefully, buyers.Edit : replacement is even worse, it has backlight bleed at different places, and color banding too, banding is worse than the tn panel of my laptop."
5,"As the WFH became the new normal, I wanted an additional monitor to be added to my laptop. I was expecting a HD monitor with an HDMI extension as my laptop didnt have a VGA port. After a bit of research, narrowed down on this monitor after seeing the reviews - definitely not disappointed. I have been using this for over a month now. I can say that I am very much satisfied - have to wait for few more months to see its actual performace.Pros:1. Really thin panel2. Provide HDMI & VGA connectivity for older PCs as well.3. Package has all the extension cords (HDMI, VGA, AUX, etc)4. Has 2w in-built speaker - not so great but can be useful sometimes. You can use the AUX extension to draw the audio out from monitor to any external speakers.5. Stand is easy to fix and holds the monitor perfectlyCons:1. Again very thin panel, looks delicate while handling - too risky if you keep moving your montior2. I see a blue light leak on top the screen - you will notice when you see that from top of the monitor (see image)3. No wall mounting option - so those who work with multiple monitors can't put them in the strut bracket.4. Locating the menu buttons is too hard at times, there is no written description on the bottom panel rather acer has given on screen navigation. I always use the blue power light to locate the power button and from there."
2,not happy with color quality
3,"The product is Great,,Irrespective of What everyone is saying about backlight bleeding or Contrast etc,, picture quality is Really great.IPS panel seems flawless, Contrast nd brightness are also great.75Hz with Amd freesync, FHD 1080p, With speakers, HDMI cable included, it really feels smooth.The only problem I had is this That There is a pink patch or say dead pixels in middle of the screen which only appears when screen is fully black,, still very annoying.Hoping for a Replacement.Seller:- Appario"
4,"This is my 2nd ever monitor from Acer. 1st one was Aopen which I still regret buying. The Aopen is pretty bad display. So after my 1st experience with Acer I was reluctant to go for Acer again. I had a few options in mind like Samsung LS24R350FHWXXL, Dell P2419H, Zebronics ZEB-A24FHD, AOC 24V2Q. Each one had some pros and cons. But finally I decided to go for Acer - color and thickness of the panel.received the monitor in good condition with an extra cardboard box packing on top of monitor company packing. As soon as I opened it, it just took away my mind. The white color looks awesome and the thickness of the panel is just too less for it to look the most sleek of monitors. Its bezel less and the colors are good too. Using this for a month now and all good, though initial few days it took time to adjust to the colors switching to this one form my old monitor, but now its fine.Please don't buy this for speakers as they are worst, hardly any sound from them. So speakers are just a gimmick. I hope the stand could have been a little more sturdy. Stand looks awesome in white but if that could have been a bit more solid, it would have been great.Overall, this monitor is worth a buy."
1,"Pros :>Style , ips , slim , amd free sync.Cons:>Over grains. Over sharpness. Over style. That's all . I'll recommend you not to buy by seeing it's appearance. Fonts aren't smooth , e.g bitmap font quality.And there is no quality driver in official acer website .How to fix fuzzyness :>By explaining yourself that you have bought a good monitor.> By sitting at distance so that your sight wont encounter that sharp fuzzy pixelated quality.> By rate it 1 in Amazon and flipkart .Thanks for reading"
5,"I have purchased this product at ‚Çπ13300. Its been one month. This is great product in this price range.The best feature of this monitor is it is very slim, I mean it is ultra slim. The picture quality is very good.The white color of this monitor is very beautiful.I purchased it for work purpose. Some time I watch movies on it. 75hz refresh rate good for gaming. I played GTA 4 on it. The was running very smoothly on this monitor.I have got some cables like HDMI, VGA, Audio and power cable. The quality of cables is awesome.Thanks"
4,Guys This is Akshay Gireesh from Dezire 2 Tech YouTube channel I have recently purchased this monitor for my new Gaming Streaming and editing Pc build because i am building my pc with an AMD graphics card I needed a budget freesync monitor and really talking about this monitor the first thing which attracted me is its ultra slim lookThis is an exellent product the first delivery of my product wast that good as it was having an unnoticeable small white spot so i returned the product and I got a replacement within two days really Amazon's service is great .This time the product was without any single issue and working amazingly If u are on a budget then i will strongly recommend you this full HD IPS monitor for gaming and editing.Guys full review of this monitor will be uploaded whithin a week on my channel Dezire 2 Tech do check out and from there u can decide whether to place the order or not Thankyou
5,"The monitor is very good. It's very thin and looks very elegant. The picture quality is also excellent. Assembly was simple enough.Overall, for the price, this is a steal. The pros far outweigh the cons.Cons :Height is not adjustable.Has only audio input, but no audio out!The quality of inbuilt speakers is not good, the max volume is too low to be useful.The monitor far exceeded my expectations."
5,Got this for office work purpose. Best monitor for both working and entertainment. Very light and thin screen and also bezel less display makes this product looks class especially white color varient. Got this for 7.9K best deal. Though it has inbuilt speaker output is not that loud but never mind you get AUX cable.Confused whether this one or BenQ... It features everything which BenQ has.. but look wise Acer scores well. Finally purchased acer and it didn't disappointed me.
3,"This product is actually a Good product nice viewing angles,picture quality and all.... exempt one thing that there is screen bleeding even after replacement of the product.Product quality in slighty above average...But greatly disappointed from screen bleeding on acer..one thing only to say that this product comes manufacturer itself has screen bleeding i think....so think thrice before buying this and there is no refund tooo.."
4,"I am writing this review after using this monitor for 1 year exactly.**I am editing this review. ( first, I write 5star before few months but now I am facing some issue hence reducing stars)I don't play games so I can't say how this monitor performs in gaming.I bought this monitor for my design and editing/production purposes. and this monitor was very best for it until last week.Now it has started showing very strong ghosting effact hence now I can't look at the screen correctly.wherever the white area on screen is, it shows gosting/motion blur and it pain the eyes if look at that area.this is just staring hence I don't know if this effect will increase in future or not but will update this review according to it in future.another problem I found is 1 dead pixel at around middle top area of the screen and heavy backlight bleeding at dark-screen which really don't bother me for now compare to this ghosting effact. If this will increase then I have to buy another monitor because it is already hurting me while working.If I talking about good thing about this monitor then it has very good display and color quality and monitor has also slim and cool design."
4,"The monitor is really great for those who are working from home presently. Picture quality is crisp and more natural. Definitely helps reduce strain on eyes while working. But stereo speakers that are built in with the monitor are useless, you will be barely able to hear anything from it and also there's no audio out jack, so you might have to connect headset to the laptop for meetings and calls."
3,The color reproduction of this monitor is very good though there is too much back-light bleeding.I was about to use it for photo editing but due to backlight bleeding I was not getting accurate blacks. The volume is too low that the inbuilt speaker is only useful in mid-nights in a very silent environment. You need extra speakers.I purchased a LG after returning this. Paid 2 K more. No backlight bleeding. No need of extra speakers. High volume.
5,"I am So impressive look prity, value for money,So slim,"
1,i purchased this on the 8th march 2021 it is not coming on now - Didn't even work complete 1 month... Today is 5th April 2021. And i bought 1 more monitor of LG same time that is just working fine without any problem. ACER Monitor not recommended wasted my money.
1,"Please don't buy this. The product which was delivered to me had clouding & backlight bleeding issue. So i decided to replace it & when the replaced product arrived, it had the same exact issue. Now I'm returning this product. Very dissatisfied. Never expected this from a company like acer."
1,"Too much backlight bleeding..not happy at all with the product. I have 3 other monitors, 2 from BenQ and one from Dell and there is no backlight bleeding in them.This monitor does not meet my expectations even though it is good interms of design but backlight bleeding is not what I needed"
3,"Cons:1.) There are two many wires as it's has a separate laptop like adapter for plugin.2.) Inbuild speakers are useless, better if is not available, I mean 2 watt speaker, not sure what is the purpose.3.) There is a AUX in cable, the speaker itself is useless, what's the means of input cable, it's better to have AUX out, at least you can use external speaker to permanently fix on your table.4.) There is not a single USB port.5.) There is no adjustment of screen, not even tilted one forget up and down.6.) For my use I don't feel the adjustment is right, moreover you don't have choice to adjust.7.) There are many wires visible on table, there is no holding point in monitor.8.) Decent pricePros:1.) The white color looks awesome2.) Bazzle free design3) Superb slim4.) light weight - 2.5 KGI feel if the height/tilt adjustment and inbuild adapter is present, this would be incomparable choice"
2,"It is not a bezelless monitor. It has about a whole inch wide bezel. I have a DELL monitor from 15 years back (still working) that has almost same bezel thickness.The pictures shown here are misleading. While the bezels are thick, the actual thickness of the monitor is much narrow, as shown in pictures. Would have been better to have inch wide monitor thickness whilst the bezels be less than a centimeter thick. Do not buy if you prefer a bezel-less monitor."
4,"It's a glossy white color, doesn't look as good in personal compared to as in pictures. Has 100% sRGB and 75Hz refresh rate in 1080p resolution. I choose Acer because of negative reviews of LG service centers. So far all good with the monitor."
2,"The monitor has lot white light bleeding in the lower left and right corners which destroys the black levels .Also, the bugs in the monitor firmware do not allow you properly configure the monitor . The speaker are just for namesake or we can say just hear the pop up sounds dont expect media experience from them . Buy it only if you have some budget constraint otherwise spend 1.5k to 2k extra for samsung or LG"
5,Best budget monitor for budget gamers. I purchased this for below 6000 during republic day sale and it's worth of purchase. Best looking for any setup. That 3W speaker is lound enough in quit environment. Minimal screen bleeding on complet pitch black background but you won't face any kind of of distortion in gameplay or movie watching. The sceen is anitiglare.
4,Overall display is very good as picture quality also you want  gaming on this display pls buy.I have faced issue with display. I have received damaged products. Display is bleeding on right Side and top side but I have checked tha picture quality is very good and value of money... For gaming....
3,"It's a good product for its price. The picture quality is not bad but not that great either. The monitor stand is straight-up bad. it wobbles a lot.Cons :- Monitor wobbles a lot.- When overdrive mode is set to extreme, there is a lot of ghosting.- 75 hz is ok for normal gaming, but if you want to play competitively, I suggest you to go for 144hz- Brightness is way too high for my liking, even the lowest brightness is way too high for me.- White color looks yellowish. you'll have to calibrate it from windows options.- Speakers are really bad.Pros :- The monitor looks amazing. The white color making it look really nice.- 75hz is great for normal gaming. from 60 to 75, it's a big change.- There are all the cables in the box- really small bezels.I hope this review helps.Update :After just 20 days of use, bottom part of the screen started showing black/dark colors.Update :the black light is gone, by itself"
5,1) Display clarity is superb2) Price is affordable3) No flickering at all4) Can work for long times without any stress on eyes5) Colors are true (While playing games and watching videos)
5,"Beautifully designed and value for moneyWhite sleek looks big but very modern designFeatures are good,  different modes for gaming,  movies etc.75 hzs refresh rates possible.Overall superior quality at the price point.  Thanks to Amazon discount and speedy delivery."
3,"Happy with the monitor. Provides great value for money (‚Çπ9499. Not recommend above this price).Pros:+Slim form factor.+White color looks classy.+Easy setup.+Good color reproduction for the price.+In-built speakers.+Support for Amd free sync.+Comes with vga and hdmi cable.Cons:-Hinge design is not good. Screen wobbles very easily, even while typing.-Speakers are of no use.-Only one HDMI port."
5,"The monitor is beautiful so is the color accuracy and the screen. Loved it. No backlight bleeding although had to get a replacement once since the first delivered product had backlight bleeding, but the replacement is perfect. Buy this monitor without a doubt if you are looking for a budget 27 inch ips panel with 75hz refresh rate. Also the monitor is aesthetically beautiful and super slim."
5,"Great monitor for 13k price. Only problem is that the screen is soo big, that 1080p resolution seems low quality. If the resolution was atleast 2k for this big screen, it would be totally cool. But overall a really awesome monitor"
1,It‚Äôs 0% brightness is equal to 60% brightness on my smartphone(iPhone SE 2020). Will definitely going to hurt your eyes.
4,"It's too bright picture quality I feel settings are little complicated still I like the monitor because of looks , looks wise awesome go for it , speaker sound is too thin. More of treble"
5,Excellent piece for this price. Speaker in the monitor is lousy but that's not exactly a fault per se. You can hook an external speaker to this monitor if you search for those options inside the menu
1,"The Acer HA220Q monitor is the worst.It's just the worst ips monitor I have used in my life.The product I received was defective it had severe screen bleeding issue also the images are not sharp when compared with other IPS displays. The contrast is also not up to the mark.The product is also not exchangable when contacted the customer care.Think well before you buy it. Remember , When you see an attractive price there is something behind it.The photos are also shared with it."
1,"Writing this review after using this desktop for 3 months. So it is from long term perspective. After almost 2 month of usage this desktop , we have started seeing the lines in the desktop and need to get it replaced under warranty which the ACER team is not replying to.  Overall this is pathetic.. :(Need amazon help to get this replaced under warranty"
5,"Why 5 stars? I'm a customer who has checked all the reviews and then purchased this product. Ordered on 3rd got this delivered on 4th July 2018. I'm not a prime customer. Still 1 day FREE delivery. The monitor was in pristine condition. Received it with hdmi, vga, power supply cables and working perfectly fine. Thank you Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd. and thank you Amazon. I was worried that the product May not work etc although you've proved me incorrect. PS: I'm not working for amazon or anything. Very happy!!"
5,This product is not LED its LCD they removed the sticker from the pictures from other sites you can see ....
4,Good for daily use nd for editing nd videography
4,It‚Äôs really good and it‚Äôs ledIt has VGA and HDMI in the inputsIt has a power cable about 2 feet and a headphone jackI used it for gaming on PS4 and I‚Äôm surprised it has such gud quality in this price rangeI love it and would recommend it
5,"Well packed and protected for the transport,It is just a simple monitor, nothing fancy...- power cable ( good quality)-HDMI cable-VGA cable...It's easy to assemble and easy to use.If you're looking for a monitor (nothing special) I would recommend this."
1,Product does not match with the photographAvoid
3,"LCD, not LED. Fraudulent description.  Amazon should ban such malpractice.Giving 3 star only for selling misguided product description.If the idea is to buy lcd panel, It can be purchased. Value buying considering it's has both vga and HDMI port.Also you get HDMI , vga and Power cabel which saves you additional savings. Picture quality good considering what you pay for"
5,"Using this monitor as a TV to view ABS free dish channels. Connected STC H103 set top box through HDMI cable, audio is taken from headphone out of this monitor to F&D F-203G 2.1 channel multimedia speakers. Every thing working fine. Only problem is viewing angle is not good as it is not IPS panel."
5,Don't purchased this product because services is very unsatisfied really üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéNice üëç product and quality is superb in 5000k under and this screen 1920 x 1080 support but some blurry looking and perfect looking on 1366 x768 I checked on Intel i5 graphic and Invdia GeForce performance is good and slime monitor dellBut onc problem issues I share problem in image not perfect icons looked on display not full support regulations and negative effects right and left and up only front nice looking
4,I brought for my ofc desktopPros:1. Value for Money2. Decent Size3. Easy Installation4. HDMI & VGA cable included5. Brand6. WarrantyCons: NIL
5,"You will not regret after buying this monitor, especially when you are going to use it for your basic requirements of office or home tasks and web browsing. The wide screen is big and bright enough to get impressed! It does not have built in speakers but its equipped with a 3.5 mm jack. Comes along with both VGA and HDMI connecting cables as a standard packing list."
4,"No complaints for its price. It works as it claims, good as a monitor for CCTV or such auxiliary purposes. Not too good as a primary monitor as it's resolution may be low and depth of color is lacking for some people's requirements.Overall, it's a product worth its price and one can go for it if they're on a budget and quickly need a durable monitor."
3,product in picture and actual is different - also its not LED as mentioned but LCD monitor. Also regarding screen angle - there is downward tilt to it and cant see well from far or other sides...size wise also is more wider than shown in picture and other Dell monitors - also haven't got warranty card with product
3,Dell monitor easy to install all connection to fixed monitor is over brighting show but there in manual adjectments and auto brightness fit the screen view angels good but not up mark movie seeing screen ok gaming good and reading on monitor wider so some adjustments of page easily too read the documents over all product ok only for office/Home made for perfect there is HDMI port easy to connect laptops picture quality so nice but image seeing view over casting show not recmember to photo shop general usage is good.
4,well its the Cheapest Monitor u can buy with 3years warranty so far its been few days it works good for some little office use.....i think this can last long but not gonna say this is a 2d or 3d artist's best choice if ur aiming for that......imaa use this for buisness emails.*will Update more in later month
4,hi i am usig this from last few months. using hdmi cable which is very nice. in hdmi most of setting is auto can't customize. pic quality is good brightness and sharpness is liitle less as compare to my previous lg monitor but in that i can manually adjust it as par my choice so can't complaint overall good monitor for home uses.
4,"It's a full HD 60hertz ""LCD"" monitor that i found very useful as a secondary screen. Using this as  a primary screen is difficult because it's not an IPS led panel. Hence the viewing angles don't exactly work. As of a week it's working well. The only problem is the 16amps plug you get with it. A 6amp to 16amp converter or a 5amp monitor wire may be additionally required."
5,Best monitor for budget I am doing programming on it and it is working great. I never play any game on it so i will not going to anything But for other thing its picture quality is great you need to set the monitor to 1080 px in display resolution. I point this out because when i tried to watch 1080px Video on But it shows nothing after doing the setting it working properly.
3,"The monitor has zero adjustments (not vertical and not horizontal either). Its kind of slanted towards the front as in from the side its probably 85 degrees. At first I thought the stand was setup incorrectly, but the stand was correct. Maybe I received a defective stand. But if you get it too, then probably its a ‚Äúfeature‚Äù."
4,There are 2 ports to make this display work and both work but here is the catch..When I connect my display and Cpu with my VGA cable then it works extremely finebut when I connect with my Hdmi cable then the colours displayed are very bad extremely bad ...now i am going to contact the customer care of lenovo for thisRest about the display is that the blacks are extreme black which makes this display beautiful and punchy to look at
4,"Bought this monitor after reading all the reviews and comparing it with other monitors.  Received product well packed and no issues with the product.  Only issue was that there was no warranty card and no CD/drivers with the product.  When I called up Amazon, the specialist mentioned that the invoice would serve as a warranty card.  Also they do not provide the CD for any installation/update.  She prompted me to visit and website and download any update.A good monitor, but just expected the product to include the warranty card and the CD drivers."
4,Good Monitor VGA with HDMI Port. No warranty card & Driver CD not Provid. Only Fix stand. No adjustable stand. Overall it's a good PC monitor low budget with 3 yr warranty period.
4,My purpose for buying this screen was to serve a display for my home server and connecting RaspberryPi's so I'd say this gets the job done. But If I had a chance I would have bought a bigger screen than this with less bezel.Must say this is a good buy than other similar screens at the price point.
1,It looks very dull. All the colors are desaturated. feels like its 50% black and white. The black values are very pathetically grey.
1,"Pls don't buy this product, waste of money. Pathetic customer support. I have called the customer support more than 10 times but they didn't respond properly instead they are forwarding to multiple customer care executives and I fed up informing the same issue again again. And the person who was claiming technical executive he who doesn't know anything with the computer. These people are ruining goodwill of Dell company."
4,got the screen intact with wonderful packing. Included HDMI and VGA cable.All okay and good. Only thing is that viewing from different angles is ugly. you will need to sit in a proper particular position to view the colors correctly. rest all is good and works fine.
5,"A great value for money. The viewing angles are good but the only thing I don't like is the fact is monitor cannot tilt. You can't adjust it. Other than that it's a great buy. It came with hdmi vga, power cable and the packaging was good and easy to install. At this price range is a good buy. If you're looking for a gaming PC I'd say invest a couple bucks more and buy a 144hz display as this is only 60fps"
4,Decent product in the price range. Good build quality. Picture quality is also upto mark. Only concerned with the adjustment button. They are on bottm corner and are very had to press. One habe to hold yhe screen and press them.Overall. Worth to buy. Reviewed after 1 month of constant use.
3,"Colors look dull. Had to reduce brightness and increase contrast a lot to see better. It is not returnable only replaceable, otherwise would have returned it. Not happy with finish and quality."
5,"Display is good, just that it's little too bright. You get an audio out to connect external speakers from the monitor which is not mentioned in the description."
1,Bad product. When it starts then many shaky lines appears on the screen for 10 to 15 minutes. Then the actual clean screen come. Loss of money. I don't know how long it will lasts?
4,"This monitor does the job well, display is fine for working (not sure about gaming) and the purchase is worth the money. My only issue was that it came with a 16A plug (not sure why that‚Äôs necessary for this size monitor), so I had to purchase a 6A cord to make it a bit more flexible/portable."
1,"I bought one about one and a half years back. It has noticeable flicker from the beginning although not so much as to cause discomfort. Revently, it has become unusable because the screen menu is popping up all the time and going away by itself. I did not expect such poor quality from Dell."
4,"I have purchased this on 20th Jan & received it on 22nd Jan means one month is over. Till date I don't feel any kind of problem, regarding display."
4,"Well packed and protected for the transport, It is just a simple monitor, along with power cable ( good quality), -HDMI cable-VGA cable. It's easy to assemble and easy to use. Every thing working fine. Only problem is viewing angle is less."
3,"Picture quality is ok. Picture is brighter & has high contrast. If we lower it then picture quality becomes darker. Only for office use, cctv camera monitor, simple home use. Not at all for gaming, watching movies, photos, editing etc. When i play full hd movie, it shows white & bright quality that is worst quality. Not recommended, still can't believe dell sell such items."
4,"Good For Normal Daily Use,Not Recommend Photo Editing,This Monitor,Viewing Angle Not Good...Brightness Very High,"
5,Great monitor reading. Has high end hardware like HDMI and audio jack. Display is almost as same as LED Display
4,"Has both VGA and HDMI input facility, do provides added flexibility.Adequate screen resolution for normal office use but not for high quality image based needs.Wish the screen was slightly taller, feels too small"
1,"This not a LED screen. This is a LCD Screen. It is a waste of time to buy and wait for this product if you ""bought"" and LED screen. Amazon should track better this practices and ban this seller."
1,Don't buy this product of Acer. Within 2 month monitor has got 3 inches vertical black line in led. I'm keep calling Acer service they won't giving me replacement. 20 days complete after complaint got received by  Acer.  Please don't waste your money on this product. My first acer product and I'm sooo much disappointed üòû
1,"I have received the product as a replacement since the monitor I received the first time switched off after 20 mins of usage. Now the replacement I received is also defective, there is a blue line on the top left of the monitor. I think the seller TPS technologies is selling all defective product s."
2,"Good Monitor. perfect resolution for 32"" screen. Quality of picture is not that great and backlit is very strong coming from corners. Black level is just satisfactory. Although screen is good in this range, Acer's QA is not good, I had to replace the screen as there were dead pixels on screen. Replaced screen also has 1 dead pixel but its ok as I don't want to waste more time in replacement. Acer should consider QA seriously."
1,"Monitor settings menu popping on the monitor without any external input. Acer customer supports aweful (in India) and no response from them for almost 3 weeks. I suggest not to buy any Acer products, unless if you don't mind calling them regularly..."
5,"I was on the lookout for a new HD TV (1080p) 32' size for my Parents and looking at how low the price is for a 2k (1440p) display, I ended up buying Acer EB321HQU 32Inch (2560x1440), Monitor thinking ill end up return the product. But surprisingly the monitor is of a good make give perfect (2560x1440) with great darks all at 60hz on my PC. I could not wait to give a review on this product. Very impressed."
5,"Before I purchased this monitor I brought LG 22MP68VQ which was arrived faulty. And I replaced and brought again about 4 time from amazon but each and every time it arrives with at-least one fault. But LG and their customer service center did nothing.I added few photos of this monitor comparing to LG monitors side by side. In one of this photos it can noticed that back light glowing issue of IPS panel far more better in ACER than LG. Also anti-glare coating is good in this ACER Monitor.Also this ACER monitor supports 75Hz refresh rate @ 1080X1920.disadvantages in this monitor is negligible like NO SOFTWARE CONTROL and color isn't calibrated.also it is ""21.5 inch"" not ""22 inch"" diagonal. so it looks little smaller than LG 22MP68VQ. The stand provided is a old style one but very steady where LG looks stylish but not steady like it.For gaming, I think its good because of typical IPS response time but no free sync (while LG free sync on 22MP68VQ questionable) and no back-light stabilization.In spite of that drawbacks...Overall, Grate monitor for all purpose use.wait for an offer because more than 7k isn't worthy for this product."
4,"I received the product on 26th Sept 2018. Before starting, let me clear that I am writing for Acer EB321HQU 32inches with 2K resolution and IPS panel display. The reason for mentioning this is that amazon treats all comments under the same umbrella of the product. Though, there are variations among them. My current feedback would be based on the first impression. This will be updated after a few months of usage.To start up, let me share the pros and then cons of the product.Pros:1. 32 inches screen with IPS panel2. 2K resolution good for this big size display3. Easy menu configuration4. PIP option5. Good contrast ratio6. Cost wise, economical7. Good to have 3 years of warrantyCons:1. Does not have swivel stand2. One can notice a minute color shift from end to other. Though this is fine due to big screen size.3. Fixed refresh rate 60Hz. This may not be good for those who are looking for hardcore gaming stuffs.4. No AMD freesync or Nvidia gsync option. Again, not good for gaming seekers.Conclusion: If you are looking for a light gaming and day to day task with having a big screen size and economical, then go for it."
4,"The monitor is your standard run of the mill VGA monitor, viewing angles are decent and better than those horrible cheap TFT panels.Picture and colours are nice but nothing outstanding here. The response time of 4ms makes it good for gaming for a 60hz monitor.The mounting stand is not the most stable but is built solid metal while the bottom of the stand is plastic.PS- The monitor only looks to be thin bezeled and it very much not so, i.e. the monitor has permanent black bars around those bezels when the display is on, making the thin bezels pretty much redundant and a false representation of the product.All in all a decent buy for its price of around 7k."
4,"Nice product in very good price ,but i didn't receive HDMI cable , picture quality is very nice ,true bezzals less display , recommend for all.thanks Amazon for on time delivery"
5,"My only qualm is the pricing range - watchout for the 15% swing in prices before buying. There is no price drop guarantee. At the same time, I wonder if this is subject to used Vs unused screens. Or if it's just an algorithm.Hint: I could have returned it for free and purchased it again when it hit at least 10% lower. But realized that this would be a national waste. Ideally, such larger products should have come with a price drop guarantee."
1,"27 inch screen size is too large for 1080p.Was using samsung 24 inch 1080p monitor and this monitor is worse compared to that. Its cheap product so overall quality is also cheap. Its good if you just want to play videos and not at all good for reading and gaming as pixel per inch is on the lower side. Games don't run smooth. Replacing for a lower size monitor, 22 inch with same resolution."
5,"Overall good, there is slight color bleeding at the edges, not true 10 bit Panel (8bit+Acer tricks) as mentioned, still looks good, controls are pathetic, switching to another active source of input is Pain in the ass, no source switching shortcut button for a 3 input (hdmi, Dvi-d, Display ports) ??? Seriously acer! Relief is it has PIP. Won‚Äôt detect the other source even after pain staking TRICKY manual switching from menu? This is the greatest of all‚Äî>> Can‚Äôt go into Menu without a input Cable! or when it is not detecting the input with cable connected!!! Are you kidding me?Still i‚Äôm ok, because 32‚Äù UHD IPS Monitor with 4 ms response for 19000? you got me here Acer!!!"
4,"Purchased it on July, 2020. Delivered in less than 24 hours. I am writing this review after using it for 2 weeks.Pros:1. Almost no bezel. The entire screen is utilized by the picture.2. Light weight.3. Picture quality and pixels are sharp and is good for professional use like programming, emails, etc.4. Brightness is good. Will be comfortably able to view the screen clearly in a well lit room. But there is also the presence of some glare.Cons:1. The screen goes off suddenly for a second when there is voltage fluctuations. Maybe if someone turns on a tube light which is connected to the same voltage line, the screen goes off for a second and comes back. I really hope that it is not a serious problem. Usually happens around 4-5 times a day. Poor quality from Acer.2. The screen is more warmer with high white balance. I tried changing all the possible settings, and the white balance doesn't decrease beyond a certain level. Maybe uncomfortable initially, but you may get used to it later.3. The settings button is behind the screen and it is very difficult to identify which button corresponds to which setting. I spent almost half an hour to just set the right colour combinations.4. The height of the screen cannot be adjusted unlike how it is possible in other monitors. The user needs to somehow manage to the default height of the monitor. But the angle/tilt of the screen can be adjusted.5. Comes with an inbuilt speaker. Sound quality is not great and the volume is very less. I am using my laptop speaker instead. Not much of use with the inbuilt speaker."
4,Screen is broken completely . Shipping box also looks like it has been re packed many times . Big scamUpdate : got the product replaced however speakers on the replacement unit are not working although which is not a big problem because I am connecting to external speakers anyway.Coming to display it is very nice colours are sharp no bleeding no backlight error no dead pixels . Pretty satisfied with the overall package .
5,"PROSIPS display makes every detail come out clean and crisp and brillaint colour reproduction.There is a speaker at the back end of the monitor not many people write about it but this model has it. Speaker is a 5 watt speaker I think not sure.Monitor has not heat generation for the IPS display. I have used it straight for 14 to 15 hours and my eye does not feel pain as its IPS display and also has eye care and blue light filter.Cons:If you are including a speaker then two 5 watts would make sense rather than overall 5 watt.Also my unit came with a VGA cable where as seller mentions a HDMI cable. Please be specific, have to spend another 400 for a descent HDMI cable."
5,"The product was delivered in fine condition, and I did not find any dead pixels reported by few customers. Even I was worried about it, but that was not the case. It's no less than your average TV in size, so keep in mind while buying. The overall quality is good nothing to complaint about. Don't expect speakers, as you need external ones to be connected to it. Remember if you go for curved monitors you won't get the high resolution as this monitor provides at this cost."
5,"Since I have got this monitor it feels as if other displays are fake or cheap quality products wherever and whatever I see. Given I use it for my office work it simply enhances and improves the windows image quality dragged on from laptop screen to secondary screen(monitor). It somehow retains the quality even when seen from various angles. Has got anti glare properties which saves you when light is coming from behind. They definitely included a hdmi extender (male to female) but should include other types of connecting cables as well. Further, they should have provided plastic caps to cover other ports not in use. But overall satisfied with using this monitor."
1,Received today 6th sep 2020 a screen with one stuck pixel and a big blue block on bottom right when you turn screen to black color. I can ignore the stuck pixcel but blue block is very hard to be ignored.This is my second purchase of same monitor. Earlier one was quite perfect and running without any issue since two yearsDisappointed with seller on this one . I assume it's a manufacturing qa defect and seller has not sent the defective piece intentionally. I will give a benefit of doubt and I'll aks for a replacement piece. Hope seller accept replacement rather than return. I have waited for this monitor for long time as it took more than week for shipping. Very dissatisfied and disappointed.
5,"As of now i am using it as TV with HD set top box. this model has audio out( head phone out) and its working well. I connected to Set top box as well as to a computer. We don't need to touch the buttons on the monitor or a remote  for changing the input, Monitor automatically changes to next input, if we power off the set box it searches for next input like DVI port or Display port and it detects and changes to it."
5,"There were many negative reviews on Amazon for this monitor which was concerning. When I checked the latest reviews overall reviews were positive and hence I went ahead and I am happy to  report that this Monitor exceeded my expectations for price of 16K INR inclusive of offers .I had already  ordered it for 20K but  cancelled  it, and ordered at new offer price. The refund process was hassle free . At 20K INR this monitor is good buy, at 16K its value for money.I already have a BenQ 24 inch Full HD monitor and in terms of picture quality and pixel density they compare same.In two days I have got used to size of this Acer monitor  and it would be difficult to go back to any lesser size . I now use BenQ as secondary monitorPros:The 32 inch size and 1440p resolution is good for office work and multimedia, and it does not feel too big .The pixel density is is same as 1080p 24 inch monitor but the amount of information you see is much more due to increased resolution.The placement of I/O ports are well done .Good selection of I/O ports with HDMI/DP/DVI with Audio out. Note that audio will not work with DVI.IPS panel with good viewing angles and color reproduction and without any significant IPS Glow.For 16K-17K INR it is value for money and you cannot find any other Monitor in its class for this price.VESA mount is supported and setting up Stand was easiest I had done for any Monitor.Cons:No audio over DVI port on Monitor , I tried connecting PS4 and Dell Laptop, via DVI to HDMI adapter.The games appear somewhat blurry if you are not using Native Resolution of monitor.  I tested with PS4 which can only output 1080p, there was slight blur but it did not bother me much."
4,The only feature we are paying so much for this monitor is full hd 1080p. Otherwise all other features are same as compared to cheaper monitor. Feels vague giving too much money for this only feature. Also not recommended for gaming because it don't have any extensive features that gaming monitors should have like 75hz display and freesync. I think it's a good monitor for people into animations and editing videos.
5,"For the price, it was really hard to find a monitor of this spec at 32"". I was surprised how much bigger this unit was compared to my existing 24"" BenQ 2411HD! It had wall mount options but I'm using it with desk mount. The rear is white but it isn't standing out when viewed from front. The bezels are slim and the design is elegant. I'm using it via DVI. In terms of brightness, this is way superior to any monitors in the sub 30k inr price range I've come across. I'm not an expert on monitors but the grey bleeding on screen edges are pronounced with black images or game backgrounds. The response time is similar to the BenQ for games. I was considering getting a 32"" micro max fhd TV instead of the monitor, but I'm glad I got the monitor instead. Have seen the micromax TV (otherwise brilliant) have noticeable lag in gaming. For movies, it offers much clear and brighter rendering."
5,"Its edges are blurred and overall picture quality is really bad. DOnt buy it, I have another 32 inch LG monitor (1920X1080) which has a great picture quality and clarity in display. Acer on the other hand is worst.The replaced product doesnt have any issues and have very good quality, I think the seller deliberately sent the defective piece , first time around."
5,"Been a couple of weeks since I have been using this and it has been working well so far. The product came nicely packaged and arrived within projected time. Received a HDMI cable along with the monitor. The monitor feels well designed and viewing experience has been good so far. Can't speak for gaming, since I haven't sued it for that purpose. The 32 inch screen size is good for work or browsing and the 2K screen resolution is well detailed."
5,"I'm no display expert, but can definitely say the difference between a good display and an average display. For a budget price and for a more not so comprehensive requirement, this monitor fits the bill. Nice big display for an average sized room, neatly built, has several display enhancing features. The quality is crisp and extremely pleasant when viewed. Definitely recommending if you would want a descent WQHD monitor."
5,"After lot of research and conclusion I have rated this monitor the best. The screen clarity of 1440p at 32"" makes your text readable and crisp and the video wonderful. Though there is minimum bleeding of light on black screen that is common in IPS panel, all is best. Have a audio port out that helps to redirect the HDMI audio out through it.I have compared to the QLED 27"" Samsung and the text are vert crisp and very much readable. I am a coder myself and very very satisfied with the performance at this price point of 20K for this 32"" IPS panel monitor."
5,"I literally have no word...initially I was little skeptic about my purchase..hoooooooop..what a monitor...it's giant..it's heavy..not that sturdy.. little delicate to use..& most importantly bright vivacious display...for my eye concern, I have a setup of zero brightness & zero contrast.. let me tell you it moreover feels like an AMOLED if you can ignore IPS illumination..one more thing, like to share with you that the monitor comes with HDMI cable inside the box & it supports 2560 * 1440 (2k) resolution, is rendering over 90 pixels/inch.. I have bought a DVI dual channel cable separately as I have a PC & a laptop so switching physically every time won't be that good either for device or for cable ports as well.surprisingly, DVI D cable can handle 2880 * 1620 resolution, is rendering over 100 pixels/inch..but the difference is HDMI can allow audio signal where DVI can not.. i.e. you won't be able to get audio output while DVI is connected..most interestingly my 11.6"" laptop screen gets opened with this monitor over 1080p resolution.. rendering by 2048 * 1152.. which looks pretty crisp & clear..yet I can't recommend this monitor for gaming.. let me tell you why! because it handles up to 60 Hz framerate.. for regular work or still visual this monitor is surely recommended.. rather for gaming I would suggest 120 Hz or above.. framerate or refresh rate more matters for gaming experience over FHD, 2k or 4k resolution..the only thing I have found, it slightly hunches in forward direction..what I really miss in this monitor is an USB port was pretty expected there at the backside..Thanks to Acer...Thanks to Amazon...probably the best online purchase with highest level of satisfaction..Edited..check out the last photo I've included..you can get a clear about two things(i) Viewing angle(ii) Black level even being an AMOLED panel..for those who are shouting if it is a VA panel instead of an IPS.."
5,"Very nice product. Thanks to amazon for delivering the product before the time-line even in the lockdown that too at remote area of Kolhapur.In the package contains 1) Screen 2) Stand 3) Power adaptor & cable 4) 3.5mm male to male connector. 5) VGA cable 6) HDMI Cable.  (( Reason i'm specifying the items because. before buying this product, I gone through comments & found that people didn't receive HDMI & VGA cables in the packaging)).I got this screen @8.2k in ""todays deal"". otherwise usually it priced somewhere around 10k. ( Do check-out price on Flpkrt for best price range comparison).The Screen bezels are very thin ( 0.5 cms ). & display is quite sharp. Overall value for money product."
5,"//-Using it for a few weeks now , no dead pixels or screen issues seen yet, although i was very worried seeing initial reviews on QA on Acer monitor.//-Colors are vibrant and black levels are really good when compared to LG IPS led Screen which i am also using.......Its really fun for Media consumtion works both as a TV and montior at this size which is a great Buy.//-Haven't used it for gaming, but working wonderfully as a second screen. for a 32 inches this resolution (2560x1440) is good and suffices.//-Software on the Monitor is glitchy, too many tweakings and monitor Doesn't respond too well. Inbuilt default color presets are good enough for reading mode, movie mode, and photo mode. So i stick to default color presets for adjusting brightness and contrast.//-Monitor is heavy and tilts only 5 degrees .  looks classy and well built.//- It is comfortable working from 2ft Distance Viewing angles are great, Anything bigger than this size is too big and anything smaller you wouldn't want to go back small post working on this."
4,This is my first monitor which i'm using with my laptop.below are the observations so far.1. colors a pretty good. viewing angles are also good2. suitable for casual work. not for gaming at all3. I just use this monitor for browsing and coding.4. black color is not so good but it is expected for this price range.5. Top is more brighter than bottom.For whom this monitor is far??casual users who are looking for big screen for movies and entertainment and casual graphic designers. and developers.
5,"Excellent monitor from Acer. I got IPS panel monitor. 31.5 inch with 2k excellent combination. I use it for coding, so now I can split window in to 4 or 3 parts to work efficiently.Seller Xtronicsapp is very helpful to me to choose the monitor. As I was more worried about the size. I was confused between 27 and 32 inch monitor. But as it was 32 with 2k, so I am not able to resist at this price.Packaging was excellent. It was packed with four layers, out of four two layers are bubble wrap. Very good for Big and delicate items like monitor. I got the monitor in excellent condition. Also working properly.Thank you for both seller Xtronicsapp and Amazon for providing excellent monitor at best price."
5,"I was very skeptical about ordering it because of the some negative reviews I had read here. I am writing this review after 1 week of using it. I am more than happy with the product.No color bleeding as shared by some users, display is crisp and bright enough. I use it at 30% brightness.I am not a gamer, I use it for programming, image and video editing."

5,"- This is the most aggressively priced 32‚Äù QHD monitor (2k monitor). I couldn‚Äôt find a cheaper monitor with the same specs from any brand- Picture quality, brightness are decent- I am not a gamer and I don‚Äôt care about high refresh rates at all- I mainly use it for WFH and consuming video. For these purposes it‚Äôs excellent- The backlight bleed is a non-issue. The panel I got does have backlight bleed but thats a limitation of the manufacturing process. More importantly, I didn‚Äôt get any dead pixels, been 2+ months now.- Please ignore comments wrt backlight bleed. Most of them are needlessly hyping the issue and are woefully ignorant of the manufacturing process of the monitor. In day to say usage it will not affect you at all.-32 inch and 2k gives you a lot more screen real estate. You can fit more windows without it being too small. This is great for WFH.-This is VESA mount compatible, 100x100An excellent monitor that I would recommend to anyone for WFH, especially to budget conscious customers."
5,"Giant screen. Also I was lucky to get it for a low price by buying during a sale.Picture quality is good. I use it for work and I get a lot more on screen space to work with since it is 1440p, instead of 1080p.HDMI cable is provided, installation is very easy. I think you have to use a stand, a floating table mount can't support 32 inch screens.Some people are confused, but there are no speakers in this product.Overall, I am really happy with the purchase and would definitely recommend if you are looking for a 32 inch monitor."
5,"I was really confused between buying a 1080p 144hz 27 inch monitor and 32 inch 1440p 60hz monitor for my series s. I finally purchased this one and i am so glad I went with a bigger screen and higher resolution. I am very casual gamer so i didn't need 144hz really and series s can deliver 120fps on very rare games so it didn't really make any sense. This is not a long term review as i have had this monitor only for 4 days but in these 4 days i am really impressed with this monitor and the series s performance on it. It's got a mat finish that helps reducing glare upto 90% which is really awesome. I also am really impressed with the amount of emmersive experience the 32 inch screen offers. I don't have to sit very close to the monitor which a great thing and due to no glare the screen holds up it's quality even in a bright room. I haven't tinkered with the settings alot as i am not a very knowledgeable person with regards to how to get the best out of this monitor. I also read the reviews where people got faulty motors and had bleeding issues,fortunately i haven't faced any till now and i hope i don't face any in the future aswell. If you want it for am Xbox Series S i will day definitely go for it."
5,The display is too good for the price I got it for (rs 7999). The panel is very slim and sleek. The speaker volume is not that loud but just ok but still it doesn't matter considering other things
5,"Very much happy with this.. i was planing to buy LG but some how ended up buying this one. This a good display and also produces good colors. No screen bleeding or any problems at all. I will recommend this one. And please note that every monitor is LCD it only has LED backlite,Which is better.The only thing i dont like is the design of stand it looks old fashioned but you wont care after seeing how thin the display is and its overall performance."
1,"I am from Hyderabad. Like all of you, I also read all the above reviews, watched YouTube videos, thought a lot and finally decided on this 31.5 inch Acer monitor. From years, I am stuff buying from Amazon. Trusting the brand, I paid and ordered online. As I took out of the box with lot of hope, to my bad, I saw those yellow curved at the bottom of the screen inside. Didn't expect Amazon will send such defective pieces to its loyal and prime customers. Very disappointed. Its says 2k resolution but in reality you don't actually that image quality. And, you can see in the above pictures the pathetic light bleeding from all the edges. I want to cancel this and go for a different model but Amazon for now is allowing only replacing with a fresh piece. Lets see how it will be. Nevertheless, I lost hope and looking forward to a other brand."
4,"First of all, in my case, I got a defective product which had some white strips on it which were visible under reflection. In the replaced product there was some current leakage in the bezels of the monitor and hence I returned it. But if we talk about the picture quality. It was really good. Crisp and clear.I bought it at 16500K during a lightning sale.In terms of features, the most missing thing is a Speaker. It does have a headphone jack though. Don't know why in the question and answer section it's written that this doesn't have one. This needs to be corrected.Also, the height is not adjustable to do lookout for that."
5,OK this Monitor has model number KG241QS and there is similar monitor i mean exactly similar with model number KG241QP. Only the difference is that QS is a factory overclocked monitor.Here i will tell you everything about KG241QS which has 165hz refresh rate and 0.5ms response time. the similar KG241QP has 144hz refresh rate and 1ms response time.I have owned IPS panel monitor from LG ( 22mp68vq ) and before this monitor i owned Asus (VG258QE) that was a TN panel Monitor. I recently bought this monitor to actually check whats the difference in 25000rs tn panel and 12000rs tn panel. and when i received this monitor i compared it with side to side with Asus monitor and the difference between two was literally 0%. And comparing this with ips monitor i.e is LG there was a very unnoticable color difference which you will never even notice except white looking a very little yellowish type. And by very little i really mean very little.I am just writing such big review for you guys to just tell you dont waste your money on pricier TN panels you wont notice even a bit of difference. I am loving this monitor gaming is heaven in this monitor so if you are planning to upgrade your monitor buy this use this n i can assure you that i will not be disappointed if you have used IPS panel before. if you want to invest your money invest it in either getting a 2k or get yourself a beast graphic card.I am here mentioning the perfect OSD setting for both 144hz and 165hz models you will get best colors out of it.Brightness - 55contrast  - 40black boost - 06gamma  - 2.4blue light  - offACM  - offSuper sharpness - offcolor temp  - normaloverdrive  - normalfreesync  - onVRB  - off
5,"Well i was holding my purchase for past 3 months for 144Hz monitor and finally pulled trigger on 5th March 2020.And i must say 60Hz users please get 144Hz if you can already .I am not gonna devide this into just pros and cons as it completely neglactes whole user experience i have so you have to read everything.First things first let's get the facts out of the way-1) It is 144 Hz and 165 Hz out of the box; whichever mode can be set with windows or Nvidia Control Panel.2) Enable AMD FreeSync from OSD then you can set Vsync then Gsync easily on both Hz without any issues.  (To enable Vsync is not necessary)So i don't think much is needed to say for gamer at least as this is purely meant for gaming. Colours are accurate out of the box. One can down Green slider from OSD a little bit(48) to make it more accurate otherwise it's fine. Even for movie,too. there are 4 modes in OSD and 3 for gaming.Lastpicture in my review has ACER 165 on left and BenQ VZ2350H on right. I don't have any complain on either one but look at the acer sometime just giving more vibrant and still warmer colours...this is personal preference and one might like BenQ one but i would go with Acer as it is easy on eyes. And moreover u can tweak this easily form RGB menu,2 gamma presets -1.8,2.2 and 2.4 and colour temperature setting but don't do it randomely...find a scale first to measure.I mainly play Rocket League and PUBG lite online and  I tried Witcher 3 offline. 165Hz always and no ghosting or trailing effect. Resident Evil and Tomb Raider players...sorry i can't test that deep. Your user experience may very from mine. The monitor works flawless for even 6-7 hours straight.No issues in reading text but it stil looks pixelated from 60 c.m. distance. But for images and movies it's just doing fine.Ok...so why get something better if u can? Because this is TN panel and it's gonna show it's symptoms from time to time. As i have to seat in level of the display. Watch slightly from more height or more low it will affect sky and white colours resulting in washed out colour and black shadow respectively. On normal windows usage this is a issue because there is a Green tint all over the place when u see it from angle. But but but here me out; you are not gonna watch form that angle and operate your pc...U can still watch a movie from that angle and it is just showing good expected colours.For gaming this is great value for 12499 INR as this justify every feature it comes with. One might wonder why i didn't talk about 0.5 ms response time but it's marketing gimmick anyway in every gaming monitor and one have to measure actual GTG response time and i don't have that tool. For me it's just fine on 144Hz and 165Hz.U can get Acer's 144hz IPS variant but for gaming this is just fine for 60Hz to 144Hz upgrade. Sorry if i left something u wanted to hear but i don't have any issue about black level or anything. Backlight bleed? I have picture attached and it's equal on whole panel but on camera it looks somewhat bad.In reality it's perfectly fine if u watch it from straight. Any other questions feel free to ask here. I will replay and test if i can."
4,"I was lucky to have got this for 11,915 INR. I knew AS SOON AS I order it, the price would go up.Now let's talk about the performance of this monitor. Coming from a 4K monitor, it took me a while to get used to the 1080p resolution of this monitor. The brightness is far too much for me. Even after I turned Brightness and Contrast to Zero, it was still far too bright for me. Other than that, I think it's a good deal at 11,915 INR."
5,"Literally the best monitor you can find for gaming at this budget, I've been using this for about 6 months now and I'm really impressed by the display and the colours. POG"
1,"PLease do not fall for the outside cover which claims normal refresh rate at 144hz and overclock 165hz. In reality, when checked from system, it shows 119hz and 137 as normal and overclock refresh respectively. Absolutely shameful marketing from acer and being sold by amazon."
1,"Only had this for 5 months and already having to replace !!!!  I'm REALLY not happy.  I only use this occasionally (probably only 30 times since buying) and it is flickering away like anything.  Did experience a little flicker, a few seconds here and there, when it was only a few weeks old.  Changed cables and updated drivers and it didn't happen again for a while.  But now it just doesn't stop !!!  Changes cables, screen side (have dual display) and deleted and reinstalled drivers .... still flicking.  NOT HAPPY."
5,I purchased this monitor Rs 13840The monitor is really great and really awesomeNow let's cut the chase and come to the pro and consPros1.The display quality is really better if we compare with some Ips panels2.178 view angle I consider at 1703. respond this is accurate4. Its totally on matte finish and near to bezel less design5. For started just go to display setting and change from 59 or 60 hz to 144hz or 165 defends upon your flavorCons1. The stand is really good with glossy black bottom part with matte finish red But shaking you table make you  monitor a little bit shaker2. Color calibration is not done so do as for your flavorSo these are my thoughts on this monitor I hope this will really help all of you those who want to purchase for gamingHAPPY GAMING
2,"After 1 week of waiting i received a defective monitor although the monitor was working fine but something inside the back of the monitor was broken as i could clearly hear some metal plates (something like that) roaming freely inside the monitor which were hitting something inside and making that metel noise.Also i think the monitor was used because it already had freesync ,overdrive and gsync(in nvidia control panel) enabled already ,also it was already overclocked to 165 hz out of the box, or maybe im wrong and it is suposed to be like that  i ll update my review and rating once i received the proper replacemnet"
1,This monitor worked fine for 2 months and suddenly it stopped working. It is in warranty period so they told they will replace it. It's been more than 10 days now and I haven't got a replacement till now. Very poor service from Acer. No one is able to tell as to when they will get the product from their HO. Really disappointed!
5,"Ok first of all i am coming from IPS Panel 75hz so everyone told not to take TN Panel but i took the risk, but i must admit this monitor is superb.>Great Brightness and side view is good too (i thought it would be bad)>Color was little low but increased the vibrance to 75% in nvidia control panel.>Smoothest Experience literally i can feel the difference by scrolling amazon or fb you will not face any tearing n ol and in gaming like csgo, valorant just awesome..> Download color profile from acer.com and update it on device manager>Provided with Display port Cable (You have to change in nvidia resolution to 1920x1080 165hz)If anyone facing any issues for first time kindly  perform clean driver installation of nvidia or amd.Overall loved it let see how it performs in future, Hoping for Best!!!  <3"
3,"Think twice before you buy. The Monitor has a good refresh rate. But its not .5ms its 10ms and more over the screen alignment is slightly slant towards bottom right angle( i noted this on the third week) . The monitor I received looks like it is refurbished. If you are lucky , you may get a good one, try your luck and chance. However think twice!"
5,Nice quality monitor in such a low price. I have got this monitor at ‚Çπ13828. But now the price has increased. I want to purchase more but price is already increased. Please let me know about the same.
4,"There is no other monitors which is available at this price with 144 hz, I purchased this item for 11950/- and for average gaming purpose 24 inch far better. also the design of the stand and holder is very impressive. However the border of the screen is thicker. but we can ignore it when compared to the price . There is no need to think much this  if the price is on offer"
1,monitor was delivered on 17 aug and on 11 sept suddenly a blue line ran through the displayi am currently on a call with acer while writing this review and it has been 20 mins since the customer care has put me hold :)))))))ps : will update the review and write hows the acer service
5,"Best for gaming I bought it at a great value of 12300‚Çπ 144hz monitor u can switch it to 165hz and it is really awsm picture quality. 24inch is best for 1080 , 27inch monitor will decrease your pixel density for 1080 it will effect your user experience.Recommended for CS:GO players."
4,"I have waiting to buy 144hz monitor for almost year, but i was not able to afford till now. I searched for the cheapest and best feature full monitor at price of 13k. This is best monitor you can get at this pricePros:-1. 165/144 is works as mentioned in the discription2. Freesync is awesome for games. i play pubg pc alot and i usually get fps around 80-100 avg lag and stutter but after freesync turned on it feel butter smooth (free sync range 48hz-165hz )3. Brightness is good4. Stand is good no problem thereCons:-1. Viewing angles are shit if you look straight it looks fine but if you bend a little the monitor get dark in some region2. The Bezel size is too much but it doesn't matter too much. this is the best Monitor you can get at this price"
5,Very good monitor but colour not too much accurate compare to ips and side view angle colours are very very bad but am very enjoy with 144-165hz and 2k resolution gameplays.Pros.1. 144-165hz works very well.2. Freesync enable monitor also gsync support but u need to dp cable for this feature.3. Looking sexy nd stand is very attractive.4. Colours are good compare to others TN panel.5. Brightness are awesome yes it's too bright üîÜCons.1. Colours are not well don't expect much.2. Side view angle colours are very very bad images shows full dull and blackish.3. Monitor are not steady because stands is small and monitor is to weighted nd his moving by air comes from your ceiling fan and coolers.4. Monitor not support 2k 144hz on dp only work 2k 30hz but works on hdmi well. I don't know why but yeah am face this issue
5,"I have been using 60 hz monitor from last few years... and saw few videos on youtube for higher refresh rate for gaming and tempted to try one. Was on low budget and got this with discount.The higher refresh rate of 165 hz 0.5 delays (which is lowest) and 24 inch just changes the whole experience for gaming. Someone who is in to FPS games and plays daily has to have to monitor. Its a complete package at good price, vesa mount, dp HDMI port, different modes for gaming movies etc.The only thing i miss is speakers but you can anytime use external speakers.All in excellent product and delivery..... very happy."
5,"First I was saving for Acer 144hz monitor which costs around 13k on amazon but while I was browsing for it one day I saw this one and was surprised that it is just the same as it and has 165hz refresh rate and is also cheaper as I got it for 11,915. I immediately bought it and I am happy I did. Gaming performance is very good if you have a 60hz monitor please consider upgrading if you can. Viewing angles are surprisingly good for TN panel, you can see the display clearly even when sitting on the ground. The display has good brightness and color reproduction. You can tweak further by going into the Nvidia color panel according to your liking. Overall it is the best buy at this budget as no other 165hz monitor is near it in this range."
3,"I have been using this display for more than a month now, Here is my impression of it.The display quality is good and it can be easily used as a secondary display to your laptop or you can use it as your main monitor too.The color production is fantastic and the 165Hz that it provides is something you would love to experience, Keep in mind, Windows only allows 120Hz natively, So you would only get to experience 165Hz in games.The biggest CON of this monitor is its stand, The stand is so pathetic and is really not build sturdy enough. The display would constantly wobble like those bobblehead toys while you are typing on your keyboard on a table. It wobbles so much that it would be enough to annoy you into stop using the display altogether. The display even wobbling while I am writing this review. Giving three stars solely because of the stand."
4,The monitor came today with superb packing.Got a good initial feel even after un boxing but it didn't last after I booted the monitor. Got back light bleeding in the left middle screen and right bottom of the screen. Ordered a replacement and hope it'll be in my hands soon. But except that everything is fine but got irritated when playing black things.edited- got replaced today with a good panel monitor without any bleeding and counties enjoying ü§©üòç
1,"I fall in love when I first saw this I was like omg this is it <3 <3... I would 100% not recommend this to anyone, the worst monitor I have seen.. 165Hz? my phone feels faster lol..I loved it so much I would have given 0 stars if there was an option for it."
3,In dark areas the banding is horrible and takes you out of the immersionthe monitor has an unfixable forward tiltthe color accuracy is badthe only possible use for this is just office work and gaming upto 165 fps and nothing elseinvest more and buy a better monitor i wish i did that
5,"monitor is nice... 165 hz .. 1920x1080p.. 0.7ms .. 27 inches .. TN panel... as TN is best for gaming.. not for video editor and movie watcher as the color accuracy of TN is not good go for IPS then for that but for only gaming best monitor at budget just at 18000rs when i buy it .. remember the technology used for enjoying 0.7ms response time is MPRT , u have to turn on in monitor settings to enjoy.. btw turning on enhances experience but u can't able to change brightness contrast related stuff, freesync is also disabled in this mode.. the major thing u have to do with MPRT is to turn on every single time u boot ur pc... FREESYNC monitor but if u have nvidia card u can use GSYNC in this monitor as it is GSYNC Certified Freesync monitor (remember to connect display cable for 165hz Gsync/freesync support) btw nice monitor using for 7-8 months no problem at all in starting as it is 27 inches and i jumped to a 27 inch monitor from a 20 inches monitor but if u settled with it one time u cannot able to revert to a smaller monitor again.... and go for it if u get it in deal as over 20000 its not justify it price"
5,"First of All my expectations with this was high and it is fullfilled , in the picture the stand is black but u get red black combo which looks op üî•U can vary it's Refresh Rate from lowest to highest (165.003)Free DP Cable with Jaw LocksIt's 0.5 ms 165Hz Screen is so damn smoothRn I'm using it with my lappy and PS4 gonna build PC SoonOverall i just Love the product"
5,I bought this monitor checked everything it's great monitor just found one flaw of the monitor it has black colour defectiveness cos whenever black colour comes on display then tiny little white colour shows in display maybe stuck or hot pixel so I request for replacement but go for this monitor it's awesome overall üëç
4,"1.Best for 1920x1080 gaming. 2. 400Nits super bright.3.Accurate colors. (Need lily tweaking if preferred).4. With Gsync compatible FreeSync On 165hz monitor, you can play warzone high settings at 150Fps(min)  fixated provided you have 2070 super or above graphics"
5,"Got this on an offer for 10,700/-I am very happy i got this monitor. AMD freesync comes on by default. No need to go to the trouble to turn it on. Just go to your nvidia control panel or amd panel and change the refresh rate to 165 and see the magic. I play Dota 2 on my PC and earlier i used to play on 60hz. I switched to this and I can never go back. I am using GTX 1070 with this monitor but ill suggest get a AMD card for even better performance. But yeah even Nvidia cards work fine. The games run very smooth and it improvers your gameplay. Also videos and overall use becomes very smooth. I will definitely suggest this to everyone. (only viewing angles are bad so dont buy if you want to build a HTPC)"
5,"When I was buy the price was 12k it's really good too much bright I save my brightness level to 55, it's really good for gaming, it's a TN panel but the quality of the display, colour it really good, you don't face any problems with this display. It's also good for entertainment purposes, I didn't face any problems colour is good."
1,A big size monitor for gaming but when u connect hdmi cabel atleast 144hz should working but no its only working 75hz with hdmi and when u applay 165hz its not working anymore and when u apply more than 75hz then its flikring and some black line comes on screen so i refund it and give 1star so don‚Äôt buy this go with others. And picture quality is very poor very very poor
1,This monitor has a decent performance ..But the quality of product is too bad i got a damage product in which there was a gap between the panel and the bezel . I replaced the item and after one week i got the replaced monitor which has the same damage problem ..
5,bought a week back and when it arrived it was good and then while testing the screen i found a green pixel on the right side of the screen and requested for replacement and recieved new one and till now there hasnt been any defect with this but for thoseewho want to buy it and are coming from ips displays { i am on TN pannel for the last 3 years so i didnt notice it} the colours are good but they will change on viewing from other angles and it is G-sync compatible freesync monitor.
5,there is TN panel but viewing angel and color are good enough than my expectation. It gives true 144Hz and 165Hz .But you may see little ghosting issue that can be ignored. You noticed the issue if you focused on screen to see the ghosting. One problem is OSD application is not working properly. You need to use monitor button to adjust settings. Overall the monitor is a good choice for daily work and games.
4,"Its Good for Gaming and Entertainment,Only thing that i noticed is that this monitor's stand was like already used with scratches but it was beneath it and you cant even see it,Its 1ms gtg on 144hz but 0.5ms is a marketing gimmick,Input lag is pretty low good one for competitive gaming,also couldnt see much difference on 144 to 165hz,The other model KG241QP is the same with the basic features that u need while this ones got some additional features that some ppl doesnt even use,This ones Display port is kinda hard to connect and eject as it had a lock,Overall great monitor for 11997,If you want to save some bucks go for KG241QP as you dont wanna spend 1000 rs higher for 21Hz more which is literally unnoticable,Its a TN panel but colours are good for gaming as i tried it on rainbow six siege and can clearly see everything.I already bought a Samsung C24FG73 which has amazing colours when compared to this,But its marketed as a gaming monitor but its only for casual players as it has like 24ms response time bcoz of VA panel,If Casual and want more colours Go for C24FG73,as its great,also for ips consider Acer or MSI,But for competitive go for Acer or Benq zowie as TN panels are the Fastest of the lot. Also dont spend more than 15K for tn panels as they are not worth more than that."
2,"Do not buy TN panel unless you really want that competitive edge for FPS gaming, I went from a IPS 60hz display to this and colors suck compared to IPS display and honestly I can't see much difference between 60 hz and 144 hz. Better buy a IPS or LED even if its 75 hz."
5,"This review is after 8months of use...1. Monitor gets black screen in between.2. Monitor not have one more HDMI PORT, and USB port.3. Speakers are useless.4. Viewing angles are not good.5. IPS panel is best.This is main partAcer warranty is no use as no good response from services.Good @13800Buying at this price and leada to regretting...Solution Buy Samsung monitor or any"
4,"The screen display of the monitor and customisation according to the gaming is good but I am so negative and disappointed with the Audio system both the headset jack output, the audio clarity was poor on my philips external speakers and inbuilt speaker is too poor the 4W inbuilt speaker can't able to meet the performance of my laptop speakers...I strongly recommend for other products if you are looking for a monitor with inbuilt speakers...And I feel a remote or better user interface to operate with all those features..."
5,"This is how it describes - 165 hz.Feel the difference.After switching from 60 hz to 165 hz , there is nothing left in the product to complain about.I play Valorant and can see the frames like a silk cloth.Brightness is more than enough, viewing angles are not bad.Build quality is superb, especially stand.Must buy for budget-friendly seekers.I got it in 14.6k - 2 days delivery. Big thanks to Amazon."
4,"Might be good for gaming but if you are planning for office work - it's not good.The monitor can't scale up FHD to 27inch, so text becomes a lot pixellated. Circles are not proper, text lines are bold on one side, thin on other.Stick to 24 inch or less on FHD.Go for 27inch qhd or 4k if you want proper display"
1,The monitor that arrived was damaged or more likely as if it was completely submerged under some thick fluid.... Had to replace the item... It was really disappointing... Hopping this time they don't mess up... Will notify and edit after the replacement...
2,"I was pretty surprised to see a sublet of Acer selling such a feature packed monitor at such a low price.And best of all they were using VA panel and not TN(which are usually the cheapest and the worst looking).Before i start my rant about its issues, let me say this, for this price you won't get Freesync and 144hz from any other brand, the blacks are pretty good and the panel gets decently bright.And overall can be a decent buy if the panel issues are sorted out which i will discuss next.So despite my apprehensions with this brand and Acer in general, i dived in and bought it, only to realize nothing ever comes cheap, and there is a reason why AOPEN monitors are so cheap, usually with monitors QA(Quality Assurance) plays a big factor when deciding the price. You see the more monitors you have to discard on the assembly line to maintain a certain level of quality, the more end users end up paying for that quality. I think by now you know why these monitors costs to less, for those who didn't get it, the QA department for such cheap monitors is pretty relaxed, they allow relatively bad looking panels to pass through to cut down the price.For some this might absolutely be a non issue, but for the discerning user who values quality, i will not recommend this monitor, the proof is in front of you folks, the pics i have attached here show how a complete black backgrounnd looks on this monitor, its really funny because my 8 year old TN panel monitor looks way better.It seems like we should expect less of panels now than we did 8 years ago(Added a comparison screenshot of this monitor vs my 8 year old TN panel, just look at the panel uniformity and backlight difference between the 2) !The panel uniformity is all over the place, and if you tell me to look the other way due to the price, i won't because even the costlier Predator series monitors have backlight bleed and uniformity issues.Ok enough talk about the first issue, moving to issue number 2.Typically and technically IPS panels have the best color reproduction, followed by VA and then TN.So i was expecting the monitor to have much richer and better colors than my TN panel, but sadly thats not the case, the colors are completely unrealistic, have an unnatural hue, and to add to that the monitor's edges are DIMLY LIT.Caliberating the monitor on your own helps a bit but its still not a good VA panel.Pros :-------Good Contrast ratioIntuitive OSDDecent Build Quality144hzFreesync(works with Nvidia gpus too now, but only with pascal and turing)Cons :--------Pathetic backlight issues with dim edgesReally bad color calibration out of the boxPanel uniformity issuesGiving it 2 star due to all of this, because in my eyes a monitor should have a solid foundation(The Panel) and then adding extra features adds value, if your panel is this poor then whats the point in having all those features."
5,"the best under 30k 144hz, va panel, curved viewing angles r good & after sales service will be given by acer so if someone has 30k budget u can go with this also bezels r so slim to be attracted"
5,Really good monitor with crisp image quality. Totally worth the price. 144hz refresh rate and 2k resolution is a treat at this price. Freesync also works pretty good. Only thing is the brightness is 250 nits which is good but a bit low compared to other va panels out there. Viewing angles and colour reproduction is really good. Navigation controls are pretty easy with the joystick provided at the back.Pros:-Cheapest 32 inch display-144 hz freesync works perfect-no dead pixels or backlight bleed-Curve on the screen gives immersive experienceCons:-Display brightness could have been better-No speaker-Cant swivel the monitor vertically 90 degrees-Stand is very small and not firm when tilting the display up and down
4,"If you have 20k around to spare for a new gaming monitor, This Aopen curve gaming monitor is one of the best options available. I am really happy with the purchase. It took only 15 hours to reach.Pros:1. 144hz, so buttery smooth frames.2.  4 ms response.3. Curve display.4. Has display port.5. 27 inch, quite a big displayCons:1. 27 inch 1080p looks a bit inadequate of pixels.2. 1ms response time would have been better, but considering this price damn I would have bought it with 5ms also.Peace."
4,"INTRODUCTION:I bought this monitor to replace an old TN panel that I'd been using forever. Its not without its issues but it does get quite a few things right. Hopefully this review will help you decide whether its worth your hard earned money.PRICE:I picked mine up during an Amazon sale when there was a discount offer and a lightning deal on the monitor. At that price, the feature set this monitor provides can't be beaten. The price seems to have gone up since then though.BUILD QUALITY:Build quality is solid. Stand is all metal, pretty sturdy and the monitor doesn't shake too easily. No swivel or height adjustment, but you can tilt the monitor from -5¬∞~ 20¬∞. No VESA mounts either. Bezels are not slim but not very thick either and have a slightly reflective finish. No stuck/dead pixels or any other visual defects to speak of.CURVATURE:The monitor has a curvature rating of 1800R. Curved monitors offer a larger perceived field of view. I had no problems going from a flat panel to a curved one, but it felt a little strange going back the other way once I got used to it.UI:UI is clean, easy to navigate and the exact same one found on the similarly priced Acer panel. Not surprising given AOpen is an Acer subsidiary. Fortunately, unlike the Acer panel which has normal buttons, this one uses a joystick which is much more convenient and intuitive but with one rather annoying design choice - turning off the screen requires you to keep it pressed for 5 seconds. Not ideal if you quickly want to turn off your screen before leaving the room.IMAGE QUALITY:Colors are ok out-of-the-box but you'll probably need to fiddle around with the settings a bit to get the picture you desire. I found the default presets a bit too warm for my liking so I had to tone it down a bit to get a more neutral image. You can switch the color temp between warm, cool, normal and lastly user mode which enables the RGB bias and gain sliders. The panel isn't very bright but a brightness level of 50-60 will be enough for most people. Blacks look pretty nice as they should be on a VA panel. All in all, with a bit of tweaking, you can get a pretty decent image out of the monitor.VIEWING ANGLES:There is gamma shift when looking at the screen at an angle. The image becomes washed out and less bright the further you move from the centre. But its not severe and its a non-issue if you sit right in front of the screen like most people do.144HZ:Now, onto the two biggest selling points of this monitor: 144Hz and FreeSync. You have to experience a 144Hz monitor to truly understand why so many people recommend one. Forget games for a second - your desktop experience is just so much better. Simple tasks like moving the mouse pointer, dragging a window around, scrolling up and down feel so much more fluid. And once you get used to 100+ fps in games especially FPS, going back down to 60 is something you'll want to avoid. Its not quite the horrible experience going from 60 to 30 but its still jarring.FREESYNC:As for FreeSync, the difference it makes is very evident. No more picking between screen tearing and input lag. And with the latest Nvidia drivers, you aren't restricted to AMD gpus anymore to use FreeSync. As long as you have a Pascal or later series card and a DPI cable, you're good to go. Just enable FreeSync in the monitor menu, then go to the Nvidia Control Panel, click on Set up GSync and tick Enable GSync, Gysnc compatible, Enable for windowed and full screen mode, and Enable settings for the selected display model. That's pretty much it. The FreeSync range is between 48-144Hz but you can extend it using CRU (Custom Resolution Utility). I have extended my range from 40-144Hz because FreeSync is even more beneficial at lower fps. 40fps on a FreeSync panel feels much smoother than 40fps on a non-FreeSync panel.BACKLIGHT BLEEDING:The biggest con, as others have mentioned, is that these monitors suffer from quite a bit of backlight bleeding. Its normal for IPS/VA panels to have a bit of backlight bleeding but its rather noticeable on these panels. I've had two of these, and on a completely black background or even when viewing a dark scene/image, you can see patches near the top and bottom that are brighter than the rest of the screen. Compared to my old TN panel, the black uniformity really isn't good. I mean if you stand far back enough from the screen, it kinda looks like there's a Batman logo on the screen. Of course, the severity of the issue ranges from unit to unit - the replacement I got was better than the original - but its still an issue albeit one that's only evident during dark scenes. If you get a decent unit, keep the brightness at sensible levels, and don't go looking at the edges of your screen every time the screen goes dark, its not something that will really bother you.CABLES:The DP cable that came with the first monitor was not only non-functional, it would stop my PC from even booting into Windows. I had to buy a separate DP cable to troubleshoot the issue. So if you're buying this monitor and plan on using FreeSync, keep a spare DP cable handy just in case. No issues with HDMI or DVI cables though.SUMMARY:Coming from an old 22"" TN panel, this monitor has definitely been a good upgrade. The pros sufficiently outweigh the cons in my opinion. Would I pay the current asking price for it? Probably not. But during a lightning deal and/or when there are discount offers, it certainly represents good value for money."
5,1.I Have search many monitor but any monitor does not have 144hz refresh rate at low price rate And Aopen is latest one i go only 21000rs2.144hz mindblowing.3.curved super4.eye saver5.High Performance any game without any issue6.21000 all feature i got curve..gaming...144hz...4ms smooooth perfomance7.best scene like watch any movie any side without any issue or blurr8.wqhd available :-)9.beast performance ....beautiful look10.finally Rating 9/1011.one point miss because amazon delivery service one day late(delivery boy not give my product my home address ..i collect product office:-( ) but amazon service and support very good12.amazon product and service always better than flipkart13.finally guys buy this product .....best for every you want
5,"Pros:Supports upto 4k 144Hz (custom resolution), although the text turns out to be copy as it's not designed for it.HDMI, DP, DVI, cables included within1920x1080 , 144Hz on DP1920X1080 , 120Hz on HDMIFree sync+gSync compatibleImmersive curvature of 1800RFast response time of 4MsColour correction menu from monitor nipple type button on the backNot too big side bezels~1cmImages quality is natural with sRGb colour profile and great viewing angles from sides.VA panel, which is a trade-off for picture quality from IPS panel and response time from TN panelsBright enough display with 250nitsCons:The stand takes some space in front of the screenHeight is non adjustable plus there is no wall mount of any standard Vesa or whatsoeverNot Windows HDR compatible, not that it hurts but it just doesn't support it.I love it.Here on I can not go back to 60hz ever again.Will be back to edit this review after a few weeks.If you're still thinking to buy this, just do it unless you could push your budget to 20k (which basically have the same traits but additional physical features like stand, looks, adjustable heights and all)After about 8 months I first noticed some backlight bleeding when the screen goes blank. I was starteled at first but when the screen is lit, there really is no difference.For gaming, you might need the overdrive to stay off in the monitor menu options > gaming to prevent ghosting effects of moving sharp images.the viewing angles are great and color reproduction still on point."
2,"Not even 4 months and the display started flickering, tried resetting, changing DP cables but still same issue, tried calling service number of Aopen 1800-11-4100 but number is coming as not available. Raised a ticket with Aopen for servicing the product in bangalore but no proper response yet, they keep telling they are looking into it.Can't figure out how to get the monitor serviced, can anyone help please?"
5,This pocket friendly but enthusiast level specs makes it very affordable gaming premium monitor. This is a right out of the box review and may be updated as i go. qhd +144hz+curved+32 inch at 25k that's a very interesting grab. 144hz definitely feels smoother. All the color tech people include in their reviews and tells how bad this display is .... forget it. on an average day when you are playing a game or watching your fav movie you wont sit actively to notice all those. display is fine. unless you want to cherry pick its minor color calibration or brightness issues.Curved display is actually much better than i thought for browsing and youtube than gaming and movies i noticed. the images or text on edges of the pages are a same distance as middle so thats gives a very comfortable view. So no regrets. its highly recommended. I shall update the review over the time.
4,"Unlike most people, I use this monitor with my laptop (which is very capable BTW) rather than a desktop. I would really recommend that you go for the 32-inch 2560x1440 version or the 24-inch 1920x1080 version as 1920x1080 is not really adequate for a 27-inch monitor. It is quite an immersive experience with the curved VA screen. On my unit, however, HDMI was very buggy. Video signal dropped to a blank screen pretty frequently which was very frustrating. Did not encounter this problem, however, with a DP to mini-DP cable (found a decent cable nowhere online except Amazon, the AmazonBasics version). The problem must be isolated as I have never heard anyone else have this problem. My specific unit has minor backlight bleed, fortunately. Could not figure out how to enable Freesync with a GTX 1060. Again, maybe it's just me.The good :-- Competitive price point.- Huge 32-inch TV-like real estate to work with, with features of a monitor.- Smooth 144Hz refresh rate.- VA panel. Other monitors in this range are mostly TN/IPS 60Hz - 75Hz/really small.- Freesync (Not useful to me, but useful for people with AMD GPUs, at least or those who could make it work with NVIDIA cards somehow).- Curved. Very immersive.- Relatively intuitive OSD.- Adequately deep black levels.The not so good :-- HDMI signal issues (at least on my unit).- Sub-par color calibration out of the box.- Minor backlight bleed on my unit (but tolerable).- One stuck/dead pixel right around the middle of the screen.- No 90 degree rotate/swivel.- No speakers, USB passthrough, etc (justified for the price, I guess).It's not perfect. But it's great overall, nonetheless. Totally worth a recommendation.Edit: Found one stuck pixel around the center of the screen. Edited the review accordingly."
5,"I found the display port image of 1440p 120hz on a radeon hd6970 fantastic.The other complain of backlight unevenness did not exist when your in front of it, if you go back far and see it from an angle then you see it.Black's are great and clarity fantastic to the pixel on dp only.A lot of calibration settings are there.Very impressive and I'm planning a 3 monitor setup for racing and flight sim as will as productivity.The border less frame feature is a joke, as the screen actually ends much before the illustrative thin border. There's almost 10-15mm of border."
5,"The monitor is excellent , very good picture quality , excellent colour production , the curved screen is a treat to eye and 144hz and freesync at this price range is commendableGo for 24 inch one if full hd resolutionI used to run my console on my tv and now moving to this monitor the increase is quality and performance is very measurable .As all the services and onsite warranty for this product will be provided by Acer there should me no doubt related to the durability of the product.The only con is that it lacks a speaker unit but that doesn't change anything.Go for it"
1,Acer is not written anywhere on the packaging box or on the monitor itself.1) The refresh rate is 119.98Hz and not 144Hx as mentioned in specifications.2) Monitor Speakers do not work.3) It's a local individual brand AOPEN and not Acer.The word Acer is only to be found on the order purchase on Amazon app and nowhere on the actual order. Scam.
4,"Received the monitor today.  Initial impression was quite good.  I was using a 21.5inch full HD Dell touch monitor. Going curved is a great boon with good peripheral vision. Now comes the bummer. Display has a patch of dead pixel at the edge and on standby I saw the screen in just one color, reddish with the entire display looking like a cobweb. Must have something majorly wrong with the piece. Requested for a replacement, hope mine is a odd piece and wont affect long term reliability. As others are have also mentioned similar issues looks more like a production line issue rather than one off.  Hoping for a full rectification of the problem with the replacement. If it works its an excellent monitor esp for work and playing. Being a larger monitor text is larger too which adds on to the eye comfort.Edit: Prompt replacement in just a day, didnt have to wait as the pick up and replacement happened together.  New display has no issues so far."
4,"Using this monitor for 3 months now and here is my review,The curved screen helps for better vision when facing direct.Viewing angles on this monitor are also excellent.Interface is simple to understand and use.In the box VGA, HDMI and DVI all cables are included with good quality built (My favourite thing)Brightness is way too high on this monitor, I keep it in the range of 30-40%Its 1080p but pixels are slightly visible when user mode is changed to gaming or movie.These are the things which are imp for you to know rest part you can check on youtube.Overall its worth the price."
4,"First day review - Got the monitor on the next day after order, box was in good condition, after unboxing the setup was easy it only requires 1 screw to be screwed in. Setting it up connected to the computer and checking there were no dead pixels and very slight amounts of back light bleed (which is to be expected at this price range and screen size), this what i meant by luck as i got lucky with the panel where as your experience might vary given that there are older reviews where people have much worse panels.Verdict - As it is a prime guarantee product and if it has all the features that you need then get it and test it out you might get really lucky with the panel too if not just return it/have it replaced as there is nothing better in the price range if it works well.feel free to ask questions.Edit 1: found a stuck pixel so 4 stars"
5,"This is one of the fantastic monitors you get in this price range.Pros:-> 144Hz display(You will really feel the smoothness once you jump from 60 or 75Hz display).-> VA panel gives great contrast as compared to typical TN panel found in other budget 144Hz Monitor.-> Simply a great Gaming Monitor in budget.Cons:-> When in dark black screen you can see the panel is not A+ grade panel(Doesn't matter as normally you won't be in having black screen all the time).-> Doesn't have Vesa mount option, that's a deal breaker for many(Unless they are fine with low monitor height or can buy monitor stand)Conclusion: If you are looking for a budget 144Hz gaming monitor with Freesync/G-sync support  and no vesa support doesn't bother you, then its a no brainier . Simply go for it. Highly Recommended."
1,Within a month it started to flicker now... I was not expecting such a poor quality.26/09/2020 - Also bought a 32 inch... It's quality is very sub standard fully made of plactic... Jus the bottom stand is of metal. Also have noticed dead pixels on the pannel.
1,"With high hopes, keeping in mind the price to features ratio I ordered this 27""  monitor. Within a month of use it has developed dead pixel. I asked Acer service center for resolution, this is what they replied ""As per your concern, your screen pixels issue comes under CID ( Customer Induce Damage ) so it will not cover under warranty."".I have been using this monitor with utmost care, sitting on desk with APC UPS, no voltage fluctuations or any damage(physical or otherwise)What's the use of 3 year warranty???Don't go for this brand, better buy some other good brand monitor, even If you have to pay little bit more"
5,After getting my replacement of my damaged display monitors i am very happy and after one year of rough usage the monitor works liye the first day it is the best mid ranged monitor and i am very happy to buy theseThank you Amazon my love for you will be always there
1,"I bought this monitor 4 months ago and not gonna lie the product was pretty good until one day the monitors screen got cracked. Honest mistake right? It could happen to anybody! So i did what anyone would do and called the toll free to ask for non warranty service, since they said that this cant be done under warranty. I have tried calling various service centers of acer and all of them tell me that they do not service monitors. I called the HO and try to issue a complain and the representative called me to tell me that if i gave it to them it'll cost as much as buying a new monitor. Honestly, i am still paying emi for this crap. This isnt really a review on how the product is but even if you buy this and by mistake something does happen to it . Say goodbye to your money. These ppl dont care after the product is sold. Think about it before buying because multiple brands are there and they'll probably give you a better service."
4,"Great 144hz affordable monitor. The VA is amazing in terms of colour production as compared to a TN panel.I play CS, PUBG and APEX nowadays. This monitor does the job pretty well.Don't get confused with 4ms response time. It doesn't make much of a difference as you can't even tell the difference.In a nutshell,+144hz+4ms+freesync+VA panel+curved monitor (new but great experience)+great colors compared to TN"
4,"So for those wondering about 1080p 144hz on hdmi ( u can get it but this monitor doesnt allow) so to get 144hz on hdmi go to nvidia control panel setup custom resolution change it to 144hz ,and change the dropdown menu to manual and u can run 144hz on hdmi because theoretically hdmi should support 144hz .THIS MAY VOID WARRANTY(I AM NOT SURE) SO DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK . And enjoy 144hz on hdmi laptop users.So , about backlight bleed i didn't have any backlight bleed i got very good panel and colors looks good but black looks weird. OSD controls are very good . If you get bleeding panel or some defects replace it worth it for the money. In just got it today so i cant say anything about longevity."
4,"PROS1) 144 Hz. (not adaptive) (constant)2) Curved 1800.3) Good brightness.4) Has separate headphone jack.CONS1) Has an adapter.2) VA panel, so colours are not good.3) In box cables give out static to GFX card (sometimes).4) Only 1 joystick in the back, no separate on/off button.5) Top and sides 1 cm bezels, not good for matrix display.6) 4 ms displayGOOD for beginner gamersCan go for 165 hz 1ms display"
5,"I have been using this curved monitor for a sometime now.THOUGHTS: Keep in mind that the product is targeted to budget consumers so do not expect to perform like an expensive monitor.COLOR/ACCURACY: It's a VA panel with 4ms of response. Acceptable for its price. Brightness and color accuracy is good but little inferior to msi or samsung monitors that I have used in the past. All within acceptable range.Custom profiles can be set to users liking.REFRESH RATE: Through hdmi upto 120hz output is available at 1080p. Refresh rate also varies on the version of hdmi cable being used (hdmi 1.0 or 2.0). Through display cable upto 144hz is available at 1080p.MONITOR TECHNOLOGY (FREESYNC & GSYNC): Yes it's a free-sync monitor and will work with all AMD cards. It works with gsync too. However there is one minor concern that can be easily ignored (not to be confused with a defect). When gsync is on, I observed faint screen flickering when using cinebench or gigabyte's system information viewer (to control fan speed/temperature). Only the black, grey and white areas of the screen would flicker as long as the programs are kept open on desktop. Your mileage may vary.SOLUTION: Turning off such programs or minimizing them will stop the flickering till you open the mentioned programs again. If you wish no flickering at all turning off gsync (from nvidia control panel) would solve it completely. Again It's not a defect. The VA panel used in the monitor has not been validated by nvidia to be used with gsync (as mentioned in nvidia control panel). For more information check out videos available in youtube. Nvidia is aware of this and has already addressed it in 2019. No flickering observed when playing games or using daily programs or watching movies/videos with gsync on.BACKLIGHT BLEEDING: Some users complained of receiving units with backlight bleeding. It's not a manufacturing defect...not necessarily. Sometimes a design flaw can also be the cause. It all depends on the manufacturing standards how they want to channel the light on screen with minimal leakage to the sides reducing bleeding effect. Mine works just fine.Overall a good product to be used as a daily driver."
5,"Best VFM 32 inch 1440p 144hz VA panel on the market, atleast in the Indian market that is. Nothing of equal spec monitor can be had for below 50k. Better alternatives maybe had for even less elsewhere but in India an alternative  monitor like this with similar spec can only be had for around 50k. Certain buyers experiencing horrible backlight bleeding, luckily for me no such case here. no noticeable ghosting either. deep rich black with was not possible with my 24 inch ips display."
5,"Was very skeptical to get this due to the range of negative reviews, but after lots of research decided to take the plunge and was pleasantly surprised with the quality (although my expectations were minimal due to the price). As usual Amazon's delivery was fast, got it with 10% discount for 11.7k. This is undoubtedly the best <20k 144Hz Curved Monitor, nothing comes close with all aspects considered. For the price you pay, you are getting an above average monitor which is simply scintillating (assuming you can get past minimal issues which do not affect your everyday use)"
5,"144 hz, 3-4 ms, free sync (compatible with both nvidia and amd), 27inch curve, va panel all these things approx 20000 rupees. No dead pixel spotted yet. Might be best budget monitor for students or games. My personal rating arePicture 10/9 (due to va panels)Response time 10/10Input lag 10/8Brightness 10/7Value for money 10/8 ( indian sellers sold their goods at higher prices compared with international sellers)Refresh rate 10/10Free sync 10/10 ( i have 1060 and it still working as gsync monitor)Note - light bleeding is an issue  - acer provide it‚Äôs warrantyBest alternative- samsung cfg73 model, asus vg279q (alltho these high in price)"
4,Good monitor.. one less star for one stuck pixel
1,"Heavy Backlight bleeding, it's very irritating to use monitor for low light pictures,games,movies..."
5,This monitor is a treasure left in open to be explored !!Initially I was not impressed by either the picture quality or gaming performance.But as I explored and played with settings !I can say for certain that this is the best all round 1080p monitor in market right now !!!1. For fps gaming turn pixel overdrive to extreme.2. For best picture/text clarity turn off pixel overdrive and set colours to normal.3. For super sharp movie content like 1080p /2k/4k content follow these settings:  ->Do things in step 2 and follow rest from below.....  a> turn contrast to 60.  b> balck boost to 5.  c> turn on super sharpness.  d> use normal colour mode.  e> set brightness to 80%+.  Ezzz best possible experience ever........
4,"I'll keep this sort and simple. I'm not a tech reviewer, so I can't go into depth regarding blacks and nits, and other nitty gritty details a lot of you may be looking for. But I have been gaming for nearly two decades now, and this monitor is a freaking game changer.Set up was pretty easy, and apart from the display port cable that did not work out of the box, I had no issues setting this one up. However if like me, you do have to connect this monitor to an HDMI cable, set the refresh rate in your games to 120hz and NOT 144hz till you get a proper DP cable. My monitor kept losing temporary signal to my games till I dropped my refresh rate to 120.I've also never used a curved monitor before and was a bit apprehensive, but I was sold the minute I booted this one up. If anything, I started wondering how I've gamed on a non-curved monitor all my life.To test this monitor out, I ran the usual suspects like Doom Eternal and COD: MW, and they performed really well. Doom Eternal felt like a new freaking game and impressed me the most. I even tried out Division 2 and holy crap, that game looks mind blowing - especially during the night in New York. Finally, I loaded up some Forza Horizon 4 and didn't expect a higher refresh rate to really wow me, but damn, was I wrong. Racing through England's country side never felt better.Like many of you, I was on the fence for this monitor since I haven't read any credible reviews, but after spending a whole day with this monitor, I'm very happy so far. Guys I know have told me to hold off judgement for at least a month or so, so I guess I'll report back then. But in the meantime, I'm extremely happy with this purchase."
3,"There is heavy back-light bleeding all across the edges and cornersViewing angles are poor. Image quality is ok at 60Hz with a lot of tuning of image settings.At 120Hz it seems to switch to a TFT display mode and the colors are really bad.If you are looking for a budget display just for gaming, then this will do the job. Otherwise it is a waste of money...spend 30-40% more and get a better displayUpdate : Feb 2021Displays are just dumb mirrors of GPUs. After switching from gtx750Ti to rtx3070 and switching from an old hdmi cable to display port, I am able to get the maximum promised performance (144Hz@2K). Previously I used to get max 120Hz@1K and 60Hz@2K. Image quality is significantly better now with the 3070 card."
1,Pathetic monitor useless.It doesn't let me got into bios. Don't know why really did a mistake buying this really would not recommend it to anyone. First they send a defective piece and not I got a monitor I don't know what the hell is wrong. Seriously I can not my pc into bios from my old monitor but not from this
5,"Got delivered with in  2 days, decent packing pretty solid stand made with aluminium I think, more than satisfied with this monitor first time experiencing 144hz, iam using 1050ti with ryzen 5 1600 iam getting 100 to 120 fps average in every latest games at 1080p at low settings ( in box 1dp ,1 hdm,1dvi, 1 power cables available) I'll give more review after 1 month"
2,"Fully disappointed with the purchase, it has huge backlight bleeding issue, already replaced but same thing arrived, its using so called VA panel which I think is class B rated so the company offering soch a competitive price."
5,"I was sceptical about buying this monitor. As I read lots of bad reviews about dead pixels and screen quality issues. After lot‚Äôs of research i come down to three options aopen, lg ips with 75mhz refresh rate and Samsung curved quantum dot. Lg is cheapest one but it t has lots of bad reviews and has only 75mhz refresh rate that I don‚Äôt think as upgrade. Samsung one is too costly so decided to buy this. I m not sure but aopen and Samsung using same panels or screen technology . Brought this on diwali sale and wait for 20days too see if i come across any issues mentioned in other reviews. And i m glad that device is working fine. There are minor blacklight bleed but its not noticeable. As this one is not IPS panels is was worried about colour vividness. But when i test some YouTube video on this monitor i was impressed with its wide range or colour . Curve features of this monitor but is bit useless for at least 24‚Äù I guess if u buy 32inch screen it may feel more immersive with curve. Overall i can say product is good and definitely recommended."
4,Overall a good monitor for the price.Mine has one dead pixel but works great otherwise.
2,"This monitor is good only to watch HD videos and 2k videos or movies in a curved display. Will not recommend it for Gaming.I am using AMD 3600, GTX 1660, 16GB Ram, turned ON free sync and linked with G-sync as Nvidia started support all the adaptive displays. But game flickers a lot, if you have a AMD GPU you can give a try but you need also consider the backlight bleeding out of the box and black uniformity is not good. If you are watching dark scenes, it's messing up. I returned the product. You can check for Samsung 24 inch 144hz curved monitor on same price range or LG 24 Flat 144hz for same price."
5,"This monitor is just amazing for 11.7kPros:1. Great Colours2. 144hz super smooth screen3. Joystick controller on back4. Solid metal stand5. Curved screenCons:Only one: Doesnt come with vesa mount support.Other thoughts:Unlike many other reviewers, my model didnt have any backlight bleed issue. Also the review posted with backlight bleed issue is taken with full brightness(no one does that) and in a dark environment. When I do same as the review, I too see 'some' issues but not noticable at all when doing any other thing than whole black screen.Great deal I got there for 11.7k in a sale with debit card discount too. So I would advice you to wait for a sale as it happens usually every month."
5,"I have been using this for last 4 days and its a fabulous product. I am a programmer so will focus on that aspect. - For computer display, go for a PPI of 100 to 120 to have best readability of text. This monitor has 109 PPI and its perfect for reading text from 2-3 feet distance. - It has anti-glare but still does reflect some light but nothing problematic. - It has eye break reminder, low blue light, etc which is part of BenQ's eye care and they are fantastic to have. They are not just marketing gimmicks and they does help with your eye problems. - Looks for Display Pilot software. There are 2 versions available on the net. The new one doesn't provide much features for this monitor but the older version provides desktop spliting which adds an icon to each window for spliting desktop and I find it very useful. Note that you can use both versions at the same time and both provide slightly differrent functionalities. Windows 10 built-in split is not that good. - Speakers are ok. Audiophiles won't like it anyway but others can use it for all basic things like music, videos, games, etc.I am fully satisified with the product and would recommend it for anyone who wants to go for it."
5,"I have been looking for a 27 inch monitor in 4K resolution but most of them are above 35,000. So had to settle down for a 2K resolution or QHD which is decent enough resolution.Pros -I am using this for extending my laptop monitor as well as playing tata sky set top box as well. Both looks fine. I have also used it with chromecast and the video in the review attached is when I played a 8K video from youtbue which is good enough rendering. However the resolution and rendering of videos will depend a lot on laptop if you are using laptop to play the video.It was very easy to assemble and prop up. The resolution is decent enough but definetley with 4K monitors now available it is still up to par.It has a in-built speaker which is decent enough and good qualityCons -1 disadvantage is it was a shock when I saw the 16 Amp plug and this item is not returnable so was pretty dissapointed. It has not been mentioned anywhere in the description that it uses a 16 Amp plug. However luckily on searching I had a old 6 Amp to 16 Amp adapter and used this. Please don't buy if you have this restriction, however with the adaptor it is working fine and I think the wattage is pretty low for this monitor so should be safe to use as well, unlike home appliances which use 1000+ Watts. (See image for a 6 Amp to 16 Amp adaptor which i used. )Another con is the height is not adjustable but the screen can tilt front and back which is ok, still having a adjustable height would have been good."
2,16 A plug is a nuisance since you can't find it anywhere in your house . monitor is very good sound is low but okay  the problem is with plug that you can't find easily this kind of plug is only given for high power appliances . It was no where mentioned that this monitor requires so much power
5,"Benq EW2780Q 27 Inch QHD monitor is a great choice in this range. I am using it with a Macbook Pro 16inch 2019 model. Initially, I was getting fuzzy text, but then after playing withthe settings for some time, I got it right.This is good for a Work From Home setup.I have connected it using a USB C to Disolay Port cable.I feel that the clarity that I get by connecting to a windows/linux system is much better as compared to a mac. Still, its pretty much usable with a mac.Also, the speakers are surprisingly good.Great buy at 21-22k.Please note that the height is not adjustable and there are no USB ports in the monitor."
5,"I really stunned to see this monitor feature and quality , It may look bigger for coder in the beginning but later start to like the same . The most i love and unique is ""epaper"" , which doesn't there in any other monitor. I love to code and read on this monitor.  Thanks Benq. you are my life saver as i always wanted low blue light and epaper feature as I almost spend half of my life in seeing monitor"
5,"I bought this when there were 98 reviews. So naturally, I was a bit apprehensive about what to expect, but I was blown away by what I received.The picture quality is top notch."
5,Rates are jacked up by 2k for the sale!! and then they give discount !!! Have a great sale day.
5,"Good sharpness. Inbuilt Speakers are really good. Overall good monitor.Incase you don't need the inbuilt speakers, get something else with the same spec and you'll save atleast 40% on the cost"
5,"The below reviews are based on my usage after approximately 1 month & have included some comparisons with my other monitor Acer RT240Y(the left monitor is Acer in my photos), as both are similarly priced. Please note that this is a 2020 model for Dell, and mine was manufactured in March 2020. It comes in the box with HDMI cable, so that is a good thing for plug & play!Pros:1) This is E2420HS which the seller provides,which actually is supposedly a costlier model than E2420H, which is a good thing!2) Loved the height adjustment for the monitor (can be seen in the photos) which I don't get in my other monitor RT240Y. I liked this!3) Speaker of this monitor is surprisingly good! Of course,it does not have enough bass or anything for music playback, but for Skype, usual content, movie watching etc this should do very well.4) Packing for this model from seller is absolutely top quality!Cons:1) NO 3.5mm audio jack for the monitor. So can't connect to ext. speaker (I have that in RT240Y, so I like it better in this feature)2) The screen seems to be less vibrant with a bit over flashy white in terms of colour output. Liked it better on my RT240Y3) This is mostly nitpicking, but the monitor swirls sideways on the stand. I wanted the entire unit more Sturdy if possibleOverall, a good buy & I can definitely recommend. I am super surprised on the speaker quality for this monitor so that overcomes all cons for me personally."
1,"The product says it is made in India, but, in the box, it is mentioned that it is made in CHINA. Not sure why Amazon is lying."
5,"Dell E2420HS. Yes, it is E2420HS, as the product images suggest (but description is of E2420H). It is an awesome product. Side bezels are thin, has in-built speakers. There are no Display Port, but HDMI instead. We can use it as TV also, by adding ChromeCast hardware through HDMI port. Great deal..!!!"
1,"This product has 16 Amp input cable, which is normally available in Bath rooms and kitchens only.And worst part of Amazon is, they are not taking this product as return, they will only replace.Very very worst experience with Amazon and this product.It's loss of money for me.I hate Amazon for this and will publish this in all social media as much as possible, that how Amazon is cheating the customers."
2,"No It does not have a display port, wrong information by seller. The main reason for me to buy this is item two ports HDMI and DP , it does comes with only HDMI and VGA."
2,The placement of input ports - HDMI and power are badly placed - struggle to connect to input devices - mine also came with loose power port connection so with slightest movement the power would get disrupted.. Also no Bluetooth ports or anything and sound output is low .. not worth 10K that I paid for ... also had to buy 15 to 5 A. Plug converter to use in the house else u will have to unnecessarily occupy the ac/ iron plug points ... Make sure u have one before the 10 day return policy wanes away
4,"I purchased 24"" DELL monitor. It was delivered within couple of days and price was also very competitive. Easy to assemble.Two issues 1) The monitor came with 15 amps power plug which is not suitable for 5 amps power socket at homes. Fortunately I had 5 amps power plug from my old monitor that came handy to swap.2) Outer package was damaged at several places, however the inner packings [ looks like they were the original DELL packaging] in good shape and hence the package survived transportation. Not sure why the outer package is so much damaged for branded electronic items."
5,"I have been using this monitor in my office. this is very good for text based works, like coding in IDE or terminal. This does not create pain in eyes. It has speakers as well in it."
5,Picture quality is good. It's height adjustable and has both vga and hdmi port. Very good for office work.But they gave 15 amp power cable and vga cable was also missing. I had to buy both the cables separately.
4,Good monitor for daily use. Good feature of adjustable height. Using it just for an week now. No issues as such. Easy to assemble. 16a power chord provided. Please ensure you purchase a 6 amp to 16 amp converter before purchasing the monitor.
2,"display is good , but the in built speakers are not good"
4,Picture quality is good. It's inbuilt speakers are fine. It has one HDMI port and one VGA. It doesn't have USB and Bluetooth. It has height adjustable and tiltable features. Overall it's a good product.
2,"16 AMP plug provided, No VGA provided.. in this lockdown where will go and buy these two items and test it .. not expected from apparoretail .. very bad ... Spoiled complete experience.."
4,Its a good moniyot for the price offered. Suitable for notmal office wotk and entertainment purpose. Well built. Will lsst long for sure.
2,The power cable !! 16 A for a monitor for home users and no mention of it in the product spec as well.
2,"It comes with a 15 Amp power plug, now where am I supposed to go and get 15 Amp to 5 Amp converter during this lock down in bangalore."
4,LCD quality is not awesome but good
5,The ability to adjust the height and angle of the screen easily makes it an amazing buy.
5,Excellent so far and especially speakers as pointed out by many.
4,Very good build quality and picture quality.....Thanks Amazon for fast delivery....
1,Current supply  wire is not good to dell monitor it is worst
5,it is very good choice during this pandemic.
5,this monitor works very good
1,ok but not use printing  monitor  this  is low  wast of money
5,Worth money !
4,Nice
1,Received damaged product and they refused to accept return
5,Pros:1. Screen to body ratio = 90%2. Color reproduction is good.Cons:1. Stand is not that much looking good and is old model.
5,"Pros-+Picture quality looks decent to me, although it's my first monitor so I have nothing to compare to.+Goes upto 75hz even with freesync off+No backlight bleed.+Has nice color presets along a with blue-light filter mode+Viewing angles are good.+Build quality is really good, it has slim bezels but it still feels strong.Cons-Comes with VGA cable only, no HDMI.-Single HDMI Port.-Stand is basic and lacks height adjustment.Overall, I think its a good deal for <10k. 5/5."
1,"The monitor i bought stopped working after 2 months of usage, the panel is having issues and the screen is covered in red bands which literally makes is unusable.Tried contacting the Lenovo customer care, not able to speak to the representative.Kindly let me know how to avail the warrenty."
5,"Very good VA monitor. The side/edge bezel/frame is very thin/slim, it looks kinda cool. Height adjustment is not there, only few angles tilting is allowed. It has AMD Freesync, it is useful in Gaming.  I bought it for both office work and occassional games. I watched HD 1920x1080 videos from youtube, the video display is crisp and clear. For the price of 10k, it is very good monitor. Shipping was in its own box, no extra packaging."
1,"I use a spike guard that connect all my devices - a laptop, TV, speakers and this monitor. The moment I plug this monitor, my laptop starts giving a shock. No shock when I remove this Lenovo monitor. I tried multiple iterations and I'm sure this monitor is the culprit.I don't understand the technicalities but this is a very dangerous problem. I stopped using the monitor."
4,"The display is perfectly adequate for everyday use. Although, If you are planning to use an HDMI to connect to the display then please ensure that you calibrate the panel once you start using it. Out of the box, my picture quality was completely washed out and it required some tweaking in the settings.If you are a Windows user you can access the appropriate settings using ""Start > Calliberate Display Color"" after that just follow the instructions. That should help any problems with colors being washed out. Alternatively, also update the display drivers just to make sure its all working fine and up to date."
5,"Satisfied. I needed a bigger screen, working on a 14 inch laptop was getting painful. This monitor served my need. Being under 8k after discount was icing on cake."
1,The product has been barely used for 2 weeks and the monitor has started showing multiple coloured lines across the screen and now is not powering on saying ‚Äúpower saving mode ‚Äú . Amazon says that since it crossed the initial period they don‚Äôt take responsibility whereas in this instance they should take ownership . Lenovo numbers have no clear direction on how to solve it and the retailer must take action immediately
5,"Amazing product. We use it for watching videos, lectures, PDF viewing, attending meetings etc. (Not for gaming) and it is amazing. The HDMI port faces the ground so that nothing comes in the way of the wall mount. This is VESA compatible and has wall mount option of 100x100mm. Powe cable is 1.5m long roughly."
3,"I am using BenQ monitors for a long time now and decided to buy Lenovo this time. Picture quality is not as sharp as on my laptop screen or BenQ monitor. Black color is not true black. It is a good monitor for office work/email/documents/web surfing, but if you want to watch movies or other video content I would not recommend."
5,Good monitor. The stand maintains good balance though the screen size is big.Input toggle button is available to toggle between HDMI and VGA source.It has 4 wall mount holes of 100x100 standard.I got the Zipp wall mount for this and it is matching well.Works well with Chromecast also.Only thing is It's made in China. :-(I was looking for non China monitor with wall mount support which I did not find on Amazon. So I had to go ahead with this model .
5,"Im not a techy; just an average person who wantd an upgrade his system..i was sorted in terms of of the cpu i just needed a good large screen to help me with my stuff..i mainly do a lot of multimedia editing so ,the monitor is just awesome,im getting crips visuls,amazing colors, no deffects..and im totally satisfied...lenovo has done an amazing job nd Amazon has been a great experience since day one.."
5,Amazing picture clarity.. been bit feared about crack in screen or dead pixels.. but faced none of them.. good packaging.. done the setup with Amazon basics table mount... Together it looks too good... Bezels are too thin and monitor looks unique.. finally relief from using 14 inch office laptop screen...
5,Received without damages. No leakages as well. A decent monitor. Value for money. I trust lenovo. I bought it cause my touch screen laptop gave me headaches. With this I can work easily.
5,Not a gaming monitor if you want a true gaming experience. A work horse that'll stand you in good stead.
5,This monitor has has a nice wide screen with a clear picture. Be careful with it though. I'm not sure how robust it is. I like the fact that it can tilt.
4,"Its a nice product overallI got it for Rs.7750 range.pack include a VGA cable and Power cableIt has HDMI, AUX cable (no inbuilt speaker) ports as well, so that in worst case it could use as tv.Quality is good"
1,I am not at all happy with this product. Bought it for TUV certified eye comfort but it causes bad headaches and eye discomfort. The text often is hazy and difficult to read - this is a big challenge given the long WFH working hours. Please  don't waste your time here as the  product  is not worth your piece of mind.
5,"Extraordinary LED at this price.No LED model or brand can beat this.I used 10-12 different led in my last 20 years of IT career, non was like this."
5,Awesome Product in budget üòç
1,Not a good product. To revive this screen we have to disconnect than connect. Not useful
5,"I liked the display. Using it as my 2nd monitor. Good design, no issues found till now."
5,Product quality is good and i'll share my final review after 3 months of use.
5,Best gaming monitor ever. Been using for more than 2 months and played all most every games. If you're a gamer go for it. Refresh rate is awesome. Smooth display during gameplay. No backlight. Best for budget.
3,Picture quality is bad.Average monitor for averages user.
4,Very elegant and does not strain my eyes and perfect monitor for as senior citizens DR. Prakash V Diwan 72 years
4,"Value for money. Go for it. Using from past 1 month, no problems observed yet."
5,"It's very good product it's exact how I had expected, this review is after usage of more than 2 month, just for it"
5,Great picture quality
5,Yes
5,"Overall a very good monitor. Colours are good. Picture quality is excellent. I did not like the stand though, little shaky."
3,Not too bright....looks yellowish....not white screen...have tried different settings but not working
5,After a lot of research bought this product. Worth the price for use at home
4,Look is pretty classic ! One thing u should know that u can't rotate it's screen ! Like towards right and left nor up and down !
4,Overall value for money.Only thing is hight not adjustable.
3,Good productGaming-3.5Display-4Value for money-4Overall good product
5,Really good 24 inch monitor for around 8k
3,"Did not recieve HDMI cable, only VGA cable is there . Picture quality is definitely not HD"
3,Good one
4,Quality is good
5,Being a gamer...i needed a monitor and this came in..i took it...so here is a small review. The monitor is nice. Its good lookinh the picture quality is good (note: purchase it if are going to game all day long. Don't buy it if you are going to watch movies and all) The refresh rate is good. Its written 21.5 inch its 22inch.Pros :VA Pannel quality is really good.Not soo much blackbleeding.Good Refresh rate.Hardy Built.Good amount of ports.Anti-glare coating is perfect.Cons:Viewing angles are sometimes terrible. (But still great for a VA pannel)A WEBCAM can be provided.At last of are going to buy this for gaming go for it..and if you are buying this for watching movies and all dont go for an IPS monitor.
5,"Out of the Box colors are not good..I had to manually set the colors with Nvidia panel...VRB set to extreme loses lots of colour details its set to normal for best...75hz refresh rate is good....Blacks are deep not grayish. ..I have nvidia gpu so no freesynce ......Display is finger print magnet.....Cons...The monitor buttons are hard to use it is recommended to download display widget software from Acer site....VRB lose brightness and colours..there is ghostig too.New..I changed the rating to 5 star from 4 star.This mobitor is really...Unlile anyother I see.No backlight bleed and No VA glow..deepest black you ever see.I actually order another one, will receive It at 28 aug..Then my build will be complete."
4,"Excellent gaming monitor. Came with a VGA and HDMI cable. Running great with 75hz refresh rate. Very crisp and rich display, looks amazing while playing games!Edit: After using for some time, I found that there is an issue with using AMD FreeSync on this monitor. Apparently the refresh rate used for FreeSync does not work well with HDMI and needs a DisplayPort which is missing on this monitor, so we need to turn the feature off otherwise the monitor starts showing black screen for any game or application running in full screen."
3,"Gaming:-Buy this monitor for gaming if you don't care about your eyes. To achieve 1ms (measured 1.7ms MPRT though it isn't mentioned in specification whether it is GTG or MPRT) response time it uses VRB. Which is a new technique to reduce response time by strobing back-light and that makes eye strain.Other than Gaming:-It has a response time of 12.7ms without VRB. And watching movie also a horrible experience. YouTube, NetFlix and Watching movie isn't recommended according to my experience.Real Bad thing:-What I was not expected from this price point of VA panel Monitor is ""Color banding problem"". It happens to lower color bit depth of monitor and in specification nothing mention about bit depth or color bit. At windows display settings it shows 8-bit but appears like 6-bit. By ignoring this problem color performance is very good, exceptional color performance for VA panel.Good thing:-The Black Level which is very Impressive. No back-light bleeding of panel glowing like IPS panel. Black are real rich black. I watched some HDR sample from YouTube which was amazing. Color is really good and should not have any major issue with professional work.I bought this for the black level. I tried off of IPS glow and Gray Black."
4,"Great for the price, the viewing angles are pretty good considering it's a VA panel. Colours out of the box are pretty horrible but after doing some colour calibration and setting the gamma to 2.4, the screen looks pretty great. Just increase the saturation for all colours by 10, and set the gamma to 2.4"
5,"Got the 27inch monitor for Rs 8800 after the card discount. No defects or issue found with my unit, although tamper protection from one side was broken. Writing this review after 10 days of usage.Things i liked about this monitor - 1. Best bang for the buck (27 inch monitor below 9000 rs)2. Decent built quality, plastic quality feels nice & robust3. No backlight bleeding4. No Ghosting5. 75Hz works flawlessly6. Good contrast ratioThings that needs to be improved1. 1ms VRB is a marketing gimmick, you wouldnt be able to use VRB as it makes the screen dark2. Color setting needs to be calibrated out of the box3. Monitor wobbles slightly4. 72% sRGB color gamut (Not to be used by designers)5. No audio out port from monitor / no inbuilt speakerOverall, if you get it for less than 10k it is an awesome monitor. For budget build, close your eyes and take this you will not regret."
5,"I have been using this product for about a month. This is the 27inch monitor from Acer.This is a decent product for the price range of about 13K. I use it for coding as I need a bigger screen to have multiple editors on them.Overall, the Youtube 1080p videos look sharp and clear. There are a good number of tuning knobs to suit settings to your convenience. The 75Hz display helps in keeping images sharp.The HDMI and VGA connectors are good too.  I'd recommend this product without any second thoughts.Although if your desk and room permits, I'd recommend a 32 inch."
5,I think if you are on a tight budget and want a gaming monitor for your setup then this is best asPros --Zero frame display-Blue light filter- easy menu and setting- 1 ms response time- 75 hz refresh rate- colour are also nice- v stand design looks amazingFor me this is the best monitor on this budget so no cons from my side.There is no -backlight bleeding or dead pixelAlso i had a acer monitor which i bought in 2011 and its still working so i trust acer more than any other company.At last this is the best monitor for gaming in this budget
4,Love it connected to my laptop this was worth the purchaseIt's generally 75hzCan be overclocked to 76hz nothing more1ms response time1080p vn displayColours not badShipped proper and came the next day even doe it said it would take 3 days I'm happy üòäVery fine bezelCan be mounted on a vesa arm.
3,I dont know why... But there is a gap between display and the body of the display. U can push the display inward to fill that gap but that is not permanent. Overall display quality is gud but if u are lucky enough to get the product without any manufacturing defect. I will upload the photo for reference.
4,The new monitor out of the box had a loose parts inside rattling and the screen was coming out of the top left corner.......therefore had to return as replacement product was not available
5,"Good for gaming only.Don't watch movies in it as the VA panel is not so good for it.AMD freesync is really nice with my rx590 GPUScreen is a fingerprint magnet, Don't touch the screen.it's  Stand is badass looking üëåGood packingColors are not so vibrant as in ips display, but it's in budget at least."
5,"I had the Samsung monitor up until a month ago. Then I moved cities and couldn't carry the Samsung with me because its rod seems impossible to dis-assemble. This monitor is easier to disassemble. I use these monitors for ps4 gaming, so my review would be based around that.Picture quality: Firstly having a curved Samsung monitor makes no difference. Your eyes will not see any difference once you are immersed. It is easy to set a desirable picture quality on the Samsung, but this Acer monitor has many different options. So one has to really fiddle around to get desirable picture quality. After setting 50% blue light and Ultra Sharpness, I do believe I am getting much better gaming picture quality than on the Samsung monitor.Weight: The Acer monitor is quite bulky. It is literally twice the weight of the samsung monitor. The Samsung monitor is lightweight and can even be placed on one's bed. The Acer needs a table.Design: Unlike the Samsung, this Acer monitor is not curved, but it looks more premium due to its bezel design and V shaped stand.Ports: This Acer monitor has 2 HDMI ports and a VGA port. The HDMI ports can switch automatically based on which input is powered on. I would have liked a audio out port like the Samsung had."
3,"Nothing much to write home about. The ghosting is an overblown issue in my opinion. In case you're affected by it, you clearly have a rig capable of running things at 75Hz in which case you can afford a better monitor. The blacks (after tweaking) aren't even deep as a smartphone IPS but way better than my TN laptop. I wonder how worse it would've been with an IPS monitor when most reviews talk of blacks being great on this machine. Then there is banding, which makes things even sadder. The viewing angle is sub-par. Even viewed from the front, there is this ugly gamma gradient which shows up real bad on a grey screen (note they aren't as bad as in the photos - duh, cameras vs eyes). The cons aren't a deal breaker only because I work mostly on the command line. Though a part of me died on opening Blender and I've resorted to a pure black theme to compensate. So if you're a non-fps gamer who doesn't play games with plain grey scenes, then it'd be okay. Otherwise go for something better. Really, shell some money on a good monitor because this is a once-in-years purchase and you'll regret it.TLDR: Decent blacks. Ugly gamma shift. Color banding. Not much ghosting as some reviews say.EDIT: The gamma shift issue seems to affect all VA panels. Thus not a product specific issue per se. There's also current (AC) leaking via the HDMI ports."
3,"EDIT: I was really happy with this monitor only after a month, I have realized how screwed my MacBook's battery life is after using this on HDMI. Apparently, if you use an HDMI, Macbook's graphic card kicks in and HDMI pulls images at a full refresh rate, even though nothing has changed on the display. Display port pulls images only when the image actually changes.. Now my Macbook's battery life has gone from 10 hrs to 3 hrs on battery. Can't return my monitor now.. üòûI use it for work and sit really close to the monitor, so I use it at the least brightness. I saw little backlight bleeding web the black correction was set to 5 / 10. After I set that to 0 as well, no bleeding whatsoever! (Basically, the backlight is off üòÖ). In other scenarios, there's a little backlight bleeding, as expected from LCD screens.This is really important for reading text as backlight bleeding will make it difficult to read the text on your screen. #programmer üòÖI didn't connect my PS4 yet, so can't review this for gaming."
4,"simply wow , Great display only downside is no speakers or 3.5mm jackü•∫, had to buy seperate converter to get sound from Xbox one 1 star less for no sound outputIt supports AMD freesync on Xbox and I think it will be same on ps4"
5,"Quoting ""Gaming"" in the title might seem redundant but it's far from it. This is not a mockery of the claim of the seller, the monitor is in reality an excellent gaming monitor and there are no doubts about that. As mentioned in some of the prior reviews, that the product they received had some defect in them like dead pixels, a crack here, etc., so the first thing I did was checked for any faults so I could raise a replacement request straight away, but thankfully it didn't come to it.It is difficult to find a monitor this big at the price at which it is offered. I suppose the manufacturer was able to cut costs by using a VA panel instead of an IPS one. There's a lot of confusion related to the panels, but the most relevant points to care about are:1.) IPS Panels have a better viewing angle. This doesn't mean that the VA has bad viewing angles, actually far from it, it's just that it's not on par with IPS. Besides, if you're buying a monitor, a fair assumption would be that you'd view it sitting in front of it, so the viewing angles aren't really important. I checked the monitor from different angles and it looks fine to me.2.) VA panels have better contrast ratio ergo better picture quality and better blacks compared to IPS panels. Pictures with a dark background are viewed much better on VA panels so that's a bonus as well.I'd like to highlight some of the things I liked and some minor gripes.What I liked:1.) Screen Size: This monitor is huge, I don't know what I was expecting when I bought this, but definitely not what I'm seeing right now. It's almost on the verge of the TV territory especially from up close. Prepared to be treated with delight playing on this. It would definitely be hard to go back to a smaller screen size after getting used to this mammoth of a screen.2.) Picture Quality: The Picture quality is phenomenal. I'm basing this after playing a couple of games on a PS4 (I bought this to play my PS4 on). I don't know much about the technicalities, the images in the draw distance are clear, the closeups are very detailed, there is no motion blur or choppiness in fast paced scenes, the response time is good and the gameplay is fluid. I tested both games running on 30 and 60 FPS. It's such a shame that a majority of the games are clocked at 30FPS on a PS4 so I can't really see the true power of this monitor, but oh well, I'd get a PC soon and then we can see.Some Minor Gripes:1.) I wish the monitor was height adjustable. It's tilt adjustable so that's good. I have a chair where I can adjust the height and recline so it's not much of a problem for me personally.2.) Out of the Box settings are quite bad. The Gamma is set to 2.2 which should be 2.4, the temperature is warm which you would want to change to Normal and Cool, depending on your preference. Calibration is required to find your fit. I haven't calibrated mine but plan to do so. Downloading the Acer Desktop Widget app is a pretty cool way instead of fiddling with the buttons.Overall, I'm very satisfied with the purchase. The picture quality when using as a regular monitor is not as crisp as I have seen on other monitors smaller in size (It makes sense because the pixel density in a big monitor would be lower), but none of that matters when you load up a game on it because there are absolutely no compromises there."
5,"I have a 1650 super and I needed a small monitor within 23"" size categories, as I can't play on big screens. And for my requirements 1080p resolution was enough. I have a custom resolution of 1800x1080p on this system where most of the high demanding games either give me 50+ fps and mmorpgs give solid 75 with cap enabled. For example Destiny 2 gives me solid 75 every time while Witcher 3 is buttery smooth. I will upload more games snapshots once I have them. But at the moment let these 2 games snapshots do the talking."
5,What a product man! You will instantly spot the difference between 5k full hd led and 8k acer gaming led.. difference is huge truly value for money! Build quality and sharp design added rough gaming look to my setup..it will come 59hz by default..set it to 75hz by windows display setting by going into advance display setting! Maybe i will help some buyers! And download acer widget tool from acer site for easy monitor access..good day
1,"its audio not working, can anyone tell me how to play audio from monitori have connected same via hdmi cable"
4,"My experience so farSize:-21.5 inches is more than enough for me, although there is a 27 inch option.Display technology:- VA panel with deep blacks but bad viewing angles. The color accuracy is also fine for the price.Brightness:- 250 nits is good enough for my basic use with less ambient lighting, but might not be enough for you.Performance:- it has a refresh rate of 75 Hz and a natural response time of about 21 ms because it is VA, but acer has used 'VRB' technology to achieve 1 ms, but brightness will reduce significantly.Price:- The best price to performance I have seen for a monitor in some time.As long as it is between 8000 and 9000, it's a really good value.Conclusion: Recommended for casual gaming and basic use, but if you are planning anything more than basic work, look for IPS panel monitors for work and movie watching and TN panels for faster response times."
1,So the monitor is not the sturdiest. The screen plastic is bulging out from the top (weak adhesive) but this was from day 1 so I didn't bother with it.But 3 days ago screen started flickering and showing that black dead spot.Upon contacting the service center to claim warranty they asked me to show the BIOS screen as proof that this is not a windows issue.I mean c'mon! I know they wanna give a thousand reasons so that they don't have to do a replacement but that is just down right stupid. So stupid that it sounds like they'd say ANYTHING callous to delay the warranty claim process as much as humanely possible.
5,"A very good monitor for the price with a refresh rate of 75hz, supports freesync and 1ms response time.Includes power cord, HDMI cable and VGA cable. good packaging. Does not have speakers..."
1,"This monitor is not at all like the product described in the description. The colors are not at all accurate and good. I would have rated 0 stars if the option was available. The angle of viewing is also not great. You have to see it from the middle. The black color is grayish.If you are buying this monitor for gaming purposes, do not buy it at all! I rather suggest you buy IPS monitors which have accurate colors.Overall the product is ok, if you do not care much about the colors then it is a must-buy.The colors can be changed according to your need."
5,"I received this product on the 11th of April, here I'm writing this review after using it for more than 3 weeks.What I most like about this monitor is,1 - First it has a good viewing angle.2 - Good picture quality3 - At this price, you're getting a 75hz monitor with a 1ms response time in VRB Mode also with AMD FreeSync.3 - Another good point about this monitor is that it comes with a warranty.4 - It also comes with 1 VGA cable and 1 HDMI Cable which I mostly liked.Overall I'm satisfied with this monitor, as I purchased it for my office use. Till then there is not a single problem, also I forgot to mention packaging was super good.I hope this review will help any user to buy this product or not."
5,Better than Samsung..Value of money....Build quality of the product is very good enough for this price range...No one is better than this 27 inch product in this price range...Contrast and risponse time is as specifications....No colour bleeding in this panel....Don't think twice ..Do order .....Thanks Amazon for your service..
5,"I won't go into tech specs. But the monitor will not dissappoint you. It's VA panel, but you'll hardly notice any difference in quality.I use it for programming. Texts are crisp and quite good.(-) It wobbles a bit on the stand, but that should be fine for 27 inch monitor.I would highly recommend for an affordable 27inch monitor."
5,"i purchased this monitor for my xbox one x ,i have 55 inch 4k tv ,as a gamer ,i prefer playiing on monitors for better experience ,colors are amazing ,contrast is super ,deep black are black,i am in love with this monitor !! thank you acer and amazon"
1,No audio input/output available nor a inbuilt speaker is there...  If you thinking of buying for ps4 don't..
5,"I am a avid ps4 gamer and have had 2-3 cheap budget gaming monitors around the same price as this, and without a doubt i can safely say that this is the best purchase i could have made, this monitor has an amazing response time amazing color quality and most of all it has a lovely screen, with a very minimal budget, if you have a budget between 5-10K i highly reccomend you to buy this product as it's just amazing, well so far on this ive used a PS4 Slim and a nintendo switch, both seem to work flawlessly and when it comes to playing on the ps4, games like call of duty run on a steady 60 fps with rarely any FPS crashes"
5,"Its6 perfect. I don't see any shortcoming as some are saying about this. It's a perfect for casual normal work. Good bright colours with good viewing angles too! (nobody sit in a diagonal position in front of the monitor)Overall, the best in this price bracket. Not much of a difference in IPS and VA. Both looks same. It's just if you place both the panels side by side, then only you'll feel slight difference otherwise it's VA panel is as good as IPS.Go for it!"
2,I bought this product in March 2020 ...at first i was only using Vega 11 integrated graphics hence I thought I am Facing a lot of issue with Anti aliasing in games bcoz of Poor graphics card..but after updating to Rx580 ..anti aliasing is even worse ...You can play any fast fps games smoothly bcoz of low texture quality and Ghosting is insane in this monitor

4,"So I'm using this Monitor from last 3month and its decent, currently as my Primary Monitor I do lots of video editing and graphics things, and it's good. viewing angles are good. Good colors and contrast etc. on that price I recommend everyone this monitor becuase also the Brand Acer is very good. but for gaming dont buy this."
5,"No words to say,this is perfect monitor for gaming and movies also,the panel is awesome,,and edge to edge display looks so stylish,,build quality of monitor is awesome,, especially we can see all dark hidden objects very clearly in the dark (mainly in games)"
1,Don't Buy it if you want this for work or for your business purpose. This is good for gaming and movie as well. But the right and a left side portion have too much brightness. I had too much tried to set RGB for that but still not gone brightness.
3,"I would have bought a different one if I had a choice at that time, this was good value for money. Overall a good Monitor although do not like the power source."
5,"This monitor is really awesome go for it. Good Monitor for the price range 11K with 27 inch. Checked everything is really good. Eventhough, it is  gaming monitor, i dont use much much for gaming, just for general purpose, but still this is really good."
5,"Likes - Liked overall product and quality of the product for programming and office work as well, adjustable neck.Dislike - It is nowhere mentioned in the product description that there is no audio speaker attached/in built  in the monitor . Height is not adjustable in the stand of the monitor"
4,"This 27 Inch Monitor is a great choice for video editors as well as gamers. But as far as gamers is concerned its refresh rate is 75 hz , it will be better if it is 90 aur 120hz in this segment. Response Time is 1ms that's why I bought this. Overall a decent buy"
5,"This LG monitor is very bright. You can turn down brightness to ease viewing. This is a TN monitor so viewing angle is limited, however I found the viewing angles are sufficient for working on a table and doing office work or studying. May not be suitable if you are thinking to buy it for watching videos/movies from bed or sofa etc.Monitor is sturdy, the buttons work fine you can choose to keep power LED indicator on or off. I have changed it to on, by default off is selected. The VGA cable is ok but power cord is thin. Also the plug is a power adaptor itself, So it takes up more place than an ordinary 3 pin plug. But the monitor stays cool as the power supply board (SMPS) is outside monitor housing.This is not a HD monitor. It has resolution of only 1366x768. This was a common standard 10 years ago. In 2021 when YT is streaming 1K, 2K, 4K videos this monitor can't make use of those HD videos, as it can show only 720 p videos and all higher resolution videos will not improve quality over 720p. In 2021 a non-HD monitor at 5299/- (I spent) is bit over priced. This is a compromise with viewing quality, similar sized monitor with 1600x900 or higher resolution will have more clearer pictures.Final verdict is This monitor is suitable for study and office purpose. So, for students and office workers it serves its purpose pretty well.But, if you have money to spend, then go for a FHD IPS monitors for better picture and video quality, for better and vibrant colour reproductions and for wide viewing angles."
5,"Good for office purpose. Screen is Little bit brighter and can give pain in eyes on constant working, however one can decrease the brightness and use it for office purpose."
1,picture quality is very badonly usable for office work like excel and web browsing
5,"I bought this only for ‚Çπ4299 .This is tiltable you can adjust as you wish (up-down)This will give you high definition performance (I'll not recommend this for gaming)If you are on a tight budget like I was(below ‚Çπ25k)Then buddy this is for you.Wait for the price drop, no need to rushGrab the item once it comes under ‚Çπ4300 or less."
5,Excellent product on this price...u can buy this product on amazon onlyy for best packing and best product...
5,Value for moneyMust buyPicture quality is good
4,"Dont expect much more. in this price range. this is good product. but, not BETTER product.if your budget is low. you choose. this one is OK for daily usage. and build quality also good."
2,"Display only 1024*768 not 1366*768 ,delivered not actual product"
5,Good product with timely delivery
5,View is cinema-scope. Good for viewing Movies. Since this is desk top for computer(not TV) squire frame/view will be good.
4,Only VGA. No HDMI. Quality adequate but not as expected.
2,"Very bad experience, I hv received it on 6/5/19 but it is showing lines and blocks on display...since 11/2019. I want to get it at least repaired by you from which I hv purchased it please help"
1,"Amazon services are getting deteriorated day by day, I asked them for the replacement for the defective monitor they told me they will not and asked me to contact LG even before replacement time"
1,there is a problem in power section and power is not come to monitor at the first day of purchase besides it is not a HD product.HDMI is absent.don't buy this
5,"I don't know is there any screw in the back panel of monitor or not, I haven't got any screws. Packaging is good and product also."
4,Good product and service by Amazon
4,"I bought it for a cheap price, and it's the best for the price it was offered. Obviously it won't match the high end moniters which comes with the high price tag"
4,I have been using the LG monitor since last one month. It is a good product not faced any challenge yet. Suggest for everyone who all are working from home.

4,Good
1,This is very primitive monitor. It do not support higher resolution.
4,"Although i did plenty research on every aspect before purchase, but eventually have mixed feelings.Pros :-- Very beautiful sleek design! (As good as Predator series, a major reason why i chose this! And it takes very less space compared to those old roundish bottom flat monitors ehe... its looks are a killer! :) )-- Anti Reflective Matt Coating is effective.-- IPS Panel, so wonderful wide viewing angle. Truly 178 degree horizontal and vertical, many people can see.-- Important Connections : Display Port 1.2, HDMI 1.4 , Audio Out Jax (good thing they didnt waste money on waste speakers like rest), so you can make it a TV with added speakers using HDMI and Audio Jack.-- Actual response time is 5ms, which is decent for an IPS panel.-- FREE SYNC! Trust me, MUCH better than Vsync of even best GTX1080ti! (only Gsync could match it), Say good bye to screen tearing. And hopefully AMD FREE SYNC will get NVIDIA off their high horses huh... I aint AMD fanboy, but we really wish fair competition instead of Evil Monopoly!-- And hey, brightness was surprising all right! i thought this 250 nits will be much lesser than 300 Nits i was used to on laptop and old LG19inch but 250 nits is well spread, screen bleeding is minimal)-- A lot of Controls! Yeup, i like being able to totally customize every aspect, and this monitor gives you A Lot of options! (even 2 3 4 screens on same! Although the control button is like Old Nokia mobile 4 way stick, but so far so good...)-- And it does work at 75hz! (unlike what other ppl claim thats only FreeSync feature for AMD), i used on GTX1050ti OC.-- Balanced pricing for features it offers.Cons:-- ALAS! The Color Accuracy, contrast is NOT As good as i imagined... duh, my biggest and only disappointment i guess, my old LG19 Inch Flatron has better color! huh, i wasnt hoping this from IPS panel which boasts 72% on Adobe, and same on Color Gamut... Its not bad but just not great, so lets hope, i can get some color calibration so that it becomes as good as it boasts!-- Lack of Tilting or Twisting-- No VESA support or Height Adjustment (atleast VESA MUST be there, then you can mount on stand and adjust), i took this as known compromise, still if you have worked on height adjustment, you will miss it.-- AND REMEMBER! If you go to 1080p from 720 or even 900p, then you MUST have stronger CPU and GPU! Or else, screen Tearing etc will be unbearable!-- And 1ms Motion Blurr is arrant nonsense! Trust me, you are much better without it!And other things like Power Consumption etc are normal for IPS Monitors at this price range.And btw, i got from Appario, the product was nicely double packed! (yep, double pack). With warranty card and bill. Clean new piece.So i wrote what i could remember, a bag of mixed feelings.. but overall, 4/5, and i am staying with it.."

1,"EDIT: I had to edit the review and give it 1 star instead. The one star I took is for terrible service from LG. My monitor has a white spot from inside the monitor screen, LG refuses to honour their warranty. So I contacted Amazon and even they refuse to return the product now as it is out of return date. I feel like I wasted my Rs.12,000 on this damaged product.I attached a picture of the issue, monitor has a big white spot from inside yet LG refuses to fix it.My old samsung had a blue line issue and they replaced my monitor in a week - no questions asked. So this 3 year warranty of LG is useless, beware. I suggest you to avoid this product and look for a Samsung monitor instead.Original Review:Quite the average monitor but a little overpriced for what it actually delivers. Sad part is that it is so overrated here in other reviews which is making more people fall into buying this monitor.First of all let me warn you that the seller Appario Retail Private Ltd is sending used products. I received a monitor with damaged display first, then I asked for a replacement and received one with scratches. Looking at seller reviews many other people have said the same that they received used products so I reported to Amazon but no action was taken but I'll ask you to avoid that seller.Now I'm stuck with a monitor with scratches even on the front of the display but I'll review the monitor ignoring these issues.‚Ä¢ The quality of the monitor is pretty average. The display gets too sharp on few colours which makes you see the pixels on screen with light colours such as the blue of twitter. Every time there is blue colour on screen you can see horizontal and vertical lines all over them (pixels) which can be quite annoying most of the time. Surprised that not many people have talked about this in their reviews, googling shows that this is not my piece of the monitor but but every version of it with the same issue.‚Ä¢ All the ""gaming"" features are just gimmicks. 75hz, 1ms response rate and other stuff just doesn't work as intended. The monitor really is running at only 60hz most of the time while gaming if you're using DSR. 75hz works on 1080p and 1ms response rate mode flashes the screen badly making it completely useless. I have a nvidia card so couldn't check freesync but I doubt it's quality would be up to the mark either.‚Ä¢ The only good thing I can say about this monitor is the design. The top portion is very slim, the stand looks good so in terms of looks, monitor feels good. Apart from that, I don't really see any positives about it.‚Ä¢ Monitor also faces the issue of ghosting on 2D scenarios. In 3D it works fine but in 2D there's ghosting whether it's 2D games or a 2D animated video that you're watching.‚Ä¢ I tried to register the product with LG but their website doesn't work properly either. I contacted their support for help and haven't heard back in 2 weeks. I can only imagine how bad their service center would be in case this monitor needs repairing.Final conclusion: I'm very disappointed with this monitor not only because I received a used product but also because the quality of the monitor is average at best. LG service is terrible and I wish I went from something from Samsung instead. My old Samsung monitor has been going on for 9 years now and it required repair once long ago during which time Samsung's service was excellent and they repaired my monitor within days.I'd advice you to avoid this monitor and look for alternatives."
1,Very good picture quality. Very bright display. Has a Backlight Bleeding on the bottom left corner.  Yet to decide whether to replace it or keep it.The box was very slightly damaged. No damage to internal thermocol or product. Very good stand.2019-10-04: My replacement came and has si better than my previous one. I do have a slight backlight bleeding on my right side but better than my previous one.  I will keep it.2019-10-12: Found a dead/stuck pixel in the second monitor too.
4,Is a very good quality monitor for Indian gaming community. Pictures quality is excellent. Best refresh rate. Gaming look monitor . Thank u amazon for best price
5,"Best monitor for gaming within limited budget,i have been playing cs go dota and many modern warfare games since 6years and i have been changing monitors on and off but i bet that this is the best monitor in this range of budgetThe only DEMERIT of this monitor is that it shakes a bit when you do a drag with your mouse as an awper i feel this is the only thing that needs to be rectified."
4,"Bad:Background bleed on the bottom left side of the panel otherwise good ips panel,The on screen controls are not working for me for a month now it worked in the startReally bad stand shakes when you move mouse or type hard in keyboard1 ms is a gimmick it will tear your eyesGood:Good 75hz monitor nice for CSGO etc.Value for money is pretty good.Thin bezels feelsgoodmamIps Panel,viewing angle are great"
5,"Really loved the product what i get in 9500 after the discount. This is best monitor in this budget, I have upgraded my old samsung full hd monitor with this, Really like the picture quality of this monitor, it look awesome with v shape stand. I am just missing the wall mount system but its ok for as you can see the image i have uploaded i have made custom glass using studd stand. I am graphics designer as my point of view this the best option available in this 24"" inch monitors with the best price thanks LG and Amazon.."
1,"This monitor could have easily been the top monitor if not for its white banding or pixelling on Blue and orange colors. Its hard to explain.Imagine you take a magnification lens and see the pixels of the monitor , thats how it will be when the monitor shows blue or orange images.Once you start noticing , your cant unsee it .. Period.It really makes the monitor feel like its from 2009 , a decade old CRT monitor like..It has very good features like amd sync and very good brightness and color reproduction - TOP notch.Wish it didnt have this issue.Got it today and returning tomorrow , cant stand that pixellation effect."
4,"For someone looking to do color-critical work with a bit of casual gaming on the side, this is great but for competitive Esports titles like PUBG, Fortnite, Overwatch, etc. this might not cut it, as this is an IPS panel on a budget it has a slower response time compared to a TN panel, the 1ms they advertise is just marketing and if you increase the response time there is ghosting, the actual GTG response time is 5ms, besides you need a 144Hz monitor to enjoy those games anyway,Now for the technical sideEven low end GPUs like the GTX 1650 super or RX 580 are capable of pushing frame rates well over 60FPS in most titles, so there is a bit of screen tearing as the refresh rate is capped at 75Hz, tried overclocking the display but it doesn't seem to go above 75HzThis is a Freesync display but it also has adaptive G sync support as well, so even if you are using an nvidia card it works, but you have to connect it via display port and not HDMI, so you need to buy another cable for that, the monitor comes with an HDMI cable only and you have to manually turn it on in the nvidia control panel.To sum it up, for a tear free experience you have to use both adaptive sync and v sync simultaneously in some titles, which locks your frame rates to 75Hz. So I would suggest adding a bit more and getting a 144Hz panel over this."
4,"Assembling and getting it to work took hardly 10 mins. Quality is good.There is no external speaker. Only headphone female port is available.Once you connect, audio will automatically switch to the monitor speaker which is the headphone output. Have to manually change the setting in your computer' audio settings to get it to use your computer' speaker.HDMI cable could have been more lengthier."
5,"Edit: So after I bought the product, I have been monitoring it's price, and the next day after I got it delivered, they decreased Rs 500 and sold it for 8,499 + 10% card discount .. Now I checked the price again on 15th November 2020 and the price increased to Rs. 9,499 . So be careful when you're buying it . I don't think it's worth more than 8,500I've been using this product for a couple of days now, and I'm happy with it. Got this for 7.6k during a sale, which was much less than other products of similar specsPicture quality , brightness are good, no issues. It's 75Hz , which is rare to find in this price range. 75 is just a slight difference from 60Hz , but still it's better.I saw a couple of YouTube review and Amazon comments complaining about backlight bleeding, but I have not experienced even a slight bleed yet. Maybe backlight bleeding is for defective products. There is some colour difference that looks like backlight bleeding on the corners when I'm taking pictures, but it's not visible to our eyes.Overall I'm happy with this product, so 5*  ."
4,"Was surprised by the size of it. Its big. Got it for very less cost compared to other sellers.Superb gaming experience. Needs time to get used to it if your previous monitor was smaller in size.Only issue (maybe not an issue), need to keep game settings as borderless window for full screen. Nearly all games i played required me to do this."
1,"This monitor worked fine until the return window closed. One day after the return window closed, a vertical line appeared on the screen. Tried contacting LG support but they sent a mail saying everything is closed and contact later. Don't know how to proceed. Very dissatisfied with the overall buying experience."
4,"Overall, an excellent monitor.- Supports HDMI 1.4, DisplayPort 1.2 inputs- Supports 1080p at 75 Hz (need to enable Freesync in monitor settings using it's inbuilt buttons, to enable 75 Hz. Doesn't actually require your computer to support Freesync, just some weird monitor settings.)- Pretty good colour reproduction (doesn't come colour calibrated, but looks pretty good out of the box).- Variable refresh rate - Supports Freesync over HDMI and DisplayPort AdaptiveSync. Does NOT support Gsync. I heavily recommend using a DisplayPort cable with this, VRR just works for both AMD and NVIDIA. Range is 40-75 Hz which is very good compared to most other VRR displays.- Has a 3.5 mm audio jack, but audio quality isn't as good as your computer's audio jack.- Heavy backlight - bad for watching dark scenes in movies, TV shows, games. Otherwise it's not a problem.- Matte display : Good low-reflection display. No problems with indoor lights - haven't tested outside in sunlight.- Excellent for use as a desktop monitor, and for gaming. Except for dark scenes, great for watching video as well."
5,"Firstly wanna Thanks to Amazon for there lightning fast delivery got it on very next day of order and in proper packaging,The product quality is superb, as its an ips panel viewing angles are amazing getting 75 hz refresh rate in almost every game tried cod infinity war, sotr, battlefield, pubg, batman ak, witcher 3, gta v and Assassin's creed, one thing wanna talk about is black stabilizer it automatically detects the required areas for it overall outstanding monitor if you are using gtx 1650,1080, rx 570 or 580 then go for it, if are planning to update you gp card in near future then i will recommend for 144hz monitor as they are capable of such refresh rate as i think the product is bit overpriced..Thanks hope this will help you guys to decide..Over and Out"
4,Great monitor with some noticible backbleed.picture quality is good..and if you bought this for colourful games like FORTNITE then you don't worry about backbleed as it's not even noticible ..it disappears completely
5,"Awesome product.Go ahead. I see negative comments before purchasing but after purchase it's totally different. Please ignore the Amazon comments.Pros:Bright, Large enough screen, SuperB display Quality, Better screen response time.Cons:You can't adjust the height. It's fixed.Rest a good product to buy in such price range."
3,"Pros:+ Power saving mode+ I got it on a deal for 10k INR.Cons:- Can't tilt the monitor- Can't find a monitor stand that can hold its wide legs/stand- Can't use alternative monitor stand, to serve above purposes :(- I personally find it a tad bit brighter even when I reduce the  brightness to its min most. I'd like dim monitors for less eye strain."
5,The product is actually pretty good considering the price and actually has very bright and dense colours but i think the brightness is low comparing other monitors in the same budget.And i have seen many reviews reagarding the border bleeding and white spots mine has none but it may have one on yours so I think the its a manufacturing defect.All in All its a pretty good monitor
4,"I bought this for around 9K in Dec 2020, and had a scare when the monitor delivered had a lot of ghosting on the screen.  Tried everything under the sun to check if it's a software or cable issue, but eventually did a replacement via Amazon, and luckily the new monitor had no ghosting at all.  Phew.I use this side by side with my laptop monitor - which is a 14"" laptop.  It's quite a shock to have this larger 24"" by the side, and already at the ""limit"" of the contrast in sizes IMO.  I earlier had a 20"" monitor (some 10 year old model) and that was a good ratio.  I would not recommend folks buy a 27"" monitor to work side by side with your existing laptop monitor as the size difference would be excessive.This monitor itself is fine, I just wish I could place it a lower position.  But it has no vertical height adjustment, so I have no choice but to leave it as is."
2,Folks.Please don't buy this if you need to wall mount as no options.As far the quality I didn't find it great.I had great faith in Amazon to provide me support as an exception but they are not useful.Come on Amazon I bought this from you please value the customer..I expect someone from Amazon sees this as this is my first review in years.A catch I want to spread was to see the refund policy which we miss..It cleverly says you are stick with this product.This changed the whole online shopping experience for me.The guys at Amazon are not helpful...#Bad experience
4,"The BEST monitor for this price range!Ive been playing on it for over a month now, no light bleeding, Amd freeSync works well.It has a 5ms response time and 1ms motion blur reduction, do not get that confused.I played games such as overwatch and fortnite from my Nintendo switch and have to say there was a huge boost in performance from just a TV screen.It has an extremely easy to use software and also has a feature to use a mouse to program it through the on screen application though overall plug and play.A lot of people go on Youtube and see the review by some person who says it has light bleeding and other issues but that person has a defective piece, and is not ready to believe it. It lost a star as you cannot adjust the viewing angle.It has an overall sleek design and has nice red accents on the stand.Really recommend it for budget gaming setup!"
1,"Bought this thing 2.5 years back. Turned out that most of its advertised features are just gimmicks. Viewings angles are good. Dark scenes are not enjoyable because of LED bleeding. Now after 2.5 years, I started observing damaged pixels. The LG customer service is really bad and is trying to avoid getting my panel replaced by giving pathetic reasons. Its been around 3 weeks and they are also not contacting me, even after I escalated the situation.Don't buy this product."
5,"Great for the price. The picture quality and brightness is enough. I bought it for gaming and so far it's pretty nice. Also, if you're looking a monitor for gaming and confused whether to go for this or any 144hz monitor then trust me instead of spending 16-17k on any other monitor buy this one and spend the rest on your RIG. It'll be no different unless it's not you first time and you've already used monitors with above 75hz refresh rate."
5,"First of all, forget about gaming lets talk about screen quality for a moment, it is amazing.It has an Anti-Glare display which reduces most of the reflection (Good for those who work in a bright environment).I Bought IPS Panel Version there is one more with a VA panel but I prefer IPS Over VA.75Hz Refresh Rate will gonna Feel Smoother if you're switching from 60Hz.But I Didn't feel that smooth because I have used 144Hz. But still, 75Hz with 1ms Response Time is a good deal for budget Gamers.This Monitor Has Joystick Control For Settings (Like Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, More).It has 3 Input Mode (HDMI, Display Port, VGA)Overall Product is Amazing I m Gonna Give it a 5/5 Rating.About LG Brand there is nothing much to say because we already know who is ruling the display industry."
4,I purchased this morning last week it looks good but whenever you want to watch dark sean black wallpaper there is a issue of color bleeding on corners i opened it and loose the plastic part but spend 1000 or 2000 but HP 22 series that is best it has light bleeding issue that only visible in dark or black wallpaper rest is ok  only dark mode have issue rest its ok
4,"Pros:1) IPS Panel produces best pictures.2) 24 inch size is perfect, never too big or small.3) LG Brand gives confidence.4) Tested it for 1 hour, no backlit bleeding.5) Got a brand new piece with plastic covering intact.Cons:1) BIGGEST PROBLEM IS IT STAND, it fumbles a lot and not steady enough. I use a mechanical keyboard, and the screen moves even while typing :-(2) Got it with monitor packing itself, and there was no additional protection given. Although I got it in 1 piece."
5,"Pros :# IPS Monitor.# Beautiful sleek design.# Less Spacious.# Excellent wide angle viewing (True 178 degree for both horizontal and vertical).# It works 75Hz.Cons:# The contrast, I think, is not as as I noticed.# Deficiency of adjustment of Tilting or Twisting.# The Stand should have been more sturdy.# VESA support for or Height Adjustment should have been there.# 1ms response time is not found though it is absolutely not required.In one word, this is Value for money with the features."
4,Got this product in 24 hrs after order and started using it . Assembly is very easy and quick . The stand takes very lil footprint and looks awesome.. monitor is nor height adjustable but tilt can be adjusted..there is no wall mount or table mount support though. I dont need either so its ok.The screen is good for all sorts of uses and there are a lot of modes n customisation possible with a single joystick..Color reproduction is good when i compare with a couple of different screens side by side . Havent used with any heavy graphics game yet so no comment on that . Also didnt see any screen bleeding or pixelated blue bands as some reviews have mentioned .Overall first impressions are its a decent monitor at a good price and for most day to day use its looking apt .
4,"Amazing product definitely go for it at this price point. (Bought for 8.5k)Although it doesn't have VESA support4ms response time1ms motion blur is ridiculous, screen flickers way too muchIPS panel is just amazingOnly has 60hz refresh rate for VGA input but has 75hz refresh rate in HDMI input so no complaintsCrosshair and black stabilization very usefull in gaming."
1,"Bought this product in August 2018. After using the screen for less than 30 to 60 mins every day, keeping it well maintained and free of dust, I noticed two dead pixels in November 2019.I changed my wallpaper to a solid white background an noticed the two pixels.As i usually have a dark wallpaper, I have no way of knowing when these pixels went dead."
5,"This product gives you everything it promises. It may be an IPS Panel but man is the picture quality breathtaking. I play CSGO on it and the picture quality, framerate, and black stabilization were so good that they brought tears to my eyes. It does not have a USB Port or Any type of inbuilt speakers Or a Webcam for that matter. But overall such a beautiful and amazing monitor."
1,"This monitor has pixelation issue, uneven brightness. Freesync works not good. Even with good frame rate, the bottom 10% has some different kind of tear. It is neither good for general use nor for gaming. Panel is not properly secured, tiny insect got inside the space between the screen and outer layer. You can get better ones from other brands. It seems like LG have the habit shipping low quality panels in India."
5,"Honestly, I took a leap of faith when I ordered this as I saw some mixed reviews regarding the backlight leakage. But, it tempted me for the features it was offering in the given price range under 10K and being associated with LG brand.I was glad that the product has worked perfectly for me with no issues whatsoever. The picture quality is amazing with lot of presets inbuilt for different game genres.I am enjoying my time with this item. Only downside being too much brightness during browsing internet esp for the white background webpages which can be moderated in the custom settings."
2,"Pros,,good Colournot much backlight bleed.good vieweing anglesCONS:A PANEL DEFECT...There seems to be a panel defect in this 75Hz IPS Freesync monitor or similiar panels.Blue or orange colour seems to be grainy or pixelated making it look  blurry.Ex: windows icons, youtube thumbnails and many other places you can notice.Searched the internet & it seems that most 75hz IPS freesync gaming monitor are having this defect."
2,I will tell pros and cons straight away:Pros:Nice Picture QualityBrightness is goodFreesync Feature is available which is a plus point.Cons:Very delicate to handle.Bottom of stand is made of metal.Review about my received product:Amazon packinging were lowere than quality packaging. But main issue is that I received a defective piece. As I opened it from the box it had an scratch on top left corner backside of monitor (scratch on backside is shown in 1st image). That part of display were backbleeding (backbleeding example is given in 2nd image).Otherwise I had no problem. Now I am replacing this product and waiting for new product to receive as I ordered for replacement. Let's hope for the best.
5,"Amazing Gaming Monitor from LG at such a pocket friendly price.Notes:1. Good, sturdy stand (height not adjustable, just tilt, +15 to -5 degrees)2. Matte finished screen, anti reflective, but sometimes you'll see a bit of backlight at bottom corner for pitch black image3. Smooth video performance. Tried with Assassin's Creed Odyssey4. Colour dynamics are also very good, you'll see what is expected to be seen from an image5. Supports HDMI, Display Port and VGA port, all pins go perpendicularly at the back, which prevents you from sticking the monitor to the wall6. Has variety of settings for different game types like FPS, RPG, Racing, etc7. bazels are slim, but not as slim like the monitors from AOC but its much better in performance8. 75 Hz refresh rate is not that easily observable, but you'll definitely see difference if you play the same game on your TV (60 Hz) and this monitor. Also, 1ms response time is advantageous for FPS games.Overall: Great Gaming-Monitor for such an average price."
4,"Excellent product, very crisp picture quality and responsive.I don't use it for gaming, but as a secondary monitor to work on large worksheets. The crispness of the text and easy menu has made a big difference to me.My primary monitor is a standard Lenovo, and i was finding it difficult to use it due to poor picture quality."
5,"I was looking for a monitor for coding and my office work. This is the best product for 11k. Has 1ms repsonse time, LED display, perfect size (24 inch). It comes with HDMI cable. One issue is that this monitor doesn't come with 360' rotation. It also lacks height adjustment, although it has an angle adjustment option. Also not use super resolution setting if you aren't gaming, it just makes test too sharp. The laptop in the pics is 13.3 for comparison"
3,"I have researched couple of days and found this product better for me. I'm a C developer who needs to read and write text all days, and sometime I play games too, but not much graphics intesive games.So I needed a display which can fit needs of best display and some gaming capabilities. This display looked better but unfortunaltey I have got faulty product.This could be just bad luck with this peice, otherwise specwise monitor looks really good. Also physically it looks sleek and decent. Thin bazels looks very premature, I you can't lift up the monitor by bazels.The 3 star rating is not acutal rating, as current product is under return procedure. I would order again may be same or other.Also I have seen when I have ordered this product that almost all of the reviews from foreign countries and everyone written good things about this monitor which tempted me to go for it. Seems Dell sells low quality stuff in India or careless for quality control.Anyway thanks to Amazon, product returned immediately. Now I‚Äôm going with Samsung."
5,"Great monitor, sound quality is average.Got 16amp plug and had to buy 5amp plug cable at local store. Cost 200 rs from pocket."
5,"It a great monitor. It comes with a 16amp cable however it is not necessary to use it. You can use a 5-16 amp converter or like me, use a 5amp regular cable and it works just fine."
5,Both the picture and sound output of the monitor looks decent as per the price range where it‚Äôs competitor Lg with same specs failed in delivering sound output. With speakers built in I don‚Äôt feel any need to buy separate speakers. Only con is the 16amp plug which can be resolved.
5,First I have ordered lg monitor.again I think order cancelled. Then purchase this product.Dell is very super clarity and awasome  display.long time working don't effect for eye.so beautiful worth from10k. I have purchased Amazon paylater method 6month dues system.amazon paylater very very useful for middle class people.so iam like to Amazon service.
4,"Nice product, good it comes with builtin speakers.. only thing to improve is to provide 5 or 6amp power connector rather than 16amp which is not required for this power consumption.  Rest it is nice product."
5,The monitor is awesome but The package came with 16A plug which is big one...I don't know whether we can use 6A power cable
1,Do not order this item as this product will not work without additional power adapter that has to be bought. Amazon wasn't of any help.
3,Good picture quality & nice glare but vga cable was not available
5,I'm using it for my official purpose. Clean and clear picture. Good deal in this price...
4,One star less for 16Amp power socket. Rest everything is wonderful.
5,"super monitor, good for work, movies and gaming."
5,Good
5,Very nice monitor. ONLY drawback it has come  up with a big power plug.
4,Dell product was very good.Delivery packing was not good.
4,GOOD BUT EXPENSIVE
5,Very nice product for IT guys who do wdh and it also supports google chromecast so you can use to play videos from your cell phone
1,"Pros:Colors are good enough but over saturated even after calibrationviewing angles are excellentNo dead pixelsno ghosting if you change the settings properly....Cons:not suitable to watch moviesIt only comes with a display port cable ,if u want to connect to a laptop you have to buy a cable  separatelyBottom bezel gets slightly warm ,update: bottom bezel heating is a problem, waiting for a refund ,its taking forever to get a refund ,really bad service by amazon.:("
5,"Coming from 4k 60hz 24""(LG 24UD58-B), I was concerned about going 32"" 1440p as ppi would be much less, but after using 32GK650F-B, I can surely say 1440p looks gorgeous on 32"". Who cares about ppi when text and image looks good enough.In current day and age, 1440p 144hz is the holy-grail for gamers, which is even better on 32"" inch with fantastic LG VA panel for its deep blacks and 3000:1 contrast ratio.What LG 32GK650F-B gets right?1. 144Hz‚úÖ2. 1440p QHD‚úÖ3.

5,"Awesome. Upgrade from 60hz to 144hz. Super smooth gaming ,browsing. Don‚Äôt worry about dp cable,i am installed monitor with hdmi cable and got 144hz,just enable 144 in your display adapter properties in pc, also can enable in games. And u can check it is working on 60 or 144 in your monitor settings press monitor keys.go for it. So sharp panel. Love to play battlefield 5 on 144hz can see every detail. Very high details.Also one more thing:‚Äî- lg Sony Samsung are way better than acer aoc benq. I got in 15499."
1,"Dont buy this product, my screen broke from inside in 1 month and now the LG Represetative are asking me for 17000 to repair the screen. I paid 22000 for this screen and they want 17000 on top of it. Stay away from LG and this screen. I dont usually leave reviews but I have been scammed, so dont buy this screen because you might get scammed too!"
5,"Great monitor, compatible with g-sync also."
5,This is an awesome monitor FOR THE PRICE ..It is hugeee and along with 144hz this is the best buy...Make sure u have enough desk space... I sit approx 2 feet away from the screen
5,"As an TN Panel you might need to adjust colour settings according to your need after entering all the settings display looks very nice, 144hz with 1ms response time is üëå. Also freesync with NVIDIA G-Sync compatible, for enabling G-Sync you will display port connector. G-Sync is not available over HDMI."
5,"I got it on on18th Oct 2019, Ordered on 16th Oct 2019. Got it for 21k (22k-1K cashback) during Amazon Festival.The product is on point, amazing display. Upgraded from 23 inches 120hz 1080p Samsung IPS Panel.I am really enjoying this VA panel. G-Sync Works. Colour Accuracy is good, Overall the display is one of the best used.Ps- 32 inches is big, make sure you watch/play from a distance.Don't even think, this screen is a steal even till 25k."
4,"Top_reviewerSeller:  Appario Retail Private LtdPrice:  22549/- (Before discount 24252/-)Delivery: 4 days, Prime, BangalorePackage: Well packed, but packing reveals the contents inside!!!Returnable: NO, only 10 days replacementWarranty: 3 years--> In 10 days replacement period, please use as many hours such as about 60-80 hrs if possible (Monitor has usage counter). Most problems appear in the earliest hours of use so that you can initiate a replacement!Note, this is a VA Panel, NOT TN.  Picture quality wise still IPS wins. Limitations of IPS panels are response time and refresh rates, which is why TN panels are preferred by some gamer despite compromise on picture quality. VA panels stand somewhat in between TN and IPS, without compromise on picture quality much lets you enjoy both the worldsIn Box contains CD (for manual), Monitor unit, Stand set, Display cable, power adapter set,Important Facts:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~‚ô¶ This is a VA panel, picture quality is better, good viewing angle than a TN‚ô¶ Typical Response time is ~8ms Grey-to-Grey, max being 4ms (1ms is for motionblur reduction, NOT Response time); TN panels are really faster‚ô¶ FreeSync and 1ms Motion blur CANNOT be used at same time, anyway I didn't see 1ms MBR any difference!‚ô¶ 144Hz and 1ms MBR works together‚ô¶ With QHD, 1440p you need a good GPU starting from GTX 1060 or GTX1660 at least‚ô¶ 144Hz is smooth and very noticeable for window dragging, mouse but watching movies or videos no difference‚ô¶ Playing on 144Hz for games are good, but unless your GPU pushes beyond 100 FPS, this monitor is of NO BIG DEAL‚ô¶ Didn't feel need for 4K, pictures are reasonably sharp for 32""inch dimension, plus 4K needs a beast gpu!‚ô¶ HDMI mostly on current devices caps at 60Hz, so Laptop holders don't even imagine 144Hz monitors!‚ô¶ Slight blur at the corners are noticeable (if you lean left and watch the right side)‚ô¶ 4 level of adjustments (Height, Swivel, Tilt & rotate), programmers can rotate 90 deg and read upto 200 lines of code in one stretch!Tested on my RTX2060, games such as Crew2, Forza Horizon 4, Just cause 4, Project Cars 2. All I could get was ~70-110 Fps with max graphic config.

1,"First order, product came with a dead pixel, returned the product, received another, and it was flickering, so many hardware issues, i think they are sellong defective products here, all these people' here are complaining before too, but i didnt listen and bought it, now they are saying they will refund my money when they receive my product. But if you get a working piece of it, it works so fine. Cause wih one dead pixel it was workig fantastic."
4,"Don't let the reviews fool you, it's just an ok monitor, it's not the best, but it's also not the worst.The backlight bleed is horrible, the colours are ok, but you won't be making any use of it for content creation. It might have audio output, but it lacks decent volume and it's not a combo jack that means you're gonna have to connect your headphone/headset microphone separately, I find it much better when connected to the motherboard directly. HDMI + DP input means that you can use multiple systems without the hassle of changing cables every now and then (HDMI for your console or any other media device and DP for your pc)FreeSync works fine, and if you're using an Nvidia gpu you're gonna need a DP cable to make it work as Nvidia doesn't support FreeSync over HDMI.The stand is robust, but if your fan is directly above the monitor and is running at full speed it's gonna wobble quite a bit. I got it for around 15k, so I can say it's ok for that price. Would've loved at least one or 2 usb outputs or at least a better audio output. Comes with an HDMI cable, I don't use it I've got a good quality Q3 cable that works flawlessly.Gaming experience was good, no screen tearing thanks to FreeSync, pretty good response time for competitive games, I enjoy playing CSGO, Overwatch and GTA V and have no complaints with my gaming experience.Update: got a dead pixel so filed for a replacement, will update when the next unit arrives."
5,"Using this display as a secondary monitor strictly for gaming along with my LG 34UC87.Pros:1.1080p 240Hz and other bundled features sweet spot for gaming.Simply no nonsense interface.Gsync compatible no matter what Nvidia says.Using it with 1080ti.Buttery smooth -Siege/PUBG (Pc & Lite).2.Flexibility of placement on your desk (portrait/landscape), Height adjustable.3.Price.240Hz at this price is a steal any day.4.Cables bundled-DP/HDMI.(Would use a DP for 144hz n above though)5.Design.Hate it or love it  Red n Black Theme.6. I am more inclined towards 27"" 1080p 240hz against 24' 1080p 240Hz.Bigger the better.(better head visibility?)Cons:1. Color.Wont use it for any other purpose other than gaming.Don't get me wrong here its pretty decent for gaming but for movies, photo/ video editing I stick to my other monitor.Definitely recommended for gamers."
1,"Ordered frm appario Retail and the unit i got has whole display screen bleeding, color calibration out of the box is so trash, Opted for Replacement and got another defective unit which has Red stuck pixel on Left side, Worst display panel by LG. update : tried DOTA 2 with gtx 1060 6 gb and even with display cable when turned on gsync, dota 2 had screen tearing and ghosting, Not for dota players, I had to refund."
1,"While the monitor is fine, the seller appario retail is sending the same faulty unit over and over again to different customers. My package had labels from atleast 3different shipping seems like and when I tried to use it it did not work on display port. Avoid Appario retail for this monitor"
1,"Got this monitor because of the good reviews.Works well for gaming and in general, but the first one i got have noticeable black light bleed.So got it replaced by an other one and when tested for black light bleed even the this one had it.In the end had to opt for refund since i couldn't settle for a monitor which has black light bleed out of the box."
5,"Absolutely amazing monitor. For some 32 inch is bit big. Make sure you have enough desk space before purchasing it. This is an VA panel. Which has some good and bad thing too. Out of the box color is not Accurate, you need to adjust a bit to get the best results. Set the Black level to Low, color temp to cool & Gamma to mode 1. With gamer profile 1. This will make the colors much better.Now, don't expect this to be as good as IPS Panel when it comes to color performance. But as I said earlier it has its own unique good advantage.Good things...‚úÖWith this VA panel you can get amazing level of blacks. I never seen better black level on any monitor before. It's simply amazing. If you use monitor in dark room then This is the one for you. Because of the 3000:1 contrast ratio black levels are pure black, no or minimal Back light bleeding which is great for watching movies and games which has dark scenes.‚úÖQHD resolution in 32-inch panel is similar to 24 inch 1080p in terms of PPI. So it's really crisp and clear you will love it. Just make sure you got enough GPU power to handle it.‚úÖ experiencing 144Hz refresh rate is actually amazing. Coming from 60hz I can say this is something every one should experience to enjoy. Not only gaming even on desktop while using windows UI or scrolling is buttery smooth.‚úÖwith this monitor AMD Freesync works great with Nvidia GPU'S as well. (Series 10 and beyond)Not so good things...‚ùå Viewing angles are not that good. Honestly if even you sit properly in the middle you will notice color shifting and dark areas on the edge of the display because 32 inch is pretty big for and monitor. So if you sin on the middle still edge of the display will be far from Your FOV. It's not a deal breaker but it's something that sometime really annoying. For up or down or side this panel doesn't show Accurate color. Color and brightness always shifts a bit. Not a big problem of you sit and watch from middle. For best viewing angle you have to get IPS Monitor.‚ùå overall colors are not Accurate as IPS, though it's depends on your preference. For me I like more Deeper blacks and high contrast for gaming and movies. Acurate colors don't matter for me. What matters is which looks good on screen. That's why I love this monitor. But if you are doing photo editing or multimedia works then this is not for you. Get the IPS Panel (10 bit if possible) which has Accurate color but average blacks.‚ùå No HDR support. Though with 350nits of brightness HDR won't work good. But still better than nothing.üî∞Overall I can say I enjoyed watching movies and playing games on this big screen. With HDR support it would have been a perfect purchase. If you don't care about HDR or super Accurate color then go ahead and purchase it. Tested with PS4 also and loved it. Colors are punchy, super bright display. Big size with high refresh rate with Freesync ang G-Sync support. What more could you ask?‚ùìMy personal experience : I received a nearly flawless unit from Amazon. No BLB, NO dead pixels. Manufactured 06/2020. imported 07/2020 Great service from Amazon and seller appario retail private Ltd.BUT I noticed that on my unit the bottom bezel gets too hot after few minutes of use. As much hot like I couldn't touch it without hurting my fingers. That was the deal breaker for me. I got worried it might even catch fire."
5,"Absolutely my best purchase from amazon. And nothing can go wrong with LG IPS panels, the colours are too good. Only thing is, not a cons given the price is 36k, the brightness seems to be a little on the lower side making the HDR10 worthless. But then if you want HDR in this, you have to shell out a hefty money.Pretty happy with it. Also, some people said that the DPI is low for 34 inch, believe me, without a magnifying glass or binoculars you wont notice that."
4,I will not go long in this one....You can read my first review I wrote everything .Almost after 30 days of usage.At first when I upgraded from 60 hz to 144 hz things while practicing were so amooth and in main games also....In main games while so much is going on having so much fos ...at first I was unable to track people (talking in fortnite) knew because of the new refresh rate...After 2-3 days I became used to it...it helped me getting more W and kills my Ratings have gone up on worldwide ranking...... You'll get the advantage if your good enough and you think your hardware is holding u back...go for it...you won't regret....I will buy a 240hz as well wink winkThis monitor is actually amazing ...Worth the money...Never thought of it as a bad decision.
5,"I waited a long time for this monitor: 31.5 inches, 144-165Hz and G-Sync.Must say that I use this monitor as the main device. Perfect for gaming. If you want to do video and photo editing with it, it should be said that you can use this monitor for ""normal"" home use. But you shouldn't expect miracles. Of course, this can't get to other UHD resolution and IPS panel in the market which will cost you 1.3lakhs. But it wasn't built for that.Also, a monitor at almost 32 inches doesn't have to be curved, in my opinion. I now have two of this size on the table and am very happy with it. The monitor is right in front of me and the size is just perfect for me.Positive:- no pixel errors- very well lit.- Colors are okay, (AMVA) Va panel is typical- G-Sync is a dream. Always had problems with tearing on Ubi-soft titles- 144Hz or 165Hz üòä- 31.5 inches üòä- short and clear menu tour (you can quickly find your way around)- Cables are all long enough for me (monitor is right next to the tower)Neutral:- yes, on the edges the picture looks a bit soft. You can see it very well on a white background. A curved display would probably help. But not disturbing for me. In the heat of the moment, you don't give it any meaning or it is not visible.- yes, the USB ports on the back (unfortunately for me) are not quite as suitable. I personally would have preferred a side mounting to quickly connect a stick or hard drive. But here too you can remedy the situation with e.g. a USB hub.- yes, the setting options for color, gamma, color profiles, etc. are very limited. Nevertheless, the picture is completely fine for me and that says someone who has a monitor with IPS panel with 100% sRGB coverage as a second device.- FPS indicator for displaying in the game is missing (I would have liked). But here I use MSI Afterburner and can, therefore, display even more data.- Different profiles cannot be created or saved.For me, however, the ready-made profiles are enough for gaming and nothing else this monitor should be able to do for me.It is a monitor for gamers and for me it fulfills it 100%."
5,"This monitor is truly a blessing for people who want to run multiple applications at the same time along with the best gaming experience which is fueled by the Nvidia Gsync.You have 2 game modes to choose from and it allows you to adjust the other settings including HDR, Power lED light, response time, etc.The packing was good and took less than 5mins to assemble and it's height-adjustable as well which is the best part of this monitor.Overall- very good monitor- if you have the budget, go for it."
5,Fabulous Monitor.144hz works like a charm and I cannot go back to 60hz now.Everything is so smooth and colour reproduction is also fantastic.Go for it and you will not regret buying this piece over its peers.I bought it for 15490 and the next day sale got started and the price went down to 14490 but I am not unhappy as it is way better than similarly equipped monitors from other manufacturers.One word- Awesome.
1,"Worst white balance ever I saw .. it‚Äôs not showing red as red.. also I see pixel distort..I really don‚Äôt know how people rated this product as 4+ stars..  I have other LG monitor , where I same picture with good colour but when I switch that pic to this monitor red . showing as pink.. I tried all the colour correction nothing worked.. and about pixel distortion not able to do anything..It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt come with dp cable only HDMI cable is provided in box.."
5,"I mainly ordered this for my xbox one x as an alternative to TV. It totally supports 120Hz at 1080p though xbox games are capped 30FPS but due to 120Hz you will definitely notice the smoothness. Picture quality is also amazing and overall you will be satisfied. If you have more budget I would totally recommend to go for the 27"" display as you will get 1440p @120Hz. Also for the records, I used the HDMI cable provided with the monitor for 120Hz display and it's working fine.Games which I mostly play are MMOs such as Division 2, Destiny 2, Cod Warzone, etc.PS: I also tested this monitor with my PS4 as well and great results with variable refresh rate.Good purchase! 5/5"
5,"Prosthe monitor is cheap and better than 40-50k monitor asus 32XGV where i have test at my personal experiment asus is just 1% extra than lgAS far i have test all 4k, 2k and 1080p at 60hz compare another monitor 144hz as clearly 2k 144hz is clearing winner and better smooth experiment  for gaming if your are single player mostly, and multiplayer is also good due to lack of large resolution and 4k 60hz is waste of money if your are gaming only not for Movie as i hope your understand it..as i have already upload the video compare asus 32XGV and LG 32GK650for graphic card as my personal recommend 1070, 1080 1080 ti even RTX 2060, 2070 ,2080 and 2080 ti also AMD 5700 xt & 5700 for better smooth experiment fpsConsi have to manual adjust the color quality on games and movie depend on quality which take time and response time is average and it is cheap monitor for True Indian gaming"
3,"Writing my review after using couple of days with all kind of testing.  First if all, Monitor is designed specifically for Gamers(CONSIDER NOTHING ELSE).  also very bulky monitor. After using this 2K monitor observed that 2K is good till 27 Inch monitor.  1440p is does not look good at all with 32 inch.  I have tested with my Windows and Macbook Pro, 2K resolution is just not sufficient with 32 inch. I would strongly not recommend those who are not a GAMER.  I brought for dual use for game and work. but  not at all satisfied for work, for game is ok. WATCHING MOVIE IN THIS MONITOR IS WORST EXPERIENCE."
1,2 Blackspot on the screen ...now returning the product....
5,"A absolute beast of a monitor for 24k!2k resolution ‚úÖ32"" ‚úÖ144hz ‚úÖGreat color  accuracy (after calibration )‚úÖFantastic contrast & black levels ‚úÖFantastic viewing angles ‚úÖI am no professional artist seeking 100% srgb  nor a professional gamer to need absolute best of input lag. Nor I want an expensive 4k panel considering the specs I have.Hence this monitor nails it as it doesn't lag behind in any aspect . It's absolutely brilliant .Input lag is still among the very best and 96% srgb after calibration with 144hz refresh and freesymc makes it an absolute treat to play games or watch movies from a distance . The immersion is just great for watching media and a visibly remarkable upgrade in gaming coming from a 60hz 1080p 24"" monitor .Build quality is Rock solid. I have seen reviews complaining of a wobbly stand . That's because they might have tightened the screw manually with the small handle on top of the screw. Use a screw driver , it locks in firmly with zero wobble.Tilt , height , rotate adjustments makes it a great productivity display .  There is zero backlight bleed on my panel.It's the best gaming monitor for the price even as per ""hardware unboxed""  YouTube channel and a lot of other website reviews .Fantastic display at this price makes it my best  purchase."
4,"Bought the 34 inch one after a lot deliberation. Read a lot of reviews, watched a lot videos and spoke to a bunch of people. I was a 4k, 28 inch user before this, so stepping down to 2k on a bigger screen space was a bit of concern.The Pros: The colors on this one looks nice. Rich colors, not overly saturated(unless you want that, the Vivid mode does that). Color representation is quite good for the price point.Good viewing angles. No color fading or dimming. The IPS panel does it job pretty well at that.Massive screen space which over compensates for any productive work, be it editing or typing. Side by side windows will be quite useful.Texts are crisp but you need to figure out which mode works for you. There are a bunch of color modes to work with.Fast response rate of 144Hz. My jump from 60 Hz to 144Hz felt significant.If you've a decent enough graphics card, the 144Hz refresh rate will really pop up in games.Cons: The HDR mode is a gimmick. It works on a software level and doesn't really provide a wider color gamut.The aspect ration of 16:9 means most movies and shows will have a thick bar on 2 sides or all 4 sides, depending on the video being played.4K content will look a tad grainy (or maybe its just me) as the monitor reduces the pixel count to fit the screen ratio."
5,"Awesome deal....best for Gaming with 144hz, 1ms, VA Panel monitor wotj 32"" hige screen....2k resolution also stunning for smaller details...I bought for gaming like PUBG, CS.GO, Apex Legends. Very satisfied...screen is bit big...27 is best spot for gaming.....But not available for 25k range....then this is best offer, go for it..."
5,"We don't have many options for a 32"" Gaming Monitor (2k or 4k) with at least 144hz refresh rate in India, as lot of models available in US are never released here. I would have loved to find something with an IPS panel but its impossible with this budget.My use case was primarily gaming+Netflix, so wanted a 32"" to be able to enjoy both. This is probably the best option at this point (even though this was released 2yrs back). I use this with my 3060ti+5600x, no issues with G-sync over Display port. Colors look a little dull compared to IPS, but with some minor tweaks, its not very noticeable. Luckily I got a panel with no dead pixels, so that was a win. Anyone looking for a larger 2k monitor, please go ahead with this, nothing compares to this under 35k."
1,Got a defective piece. The packaging looks previously opened and highly damaged. The HDMI ports have serious connectivity issues. Pretty sure they are selling defective products considering screens that have an mrp of 60k are being sold at 30k.
5,"this is such a great display, I am a programmer and I use this display as my primary display, the 32 inch is just perfect, I had doubts in my mind if it was going to be too big, but I was wrong.Yes, it did feel very big on the first 2-3 days, but from then onwards it felt normal, its a great size to have on your desk, but u should have a big desk for a better experience, at least a medium-size one. The color is great, brightness is also very high, I am using it at 10% brightness because I spend my whole day in front of the pc and I don't want to get a spectacle soon.I have not played any games on it so I can't say anything about gaming performance, but I am sure it will be great because I have seen many reviews where this monitor has been the best entry-level monitor according to them for gaming.There were no dead pixels, the packaging was good, arrived without any damage.one concern is that you don't get an HDMI cable with it but u do get a display port cable with is good and of great quality too but most pcs doesn't come with a display port, I bought an HDMI cable from the local market at 200 rs (lapcare), I got it for 24k, then after few days, it was brought down to 23,500, my bad. and I was also looking for bajaj finserv but it was only provided for 6 months so I took it for 4000 for 6 months plan again after a few days after bajaj finserv provided 2000 for 12 months plan, again my bad. I have seen a review where they claim they got it for 22k, so if u can wait, wait for it./*******************************************  for programmers:-*******************************************/# => I use visual studio code (obviously). and at a font size of 18 pixels(minimum size to be able to see the character), I can have 3 tabs side by side opened, and each tab can display 94 characters per line (300 character per line if only one tab is open) which is just amazing.# => you can see so much of the code at the same time.# => at 10% brightness and considering my room lighting and dark mode, I don't strain my eyes much even after working for 14 hours a day. so you would be very happy with the monitor.# => even though it's a VA panel, I have no problems with it. It is a  great display, and u will love it."
4,"I was hesitant about buying a 32 inch monitor since the previous 27 inch one was very adequate. Then there was the option of flat or curved. Myriad research later opted for this LG 32"" flat one.  So far after 2 days of usage I am not disappointed.  I sit around 3-4 feet from the monitor. Those who sit less than that, I would advise to stick with smaller screens topping at 27"".144 Hz refresh, FreeSync, 1ms response time (Although all 3 are not meant to work together) @ affordable cost and backed by the reputable LG brand, thats the beauty of this monitorThere are zero dead pixels and no noticable light bleed. Lucky Me !The colour calibration of the screen was the only issue, since there is no calibration software by LG and some existing free software felt woefully short. Windows in-built calibration was inadequate. Finally it was after elongated trial and error, putting a visual, adjusting settings, changing visual, rechecking, which did the trick. But Monitor brands MUST, by default, have their own customised calibration software.All in all I would recommend go for it if you want a quality gaming monitor @ reasonable cost."
1,"For games and videos, this is good. However, if you want to see text screens like C++ in visual studio, this monitor is hopeless."
5,"I had been looking for a 144Hz monitor for a long time. I did all my research about the refresh rates, display panels response time and FreeSync, GSync. After going through all the current options in my budget, the best monitor which I could find was BenQ XL2411. I didn't came to know to about this LG monster that time somehow. All of a sudden, in an Amazon sale, I found this beast. Compared it straight to BenQ model straight away and found it superior to that. Order it for around 13,500 at that without wasting any a moment.On arrival, it was really well packed. It was easy to install, changes my setting from 60Hz to 144Hz and could suddenly feel the difference. The screen was now much more smooth and less jittery. The colors were however on the little bit higher side and were not normal when compared to IPS screen. It took me time to adjust to these settings. However, now whenever I look at any other screen, I find them dim. I have been using it for 3 months now and haven figured any issue yet.When it comes to gaming, I used it for CS:GO mainly. Visuals were great, enemies were much more visible, lag-less display, easy one-taps just because you could feel the moment and enemies don't teleport anymore as their movements were smooth. There were no more hidden spots anymore where I couldn't figure out an enemy. For CS:GO and other FPS, it is highly recommended. When I switched to NFS, the colors were bleeding i.e a lot of exposure in the game colors. Nothing bad but not just what the game wants us to see. It was not that much crisp.Overall, it is a good option to go for consider the different color settings it has along with Black Equaliser as well.  Definitely value for money and a got to go option if you wish to 144Hz from 60Hz"
1,I got fake monitor.
1,Do not buy this product. My monitor suddenly stopped working and its been 3 months since I requested for a service repair. LG keeps delaying the repair stating that the parts are not available in India. I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR. If it stops working neither amazon nor LG no one will help. Its a scam. I am stuck and so I am telling you do not fall for the low price and high specs. Its a trap.
5,"This was a very good buy for me. I play lots and lots of video games and also do work on videos and I found it to be a wonderful display for me. I'm writing this review after several months of its uses. So, I  can say that it tis reliable too. I work on it like 12-15 hours a say. It's a promising monitor."
5,"I had a Dell U2410 monitor for 10 years, it stopped working one day and I was thinking of buying another 24inch monitor of Dell. But luckily I stumbled across this 32inch LG monitor, one of the best decisions to buy this monitor.Once you start using a 32inch monitor you would definitely feel the change. I have a TV at home for movies, but for all my office work during Work from Home, this monitor really rocks.I don't have a Mac and I have not even connected my laptop to this monitor, as I have a desktop. But I think they both might work amazingly on this.Hopefully, let see how it works for the next 5-6 years.Pros:144 Refresh Rate32inch SizeColors, I am not a geek to know the color difference, but I like the colors of this monitorAmazon service was top notch and delivery was very fast within a day"
5,"Really good stand with height, swivel, and tilt adjustment and the monitor has very slim bezels and has a really good design. There were no dead pixels or backlight bleed. Only con that i could find is that audio through the 3.5 mm jack is really low when i plugged in my speakers, but that too can be solved if you are using a 2.1 speaker setup. Also most people will you their motherboard audio, i used it because i have a ps4 along with the pc. It came with a displayport so you can use freesync or gsync without buying displayport separately. Freesync range is 48 to 144hz."
4,"Dear All,I received the monitor as agreed in 2 days.I was using laptop earlier and due considering WFH - I purchased this monitor for office work.As far as office work use - I am fully satisfied.  Those who are WFH and using laptop screen, guys, Please switch to monitor like this considering eye care.I am not gaming fan so can not comment on same. The youTube quality was okay to good.Why did purchased this product:1. Budget: I do not wanted to go beyond 9000 Rs.2. Size: I dont want to have more than 22 inch size. Can our eyes catch more than that?3. Technical: I wanted IPS panel (for sure) - 100% Recommended4. Ports: One HDMI was sufficient for my laptop ( 1 VGA is bonus)5. Country of Origin of this product is India ( Yes, Of course my preference)Cons:No USB port ( Why do we need?)No speakers ( Why did WFH need it?) Laptop has speakers!"
4,"Product is good. Colours are great. Easy to self install.  Height not adjustable. If you are too tall and your chair is fixed height, you might want to reconsider. Otherwise good product.It is mentioned as made in India in website, while packaging clearly says it is Made in China. Please correct the website."
5,"The full HD IPS panel is simply amazing. No backlight bleeding. No dead spots. Build quality is top notch. Cannot comment on it's suitability for gaming as i am not a gaming enthusiast. Totally recommended for Home use. Colour reproduction is awesome!I am not a fan of thin bezels, so i actually loved the border along the panel. This is Dell. Need i say more. Just go for it."
5,This is the best monitor we can find in this price range. The IPS panel makes it a perfect choice for design purposes. Bought 2 pieces together for office purposes. Highly recommended.
4,"I got this panel a few days ago. It was good to see that the product was manufactured in April 2021. It's build quality is really good and you will like it if you have previously been a fan of IBM laptops. It's very work oriented and is for professional work only. Please do not buy this if your intention is gaming or editing videos because if you add a little bit more money you can get a monitor with 75hrtz, freesync and thin bezels. This monitor is strictly for business. The only problem I found is its plug which is 16amps. I do not know why a monitor needs 16amps? So if you are buying this keep in mind you may need a 6amp to 16amp converter(you also get 5/6amp monitor wires which will also work but you have to be careful with quality of the wire). It's got a vesa mount which makes dual screen setups easy. Other than the 16amp plug situation it's a good monitor. Be sure of your needs before going for this panel."
5,Good monitor for home and office. IPS Screen clarity Excellent. Build quality great. Installation very easy. Fully satisfied for this monitor. Good packing.
5,Nice delivery no damages. All parts is there. Nice monitor. And i have cheak dell customer service. It is best. This monitor come with 3 year warranty but sellers should update warranty from my date of purchase. But dell customer service is best they done it. From just one call.
5,"Nice product..Not available in market, cheaper then other same product qulitiwise ,it would be better if two HDMI input for tv and cctv.."
5,"If you spend more than 5hrs in work looking into desktop go for it, this is being used in all mnc. the ips panel is good and keeps your eye clam during work. Highly recommended for work from home."
1,The product stopped working within 15 days. Amazon didn't resolve my issue. I got a product with a different serial number which was not on the receipt.
5,"Like mentioned in headline, colors and quality of display is really good for it's price. Response time of 14ms does not seem to cause any issues for programming, general browsing/media consumption.Some might face issue of  drop in frame rates when using this as an extended display. Set refresh rates to be same for both primary and secondary displays and the problem should be solved!"
1,Received the product with a broken Display.Really disappointed with the product as I didn't expect this to happen.  Be careful!
5,Really great product excellent work but one Remarks VGA Cable port very congested to fixing VGA CABLE Their is no proper place to fixing VGA cable very difficult. Really. Should be give space.
5,Bought this during Amazon sale good product. Very professional very apt for office use. Am  not using for any gaming so can't comment on that but worth price
5,Very good
5,It's pretty good. The only thing I feel is weird about this monitor is the bezel around the screen. It feels a little too thick but it's okay I guess. The monitor is pretty good overall. I haven't had any issues till now when I was gaming and for normal use as well.
5,Very nice product if you like to work on wide screen you must purchases this one.
5,"Delivered safely on time, thanks to Amazon. Good IPS panel monitor in this range. Color representation is excellent. Dell Plastic build quality is good, Look nice. Easy to install."
5,there is no sound facility in this monitor.
3,"Picture quality is good, also didn't notice any lag between laptop action and monitor.However, height is not adjustable and the default height is very very low."
5,I am using this monitor in my Home Office. Very happy with this Dell IPS Model. Value for INR 7300 :-)
5,Really amazing monitor. Best part is the comfort view. Eyes don't get strained even after hours of long use. However don't use it near a window. Antiglare sucks on this.
5,Yeah it's good for everyday use. Can't say anything about gaming because I didn't play any on this monitor. Colors are good once calibrated. Product as described by the seller.
5,"Go for it, best for cctv monitor."
5,Reached me on time in tie usual sturdy dell packingPicture quality great did not disappoint
2,"Purchased because mu old AOC 19.5 inch monitor display is showing some problem....  So, i bought one from Amazon. First bad experience. one / two deal pixel in new monitor.  No refund available. So i am applying for a replacement. Lets see....."
4,Good Buy go for it
3,It is what you would expect for the price. The resolution and speed are not great and you'll still be straining your eyes to make out small text. I'd go for a better model even if it's more expensive.
5,I purchased this dell monitor on Amazon.I'm using till from 2 Months. Colour and contrast is a good. IPS panel monitor.
5,"I have been using this product for a week, it has good picture quality, and is perfect if you like to open multiple windows side by side for your work."
5,good quality product as expected
5,"Dear all,I bought this monitor for my desktop PC at home. It arrived as agreed with two days delivery. The earlier product BenQ SE2231 died after 10 years of use."
4,"Baught it for my desktop,With IPS panel and screen size it's a really good deal,NO speaker,I use speaker separately so it was a good deal for me"
5,Everything as claimed
5,Best monitor for small office CCTV use
5,It is awesome üëç....Everytging is fine!!!As per my expectations!!!
5,Very good
1,I have not received power and VGA cable with both of the monitor...
5,The best monitor to purchase online at this price. Picture quality and brightness is excellent. It's also good for gaming.
1,"The plug is too big and not fittable in normal Indian electrical socket. This is very bad,Plus they dont provide VGA cable which is a shame"
5,"I got it for around 11.5K. At this price point it feels like a great competitor to Benq IPS monitor.PROS:--------------------Sturdy AF monitor stand:This ensures that the monitor is sturdy and minimizes the wobble. It has a better stand most of the other brands at this price point as they all offer plastic stand, the wobble from which would definitely be noticeably more. I don't think I would ever be going back to using a monitor with a plastic stand after using this one.-Good Picture quality:Out of the box the blue shade was a little bit more than it usually should be, but after calibration this was comparable to panels from LG or Benq. For comparison I am using a LG 27MP59G along side this and the picture quality from Zebronics panel is almost the same.I didn't face any issues while playing games on this but still I would not recommend this monitor if you want to play a competitive fighting game like street fighter or tekken on this.-Thin Bezels:The bezels are actully really thin. While the physical bezels seem to be paper thin, the actual LED and the outsides of the monitor make the bezel about 0.8cm which is great.-Budget friendly:There are not many monitors that offer thin bezel, great picture quality and viewing angles along with the 27inch screen size at this price point. Zebronics has definitely done a great job here.-Indian Company:Although this may sound really stupid but this was one of the reasons why I actually bought this monitor as I wanted to try something new, specially from an Indian brand and I am actually impressed. Hence this long review.-Included Aux cable:This may not be useful for everyone, but it was good to see someone include a aux cable out of the box since this monitor has a audio out port at the back.-Vesa Mount:Can't praise Zebronics any more at this point.CONS:-----------------Only available in white color:I feel this is mostly depends on personal preference. I personally prefer black monitors as watching media on them feels more immersive.-Buttons on the side:The adjustment buttons are available on the right-hand side of the monitor. If you are using a multi-monitor setup then you have to make sure that there is no other monitor on the right hand side of this monitor since that would hinder your ability to do any adjustments using the side panel buttons. This somewhat beats the purpose of a slim bezel monitor.-Only VGA included:Most of the modern devices have HDMI as the standard video output port. Zebronics could have included a HDMI cable instead of a VGA since HDMI is a better standard to use than a VGA. (they don't differ alot in terms of pricing).I fell this leads to decreasing the price difference between this monitor and some other monitors as they already have HDMI included out of the box (Benq) and you would have to buy a seperate HDMI cable with this one.-No monitor adjustment:I don't think there is any way to actually adjust the monitor but the more than sturdy monitor stand kind of makes up for this con.[PS: A great purchase and would definitely recommend this to my friends and family]"
4,Pro :Big screenpremium lookcon :1. brightness light make stress on eye even you tried to downgrade the brightness. not sitting work have an issue2. inbuilt speaker very low. even not auditable if you want to listen anything voice.but i am satisfied with overall  performance.
5,"Reviewing after a month of use, 60Hz 1080p display with very slim design. Display brightness is also good, Not using for gamming. but you can have decent output for that as well. most importantly it has 27inch display, which is definitely better to look at.Only issue I found that if you have a poor electricity wiring or no earthing, display turns off for a while when switching fan/bulb on/off (happened only once, might be due to low voltage supply). Also if you accidently touch the pin of your charger (Type c or B any) to stand of the display (which is made of metal) then it flickers. Disappointing!!!Apart from this issue, I found the display very well, no issues further."
1,"The main issue with this device1. It's not FHD or HD, this Delhi made local product.2. ""It has 500000:1 dynamic contrast ratio for deeper blacks, brighter whites and rich colours"" it's completely fake. It's not true. This device is unable to display black colour properly.3. Assembling: Bottom side screw not properly tight and screw hole is not on proper position.4. Power adapter: 100% Local5. Power Cable: 100% Local"
5,That's my 15.6 inch laptop next to this monitor. It's very helpful for my office tasks and also to watch HD movies. Although I had to replace the monitor on the very same day as it didn't turn on. But got the replacement the very next day so no complaints on that.
5,"This is a superb monitor, with good quality and cheap price tag.  Picture quality is good. Speakers are little disappointment, but what else you could expect in such price. Packaging was very good and secure and delivery was timely as well. Overall it‚Äôs a best monitor in this price range. Go for it."
5,Best for working don't purchase for gaming but best for working value for money best buy for it professionals
5,"I bought this 27"" inch zebronics monitor for trending purpose and I m very happy to buy this good looking monitor"
5,Everything was good but quality was not up to the MarkCons - no warranty card received ü•∫
5,"I must say . The best monitor at this price . 27"" for 12 k is just mind-blowing .I hope this monitor stands the test of time."
5,Best in price. Quality is ok according to price.
5,Awesome and good looking
5,Best monitor
5,"Worth the money and good quality. The stand is a little wobbly, but except that it is really good."
5,Good product
5,I think price is slightly high but quality screen size and design all is look fabulous.
5,Awesome product.
5,Amazing desktop for show off andbest design build quality and best brightness level amazing desktop after all very less bezel or you can say bezel less
4,"Just to give you the expectations, the one the seller deliver is different. this monitor does not allow to tilt it forward and backward like others in this price range. The speaker is just a namesake, even the mobile speaker sound better than this. I have never used this monitor speaker, its bad super low voice, no one can hear. the button for brightness and contrast adjustment is complicated to use.Best part, it looks good, takes less space, the overall quality is good"
5,Display was quite good
5,the monitor is very awesome
5,Really like it
5,i suggest buy under 15000 rs is best led
5,Best monitor ever
4,"It is a white frame and white plastic body at backside. I prefer black only. But the LED tv is slim in size,  frameless are beauty and stand design is more attractive. It would be helpful if the seller spply a wall bracket and a HDMI cable instead of VGA cable which is outdated now days."
5,Super
5,nice picture
5,Sandaar i like superb
5,Nice
4,"Its entry level monitor, not 4k, disply quality is poor compered to top brand like Dell,zebronics failed to compete with dell, samsung, LG"
4,Using after 15days..my decision is correct.. Quality and price are really great and perfect suitable for photoshop and video editing ( my opinion)
4,"Pros :- Nice product , ultra-slimCons:- little tilted , no height adjustment"
3,"I would give 5 stars for looks but 3 stars for picture quality as images looks washed out, contrast is not that good. Another najor drawback is that there is no tilt adjustment which would have been fine if by default the monitor didn't point slightly in a downward direction. As u can see in the image I had to manually tilt it backwards to resolve this by putting some cushining below the stand, 2 cardboard pieces u can see at each end. If u r looking to wall mount then I dnt think this should matter as I am assuming that monitor won't tilt downwards then, but I can't say as I haven't wall mounted it. I did a lot of research before buying n thought of giving this indian brand a chance but since there is no option to return this product I have kept it otherwise I would have returned it. Dnt go for looks, go for picture quality and buy any other brand."
4,Good
4,"Amazing Product. Really worthy at this price Range, Overall is is Good.Inbuilt Sound can be Improve a Bit..its Too Low...Rest is Great"
5,Trust me if you are looking for a DECENT PICE AND QUALITY MONITOR I would proffer definitely  because I was really scared of the comments which I saw above but when I received the product I really loved it for the money what I have paid it is fine because you do get the same size monitor with higher price BUT THIS ONE IS DEFIANTLY WORTH OF BUYING IAM REALY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT FROM PACKING TO DELIVERY PERFECT.
2,"Valur for money except for aux issue but won't recommend buying.Audio aux port doesn't work.Replaced the product received in another week but for new monitor also audio aux port is not working.Most people doesn't test it.I don't know if it works at all or just for showcase.Tried with aux cable that was in box ,tried other aux , earphone as well."
4,Display complaint
2,"Its installation and setup on table as well as on the wall is very confusing. There is no space/screw...for wall mounting. I tried to buy a wall mount for this monitor but could find one anywhere. I also visited its service center in Nehru place (New Delhi), surprisingly they also do not have any idea about how I can wall mount this monitor. Other wise in terms of design and look it's a good monitor."
2,"The monitor is good over all , the issue is that the base is not proper for a 27 inch screen . It wobbles , and slight nudge can make it topple .  I recieved the product with dead pixel.  Customer care cannot find the product based on serial number printed at back . Also due to the shaky base the monitor toppled and the led broke .  There is no option to connect it to wall or monitor stand."
2,"I was pretty surprised to see a sublet of Acer selling such a feature packed monitor at such a low price.And best of all they were using VA panel and not TN(which are usually the cheapest and the worst looking).Before i start my rant about its issues, let me say this, for this price you won't get Freesync and 144hz from any other brand, the blacks are pretty good and the panel gets decently bright.And overall can be a decent buy if the panel issues are sorted out which i will discuss next.So despite my apprehensions with this brand and Acer in general, i dived in and bought it, only to realize nothing ever comes cheap, and there is a reason why AOPEN monitors are so cheap, usually with monitors QA(Quality Assurance) plays a big factor when deciding the price. You see the more monitors you have to discard on the assembly line to maintain a certain level of quality, the more end users end up paying for that quality. I think by now you know why these monitors costs to less, for those who didn't get it, the QA department for such cheap monitors is pretty relaxed, they allow relatively bad looking panels to pass through to cut down the price.For some this might absolutely be a non issue, but for the discerning user who values quality, i will not recommend this monitor, the proof is in front of you folks, the pics i have attached here show how a complete black backgrounnd looks on this monitor, its really funny because my 8 year old TN panel monitor looks way better.It seems like we should expect less of panels now than we did 8 years ago(Added a comparison screenshot of this monitor vs my 8 year old TN panel, just look at the panel uniformity and backlight difference between the 2) !The panel uniformity is all over the place, and if you tell me to look the other way due to the price, i won't because even the costlier Predator series monitors have backlight bleed and uniformity issues.Ok enough talk about the first issue, moving to issue number 2.Typically and technically IPS panels have the best color reproduction, followed by VA and then TN.So i was expecting the monitor to have much richer and better colors than my TN panel, but sadly thats not the case, the colors are completely unrealistic, have an unnatural hue, and to add to that the monitor's edges are DIMLY LIT.Caliberating the monitor on your own helps a bit but its still not a good VA panel.Pros :-------Good Contrast ratioIntuitive OSDDecent Build Quality144hzFreesync(works with Nvidia gpus too now, but only with pascal and turing)Cons :--------Pathetic backlight issues with dim edgesReally bad color calibration out of the boxPanel uniformity issuesGiving it 2 star due to all of this, because in my eyes a monitor should have a solid foundation(The Panel) and then adding extra features adds value, if your panel is this poor then whats the point in having all those features."
5,"the best under 30k 144hz, va panel, curved viewing angles r good & after sales service will be given by acer so if someone has 30k budget u can go with this also bezels r so slim to be attracted"
5,Really good monitor with crisp image quality. Totally worth the price. 144hz refresh rate and 2k resolution is a treat at this price. Freesync also works pretty good. Only thing is the brightness is 250 nits which is good but a bit low compared to other va panels out there. Viewing angles and colour reproduction is really good. Navigation controls are pretty easy with the joystick provided at the back.Pros:-Cheapest 32 inch display-144 hz freesync works perfect-no dead pixels or backlight bleed-Curve on the screen gives immersive experienceCons:-Display brightness could have been better-No speaker-Cant swivel the monitor vertically 90 degrees-Stand is very small and not firm when tilting the display up and down
4,"If you have 20k around to spare for a new gaming monitor, This Aopen curve gaming monitor is one of the best options available. I am really happy with the purchase. It took only 15 hours to reach.Pros:1. 144hz, so buttery smooth frames.2.  4 ms response.3. Curve display.4. Has display port.5. 27 inch, quite a big displayCons:1. 27 inch 1080p looks a bit inadequate of pixels.2. 1ms response time would have been better, but considering this price damn I would have bought it with 5ms also.Peace."
4,"INTRODUCTION:I bought this monitor to replace an old TN panel that I'd been using forever. Its not without its issues but it does get quite a few things right. Hopefully this review will help you decide whether its worth your hard earned money.PRICE:I picked mine up during an Amazon sale when there was a discount offer and a lightning deal on the monitor. At that price, the feature set this monitor provides can't be beaten. The price seems to have gone up since then though.BUILD QUALITY:Build quality is solid. Stand is all metal, pretty sturdy and the monitor doesn't shake too easily. No swivel or height adjustment, but you can tilt the monitor from -5¬∞~ 20¬∞. No VESA mounts either. Bezels are not slim but not very thick either and have a slightly reflective finish. No stuck/dead pixels or any other visual defects to speak of.CURVATURE:The monitor has a curvature rating of 1800R. Curved monitors offer a larger perceived field of view. I had no problems going from a flat panel to a curved one, but it felt a little strange going back the other way once I got used to it.UI:UI is clean, easy to navigate and the exact same one found on the similarly priced Acer panel. Not surprising given AOpen is an Acer subsidiary. Fortunately, unlike the Acer panel which has normal buttons, this one uses a joystick which is much more convenient and intuitive but with one rather annoying design choice - turning off the screen requires you to keep it pressed for 5 seconds. Not ideal if you quickly want to turn off your screen before leaving the room.IMAGE QUALITY:Colors are ok out-of-the-box but you'll probably need to fiddle around with the settings a bit to get the picture you desire. I found the default presets a bit too warm for my liking so I had to tone it down a bit to get a more neutral image. You can switch the color temp between warm, cool, normal and lastly user mode which enables the RGB bias and gain sliders. The panel isn't very bright but a brightness level of 50-60 will be enough for most people. Blacks look pretty nice as they should be on a VA panel. All in all, with a bit of tweaking, you can get a pretty decent image out of the monitor.VIEWING ANGLES:There is gamma shift when looking at the screen at an angle. The image becomes washed out and less bright the further you move from the centre. But its not severe and its a non-issue if you sit right in front of the screen like most people do.144HZ:Now, onto the two biggest selling points of this monitor: 144Hz and FreeSync. You have to experience a 144Hz monitor to truly understand why so many people recommend one. Forget games for a second - your desktop experience is just so much better. Simple tasks like moving the mouse pointer, dragging a window around, scrolling up and down feel so much more fluid. And once you get used to 100+ fps in games especially FPS, going back down to 60 is something you'll want to avoid. Its not quite the horrible experience going from 60 to 30 but its still jarring.FREESYNC:As for FreeSync, the difference it makes is very evident. No more picking between screen tearing and input lag. And with the latest Nvidia drivers, you aren't restricted to AMD gpus anymore to use FreeSync. As long as you have a Pascal or later series card and a DPI cable, you're good to go. Just enable FreeSync in the monitor menu, then go to the Nvidia Control Panel, click on Set up GSync and tick Enable GSync, Gysnc compatible, Enable for windowed and full screen mode, and Enable settings for the selected display model. That's pretty much it. The FreeSync range is between 48-144Hz but you can extend it using CRU (Custom Resolution Utility). I have extended my range from 40-144Hz because FreeSync is even more beneficial at lower fps. 40fps on a FreeSync panel feels much smoother than 40fps on a non-FreeSync panel.BACKLIGHT BLEEDING:The biggest con, as others have mentioned, is that these monitors suffer from quite a bit of backlight bleeding. Its normal for IPS/VA panels to have a bit of backlight bleeding but its rather noticeable on these panels. I've had two of these, and on a completely black background or even when viewing a dark scene/image, you can see patches near the top and bottom that are brighter than the rest of the screen. Compared to my old TN panel, the black uniformity really isn't good. I mean if you stand far back enough from the screen, it kinda looks like there's a Batman logo on the screen. Of course, the severity of the issue ranges from unit to unit - the replacement I got was better than the original - but its still an issue albeit one that's only evident during dark scenes. If you get a decent unit, keep the brightness at sensible levels, and don't go looking at the edges of your screen every time the screen goes dark, its not something that will really bother you.CABLES:The DP cable that came with the first monitor was not only non-functional, it would stop my PC from even booting into Windows. I had to buy a separate DP cable to troubleshoot the issue. So if you're buying this monitor and plan on using FreeSync, keep a spare DP cable handy just in case. No issues with HDMI or DVI cables though.SUMMARY:Coming from an old 22"" TN panel, this monitor has definitely been a good upgrade. The pros sufficiently outweigh the cons in my opinion. Would I pay the current asking price for it? Probably not. But during a lightning deal and/or when there are discount offers, it certainly represents good value for money."

I was starteled at first but when the screen is lit, there really is no difference.For gaming, you might need the overdrive to stay off in the monitor menu options > gaming to prevent ghosting effects of moving sharp images.the viewing angles are great and color reproduction still on point."
2,"Not even 4 months and the display started flickering, tried resetting, changing DP cables but still same issue, tried calling service number of Aopen 1800-11-4100 but number is coming as not available. Raised a ticket with Aopen for servicing the product in bangalore but no proper response yet, they keep telling they are looking into it.Can't figure out how to get the monitor serviced, can anyone help please?"
5,This pocket friendly but enthusiast level specs makes it very affordable gaming premium monitor. This is a right out of the box review and may be updated as i go. qhd +144hz+curved+32 inch at 25k that's a very interesting grab. 144hz definitely feels smoother. All the color tech people include in their reviews and tells how bad this display is .... forget it. on an average day when you are playing a game or watching your fav movie you wont sit actively to notice all those. display is fine. unless you want to cherry pick its minor color calibration or brightness issues.Curved display is actually much better than i thought for browsing and youtube than gaming and movies i noticed. the images or text on edges of the pages are a same distance as middle so thats gives a very comfortable view. So no regrets. its highly recommended. I shall update the review over the time.
4,"Unlike most people, I use this monitor with my laptop (which is very capable BTW) rather than a desktop. I would really recommend that you go for the 32-inch 2560x1440 version or the 24-inch 1920x1080 version as 1920x1080 is not really adequate for a 27-inch monitor. It is quite an immersive experience with the curved VA screen. On my unit, however, HDMI was very buggy. Video signal dropped to a blank screen pretty frequently which was very frustrating. Did not encounter this problem, however, with a DP to mini-DP cable (found a decent cable nowhere online except Amazon, the AmazonBasics version). The problem must be isolated as I have never heard anyone else have this problem. My specific unit has minor backlight bleed, fortunately. Could not figure out how to enable Freesync with a GTX 1060. Again, maybe it's just me.The good :-- Competitive price point.- Huge 32-inch TV-like real estate to work with, with features of a monitor.- Smooth 144Hz refresh rate.- VA panel. Other monitors in this range are mostly TN/IPS 60Hz - 75Hz/really small.- Freesync (Not useful to me, but useful for people with AMD GPUs, at least or those who could make it work with NVIDIA cards somehow).- Curved. Very immersive.- Relatively intuitive OSD.- Adequately deep black levels.The not so good :-- HDMI signal issues (at least on my unit).- Sub-par color calibration out of the box.- Minor backlight bleed on my unit (but tolerable).- One stuck/dead pixel right around the middle of the screen.- No 90 degree rotate/swivel.- No speakers, USB passthrough, etc (justified for the price, I guess).It's not perfect. But it's great overall, nonetheless. Totally worth a recommendation.Edit: Found one stuck pixel around the center of the screen. Edited the review accordingly."
5,"I found the display port image of 1440p 120hz on a radeon hd6970 fantastic.The other complain of backlight unevenness did not exist when your in front of it, if you go back far and see it from an angle then you see it.Black's are great and clarity fantastic to the pixel on dp only.A lot of calibration settings are there.Very impressive and I'm planning a 3 monitor setup for racing and flight sim as will as productivity.The border less frame feature is a joke, as the screen actually ends much before the illustrative thin border. There's almost 10-15mm of border."
5,"The monitor is excellent , very good picture quality , excellent colour production , the curved screen is a treat to eye and 144hz and freesync at this price range is commendableGo for 24 inch one if full hd resolutionI used to run my console on my tv and now moving to this monitor the increase is quality and performance is very measurable .As all the services and onsite warranty for this product will be provided by Acer there should me no doubt related to the durability of the product.The only con is that it lacks a speaker unit but that doesn't change anything.Go for it"
1,Acer is not written anywhere on the packaging box or on the monitor itself.1) The refresh rate is 119.98Hz and not 144Hx as mentioned in specifications.2) Monitor Speakers do not work.3) It's a local individual brand AOPEN and not Acer.The word Acer is only to be found on the order purchase on Amazon app and nowhere on the actual order. Scam.
4,"Received the monitor today.  Initial impression was quite good.  I was using a 21.5inch full HD Dell touch monitor. Going curved is a great boon with good peripheral vision. Now comes the bummer. Display has a patch of dead pixel at the edge and on standby I saw the screen in just one color, reddish with the entire display looking like a cobweb. Must have something majorly wrong with the piece. Requested for a replacement, hope mine is a odd piece and wont affect long term reliability. As others are have also mentioned similar issues looks more like a production line issue rather than one off.  Hoping for a full rectification of the problem with the replacement. If it works its an excellent monitor esp for work and playing. Being a larger monitor text is larger too which adds on to the eye comfort.Edit: Prompt replacement in just a day, didnt have to wait as the pick up and replacement happened together.  New display has no issues so far."
4,"Using this monitor for 3 months now and here is my review,The curved screen helps for better vision when facing direct.Viewing angles on this monitor are also excellent.Interface is simple to understand and use.In the box VGA, HDMI and DVI all cables are included with good quality built (My favourite thing)Brightness is way too high on this monitor, I keep it in the range of 30-40%Its 1080p but pixels are slightly visible when user mode is changed to gaming or movie.These are the things which are imp for you to know rest part you can check on youtube.Overall its worth the price."
4,"First day review - Got the monitor on the next day after order, box was in good condition, after unboxing the setup was easy it only requires 1 screw to be screwed in. Setting it up connected to the computer and checking there were no dead pixels and very slight amounts of back light bleed (which is to be expected at this price range and screen size), this what i meant by luck as i got lucky with the panel where as your experience might vary given that there are older reviews where people have much worse panels.Verdict - As it is a prime guarantee product and if it has all the features that you need then get it and test it out you might get really lucky with the panel too if not just return it/have it replaced as there is nothing better in the price range if it works well.feel free to ask questions.Edit 1: found a stuck pixel so 4 stars"
5,"This is one of the fantastic monitors you get in this price range.Pros:-> 144Hz display(You will really feel the smoothness once you jump from 60 or 75Hz display).-> VA panel gives great contrast as compared to typical TN panel found in other budget 144Hz Monitor.-> Simply a great Gaming Monitor in budget.Cons:-> When in dark black screen you can see the panel is not A+ grade panel(Doesn't matter as normally you won't be in having black screen all the time).-> Doesn't have Vesa mount option, that's a deal breaker for many(Unless they are fine with low monitor height or can buy monitor stand)Conclusion: If you are looking for a budget 144Hz gaming monitor with Freesync/G-sync support  and no vesa support doesn't bother you, then its a no brainier . Simply go for it. Highly Recommended."
1,Within a month it started to flicker now... I was not expecting such a poor quality.26/09/2020 - Also bought a 32 inch... It's quality is very sub standard fully made of plactic... Jus the bottom stand is of metal. Also have noticed dead pixels on the pannel.
1,"With high hopes, keeping in mind the price to features ratio I ordered this 27""  monitor. Within a month of use it has developed dead pixel. I asked Acer service center for resolution, this is what they replied ""As per your concern, your screen pixels issue comes under CID ( Customer Induce Damage ) so it will not cover under warranty."".I have been using this monitor with utmost care, sitting on desk with APC UPS, no voltage fluctuations or any damage(physical or otherwise)What's the use of 3 year warranty???Don't go for this brand, better buy some other good brand monitor, even If you have to pay little bit more"
5,After getting my replacement of my damaged display monitors i am very happy and after one year of rough usage the monitor works liye the first day it is the best mid ranged monitor and i am very happy to buy theseThank you Amazon my love for you will be always there
1,"I bought this monitor 4 months ago and not gonna lie the product was pretty good until one day the monitors screen got cracked. Honest mistake right? It could happen to anybody! So i did what anyone would do and called the toll free to ask for non warranty service, since they said that this cant be done under warranty. I have tried calling various service centers of acer and all of them tell me that they do not service monitors. I called the HO and try to issue a complain and the representative called me to tell me that if i gave it to them it'll cost as much as buying a new monitor. Honestly, i am still paying emi for this crap. This isnt really a review on how the product is but even if you buy this and by mistake something does happen to it . Say goodbye to your money. These ppl dont care after the product is sold. Think about it before buying because multiple brands are there and they'll probably give you a better service."
4,"Great 144hz affordable monitor. The VA is amazing in terms of colour production as compared to a TN panel.I play CS, PUBG and APEX nowadays. This monitor does the job pretty well.Don't get confused with 4ms response time. It doesn't make much of a difference as you can't even tell the difference.In a nutshell,+144hz+4ms+freesync+VA panel+curved monitor (new but great experience)+great colors compared to TN"
4,"So for those wondering about 1080p 144hz on hdmi ( u can get it but this monitor doesnt allow) so to get 144hz on hdmi go to nvidia control panel setup custom resolution change it to 144hz ,and change the dropdown menu to manual and u can run 144hz on hdmi because theoretically hdmi should support 144hz .THIS MAY VOID WARRANTY(I AM NOT SURE) SO DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK . And enjoy 144hz on hdmi laptop users.So , about backlight bleed i didn't have any backlight bleed i got very good panel and colors looks good but black looks weird. OSD controls are very good . If you get bleeding panel or some defects replace it worth it for the money. In just got it today so i cant say anything about longevity."
4,"PROS1) 144 Hz. (not adaptive) (constant)2) Curved 1800.3) Good brightness.4) Has separate headphone jack.CONS1) Has an adapter.2) VA panel, so colours are not good.3) In box cables give out static to GFX card (sometimes).4) Only 1 joystick in the back, no separate on/off button.5) Top and sides 1 cm bezels, not good for matrix display.6) 4 ms displayGOOD for beginner gamersCan go for 165 hz 1ms display"
5,"I have been using this curved monitor for a sometime now.THOUGHTS: Keep in mind that the product is targeted to budget consumers so do not expect to perform like an expensive monitor.COLOR/ACCURACY: It's a VA panel with 4ms of response. Acceptable for its price. Brightness and color accuracy is good but little inferior to msi or samsung monitors that I have used in the past. All within acceptable range.Custom profiles can be set to users liking.REFRESH RATE: Through hdmi upto 120hz output is available at 1080p. Refresh rate also varies on the version of hdmi cable being used (hdmi 1.0 or 2.0). Through display cable upto 144hz is available at 1080p.MONITOR TECHNOLOGY (FREESYNC & GSYNC): Yes it's a free-sync monitor and will work with all AMD cards. It works with gsync too. However there is one minor concern that can be easily ignored (not to be confused with a defect). When gsync is on, I observed faint screen flickering when using cinebench or gigabyte's system information viewer (to control fan speed/temperature). Only the black, grey and white areas of the screen would flicker as long as the programs are kept open on desktop. Your mileage may vary.SOLUTION: Turning off such programs or minimizing them will stop the flickering till you open the mentioned programs again. If you wish no flickering at all turning off gsync (from nvidia control panel) would solve it completely. Again It's not a defect. The VA panel used in the monitor has not been validated by nvidia to be used with gsync (as mentioned in nvidia control panel). For more information check out videos available in youtube. Nvidia is aware of this and has already addressed it in 2019. No flickering observed when playing games or using daily programs or watching movies/videos with gsync on.BACKLIGHT BLEEDING: Some users complained of receiving units with backlight bleeding. It's not a manufacturing defect...not necessarily. Sometimes a design flaw can also be the cause. It all depends on the manufacturing standards how they want to channel the light on screen with minimal leakage to the sides reducing bleeding effect. Mine works just fine.Overall a good product to be used as a daily driver."
5,"Best VFM 32 inch 1440p 144hz VA panel on the market, atleast in the Indian market that is. Nothing of equal spec monitor can be had for below 50k. Better alternatives maybe had for even less elsewhere but in India an alternative  monitor like this with similar spec can only be had for around 50k. Certain buyers experiencing horrible backlight bleeding, luckily for me no such case here. no noticeable ghosting either. deep rich black with was not possible with my 24 inch ips display."
5,"Was very skeptical to get this due to the range of negative reviews, but after lots of research decided to take the plunge and was pleasantly surprised with the quality (although my expectations were minimal due to the price). As usual Amazon's delivery was fast, got it with 10% discount for 11.7k. This is undoubtedly the best <20k 144Hz Curved Monitor, nothing comes close with all aspects considered. For the price you pay, you are getting an above average monitor which is simply scintillating (assuming you can get past minimal issues which do not affect your everyday use)"
5,"144 hz, 3-4 ms, free sync (compatible with both nvidia and amd), 27inch curve, va panel all these things approx 20000 rupees. No dead pixel spotted yet. Might be best budget monitor for students or games. My personal rating arePicture 10/9 (due to va panels)Response time 10/10Input lag 10/8Brightness 10/7Value for money 10/8 ( indian sellers sold their goods at higher prices compared with international sellers)Refresh rate 10/10Free sync 10/10 ( i have 1060 and it still working as gsync monitor)Note - light bleeding is an issue  - acer provide it‚Äôs warrantyBest alternative- samsung cfg73 model, asus vg279q (alltho these high in price)"
4,Good monitor.. one less star for one stuck pixel
1,"Heavy Backlight bleeding, it's very irritating to use monitor for low light pictures,games,movies..."
5,This monitor is a treasure left in open to be explored !!Initially I was not impressed by either the picture quality or gaming performance.But as I explored and played with settings !I can say for certain that this is the best all round 1080p monitor in market right now !!!1. For fps gaming turn pixel overdrive to extreme.2. For best picture/text clarity turn off pixel overdrive and set colours to normal.3. For super sharp movie content like 1080p /2k/4k content follow these settings:  ->Do things in step 2 and follow rest from below.....  a> turn contrast to 60.  b> balck boost to 5.  c> turn on super sharpness.  d> use normal colour mode.  e> set brightness to 80%+.  Ezzz best possible experience ever........
4,"I'll keep this sort and simple. I'm not a tech reviewer, so I can't go into depth regarding blacks and nits, and other nitty gritty details a lot of you may be looking for. But I have been gaming for nearly two decades now, and this monitor is a freaking game changer.Set up was pretty easy, and apart from the display port cable that did not work out of the box, I had no issues setting this one up. However if like me, you do have to connect this monitor to an HDMI cable, set the refresh rate in your games to 120hz and NOT 144hz till you get a proper DP cable. My monitor kept losing temporary signal to my games till I dropped my refresh rate to 120.I've also never used a curved monitor before and was a bit apprehensive, but I was sold the minute I booted this one up. If anything, I started wondering how I've gamed on a non-curved monitor all my life.To test this monitor out, I ran the usual suspects like Doom Eternal and COD: MW, and they performed really well. Doom Eternal felt like a new freaking game and impressed me the most. I even tried out Division 2 and holy crap, that game looks mind blowing - especially during the night in New York. Finally, I loaded up some Forza Horizon 4 and didn't expect a higher refresh rate to really wow me, but damn, was I wrong. Racing through England's country side never felt better.Like many of you, I was on the fence for this monitor since I haven't read any credible reviews, but after spending a whole day with this monitor, I'm very happy so far. Guys I know have told me to hold off judgement for at least a month or so, so I guess I'll report back then. But in the meantime, I'm extremely happy with this purchase."
3,"There is heavy back-light bleeding all across the edges and cornersViewing angles are poor. Image quality is ok at 60Hz with a lot of tuning of image settings.At 120Hz it seems to switch to a TFT display mode and the colors are really bad.If you are looking for a budget display just for gaming, then this will do the job. Otherwise it is a waste of money...spend 30-40% more and get a better displayUpdate : Feb 2021Displays are just dumb mirrors of GPUs. After switching from gtx750Ti to rtx3070 and switching from an old hdmi cable to display port, I am able to get the maximum promised performance (144Hz@2K). Previously I used to get max 120Hz@1K and 60Hz@2K. Image quality is significantly better now with the 3070 card."
1,Pathetic monitor useless.It doesn't let me got into bios. Don't know why really did a mistake buying this really would not recommend it to anyone. First they send a defective piece and not I got a monitor I don't know what the hell is wrong. Seriously I can not my pc into bios from my old monitor but not from this
5,"Got delivered with in  2 days, decent packing pretty solid stand made with aluminium I think, more than satisfied with this monitor first time experiencing 144hz, iam using 1050ti with ryzen 5 1600 iam getting 100 to 120 fps average in every latest games at 1080p at low settings ( in box 1dp ,1 hdm,1dvi, 1 power cables available) I'll give more review after 1 month"
2,"Fully disappointed with the purchase, it has huge backlight bleeding issue, already replaced but same thing arrived, its using so called VA panel which I think is class B rated so the company offering soch a competitive price."
5,"I was sceptical about buying this monitor. As I read lots of bad reviews about dead pixels and screen quality issues. After lot‚Äôs of research i come down to three options aopen, lg ips with 75mhz refresh rate and Samsung curved quantum dot. Lg is cheapest one but it t has lots of bad reviews and has only 75mhz refresh rate that I don‚Äôt think as upgrade. Samsung one is too costly so decided to buy this. I m not sure but aopen and Samsung using same panels or screen technology . Brought this on diwali sale and wait for 20days too see if i come across any issues mentioned in other reviews. And i m glad that device is working fine. There are minor blacklight bleed but its not noticeable. As this one is not IPS panels is was worried about colour vividness. But when i test some YouTube video on this monitor i was impressed with its wide range or colour . Curve features of this monitor but is bit useless for at least 24‚Äù I guess if u buy 32inch screen it may feel more immersive with curve. Overall i can say product is good and definitely recommended."
4,Overall a good monitor for the price.Mine has one dead pixel but works great otherwise.
2,"This monitor is good only to watch HD videos and 2k videos or movies in a curved display. Will not recommend it for Gaming.I am using AMD 3600, GTX 1660, 16GB Ram, turned ON free sync and linked with G-sync as Nvidia started support all the adaptive displays. But game flickers a lot, if you have a AMD GPU you can give a try but you need also consider the backlight bleeding out of the box and black uniformity is not good. If you are watching dark scenes, it's messing up. I returned the product. You can check for Samsung 24 inch 144hz curved monitor on same price range or LG 24 Flat 144hz for same price."
5,"This monitor is just amazing for 11.7kPros:1. Great Colours2. 144hz super smooth screen3. Joystick controller on back4. Solid metal stand5. Curved screenCons:Only one: Doesnt come with vesa mount support.Other thoughts:Unlike many other reviewers, my model didnt have any backlight bleed issue. Also the review posted with backlight bleed issue is taken with full brightness(no one does that) and in a dark environment. When I do same as the review, I too see 'some' issues but not noticable at all when doing any other thing than whole black screen.Great deal I got there for 11.7k in a sale with debit card discount too. So I would advice you to wait for a sale as it happens usually every month."
4,"Bought this monitor for my 2016 MBP 15"" and works flawlessly.Design is outdated with clunky buttons and thick bezels, but that display, oh boy! Is very good.This is my first ever HDR display and it makes MBP screen's colors look a bit washed away. My laptop screen is noticeably sharper(Especially for 1080p content), thanks to its nearly twice dense ppi, but for 4k content this monitor is very good!A usb hub would have made this a perfect monitor, but I was planning on getting a thunderbolt dock anyway. Read some online reviews opining that this is a better display compared to  similarly priced acer et322qk."
5,"In all aspects (Quality, Performance, Price, etc) this monitor is better. Those who are looking for 32-inch UHD can consider this one.This monitor doesn't offer PIP, PBP features which is not a deciding factor for me."
5,"31.5 inches of real estate, 4K, USB-C and HDR (though the brightness isn't enough to really call it true HR, you need minimum 500 nits for that).You can't ask for more at a price of 33-34k.The display is gorgeous, and thanks to the incredible contrast ratio of 3000:1, you can even use it as a smart TV with a Firestick 4K or Mi Box 4k (I got this).I'm a designer so I got it because of the color accuracy and it delivers perfectly. I can barely distinguish the colours from my 16"" MacBook Pro display.Keep in mind, it's a VA panel and not IPS panel so you might feel the colours are not as punchy but again, the contrast ratio (3000:1) is a lot superior (IPS panels usually have 1000:1) as a result which means your blacks look closer to black than dark greys you see on IPS monitor panels."
4,"Removed one star because benq neither provide app for monitor settings nor for split screen.Its VA Panel so images degrades slightly if viewed at an angle.Blacks are much deeper and uniform than IPS panel, loves it. Just like IPS glow on IPS panel, there is very very little VA glow, doesnot bother much. Audio is pathetic.Its really better than LG 32UD59 (VA panel) in image quality. which costs Rs 45k.Monitor is too heavy that my table mount monitor  arm can't handle it."
4,"I wanted to get a big monitor for software development.My requirement was:1. A 4k panel, preferably IPS2. 32 or 34 inch3. Eye care features like higher refresh rate (although I am not a gamer)4. Good ergonomics - height, tilt, rotate5. Acceptable sound6. Budget up to 40kSadly, No monitor ticked all my needs. After spending too much time comparing all available options in my budget, finally ordered this. Other contenders were Benq PD3200Q and LG Ultragear 32. Dropped due to 2k resolution. Since 2k at 32 inch is same as full hd at 24 inch (my existing monitor).Went with Benq EW3270U, since it it has 4k resolution and eye care features. The shortcomings were not major factors for me.Review:1. Display: Very good for programming. I have scaled up the sizes of items by 100% using windows settings. Still I can see two files side by side. Big test is easier on the eyes.2. Auto brightness: Tried it at night. It was too bright for me. So turned off and manually reduced brightness to 20.3. Adjustments: My table is a bit too tall. This monitor doesn't have height adjustment. So I need to look up. Will get a separate monitor stand to fix this.4. Connectivity: Tried HDMI. One slot didn't work - didn't detect signal. Second one worked, but resolution was only full HD. Switch to USB 3 cable, and working fine. Only problem is that the supplied USB 3 cable is short.5. Sound: Surprise! Many reviewers have said that sound is too low. I found that there is a setting in monitor controls to adjust volume. By default, they have set it to 30% (stupid decision IMO). I increased it to 100%, and it is louder than I can tolerate."
2,The monitor in itself is just mind blowing. But a cluster of dead pixel right in center of screen. I saw on Benq website they dont replace panel in warranty if there are less than 6 dead pixels. This is just unacceptable. So I returned it the day after. Although the resolution is so high that u cant notice in daily use. But you will definetley notice when something white or light appears on screen over dead pixels
5,"Monitor is big. It's like you have 4 16 inch monitors together. great for productivity. But, it will take time to adjust.I mainly bought for office work, i don't play any games.Main thing to remember is cables given with the monitor are fully futuristic and you may not be able to use immediately.Cable 1: Both sides USB type C of USB 3.1Cable 2: Monitor side DP port, laptop side mini DP.I wasn't able to use both cables to connect monitor to laptop even though my laptop is very recent laptop.My laptop which is Lenovo X390 only has USB type A USB 3.1 and a HDMI port.So, i had to buy another HDMI cable to use the monitor.28 inch variant of the same monitor comes with a DP port on both sides though.Another disadvantage is there is no height adjustment or side adjustment. Only adjustment is -5 to 15 facing adjustment.Just 4 days now, will update review after rigorous usage.Review after a week. I have a lenovo thinkpad x390 and lenovo thinkpad thunderbolt 3 dock. Monitor is not getting detected automatically on connecting to dock. Manually i have to remove the cable and reconnect to detect after starting the laptop. If i restart, settings are retained, but if i shut down, settings are lost and again on starting laptop, i have to manually remove the cable and connect again."
5,"First of all, this is an amazing monitor for the price! I highly recommend it if you do a creative works as a profession/hobby which requires color accuracy. I do 3D art and work with colours a lot and this monitor is just a lot of fun to work with! I'm coming from a FHD monitor and experiencing this 4k monitor is just amazing, everything is super crisp and clear!That being said you will have to do some color calibration on the monitor. The whites and gamma on the monitor were absolutely trash when I turned it on for the first time. Colours were okay though. The white balance is completely off and is orange-redish.  The gamma is off too and makes everything looks washed out, blacks appear grey, etc. I don't have a colour calibration tool but I managed to do it with the windows colour management software. If you have a pre calibrated monitor at home, you can use that as a reference like how I did.After calibration, the monitor is just amazing. It left me speechless. 100% recommend you to colour calibrate the monitor.I've attached images, A is calibrated, B is before calibration. Images were shot with manual exposure, white balance and ISO. It's not an accurate representation but should give you an idea."
1,"after going through lot of reviews, I decided to buy this monitor and I bought it on 25th Apr 2021.Things went well for first two weeks, and then the worst happened. I am seeing vertical lines from the last 10 days though i didnt move the monitor and i kept that monitor on a heavy-sized table (5x3ft).I dont know what to do with this piece, I am thinking to throw away this one and buy some other brand monitor."
5,Good value for money. Picture quality is very good. Large size is very good for coding development and general office use. Connected using USB-C to my MBP and it works Without any issues. With default settings the fonts are too small; too small to read- increase the scaling from Display settings of your MacOS and it gets much better. Lot of room for multiple windows. Planning to get one more to make dual monitor setup. Speakers are below average and no USB hub either. It‚Äôs disadvantage. BenQ should‚Äôve added atleast two USB ports making it convenient to connect or charge your phones. One other disadvantage: Even if you connect MBP via USB-C MacOS reports the battery is not charging. Overall good monitor for the price.
5,Using it for my PS5. It has very crispy and colorful display. HDR works great and even the eye sensor is very accurate.No issues with eye strain or colors being displayed inaccurately.Very good monitor for this price range. Amazon took around 10 days to deliver it to Mumbai.
4,"I have been using the monitor for 2 months now, and it has not given me any problems. The build quality is good. Sound quality could have been better, but for a monitor that costs only Rs 32,000, this is a minor nitpicking. Overall, great monitor. Go for it."
5,"Using it for my hackintosh setup, and gives u the retina display at 2k resolution. Colours are accurate, brightness is more than enough, HDR is a hit and miss. Fits in well with the wfh setup and being 32"", really does help manage organising windows very well."
5,"Great Picture quality thin bezel, sturdy stand with multiple ports (2xHDMI, 1x DP, 1x USB-C, headphone socket.The colours are great with good saturation. Probably one of the best 32"" 4K monitor at this price."
5,"The product is really good, since the size it little big it can give you a pain in the neck.Resolution is excellent, but without windows scaling it will be difficult to see the text. But on higher scale its crisp and clear. Not all softwares are scalable, text can be blurry sometimes.For programming I say better go for a 2k resolution antiglare monitor, that should be a best buy coz the text gets real small in this 4k displays.For entertainment this will be perfect buy."
4,"Well this monitor is not meant for gaming. You can still play games with vivid details @4k, but due to low refresh rates, response and fluidity wont be like other gaming monitors.HDR in 4K is just cherry on top.For media consumption this Monitor just hits all the right points."
5,"The BenQ monitor is awesome. However, do note that you need to buy a separate hdmi that supports 18Gbps+ speeds for 4k display. Also, if you are using Linux, you will not get 60Hz, which is my case. I think drivers in Linux are responsible for that and not the monitor.Thank you."
5,Awsome monitor. Got what I was expecting. Note that before buying check whether your laptop/desktop supports 4k output. Otherwise it will show only 2k or HD resolution. Dell Inspiron 3521 doesnt support 4k output.
4,Product packaging is goodDelivered on timeBlue eye is Good for office workFinds it good for learning purposeSpeaker is not audible even at close distanceMissing height adjustment is bit minus but not required in most cases as the screen size is bigger.
5,"Hdmi cable Missing .. only 3 cables (power, type C, Display cable)Good all in one entertainment monitor.Able to play in 4k ..cool"
5,I bought this monitor for my series x and it's awesome thank you benq
5,"probably the best for the price. Because it's not ips panel ,viewing angles are not good but very good contrast ,sharp and clean display, no edge bleed, accurate blacks."
3,"If you are using a MacBook Pro like me, you would hate this display. The VA panel just can't give you good colours and the viewing angles are very poor. Go for any IPS monitor instead."
5,"The picture quality is excellent and it's a joy to use a 31 inch 4k screen. Volume is a little low, but a very good monitor, probably better than most others available for the same price"
5,Good
5,Good value for money
5,Breathtaking views and ideal for both gaming and multitasking. Videos come alive with the screen. Though it could improve with colors at an angle.
5,"Good display and great picture quality , and better colour representation"
5,"Excellent monitor, nice and decent, value for moneyDead pixel - not found in naked eyes :)Thank you BenQ and Amazon both."
4,Nice but.. Big size. Not compatible
5,Amazing!
4,‚ò∫Ô∏è
1,I just purchased this monitor today and it's screen starts to flicker after just 30 seconds of booting up. Can someone help me why does this happen.
3,"This monitor has a VA Panel. I had read that the viewing angles of a VA panel are bad, and I saw it in action on this monitor.It is a nice monitor, good colors, but you HAVE to look straight at it. The image washes out when viewed from an angle of even 60 degrees.This is good as a primary monitor, but not as a second monitor.My suggestion is to stick to monitors with IPS Panels if you would like to use it as a second monitor, and would end up looking at it from a slight angle."
2,After 2 weeks of Delay due to some shipping issues because of some external errors I received the package with some dents and scratches probably used one or returned item(You can see the pics for proof). I‚Äôve asked 3 times to seller(could be manufacturer himself) about the laptops weight capacity all 3 times received a positive response saying that it‚Äôd hold my laptop as such. But after things are being assembled(thanks for detailed and clear instructions) I found out that laptop stand goes down to the table though things are fitted properly. Here comes the monitor arm issue. As the mount bracket and it‚Äôs holder doesn‚Äôt have proper gripping monitor is facing downwards a bit. Am not sure whether to expect a perfection for this price or the product should justify the price.
5,"Sturdy, supports as stated. Good enough for 20 to 24-inch monitors and a decent size laptop. The typing angle is a bit odd but then the whole idea is to get away from the screen as much as possible which means there should be an external keyboard and mouse to support. Which is good since gives a very ergonomic posture and sitting. Screens are on eye level and you need to bend too much giving you a pain-free back after 10 to 11 hours of screen time. Recommended for IT and ITES folks, who have a normal screen time of 10 to 12 hours a day."
5,"Writing the review after 1 month use.Took at least an hour to fully assemble.It is a VFM product , very sturdy.However, laptop tray not very strong enough, shakes if used laptop keyboard.Got it for Rs 4,150.I would recommend this for all who works on two screens."
5,"I was hesitant given that similar models were available for 10k INR. The make is top notch and you can tell by the weight (its heavy!). Assembly takes a bit of effort depending on where you are fixing it. The only thing I miss in this model is the ability to adjust height without having to mess around with the screws. A few plastic items are included to manage cables and secure the laptop - they are of very low quality, but they don't impact the overall structure of the mount so no concerns there. 10/10 would recommend."
4,"I had a small computer desk i needed a extra monitor for my laptop since bought this product now everything fits well i have a 27 inch monitor and 15 inch laptop both are now adjusted will enough space for keyboard, mouse and a  coffee mug :) , only con is its bit complex to install took me more than a hour to align properly, but once set its all good."
4,"One of the VESA mount holders (360¬∞ rotating head - in the arm) was loose, had to get a replacement. Even the replacement has the same problem.The price I bought was 4150, now the price seems jumped up to 5500 which makes it expensive. The laptop tray is very neat and sturdy. Useful for those needing multi monitor setup."
5,5 üåü for build quality. Utility is great. Very much value for money.Challenge is it took quitw a bit of time to assemble and hard hinges.
4,"Overall, it is an excellent product. And value for the money.Pros:1. Flexible and allows a lot of adjustment2. Uses standard Vesa mount for monitor. Mine was not VESA compatible, so I purchased rife's vesa adapter.3. Saves a lot of space.4. Assembly instructions and all necessary equipment is provided.Cons:1. Need to assemble the product manually. It took me a couple of hours to assembleOverall excellent product and very good for WFH. Especially if you are low on desk space"
5,Amazing piece of art. Job well done Lumi
5,Great Value for Money Product... Buy it before it gets famous and expensive :)Quality is top notch and price is very less if compared with other...Thumbs Up!!!
5,This is the first purchase I did for Lumi stands. Work from home changed for me once I installed the stand. Allowing complete ergonomics for long hours while still being able to focus on work.Thank you merchant for your support and service.
5,"best at this price point. used it for a day now, assembling is a fun DIY, sterdy and got a lot of table space after installation! worth the investment"
5,"The lumi brateck pairs laptop and pc screens perfectly to make working from home a piece of cake. It's strong, easy to install and offers plenty of flexibility. Making zooms calls, learning online, researching for articles an enjoyable and relaxed experience. Go for it if you need a command centre experience!"
1,"Laptop Tray Installation Components mismatch in size. The Tray becoming Useless, the whole product becomes useless."
2,Product works....but quality could be better. One of the screws cracked within a week of use.
1,"Missing a parts(screws M,O,L)  poor packaging"
5,"Good. Assembly is tough,but worth it. Instructions ought to be more simpler."
5,Good. Heavy duty and functions well.
5,Received product as detailed on the page. Happy with the ergonomics arrangements finally.
5,Using this i have easily organized my workstation. Nice product Highly Recommended
5,Easy to build and well documented. Good quality
5,Value for money
5,very good product i am satisfy with product its too greatvery good product i am satisfy with product its too great
5,"Value for money Took me a little time to set it. Once done, its quite sturdy You get what it claims."
4,Nice and worth for money
5,"I received the package , 2 days after ordering. All components were present: Monitor, stand, power cable, VGA cable. The monitor's plug and play function really was helpful as all the device drivers were installed automatically. Everything is in working condition."
2,overall product is not that good as i expected ..... this comes with no power cable ..... i had to buy it separately..... only vga/d-sub input.... i would give it a 3 or 4 star if it comes with power cable.... its a headache almost.....
1,"This is E2016HV not E2016H model. If you are looking monitor having 170 degree viewing angle then this is not that item. Be clear before you order.Cons:1. Over bright2. Over contrast3. More whitish color. You cant pure black on this screen.4. Viewing angle is 90 degree5. Seller wrote wrong information. He is sending Dell E2016HV model6. Painful for eyes if you are sitting long time.Pros:Not interested to write, but below given by Dell customer care center.1. Improvised model2. Consume less power. This monitor have good quality in colorIf you have used any Dell 20 inch monitor, don't get misguided with this product."
4,Screen
1,It's not led.its LCD.
3,"I didnt get a stamped warranty card and instalation CD for my new dell E2016HV monitor..please advice me ,how can I get a warranty without warranty card.The display quality is average and ....amazon did it realy a LED monitor....I dont think so,antiglare feature is not there ..I didnt expect it from amazon.."
3,"On the first occasion I got a defective product, which Amazon replaced (sadly we don't have option of return). After replacement product was working OK but it's an old technology TN screen and the effects are bluntly visible. Very poor viewing angle, even a slight tilt from perfect 90 can cause change in colours. You can see the difference in shades in the attached photos. It's annoying. It has settings for Cool, Warm etc. shades but none seem good enough for my eyes and I had to manually adjust the brightness and contrast. Only connectivity option is serial cable which is a big disappointment. No speakers as well. I believe cheap things come at there own price."
1,"This monitor is really dull. You would want to beat it and bring it to life.Picture quality is not good. Sharpness is alright. Overall it‚Äôs a strain on your eyes to keep looking at it. Dell‚Äôs predecessors on LCD monitors were really good, not sure if it‚Äôs Dell‚Äôs strategy to make people buy the more expensive LED monitors. With continuous use you‚Äôll get used to it, but it‚Äôs blaring evident that the monitor is not a good make. And unfortunately you CANNOT return this item but only get a replacement of the same one."
4,This product is value for money but in this package missing of CD. So when you install this product on your PC that time you need to download this product driver that a negative point but not a Dil breaking overall the product is good for day to day using.
5,"My main objective buying this is for working, I have WFH option and wanted to make my work place at home look similar to my office. This monitor does what it's meant and is very pleasing in terms of viewing. I initially thought the product was damaged as the screen looked like having a whitish bright area in the centre only to later realize that it was just my imagination and had something to do with initial connectivity. The packing was on par and was neatly covered. Amazon did it's part in sending the product in 2 days time. Highly recommended."
5,"Very good Screen Size and compatible with CPU's of different makes and models. Very good display and Power saving mode facility.  I am yet to adjust the Brightness and Contrast as it took me some time to figure them out. Delivered well within the timelines and on Time, and neatly packaged and wrapped up. Certainly Worth The Money for what it has been offered. Thanks for the Price discount, Very much appreciated & recommended. Thank You !"
1,Doesn't come with power cable...also don't have HDMI...better to go with other brand ...waste of money..
4,"I needed a monitor to complete my PC build but since having spent most of my budget on system components, I had to cheap out on the screen(get a lower priced screen). This one offered decent specs at the price and a resolution of 1600x900 at 60Hz and screen brightness at 250 nits, is absolutely fine if you're in a similar situation or looking for a secondary monitor. It has a down side though, it doesn't have an HDMI port and only has a single VGA port, very restricted. Other than that, it is a great product, value for money."
1,This product is the Worst viewing angle. Please don't buy this. I want my money back please help. Please replace this product with another product and i would definitely buy. I want my refund now. Please help me out with this. please.
1,"Original product had to be replaced within a month of delivery because of color bleed. Replacement product has multiple color bleed patches within 5 to 6 months of replacement. Bad product. Tried reaching Dell technical service, post troubleshooting they said, monitor will be replaced, later they said the monitor was damaged. Requested for physical inspection of the monitor to establish it was indeed damaged. With no damage / signs of it, being told it was damaged was not a happy situation.... 3 years warranty being claimed by Dell is defunct, they just don't honor it. ***Don't by this product***"
1,Worst picture quality please don‚Äôt buy looking at the rating as like me.The first image is from the dell screen and the second image is from my laptop and here easily you can see the difference
5,"Ordered from Amazon this model and Team Amazon delivered well before the date promised....This is definitely a good monitor if you get it around rs 6K . Useful as an additional monitor ( to extend your laptop screen)  or in small shops at point of sale etc.Used it for the last 3 days and works as expected.The only downside being  - Height not adjustable ( does not matter much) and no HDMI port (use VGA to HDMI connector cord for that). If you ignore these two aspects,  this is definitely a good monitor in this range.Colors / Brightness can be adjusted very easily.Overall, good experience , see pic."
1,"This is a useless product in fact they cheat you by passing on such dangerous to use and low quality products.Donot trust everything sold on Amazon.Before I could find out defects,return window was closed.Anyways it‚Äôs too bright,glare is unbearable and you can‚Äôt see anything while viewing at an angle. I am going to buy another one.Waste of money"
5,"The 19.5 inch LED Monitor is of amazing quality, delivered within 2 days with all the accessories.Picture Quality on 1080p is excellent, the power saving works good.Installation is easy, just like another Comouter Monitor."
4,Its a decent budget monitor. We cant expect much out of it. It has only via connector. Best monitor to buy for this price range. If it has a HDMI i will give 5 star
4,"It's big! Really big for the price. But it lacks ips display and the color scheme is not good. I could clearly see the difference since i use dual monitors. I replaced it a friend of mine. Because when you are using dual monitors you need to see the same color on both monitors.So, if you r buying it for dual monitor then please don't buy. Go for Samsung with IPS display. Extra 1-2k will not go in vain."
1,The box is written 1600√ó900p but the screen can run on 1920√ó1080p
2,it is just a monitor .  very much disappointed after seeing the image quality . No colour in depth. u can see a dull an a defaced Image quality  . local brand can give better image quality and clarity than this . Dont waste money in this size and range.
3,"If you are planning to buy this product only for computer purpose then it is value for money product. But if you are planning to use it for multi function means for computer and for watching videos, movies etc. then you will be disappointed little bit because you can see movies etc only if you are in the front of screen. Video will not be clear with change of angel (Negative appearance)"
1,"I am totally not satisfied with the picture quality, since  I am not able to see the screen/pictures from side views and also some 2 mtr distance it is showing like  negative pictures, faces are not able see and head is not visible, in totally I am notice able to recognise the person."
5,Wow it was good Monitor.VGA cable and Power cable both are inside that's petty surprise for me.I recommended to all with this price worth to buy.
4,"Overall great value for money. But there is some problem with colour contrast. Unable to see light blue colours. For instance when I select some tabs in excel or click on something in chrome, it does not turn blue."
1,"Defective product stopped working next day. Please do not sell defective/repaired items, otherwise people will lose trust in online shopping. I am glad Amazon gave me a full refund. I got a nice monitor from flipkart instead."
3,Amazon is saying it's LED but it's LCD. The problem with this monitor is that you can not get good quality of picture if you are viewing screen from side. You have to tilt the screen according to your sitting position.
5,Good product in 5k price range19.5 inch display with a little washed off colours!But I suppose that‚Äôs what is to be expected in this price range :)Base is little worrying as it‚Äôs not fixed properly to the stand
1,This is not LED monitor and no matter what setting you try text will appear blurry on this monitor.  First i thought its my computer issue but no after testing on other Pcs result is same.  You have been warned.
5,"Go to my YouTube channel ""current technical news"" and see its unboxing video. Thanks"
1,"picture quality is very poor, when compared to older dell monitorsand there is no display port as mentioned in product title.. just VGA portbetter to spend some more money and buy better quality monitor"
5,Picture quality is A-class but then again I have a affinity for Dell displays. Has had no faults till date. Two years and going strong.
5,Working fine till now after I received the monitor packed in well manner. I recommend this product for every kind of usage with desktop PC. I am actually using it as an additional display with my laptop and experiencing good.
4,Nice clarity.. Easy to set up and operate.. Good purchase for this price and perfect for Office and everyday Use with decent looking design and good build quality.
1,Cannot view from all the angleI have to sit right front of the monitor....I am cheated because there is no money back guarantee for electronic items...
5,"Awesome product at great value. Felt 24"" could have been great.. totally worth it if you are budget conscious. Got everything like power cable, VGA cable.."
5,"It's a really nice monitor, we can adjust it according to the temperature. So cool it is.It's been a year and half, it works really well with my both laptops at a time, no complaints, all goodü§üü§ü"
1,Panl is Brocaned
4,"Hi,Talking about the unique selling point (usp) of this monitor, its the response time.For gamingRemeber, a faster response time is not all a good gaming monitor needs, it does need higher refresh rate too, which this monitor lacks(75 hgz) which is still considered good at this price point though.Full HD LCD- Most monitors till date are LCD with LED/WLED(same) backlit.Its the panel which makes difference.3 panels found in monitors are IPS, VA, TNThis one have TN, which is cheapest among above 3 mentioned so its cost effective.TN have fastest response time but lack picture quality.This monitor is only for gaming or normal office/home browsing. Please avoid if anyone is looking for graphical, imaging, visual work."
5,Got it for gaming and video watching. I carry it with me when I'm traveling with my rig! The speakers were a good surprise! Been using them almost exclusively (no other speakers) but then I'm not very finicky about audio. The screen itself is the best I've had in a while.
4,"1. The monitor is as described in the Item description. Picture quality is good and the viewing angles are alright ( Used HDMi cable) .2. Easy Installation and It got delivered with the Indian Power cable , so there was no worries about plugging it straight away.3. Plenty of options to change the settings on this one and can be done with ease.I haven't played any games as i am yet to build my PC. Will review gaming performance post PC build.I had selected next day delivery for this monitor but there was some issue at Courier's end and wasn't delivery on the 1st day. So reducing 1 star for it."
3,"I really liked its vivid, vibrant colors. Coming from a Dell monitor, this felt glorious to my eyes in Mass Effect Andromeda. But the screen fonts are all very blurred and jagged and I couldn't fix that with Windows 10 ClearType adjustment. Text scaling settings did not help either. Tried installing its drivers from Asus website but Windows rejects them because apparently the drivers are not signed. Windows 10 (1903) does not have inbuilt drivers for it either and detects it as a Generic PnP display. Honestly, this is the first occasion in my 20 years of computing that I had to look for drivers for a monitor. And when I did look for them, I couldn't find one that works. But thankfully, I need this only for gaming and not for browsing or wordprocessor, so it doesn't matter to me.Worked perfectly for my PS4 too.Speakers: I connected this for PS4 on HDMI for gaming video and audio. But the speakers are very poor. Think of them as very loud headphones, very tinny. That's it. Even cheap ~Rs.500 desktop speakers work better than them and you can forget gaming on the inbuilt speakers."
4,"A great monitor for my ps4, pictures are crisp and clear, the colors in this monitor surpassed my expectations. I have been using this monitor for over 9 months, no problems found. Cool product"
4,"Very good for gaming. Zero lag with PS4 Pro. But, the details in the display cannot equal IPS Panels... But we have to sacrifice IPS for higher refresh rates."
5,Nice product Asus Go for it Works well competitive pricing
4,"I think the monitor is good but would have been better if:1. HDMI cable is included.2. better arrangement is available for the two cables at the rear ie are secured properly instead of being loose & open to damage.3 Its a fairly big monitor for a desktop & work. On a desk, better if it stays farthest from the eyes. A stand designed to keep it closest to the wall of the cubicle would help.4. There is scope of improvement in Audio quality.5. Gaming I have not tried. Response time is ok but do not how know the refresh rate works for this monitor.overall a good monitorOver all its good."
5,Great display loud sound connected to HDMI.Only single cable is required for both sound and display there is a alternative for for audio of cable and video VGA but HDMI does both of the job great product Asus
3,"Pro: Value for MoneyCons:1. Not a very friendly design, connecting hdmi and power is a task2. If it won't surprise when you wake up to a failed monitor and you are ok to go for another one.3. Finding a service center who can get the failed product service is like a huge task4. If at all you find one and call them, they say they only service laptops and not monitors."
5,Bought two of these to do a multi monitor setup. Super crisp fonts and contrast make it easy to code at low and bright light.
5,"This product is the best for its cost,But the stand of this monitor is not good the monitor shakes a lot even for a little tap.so you can use a wall mount thisBesides that everything is great about this monitor"
5,I just received the monitor in a big box. I'm very happy with the performance of this monitor . I have connected this monitor toMy PS4 and it works well. Only thing I don't like about this is that it has a small power cable :(
5,A great product got it for 7000/- ..really beautiful .... Buttons are bit annoying but my intention is performance gaming  and work ..if the refresh rate is above 75 hz it would have been better ... Screen tearing is one of the noticeable prob... So far so good.
5,Exactly as mentioned in the description. 21.5 inch full HD clear lcd panel with neat picture quality and 1ms response. No flickering and excellent blue light filters (multiple choices)
4,"Picture quality is average. For this price you can get an ips panel monitor which has a better picture quality than this. And if you buy this monitor by considering it's refresh rate, please remember that you can only hit 75hz through it's vga port."
1,"Dislike: Different country of origin written on product actually delivered than that's mentioned in product description on website, so returned it.  Expected same country of origin on delivered product as mentioned on website."
5,Awesome Gaming experience @1ms.
4,This is a very good product and perfect for gaming. There was no dead pixel or any other damage on the monitor. It is a TN panel so the viewing angles are not good but the colors are spot on if you look directly. 1ms of response time! What more can you want for gaming. Thanks ASUS for this wonderful product.
4,Expected stronger sound output. Other than that is a very good monitor at this price range. I use it for my ps4 gaming and it looks great.
5,really good monitor but keep in mind it does not include hdmi cable so u may need to order one but leaving those its the best reallyt the best as 1ms response rate and 70hz approx. refresh rate and for using the speakers we need to join the aux cable which is included dont think it will work with joining only hdmi or vga cable
5,Good product for home use.
5,"Nice product, max refresh rate 75Hz when res is 1440x900 set in custom resolution. Don‚Äôt mess with other settings. Great value for money"
5,Best Value TN Panel
5,"Amazing monitor, only issue is the angle view.. If u see it from any other angle except perpendicular, you wouldn't get perfect view"
5,Excellent monitor. Did the job. Great at its price point.
5,Awesome Product This Pictures Quality Superb & Easy To Installation & ASUS Product Is Performance Is Superb. THANK YOU AMAZON.
5,Value for money
3,Was fine for the first 3 months then it Stopped working. Now I am left with a non-functioning monitor.
5,better  for gaming moniter on this price.. response time as per mention... best for new and low budget gamer.
5,"Its been more than 3 month since i bought this, totally worth the price. No issues tillnow. I use it for playstation 4. Its just worth the price and the picture quality is brilliant. Highly recommended."
2,"Good for gaming, picture quality is also good., audio quality is not upto the mark and the stand of this monitor is not good the monitor shakes a lot even for a little tap"
4,"Monitor is good, but sound is not good enough,"
4,Awesome gaming experience. Good color from all directions. But some are pixelated due to 60hz. But it doesn't matter. I became a pro in csgo
3,There is no HDMI cable given
4,"Monitor speaker volume is very low u need an external speakers, else it's best product"
5,"I am completely satisfied with the product, I placed the order in night and it was delivered by next morning."
5,Lcd monitor not led contrast is very bad
4,Good product 1ms monitor in really good price
5,Bought it for ps4.. Gaming monitor at this price is awesome value for money
3,This  moniter doesnt  include  power  cabel  and  seller  say  that  it  included  ...Pless  dont  misguide  custmer
1,I didn‚Äôt get the Power Chord or the VGA cable as advertised. Hard to imagine how someone can miss some key accessories without which it is totally not usable.
2,"I bought two of these monitors, and none had the power cord. So, if you add the power cord price as well, the it becomes expensive. The viewing angle is poor. Colors are not correct either."
2,I had purchased this monitor for CCTV viewing. The monitor functioned well for a few days after which a display message started appearing regarding my screen resolution. At this point i tried to press the function buttons on the monitor and this is when i realised that other than the power button none of the other function buttons were working
1,"Please dont buy this product. Picture quality is very bad. Picture look better on my less resolution laptop than on this high resolution monitor. I tried connecting this monitor both to low and high resolution laptop but problem is same.  When I asked for a replacement seller ""Cloud Tech IT Solutions"" rejected my request but with amazon intervention they provided the replacement. But even the replacement is not good. So I immediately return it.Please please dont buy this product at least from ""Cloud Tech IT Solutions"". very bad quality."
4,"Received the monitor today. The package was slightly damaged on the outside; however, the monitor was found intact without any damages or defects. The build quality including the plastics is good and the protective material used for packaging is also good. Easy to assemble and power, the monitor was functioning normally on power-up. The display resolution is OK, though not as crisp as my earlier Samsung monitor. The mounting arrangements and cable clamps are good.One important point to be noted is that the monitor IS NOT SUPPLIED with D type VGA cable; however, the power supply and HDMI cables were included with the unit."
1,"I have not received power cable with monitor I arranged it from outside and started using the same, Earlier it was running properly and good but from 2 - 3 days the monitor suddenly started blinking, what should I do. The return window is also closed now."
1,"the package without any Power Cable, not once, but twice!!!Even after raising the request saying clearly that POWER CABLE IS MISSING, it still sent me the same package.Looks like its a bad lot of Monitors from Thailand which doenst has Power cable or indian power cable.ITS PRETTY MUCH USELESS MONITOR!!!"
1,"No i don't think so.I would advise you not to purchase this product. As they don't give proper power cable. And I have bought two and refunded very soon as it lacks many features like USB C port VGA cable was missing , pictures quality and it can't be used as vertical screen. Still they have not refunded my second monitor amount, just because of the customer care they have initiated only one monitor refund but we had discussion for two products on call."
4,As the product says it's just a entry level monitor.It can be used as secondary monitor for your PC üñ• or laptop üíª  for offloading some office work.I will not recommend this a main monitor for game monitor.Drawback - this doesn't come with power cord.  I bought the power cord from local vendor for Rs 60.HDMI cable included.Overall I satisfied.
3,What i am doing without Power & VGA cable. Both are missing i get return back this  product.
4,Very good in this price..vga and power cord not included its may be for cost cutting ..no problem hdmi cable included.good picture quality.
5,VGA cable missing only received HDMI cable and box damage photo attached
3,"The product is only fine for basic stuff. I am getting blur view on the screen and is trying to identify what is the cause of it. However, no power cable came in the box. Have to deal for that as well now :-("
1,"I didn't received the power chord with monitor, in first time ,then I asked for replacement, in replacement item also I didn't get the power chord, now what am I supposed to do, what the heck is going on. A monitor is supposed to be given with power chord. This is really frustrating"
3,"Got the Monitor in good condition, however power cord is missing from the package. Unable to start the monitor"
1,I dislike this product because of power card included the bill but I received this product without power card and Hdmi cable also. I replaced that order too again also cable are not dispatched...
1,"Wrong power cable was sent.HDMI Connector very loose and continuously connects / disconnects.Very faded picture quality.Overall, though it has a brand name, it is very bad & inferior quality."
5,Very good picture quality and color. I got the same as expected.
3,As per your inclided component details power cable and VGA cable missingPlease provide me immidiatly
1,"Naaah...This is not what I wanted,Picture quality is low, images look pixelated, not happy with the purchase, never expected this from such a brand called Lenovo"
4,"Its ok and the pocture quality is decent , but i am happy with this price and price worthy"
5,It is a pretty descent monitor at this price range. It works very good. I would recommend others to buy this monitor if you are low at budget and are looking for an HDMI monitor.
4,Nice product.
4,Power Cable is missing and it is royal pain to reach customer service as they will suggest return entire productSo I bought myself power cable
1,"I did not get powerchord , how come someone be so irresponsible"
1,Power cable is missing. Just a plastic box without it. Not useable.
5,Veri niceüëçüëèüòä
1,2nd hand refurbished product sent with no accessories (not even power cable)Waste of time and money
4,Power cable missing in the box
4,In this price okayLcd monitor with led backliteHdmi and vgA
1,Product is somewhat good but no vga as well as power cable. But while displaying they said they are included. Amazon couldn't allow these kind of sellers.
4,Hdm not working
1,This is a replaced product. Both packages were missing the power cord. I have given up now. Trying to find a three pin power adapter.
1,Unable to use without power chord. Says it is included but I did not receive it
4,"The power cord is not included, and the BOX label also  says so ""1 CORD"" (HDMI) is included , the listing is misleading"
2,This product doesn't have power cable and VGA cabel
5,Very good
3,Power cord was missing.
1,Product was delivered without power cable. I had to buy from outside since don't have time to return/replacement.
1,"Monitor Developed Black Spots after two months of use.  DELL only says 3 year warranty for this monitor but doesn't  seem to honor its commitment as I am yet to get a confirmation for the replacement  faulty product , DELL says it cant honor its warranty as it find the Invoice isn't matching their records  ,Cloudtail isn't bothered to answer and  Amazon after every repeat reminder complaint  asks me to wait ,for 3~5 business days (since last 30 days)  , and every time I am asked to do something and revert back to amazon. This has become a never ending cyclic process and I am feeling frustration why did I ever buy any Product from Online resells if they cant settle between themselves who is responsible to the end Buyer ???"
1,"The product is very bad quality. The power cord port on the monitor was defective since day 1. You have to keep adjusting it by trial and error method for the picture to come. I even tried changing the power cord but the problem is in the port in the monitor itself. Since I opened the package 10 days after it arrived (I was not in the city), I could not get a product replacement. I then contacted the Dell Service Center so that they could help me out by maybe replacing the port. But they were not helpful at all. They just told me nothing can be done about it. I even offered to play money to fix the issue but they said nothing can be done. It was my mistake that I did not check the product within 10 days of delivery since I was out of station. If I had checked it before I'd have definitely sent it back and gotten a replacement. But very poor service from Dell. They refused to do anything about it even after I offered to pay for the repair."
5,"To-day (Sunday) I received this monitor two days in advance. As certified by amazon, seller send the product in decent manner. Thanks for good package and  Inner accessories are packed with good manner. Next the monitor is brand new and accessories are in-tack. I  am writing this review through this new monitor after-auto-manual colour adjustment.  Working good.  Good look with wall mounting facility, Separate adopter for power supply is an advantage and signal supply led indicator with blue blinker is so cool. ( I used CRT samsung monitor from 2004- sill working without any problem. So I preferred the same.  As expected it fulfilled my expectation."
4,"This monitor completed its job having 5ms response time. All i wanted was a monitor that could last some years untill i could buy a 144hz monitor. I was able to boost it to 75hz from 60hz, increased the smoothness a bit. Enjoyed csgo, r6 and many more games. Worth it."
4,"I liked Dell E1916HV Led monitor very much, It's googlooking, very clear pictures & nice performance.Buttons for varied functions @ right hand side are easy accessible. I got urgent delivery by theexpense of only 100 Rs. extra. I am completely satisfied by this product."
1,Power cable for cabinet was not original...although it worked but it was replaced with some local wire and was full of dust...didn't expect this cheating inside sealed boxes
5,"It's really a great product from Dell, worth every paisa"
5,"Good product. Does its job. Very useful as I use my laptop with it. I like working on big screens, so when at home I use it and also a cordless keyboard with mouse. So I believe I get the benefits of a desktop without possessing one."
4,Good but it's LCD. I am expecting LED for this price.
5,Took 4 days to deliver the monitor. But satisfied with the monitor. Built quality is good and looks premium. The VGA cable also looks premium. Viewing angles are not that great but worth for price paid.
4,LCD now working fine. Power cable not available on box. How to connect LCD. I want new LCD cable.
4,"18.5 inch is sufficient but having used a 24 inch monitor last few years, this looks small. But works well. It should have had a swivel stand."
4,Picture Quality is good but costlier. For the same price we can get bigger monitor in other brands.
5,Good screen opyikns at the entry level.
3,screen quality is not so good like Samsung
4,Purchased it for my gaming purpose in seclusion. Away from my living room area. Good monitor.
1,Very poor product quality. The screen colors got dispersed within weeks of buying it. There are permanent lines on the screen. And there is no option for return.
4,good product.but viewing angles could have been better for watching videos...else good product.
5,"Nice monitor by Dell ,nice picture quality and colors"
3,When I was search in amazon hdmi supporting and this monitor show me. But in this monitor no HDMI cable options. This is best for only cpu cable. ..
1,im very dis appointmented while seeing the screen on running movies or pictures... side angle view was totally blind... i thought its LED.. hope so its not...in stright view was excellent..
4,After some months of Useage white spots felt on screen
4,"I just wanna say, if anyone looking for a monitor with best quality at cheapest price then you should order this one."
5,Good
4,"nice product, smoothly working"
4,Value for money.
1,Bad monitor used 3 months after no working.I call dell costumer care not responsible.dell bad service.don't purchased dell monitor.
1,The product did not meet my expectation. The resolution of screen does not seem to be HD. the colour quality of the screen is very poor
1,Time waste to update about it. Worst quality and no optional inputs other than VGA.. Requirement unfulfilled.
4,picture view angle 168¬∫ and 178¬∫ is not clear.
5,Dell monitor provides a better picture clarity.. and the pixels are not breaking.Best buy for this price.
2,The data cable is not working
1,Product was damaged one ...and return taken time so much time to taken waste product
4,"Moniter is good but it is wide so it looks small & if we look at monitor from side, image is not so clear."
5,Excellent Monitor by dellMust for home and office useElegant designLight weightVery nice screen qualityMate finish screenAnd great delivery by Amazon
4,most resonable product
4,product is as described. value for money
5,Very good product good quality and value for money loved it but it
5,Good
3,Display good as expected but is fixed and cannot be moved.
1,"The product heading itself is misleading. It is a LCD monitor not an LED one. It has LED back light display only. The product heading is mentioning it has hdmi ports, but it don't have hdmi ports. I have ordered once and found no hdmi ports and ordered for replacement. The replaced item also don't have hdmi ports."
1,"Complete waist of time buying this product, replacement done twice still no HDMI port. Discription is wrong"
3,Avg monitor ...not impresseive..display angles are worst. only good thing is u can use it as tv via HDMI ports. External speakers connectivity is there.
4,Its  not support resolution  more than 1366*768. Sound speaker is only one watt...so sound is low but sufficient.Plus point it VGA + HDMI + Inbuilt speaker that make this product value for money.
3,Received the monitor well within time . The display was good but the only thing that bothers me is it's sound which is very low.I had even put up a service complain to Acer which was promptly attended but nothing could be done as the speaker's are in the back side and you need very good recording to hear the sound clearly.I had purchased this monitor because it had inbuilt speakers but it has disappointed me.
1,"Please do not think about buying this product. Before I get to the features of this product, it is very poor quality the HDMI port stops functioning and it glitches a lot and has given me a lot of problems since I purchased it. The viewing angles are horrible and I do not recommend this monitor to anyone as it becomes obsolete due to the poor quality of the HDMI port."
5,"This monitor works as described. The picture quality is decent. The sound is not very loud but it is fine for the person sitting in front of the monitor. I think it is a good value for money monitor, as it comes with built-in speakers which other monitors in the same price range do not offer. (Note: you will need to connect with HDMI cable to get sounds. VGA cable does not transmit sound). I returned the monitor since i realized i wanted a full HD (1080p) monitor and not a HD (720p) one like this."
4,it was installed in Oct-18 and was working ok but it was observed that vertical lines are appearing on the screen . I am trying to contact customer service but not able to contact..I contacted amazon ..they are also advising to contact acer....but not getting solution..still trying to contact...product is under guarantee...
4,"Picture quality is as expected.. values for money also but not too perfect on sound. Buy its ok can be compromised on sound with this price range. All the description is correct like it VGA port, HDMI port, inbuilt sound & input/output options.And yes last but most important on time delivery by Amazon."
5,Good product received and opened Box good item's sending for seler
5,"So quite a few reviews mentioned that they did not have the HDMI port. I don't know if they received a different model.I ordered this and it did have an HDMI port, a VGA port, an Audio input and an Audio output as well.Attached is a pic for reference."
4,"sound quality is not ok..its give very low sound..i had to connect external expeaker. Cannot move the screen up or down once fixed..i mean to say u dont have option to set the position of screen. But its ok for table. The above mentioned are the two issue which i faced, rest every thing i feel good in this product. I took this as I wanted HDMI port to connect to Mini mac and my purpose is served."
1,Broken piece delivered. Misusing the contactless delivery system.
4,"It‚Äôs okay for the price. Nothing special about it. One weird thing is that the audio does not connect via hdmi, they‚Äôve provided a small aux cable for that"
4,"There is no Stereo Speakers as mentioned in description. You can however connect 3.5mm audio jack, provided with the package. Except this, this is an excellent monitor with good picture quality. I am using this with desktop computer as well as Fire TV Stick. In both, it performs well. This review is after 2 days of use. Not sure how it will perform in longer run."
3,"After installation of the product I found that  this monitor will not serve my purpose. Can I replace this item with a 21.5"" monitor from  same supplier? I am ready to pay the difference amount of price."
4,Nice product
4,The monitor is excellent. As I saw the previous review that there is no HDMI port but I can say that the HDMI port is there only thing they are not providing you is HDMI cable. but if you are looking for inbuilt speaker feature then it‚Äôs not so good. It‚Äôs sound okay instead of that you could buy the speakers separately. The overall monitor is good.
1,Hdmi port will not work so you have to use vga port alone. So the picture quality will be low and you have connect extra aux cables for sound and the sound quality is low. Totally a trash. The display blinks when connected to hdmi.
1,"Bought this for daily use on programming, but useless. Got heavy eye strain due to backlight bleeding and view angle is so bad that you have to sit 90 degree upright to see things in monitor. May be useful for CCTV monitoring purpose, but not for regular office use / study."
5,It is a good led monitor at best price segment....no 1 point is getting HDMI port with audio in out port with inbuilt speakerspoint 2 is acer is trusted brand giving 3 yr onsite warranty ..such a good product.
2,Its OK product LCD display not led and hdmi port not available
3,"Product is as shown In the picture promptly delivered on time. Vga cable , power cable and aux cable for audio out are provided with the monitor. Speaker out is ok audible if you sit right next to it."
2,"Out of warranty product delivered. When I consult customer care, repair can be done through chargeable basis (2013 manufactured piece). I had purchased this monitor in Feb 2019. Please be careful about warranty policy and check warranty as soon as receive the monitor"
4,Design is decent and good monitor. But it's 720p i.e. only HD quality not FHD. There are so many company which are providing 1080p monitor in same price range. Speakers are worst. i don't even use it anymore.Ports selection is good. It's can be used  for office works only not for multimedia purposes.
3,"Overall picture quality is good, only concern is the sound which is really very poor and unsatisfactory.Better this product should be marked without speakers. Really upset with the very very poor sound quality.Stereo speakers at the back which is too low."
1,"Volume is very low and quality of display is bad. need to view straight, cant go below or above 90Degree"
4,"You shall only be infront of screen...if you watch it out from side, you could not..."
1,Waste product this is only works on vga cable and it's not having an inbuilt speaker also
4,This Screen having inbuilt Speaker...This was the Good thing with this screen.....But because of LED screen....Screen Got black when we change the position...So Good in price range....And For classes and Official work....
1,I am waiting clarifications from the seller. There  is only one VGA port. No HDMI port and no built in speakers.
4,I am using to connect to youtube while threadmill through chromecast. Sound volume bit low but you can add ext speakers if neded.
5,Good monitor. Value for money. Sound quality is not as good as expected but still satisfied by the product.
5,Best buy. But speaker quality is not good. Hdmi connection fluctuates little bit.
4,performance as expectedthird monitor in the house
5,"i have using this monitor from last 6 month and it performed above my expectation, only  compensating is in the speaker as they are not loud enough .device has eye protection function as well, HDMI , VGA and external speaker  connectivity."
3,good
4,"Speaker sound is verry less. what is the problem,,,?"
3,The resolution 1600 to 900 is fake because the real resolution is 1300 to 780
5,Very GoodHDMI Socket is available
3,"This monitor does not feature 1920x1080 native resolution. It features the 1366x768 resolution also known as HD-Ready. Also, the monitor comes with a 15 Amp cable for some reason, requiring us to run to the market to buy a 5 Amp one. The monitor also comes with a VGA cable instead of a HDMI cable. While the monitor supports both VGA and HDMI (which is excellent), the default cable should have been HDMI as fewer and fewer computers (including Desktop computers) feature the VGA port. Another run required to the market to purchase a basic HDMI cable.The monitor brightness, colour saturation are good. Good enough for office and entertainment.Pricing-wise, due to recent shortages, the monitor has gone up in price. It's real price should be in the 45xx/- category."
2,"It's not a bad monitor. But, not a Full HD resolution as added in the product description. It's actually HD Ready monitor.  This is actually like not meeting the promises given to the customer or misleading the customer completely. It's clearly a cheating. Not sure, why Company like Philips has to do this? Not sure, this may be just this particular seller's cheating..."
1,Description says TFT/LCD. It is backlit LED. Why such cheating by Philips India?
5,Very useful and meets my expectations. It‚Äôs worth and value for money.
1,It does not have inbuild speakers or anything
1,"I have purchased this monitor two times and returned, I feel the following in respect of this...(1) The resolution of this monitor is FHD which is not sufficient for any 27 inch monitor. if you want to buy 27 inch monitor its  resolution must be 2K or more than it.(2) The most annoying thing is that both time the monitor which i was received, It was already registered at DELL site for warranty and it was started 6 month before. Thanks to Amazon customer care for there quick support and help for returning this items.(3) I was facing eye strain and my eye became red due to long hour siting in front of it, It is not safe for eye also."
5,Very nice
2,"product is good but the Philips customer support is zero!Missing at least 5 cables when I have received the item. There is no chance to get them from Philips neither from the seller. Please, see the screen shot where I have highlighted the missing cables.I have requested Amazon for a replacement but they told me that the only option was a return and refund.The screen is supposed to bend of 10¬∞ from side to side as it is shown in the User Manual, well, it doesn't!The screen bend only to and fro but side to side.There is no any software that allow to split the screen in multiple areas like the one used by LG ultra-wide monitors.There is a remote control though and this is very handy."
5,"*** An Excellent Monitor *****POSITIVE***  PBP (Picture by Picture) function separates the screen in half displaying output from two different source devices simultaneously on the left and right sides of the screen.*  KVM with Auto(Based on the input selected) and manual selection*  Type C Hub with Charging - I've tried with Dell Latitude and MacBook and it works fine, though my Dell latitude has a normal laptop charger.*  FHD Web Camera with Windows Hello(Facial Recognition) feature works seamlessly**NEGATVE***  I've received a monitor with Country of Origin as Australia, I've checked with Philips India Customer Care and they have confirmed on the warranty status and it is valid for 3yrs in India.*  As it is an Australian manufactured Monitor, it comes with Australian specific Plug, however it works in universal voltage, however you have to get an adapter to plug into into the normal sockets in India,*  I've received only Type C to Type C cable and HDMI cable, However As per some of the unboxing video, there are cables like, Display Port to Display Port, Type C to USB etc."
5,"I believe this monitor returns what it promises. Use display port/usb c cable to get proper resolution. Your computer/laptop should be able to support the resolution of 5120 x 1440 otherwise it would not give the max resolution. Using USB C cable would also enable its usb hub or if you are using hdmi cable or display port cable then you have also plugin usb up cable in order to use the usb hub.I bought this monitor for Rs. 1 lacs, now it is for Rs. 1.25 lacs. Anyways, it has the best specs of all the other monitors. So far, so good."
5,Best for this budgetGot it for 20000 now price is 1 lakh ü•∞üòçSurely go for it best in class.
1,"Today just I opened and connected it to laptop and found defective. one/two flickering vertical lines are seen on left side of the screen which means the display panel is defective.I put it for replacement but you don't buy this product, it is of bogus quality."
5,Very nice Product value for mone big bazaar ke liye hi apki monthly income tax return for the link below to continue watching the playlist I am a bhalo kore
3,"I have been using this monitor for almost A YEAR now. Bought it for 15300/- back then.Picture quality is good, great brightness and colour calibration but the build quality is not. The edges of the glass panel are not smooth and seamless You will notice it as soon as you sit in front. The plastic protective bezel around the glass display is of really cheap quality and paint has started to chip. Pixel pitch is okay (about 116 I think) if you use this monitor from a 2 feet of distance. NOT recommended for MacOS, fonts look really bad.Some people have told me this monitor costs a little extra for the special colour calibration from the factory which is nice but shouldn't that be a factory standard for all monitors anyways?Power on-off + controls switch ( It's a joystick actually ) has a built-in white light which you can set to remain off or on. It serves as a keyboard light in dark rooms which I think is a brilliant idea!Speakers are just bad, so bad that they don't even deserve a review.2HDMI, 1 VGA, 1 Line-in, 1 Headphone. Ports are alright but in horizontal position so if you plugin 2 cables side-by-size there is barely any space between them.Stand looks nice, cheap quality plastic again. Has a recycled kind of metal bar hidden underneath, attached for weight and stability. There is NO HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT and just a small amount of tilt. There is NO WOBBLE like everyone around here has been complaining, you guys need a sturdy table üòãMonitor comes with a control utility which you need to download from LG's website. It's okay and allows you use monitor in different modes. But I think 23.8 inch isn't that big enough for effective use of those features.Other brands with similar or even bigger size of monitors are much much  cheaper with same or better performance.Oh one major issue if you are hoping to use the VESA mount. The VESA screw ports are way up the monitor edge so if you mount it along side any other monitor this one will sit really low. I didn't realise is until after few months when I mounted it to a dual monitor setup with my existing Samsung display. Ugh! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
5,"Does, what its supposed to do.All monitors are great, but 24"" 1080p with IPS panel, anti glare coating and inbuilt speakers for 15K, is a steal.Anti glare coating is a boon these days, see for yourself, there is a 18 W LED bulb glowing upfront of the monitor, still no issues, you won't be distracted by your own image or projections due to upfront light.This was a major issue, with my previous monitors.Also, I see, that prices have increased here on amazon, so do try local market in your area, if you're not getting a great deal on amazon."
5,This is one of the best investment I have ever made in a display. There are lots of reasons why I chose this display over any other display that is in its price range and some are even cheaper.- Color and Contrast is mind-blowing. While comparing it with my laptop screen you can clearly see the difference between the color grading.- The display is almost bezel-less and you will love to do photo editing as well as video playback on it. I do a very little gaming but despite the refresh rate being 60Hz I didn't notice any lag while the gaming.- I have lots of gadgets that connects via HDMI and I also have a home theatre system. The best part was that I was able to connect the monitor directly to sound system using the 3.5mm audio jack and I only have to connect HDMI cable for both audio and video.- The traditional VGA cable allows you to connect your old PC with ease.- I was amazed to download its windows software which allows the full monitor control right from the computer so that you won't ever have to touch the hardware buttons of the monitor.There are many other things that I love about this display but the above listed are the major ones.I have heard complaints that the stand of the monitor is wobbly and not so sturdy but I don't know why people are complaining about it. Because It's not like you are going to use it in your car or train. Once the monitor is placed on the table or wall mounted it won't matter if the stand is wobbly or not as long as you don't touch it.Overall I am very happy with my purchase and this couldn't get any better!

1,I ordered this monitor first time and I got screen with dead pixels. Placed replacement which I never got and had to cancel the order and place it again.This time it works perfect for 2 weeks and now I see full screen dead. White screen flashes and boom screen is gone.And now the return perioed is just 14 days and cant return/replace. Have to contact LG support and get it repaired on my own which is absolutely annoying and disappointing.
5,"It is the best monitor for my usage. I am a photographer who uses it for editing and I also play games casually. Purchased it for rs. 15900/-I have connected my laptop on one HDMI and PS4 in another. Got one HDMI cable free which is a nice additionPROS:1. Matte finish panel , no reflections2. Brightness is good3. Colours are excellent4. Also has decent speakers which do the job5. Very thin bezzels6. I love the combination of silver and black. Fits well in my desk, and there is no prominent LG branding anywhere, just a small logo at the right end of the standCONS:1. Speakers are good but sound quality could have been better. But they do the job. I did not have to buy a new one.I did not find anymore cons, will update in the future if anything comes up"
1,Terrible backlight bleeding. I was sent a replacement which was worse than the original. Had to return both. Backlight bleeding is usually caused due to a flaw in the manufacturering process so it is likely that entire batches could be defective. This is usually common at cheaper monitors in the 5000-8000 price point but at this price it is completely unacceptable.
5,"I was very confused in few more brands, I do multiple stuff in my pc, mostly gaming/streaming/video editing & movies. I was concerned about viewing angle, but honestly after this purchase i never regret my decision in chosing this.Excellent viewingVery thin bezelGreat picture qualityGreat features & color & picture adjustmentIn build speakers (I never used it as have I woofers but it could be a great feature to have inbuild)Some says the stand is woobly means it shakes in nominal pressure but I dont find it any negetivity in it as there is no point of moving your monitor after u set it on ur desk.Very sleek designCool standIt has futuristic aound when turned on which always make me feel of transformera :pTerrific purchase, dont think if you have a budget of 16k its the best pick as per my choice."
1,There is no FreeSync in this monitor and there is false advertising from Amazon's end. FreeSync was the most important feature for me and I definitely feel scammed. Even the company is not responding... They will send an engineer and the engineer will say that they cant do anything about it and they will close the case. I would suggest you to go with brands like Samsung as this product is not worth your hard-earned money. Only buy if gaming is no where on your priority list.
4,"Performed all the checks one is expected to do when you get one of these, all good. It's a 60hz monitor. It's not ideal for gaming only and only if you are that hardcore competitive gamer who wants everything before everyone(you wouldn't be looking for this if you are one of them) but for the rest 90%+ people who enjoy gaming and wants to have fun, this would do pretty good. I do play a lot of games and I haven't had any issues. 60hz is all you need tbh. Coming from a TN panel the difference is Day & Night both in terms of colour reproduction & viewing angle. This having an IPS will also help the folks with editing work. Why not 5 stars? The delivery. Absolutely horrendous. Delayed for 2 days. Had to write emails to get a proper communication about what's going on. The product itself is good. Sabr ka phal mitha wala logic probably."
5,"Excellent product. I have purchased this model after about two weeks of researching on the net. Samsung, Benq, AOC, LG, HP, TN, VA, IPC, 21.5/22/24/27, 8000/10000/12000 and what not. Finally i decided to go for BENQ 24 inches. At the last moment i realized LG 24MP88HV is better in terms of:1. The way it looks.2. Borderless.3. IPS4. Black levels are amazing.5. Connectivity options are multi6. Works like a charm.7.  You can reduce the lag in picture settings.8. You can connect your gaming headsets to the monitor itself.(Not USB)9.  You will fall in love with the clarity and TRUST ME..... I have been playing BF1, BF5, TC-Wildlands and many more from ps4 on my LG 55 inches 4K Tv so far and i used to miss so many enemies cause i just couldn't see them and and and on this monitor i could see everything.10. Don't beleive on people saying that its stand is wobbly. not at all. You just place it once on a firm table and it DOES NOT move there after until and unless you actually keep pushing it too see whether it is stable or not.I have not checked its AMD Gsync feature. Planning to upgrade to gaming PC soon and check on Ryzen. Will update"
1,"Very disappointed with the purchase.I am a designer, and I was searching for a budget monitor for my requirements. I placed the order after lots of research.The first monitor I received was with heavy backlight bleed and one dead pixel on the bottom right corner. The black colour looked like dark grey, and also had a light blue shade on the centre of the monitor.Requested a replacement order, the replaced monitor is also defective. The monitor has a vertical black line. This line exists even not connecting to the computer.Total waste of my time."
1,I was looking for a bigger monitor after using a 22 inch dell monitor for 5 years. I was instantly disappointed with the ips panel on the LG monitor. It was bleeding all around the edges (not IPS glow). The monitor is a bad performer for its 27k price tag. My Dell is way superior. Returning this to go back to my Dell monitor. DO NOT buy this!
1,"Cons:Screen Bleeding at bottom side, it is expected in models with sleek bezel I guess.The bezel is actually distracting, silver plastic protruding off the black glass.(Go for black one)Stand is not attractive or durable as shown.Pros.Nice matte finish, still glossy is preferred for good colour reproduction.Speakers are good compared for their size, the bass and treble are amazing."
1,Amazon delivered me damaged monitors twice and even lg is making poor quality monitors as the display has come of the bezels bcz of poor gluing.. lg is not maintaining any quality but gives quality assured papers in the box. That is soooooo stupid.
3,"Not into gaming, so can't evaluate that aspect. I'm replacing a 10 year old Samsung SyncMaster SW2233 22"" Full-HD monitor which developed fungi like patches in screen.Since I've had no serious complaints about the old monitor that I had, I could only list down negatives about this first.- Last monitor I had was at perfect height for me (the top bezel should be at the height of our eye), this one shoots way higher. Both monitors had a fixed height, but this one is off the mark.- Last monitor sat on the table without any movement at all. This is a boat, simply shakes for any shakes in and around the table. This is the worst aspect of this monitor. I'm afraid I will topple this one day.- Last monitor had easily accessible dedicated switches for many controls on the side. This one being thin, has one joystick like power button-cum-menu navigation joystick at the bottom. It's quite intuitive to use, but due to the instability of the monitor, every movement of the joystick rocks the monitor all around.- Silver color actually is an eyesore. The black would have been perfect, and the thin border also would have become invisible.Now some positives to speak of+ There is lot of room at the bottom of the monitor due to it's elevated stand. I can keep some things and a tea cup beneath comfortably.+ I've had no audio / speaker system in my desk arrangement. This one's got audio over HDMI and it works well, loud and clear once you turn up the volume. Conference calls are very good. I've had a Kayasuda USB speakerphone but it's speaker output was way too weak. This compensates well for that shortcoming.+ The monitor overall dimensions are pretty much what I had earlier, but this being thin bezel, the screen area is indeed larger (Obviously the older one was 22"" and this is 24"")+ The On screen display fonts are bigger and legible compared to the older one. But once they are set to a preferred setting, you rarely change.+ This runs on a DC adapter, so the big fat power cord have given way for mobile like skinny charging cables.+ That power switch / joystick seems to light up the bottom of the monitor and hence the desk, so that may come handy at times.+ The ventilation slots are at the bottom, and very less compared to older monitor. So less areas for dust to go in"
5,"I was looking for new monitor after my old Samsung monitor screen broke. I was not sure earlier whether to buy a monitor or tv. Since there were some TVs which were bigger in size and lesser in price i was confused whether to buy TV or monitor for my iMac. After some research i got to know that for maximum video and gaming performance monitor is better than TV. So i decided to buy monitor. Key feature that i was looking for were IPS display grater than my old monitor which was 21"", multiple HDMI port and in built speaker. This monitor matched all those expectations. It has great picture quality, which you can customize as per your needs(sports/gaming/movie). Multiple HDMI port means i no longer had to switch HDMI cable between my PC or Playstation. In built speaker are also surprisingly brilliant. Totally satisfied with this monitor. Thank you amazon for timely delivery."
1,"within 15 days from date of purchase this monitor started showing blur images.Straight white and black lines. and this is not at all ergonomic to use.Moreover, this is not at all good for movies, I had dell monitor as primary and brought it just because it has inbuilt speaker. But these speaker are not price either. total waste.Do yourself a favour by buying Dell ones, which can move up and down.======updateservice of lg is pathetic"
5,"I have spent 3 days choosing this monitor which suits my requirements( work, movies & budget). I bought this monitor for ‚Çπ14800 received on 19th June 2020. I ordered it on 15th June 2020. It delivered well at my door step. It is beautifully designed with white/silver color. I have been using it daily 8-9 hours. The screen quality is really good. It has in-built speakers which are also good for a normal room(Study/Bedroom) not for big halls like Drawing/Dining room. You might face difficulty in listening in fan speed. But over all good speakers. It has 2 HDMI slots(To connect Laptop & Fire Stick(Yes, It supports fire stick), 1 VGA slot(To connect laptop/CPU), Audio In(Use monitor‚Äôs speakers via AUX cable), Audio out(To connect external speakers or Headphones) Slots. There is no USB slot and Bluetooth Feature.What‚Äôs in the box:1. It has Stand with screws for putting on table.2. One HDMI cable.3. One Adaptor for power.4. Manual book with CD and Warranty Card.Note: No VGA Cable."
1,where bad product and amazon is rising prices of all products so dont go for amazon ...and this product is worst
4,"I should have bought this earlier, made the wfh easy on this rather than working on the laptop.The antiglare on this device is superb.This device has minor forward and backward tilt but the screen can't be rotated thats the drawback, but if coupled with a Rs1k monitor arm to remove that drawback instead of paying extra for a model which support the rotational feature.Picture quality is pretty good i must say, i played the 4k videos on youtube, it downgraded and played quite well, colors seem quite vibrant and saturated.When we unbox it, it looks very premium, since i have seen few devices worth 40k as well.I haven't played much games on it, so can't say much about gaming aspect.I bought this at Rs21k, i need to buy another device for home, but price is now a bot higher, hoping the price comes down in near future."
3,"Firstly I brought this product after watching many positive reviews in Amazon. My purpose to buy this product is to use it intact for Photoshop and After effects. Trusting LG I have ordered it.But the design of the product is very poor. Don't just fall for thin bezels when the overall design is so poor, this Monitor wobbles like a swinging chair with even the slightest shake. The screws and fitting aren't even adequate. This is a bummer if you purchased for gaming.And the text fonts(every font) in the screen look soo sharp that it almost seems like distorted text on screen. The colors are always warm no matter in what setting you set the Monitor to display. I have to choose PHOTO setting in display to get the average better look on display with colors.It displays a pixel issues in very fast moving content on screen. So a big no for core gamer. Its for average user to show off the monitor. Not a effective product and it has only 60hz and 5ml sec response in it, which is again basic.I have purchased it for 12.1k in recent deals. Or else I would have returned it on the very same day when I got to know about the practical issues in it."
2,"I have used this product for the last two years. Not the best monitor out there, but it served my needs (the built in speaker is almost useless). However recently it failed to power on (I suspect the power block is the issue), and connected with LG Support from their website. Repeated call back requests were ignored and when I called them I was told that they will call back in 2 hours which also did not happen. Very poor servicing experience overall."
4,"I got this display to compliment my 2017 Macbook Pro.Pros:1. Beautiful Display Panel. Good Colours and nice black levels. Has a matte display so there is very little reflections.2. Very Futuristic, modern and sleek design with slim bezels3. Very neat  and modern looking OSD interface that has a single illuminated joystick to control it.4. LG software to control Brightness and Contrast settings directly from the laptop.Cons:1. The stand is a bit wobbly2. Speakers are good enough for computer sounds and light media use.  They can get loud no doubt but the sound quality and sound profile is not good for long use like watching movies."
5,"I was looking for work monitor which can be used as secondary TV unit as well.And this model of LG 24"" monitor fits that criteria.So my review is inclined more towards work+light usage. Not sure how good it is for heavy games.Pros:1. Excellent picture quality.2. Lots of options for connectivity. 2 HDMI, 1VGA, 1 Audio-in (used for mobile input, Bluetooth input), 1 Audio-Out (used to connect external speakers), Found it best in this range.3. Design is also slick and not much bulky.4. Bazel less gives cool look when operating on it.5. Compatible for generic VESA Wall Mount (Actually ideal for Wall Mount)6. 10W speakers are more than enough for my bedroom. We can change Bass, Treble, Balance. It also has nightmode (manually activated) in sound settings which keeps volume low.7. Multiple options for Pictures colour settings like Cinema, Sports, Games, ExtraBright, Reader modes and so on.8. Anti-Glare is important when working up-close to display and found useful.Cons:1. Wobbly stand. Base is made of Aluminium but its neck is all plastic, plus its connected with only one screw. altogether its weak in design as compared to weight of monitor. So even slight touch to table will wobble monitor :) (Hence said, ideal for Wall Mount)2. They gave lots of options for connectivity but missing is 1 usb port. I have to arrange extra for connecting my Chromecast to this monitor.3. Single button for all operations sounds cool but once its broken, you wont have any option for choosing inputs, sound adjustments and overall setting panal.4. Its heavy :) 3kg for today's technology is on higher side. could be due to speakers and all connections, but should have given sturdy stand as well.My plan.. when I am not using it as monitor, I will hang it on my wall and use as small TV!!"
2,"Pros:  Picture quality is stunning u will love it,  Refresh rAte is excellently  Screen is very well calibrated  Works perfectly fine with MacBook Pro (2018)  Easy to setup  Good for gaming, played pubg and it worked fineCons:  Don‚Äôt purchase for speakers, they are not worth.anything, your phone has better speakers  You cannot do height adjustment  If table shakes a little while u move , the monitor wobbles like Noddy‚Äôs head  Got a straight line of dead pixels as u can see In attached image  Lack of USB ports sucks"
5,"If you work long hours in computer and packing to buy monitor, just go for this one blindly. I'm using it for quite some time now,it's so comfortable that I don't even open my laptop. I work for long hours and surprisingly I don't feel eye irritation. Best part is it auto adjusts brightness which is very useful during night time. Also you've several modes to toggle between for display. All in all best one to own. I was initially placing for 27'' monitor but for home use 24'' inches is more than sufficient. After lot of research I bought this and I'm happy to own it.Only one Con is It's shaky. I'm ok with it with all other benefits I get and I don't shake my table or screen at all so there's no affect for me."
5,"I purchased this product recently and have used it for a few months now. I must say this is one of the best looking 4 side borderless monitors available (honestly, I couldn't find any other 4 side borderless monitors in the market). It looks premium in the desk and the anti-glare display is amazing. The picture quality is awesome and colour graded. So, I love using this to edit photos and videos without worrying about the colour quality. Anything that looks good in this monitor will look good in any other device. The blacks are deep and makes pictures look punchy. My product did not have any backlight bleeding issues, but you must understand that this is an IPS LCD panel and if you sit in a dark room, you will be able to see the backlight through the dark screen, however if it is evenly distributed throughout the panel then you don't have any bleeding. There are multiple picture modes available to adjust according to your use. The built-in speakers serves its purpose and are good for general use, don't expect it to sound like your home theatre...!! :P.Paired this up with my MacBook Air and loved it. The white glossy back adds more premium look to it.I am not a gamer and haven't used it for gaming. But I believe you wouldn't be buying this if you are really a gamer and know what refresh rate actually means!!!Also, 1080p on a 27 inch screen can actually make you see the pixels if you sit too close to the display, but it's not a big deal if you understand that it is a big screen and is meant to be used from a suitable distance for comfort. Similar 4k monitors from LG cost more and does not offer 4 side borderless panel. This is the only option to go if you really love to see a true borderless display.**It has a small black border running on 4 sides covered by a metallic/aluminum coloured frame. The border however doesn't protrude out  from the frame like the ones in normal monitors . It is coated inside the glass panel of the monitor itself. This gives the premium finish to the panel!! **HIGHLIGHT - There is no brand logo on the panel...!!!!!!! Awesome right? There is only a small LG logo at the right corner of the stand. LG definitely had given a lot of thought about making this look truly premium.LG is always a brand to trust when it comes to displays. So, I would recommend anyone with a budget to go for it without any second thoughts.!!!"
4,"It's quite expensive product, similar quality monitors can be purchased much lesser than this LG monitor (may be 5000 less), don't expect 4k video clarity, it's a FHD monitor, now a days most of the people are used to 4K video, however it's good to watch FHD/4k videos on high internet bandwidth.Pros:1) The build quality is good,2) Bazel design screen, no logo in front of the screen.3) Full HD and bright in color display.4) lot's of connectivity options, 2 HDMI, 1 VGA, 1 Aux,Cons:1) Expensive2) Stand is not steady, but OK as long as table is stable, not to worry too much on this as many reviews gave negative feedback on stand.3) No return, only replacement in case any fault during 10 days of purchase"
1,The product has good picture clarity but the main drawback of this model is that the monitor stand is very weak and shaky. A slight jerk on the table cause the monitor to shake which is really disturbing. Even the jerk caused by typing on the keyboard cause the monitor to start wobble. I am really disappointed with this model.
3,If you are buying this product note this things :1. Don't buy 27 inch monitor because the pixels are structured and working with this monitor will be crispy because it supports only 1080p ...2. For 27 inch monitor you should go for 4K... Because for 27 inch the pixels will be stretched if you go fo 1080p3. The product specification is different venue product is received..... In product specification its shows that it support 75 Hz refresh rate but it supports only up to 60 Hz refresh rate.
5,"Bought on 13th July, 2018.Excellent monitor.  The colors are amazing. The ghosting issue was a bit apparent and seemed troubling but it went away after i turned Response time to Low and Super resolution to OFF.Its close to bezel less so it looks sexy and if you have 2 size by side, its gonna be awesome.The curved stand is sexy and provides a housing unit for the wires at the back to ease off wire cluttering.It can also be wall mounted by buying a wall mount separately.My main reason to buy was its sleek look, Full HD support and VGA plus HDMI ports. No display port though so that's a neg. You can also attach your headphones to it via a 3.5mm jack at the back, but the sound quality is nothing to brag about, its decent.Overall, a total bang for your buck. Buy 2 with a good graphics card and game on."
3,"Had a very bad experience buying this monitor! 3 years since launch,so the technical advancement in this monitor wrt to picture quality is very bad.1.The display is not crisp, there is ghosting and pixelation issues with even  4k videos.2.Also, a big no for WFH as the text is not very clear.3.The only good thing about this monitor is the design of the panel but again the stand wobbles even with  a slight movement.4.Speakers are fine and support bass too!"
3,"Sweet spot for Full HD resolution monitorUpdate: After using it for 1 year and 6 months, I came to a conclusion that its not as good as I though it would be.I mean my 18.5 inch Dell Monitor of 1440x900 from 2008 or so gave me better quality than this even though being old and without any modes.The main concern that I have is Motion Glow or whatever, is it that you call, but I cannot view any video properly on 60 fps or above. It gives a strange motion blur /glow like ghosting along the path of the object in the direction in which the objects moves.I don't know if its my product that is like this or is every product like this and i haven't gotten used to it.Thinking about switching to 4k."
2,"Text appears worse than a cheaper monitor that I bought from Samsung.After buying this I have came to a conclusion that if you are looking for a monitor for coding or reading text only buy professional level monitors from HP or Dell. Text on this monitor is just not sharp enough, it has been siting in my store since bought as Amazon doesn't accept a return anyway."
5,"Last 4 days I purchased this monitor and use it. In this price range it's a good choice. It's looking is really attractive, 4 sides Borderless just wow. It's colour accuracy is too good. And also gaming performance is awesome. Every dot to dot is visible. Its inbuilt speakers. This speaker sound is overall good. Late night working this speaker sound is soft. This monitor are all modes are available, so easily control brightness levels. Thank you Amazon giving me a good packaging. Really Amazon packing is very good. I brought it 13750 in this price. Overall this monitor is really good.üòäüòä"
4,"Writing this review after 6months of using this product. Personally I like the look of this product and the picture quality as well. The IPS panel never fails to impress you in your editing work and gaming only in terms of image quality. But I must say there's input lag when gaming as this only supports 5ms & 60h.. Besides, THE SELLER HAS WRONGLY PUBLISHED THE SPECIFICATION OF THIS PRODUCT. This never comes with Amd FreeSync, check anywhere and even LG websites.Amazon, you should check and rectify this things before more of your valued customers turn into another victim."
3,"The monitor looks exactly as described in the pictures. Here's the lowdown on it.Good1. Thin chassis, and bezels are really small2. Looks great in white3. Pretty lightBad1. The stand is very wobbly - even the fan makes it wobble.2. The stand makes the monitor tilt forward, it is not straight3. I've not been able to tune it properly for realistic coloursOverall, an OK purchase, wish the stand and colour accuracy were better."
1,"I have connected it to my laptop.  While watching the small fonts in laptop, I was feeling stress on my eyes.  So bought this monitor thinking that when I see bigger fonts, the stress will reduce.  But that didn't happen.  I continue to feel the same.Picture quality is horrible.  Sometimes I watch Amazon prime on this monitor.  Colors are very different compared to normal TV.  I don't think this monitor has HD picture quality.For normal work, it is OK (ignoring the stress on my eyes).  But not for watching videos.  I think gaming experience will be even more horrible - I have not experienced.Sound is very average, but that was not my priority."
4,"I'm writing this review after 15 days of usage. Below are some pros and cons I've found during my usage.Pros:1. The most important thing for a monitor is its picture quality and it didn't let me down in that aspect. Colour reproduction, viewing angles are vey good. It is best for media consumption.2. The very first thing when you look at a monitor is its for factor. This lg 24inch monitor looks very premium. 4 side borderless display looks good.3. Connectivity: it has 1 vga, 2 hdmi ports on back side. 3.5 mm head phone jack also present on the back.4. It has dual speaker on bottom of the monitor. It serves it's purpose. Don't expect too much.Cons:1. The stand should be made of metal instead of plastic.2. No height adjustment. I think this one feature every company must add to their product. It's very useful.3. This monitor is not for gamers. It supports only 60 hz.Overall it's a good product from Lg brand. You can definitely look into this one."
4,"Quality is economical. If you want a premium quality product you have to spend at least Rs-1000/- more on such a product. Build quality, performance, usability all are good if not great. The joints specially that which connects the vesa mount plate to the arm and the tilting mechanism could have been better. I am using it as a laptop desk mount with a vesa mount laptop tray of the same company. I got both the products of ""Brateck"" company and Seller told me that Lumi is the parent company and under Lumi there arebrands like Brateck,ergovida, Lumi ergo etc. Seller has increased its price still I am satisfied with the product."
5,"Steardy, can handle 34 inch ultra wide but can't rotate to potrat that's all.nice build quality"
5,"This works very well and is super convenient to have, instead of the monitor stand which takes a lot of space. it cost me a little more than I would like but it does the job well, so no regrets."
4,The brackets could have been power coated other than that the overall product is of good quality.
3,"The product is good. But the mounting screws provided to attach the clamp to the arm's base are of no use, had to buy them separately from a local store. Apart from that, the product is good."
5,"Expensive, but cheaper (compared to getting a bigger table, which was our original thought) and (far more) efficient than alternatives (sturdy and safe, good articulation)"
3,Arms are good but the base hose screws are Little crazy to fix I had put a synthetic tape to screw them tightly
3,It‚Äôs good but it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt go very high so I had to return it.
5,Stand looks sturdy and elegant but it is priced slightly on a higher side
3,i ordered 2 stand but 1 stand have fault.
5,Worth the money some people are selling the same stand for 5k .
4,Good value for money. Nice product.
5,Definitely value for money
1,not good bulid
3,"The metal built quality is good but plastics are not of good quality considering the price. Also, plastic edge of the base is rough which has scrached my wooden polished desk."
2,"PROS:- All required tools are provided- Feels sturdy- Somewhat ok instructional manual, though seller/company should upload some assembly video to youtube. CONS:-The product is extreemely diificult to assemble.-To fit the screws in the groove it requires lot of effort.-Does not feel like gas spring operated. I have used gas spring arms in my office earlier and they are very smooth in operating.- However this one has arms which are extreemely tight and requires to use the alex screws to loosen and adjust.-Even after assembling the arm, moving it requires lot of effort to move it around.OVERALL - It is better to search for other products which cost a bit more but which are truely gas spring operated and have smooth mechanism. Do not believe on all the positive reviews. If you want your monitor to be stationary then definitely buy it otherwise if you require some sort of movement or tilting avoid this product."
5,"Much better than I had expected, the arm is sturdy and flexible, and also easily moves along the pole. Perfectly lifts my second monitor above my first monitor"
4,Works like a charm. Can be operated very swiftly due to gas spring operation.Only drawback is the arm length is a bit short
5,"Its a good table mount. I'm using a 27 inch monitor and the mount is perfect for it. It is easy to adjust and meets my needs, Got it for Rs. 3,450. A good recommendation for that price."
2,The arm extension as shown in last picture is wrong.. Thre is no extension with this product..
5,"Good product works as advertised, Good material . Little bit of struggle to setup. They could have given setup video links in the manual."
1,Really hard and not handy to use.
5,It's a very nice product. Works great.
1,I've ordered product with description as:Part number: UM.IV6EE.A01Resolution: 1600x900But i Received Product with Description as:Part number: UM.IV6SS.B08Resolution: 1366x768Not ready to accept different product with Lower resolution so requested Return.
3,No inbuilt speaker
5,using since few years. very good product. I strongly recommend this

5,the product offers decent value for money as a second monitor.
5,Excellent
5,price is good. Display is awsome
1,Dont ever buy this product.They are cheating with name of LED monitor but this is LCD monitor.Waste of money.....Really dont buy.....
5,Excellent product
5,yes it reached to my expectation
5,Just as I expected
1,this is not led  its LCD...WRONG INFO ..I FELT SO SAD  AFTER GOT IT..DONT BUY PLS ITS  EFFECT ON EYES  DIRECTLY
5,Nice product
1,Never buy acer monitors... they are defect prone and you wont get proper support and they give some junk monitor as replacement.
5,Good
4,"Its a good LCD monitor(not LED) for your work related stuff. Picture quality and color reproduction is not that great. It comes with all the required cable within the box(HDMI, 3.5mm audio cable, RGB cable, Power adapter).It looks great. Nice design.Monitor stand is solid.Sound quality is very poor. Better to use with external speakers. NOTE: It is Audio-In model. Monitors jack cannot be connected to external speakers. Can use external speakers in laptop connecting to screen.Overall I would rate it between 3.5 to 4."
4,Design 5 star. As this is montor so dont expect much of loud and crisp sound. But the pic quality and 70hz refresh  rate gives you good picture and viewing angles.  overall under 10k this is one of the best
4,I got it for 8100 ... So for this price its perfect.... I cut one star for the speaker...the speakers are of no use.... Its just a marketing strategy.... Else everything very good....the hinge connecting the stand could have been much better....but still no problem...... Writing this review after 3 months of use.... Look wise the monitor is perfect....
5,Incredible value for money. Set up is very easy and the monitor is sharp and crisp on the images. Easy on the eye and supports all connectivity. The speakers are a bit tinny sounding but can be accentuated using external speakers. Very happy with this purchase.
5,"Purchased for WFH and needed a good secondary screen. This was perfect fit. Been couple of months since purchase. No issues at all till now.Giving 3star for speakers, can't really expect from secondary screen. But it was not a problem as I use my headphones for work and not for watching movies."
3,"Buy this monitor if you are looking for less than 10k budget, don't expect to much from this . But I was upset when I was not able to adjust the screen height, it didn't had that option and I I beleive it's not written as well. Overall it's an OK types monitor.."
5,It's video quality is super as well also have quality sound speaker
1,Don't Buy this product the quality is very bad  with in 5 month in my  monitor this line came.The service is very bad.
2,"I got defective monitor, quality not that good, color and picture quality is not that great, when it comes to speak it's just marketing strategy its just waste, instead of giving the speaker they would have cut the price for the monitor.only thing i liked about the monitor is it's very slim and thin bezel."
4,It's a best in segment. But only issue is that it has only 2 years of warranty by Acer.
5,Nice monitor for office and study work. Easy to assemble. Delivers usually in 3 days. Note that it is 24 inches diagonally.
5,Good one. Nothing to worry about.  Just go and place order. My experience and luck was good..  Try yours !!!
3,Medium quality
1,Found a black spot inside the upper left corner of display.Unfortunately return window is closed.Quality of the display is average.
5,Good quality and form factor
4,This is the slimest nd bezalless ips led pannel nd looks amazing nd Picture quality is so great thnx to Acer nd flipkart.
4,Decent monitor...... Not too great but not to bad.... Definitely not LED... ITS LCD....serves the purpose...
4,"Good for cctv & study purpose, sound quality is just ok"
5,It is good
2,I am watching movies and the screen always flickering.
5,Good buy
3,Headphone jack is not working.
5,Perfect for WFH.
5,OK this Monitor has model number KG241QS and there is similar monitor i mean exactly similar with model number KG241QP. Only the difference is that QS is a factory overclocked monitor.Here i will tell you everything about KG241QS which has 165hz refresh rate and 0.5ms response time. the similar KG241QP has 144hz refresh rate and 1ms response time.I have owned IPS panel monitor from LG ( 22mp68vq ) and before this monitor i owned Asus (VG258QE) that was a TN panel Monitor. I recently bought this monitor to actually check whats the difference in 25000rs tn panel and 12000rs tn panel. and when i received this monitor i compared it with side to side with Asus monitor and the difference between two was literally 0%. And comparing this with ips monitor i.e is LG there was a very unnoticable color difference which you will never even notice except white looking a very little yellowish type. And by very little i really mean very little.I am just writing such big review for you guys to just tell you dont waste your money on pricier TN panels you wont notice even a bit of difference. I am loving this monitor gaming is heaven in this monitor so if you are planning to upgrade your monitor buy this use this n i can assure you that i will not be disappointed if you have used IPS panel before. if you want to invest your money invest it in either getting a 2k or get yourself a beast graphic card.I am here mentioning the perfect OSD setting for both 144hz and 165hz models you will get best colors out of it.Brightness - 55contrast  - 40black boost - 06gamma  - 2.4blue light  - offACM  - offSuper sharpness - offcolor temp  - normaloverdrive  - normalfreesync  - onVRB  - off
5,"Well i was holding my purchase for past 3 months for 144Hz monitor and finally pulled trigger on 5th March 2020.And i must say 60Hz users please get 144Hz if you can already .I am not gonna devide this into just pros and cons as it completely neglactes whole user experience i have so you have to read everything.First things first let's get the facts out of the way-1) It is 144 Hz and 165 Hz out of the box; whichever mode can be set with windows or Nvidia Control Panel.2) Enable AMD FreeSync from OSD then you can set Vsync then Gsync easily on both Hz without any issues.  (To enable Vsync is not necessary)So i don't think much is needed to say for gamer at least as this is purely meant for gaming. Colours are accurate out of the box. One can down Green slider from OSD a little bit(48) to make it more accurate otherwise it's fine. Even for movie,too. there are 4 modes in OSD and 3 for gaming.Lastpicture in my review has ACER 165 on left and BenQ VZ2350H on right. I don't have any complain on either one but look at the acer sometime just giving more vibrant and still warmer colours...this is personal preference and one might like BenQ one but i would go with Acer as it is easy on eyes. And moreover u can tweak this easily form RGB menu,2 gamma presets -1.8,2.2 and 2.4 and colour temperature setting but don't do it randomely...find a scale first to measure.I mainly play Rocket League and PUBG lite online and  I tried Witcher 3 offline. 165Hz always and no ghosting or trailing effect. Resident Evil and Tomb Raider players...sorry i can't test that deep. Your user experience may very from mine. The monitor works flawless for even 6-7 hours straight.No issues in reading text but it stil looks pixelated from 60 c.m. distance. But for images and movies it's just doing fine.Ok...so why get something better if u can? Because this is TN panel and it's gonna show it's symptoms from time to time. As i have to seat in level of the display. Watch slightly from more height or more low it will affect sky and white colours resulting in washed out colour and black shadow respectively. On normal windows usage this is a issue because there is a Green tint all over the place when u see it from angle. But but but here me out; you are not gonna watch form that angle and operate your pc...U can still watch a movie from that angle and it is just showing good expected colours.For gaming this is great value for 12499 INR as this justify every feature it comes with. One might wonder why i didn't talk about 0.5 ms response time but it's marketing gimmick anyway in every gaming monitor and one have to measure actual GTG response time and i don't have that tool. For me it's just fine on 144Hz and 165Hz.U can get Acer's 144hz IPS variant but for gaming this is just fine for 60Hz to 144Hz upgrade. Sorry if i left something u wanted to hear but i don't have any issue about black level or anything. Backlight bleed? I have picture attached and it's equal on whole panel but on camera it looks somewhat bad.In reality it's perfectly fine if u watch it from straight. Any other questions feel free to ask here. I will replay and test if i can."
4,"I was lucky to have got this for 11,915 INR. I knew AS SOON AS I order it, the price would go up.Now let's talk about the performance of this monitor. Coming from a 4K monitor, it took me a while to get used to the 1080p resolution of this monitor. The brightness is far too much for me. Even after I turned Brightness and Contrast to Zero, it was still far too bright for me. Other than that, I think it's a good deal at 11,915 INR."
5,"Literally the best monitor you can find for gaming at this budget, I've been using this for about 6 months now and I'm really impressed by the display and the colours. POG"
1,"PLease do not fall for the outside cover which claims normal refresh rate at 144hz and overclock 165hz. In reality, when checked from system, it shows 119hz and 137 as normal and overclock refresh respectively. Absolutely shameful marketing from acer and being sold by amazon."
1,"Only had this for 5 months and already having to replace !!!!  I'm REALLY not happy.  I only use this occasionally (probably only 30 times since buying) and it is flickering away like anything.  Did experience a little flicker, a few seconds here and there, when it was only a few weeks old.  Changed cables and updated drivers and it didn't happen again for a while.  But now it just doesn't stop !!!  Changes cables, screen side (have dual display) and deleted and reinstalled drivers .... still flicking.  NOT HAPPY."
5,I purchased this monitor Rs 13840The monitor is really great and really awesomeNow let's cut the chase and come to the pro and consPros1.The display quality is really better if we compare with some Ips panels2.178 view angle I consider at 1703. respond this is accurate4. Its totally on matte finish and near to bezel less design5. For started just go to display setting and change from 59 or 60 hz to 144hz or 165 defends upon your flavorCons1. The stand is really good with glossy black bottom part with matte finish red But shaking you table make you  monitor a little bit shaker2. Color calibration is not done so do as for your flavorSo these are my thoughts on this monitor I hope this will really help all of you those who want to purchase for gamingHAPPY GAMING
2,"After 1 week of waiting i received a defective monitor although the monitor was working fine but something inside the back of the monitor was broken as i could clearly hear some metal plates (something like that) roaming freely inside the monitor which were hitting something inside and making that metel noise.Also i think the monitor was used because it already had freesync ,overdrive and gsync(in nvidia control panel) enabled already ,also it was already overclocked to 165 hz out of the box, or maybe im wrong and it is suposed to be like that  i ll update my review and rating once i received the proper replacemnet"
1,This monitor worked fine for 2 months and suddenly it stopped working. It is in warranty period so they told they will replace it. It's been more than 10 days now and I haven't got a replacement till now. Very poor service from Acer. No one is able to tell as to when they will get the product from their HO. Really disappointed!
5,"Ok first of all i am coming from IPS Panel 75hz so everyone told not to take TN Panel but i took the risk, but i must admit this monitor is superb.>Great Brightness and side view is good too (i thought it would be bad)>Color was little low but increased the vibrance to 75% in nvidia control panel.>Smoothest Experience literally i can feel the difference by scrolling amazon or fb you will not face any tearing n ol and in gaming like csgo, valorant just awesome..> Download color profile from acer.com and update it on device manager>Provided with Display port Cable (You have to change in nvidia resolution to 1920x1080 165hz)If anyone facing any issues for first time kindly  perform clean driver installation of nvidia or amd.Overall loved it let see how it performs in future, Hoping for Best!!!  <3"
3,"Think twice before you buy. The Monitor has a good refresh rate. But its not .5ms its 10ms and more over the screen alignment is slightly slant towards bottom right angle( i noted this on the third week) . The monitor I received looks like it is refurbished. If you are lucky , you may get a good one, try your luck and chance. However think twice!"
5,Nice quality monitor in such a low price. I have got this monitor at ‚Çπ13828. But now the price has increased. I want to purchase more but price is already increased. Please let me know about the same.
4,"There is no other monitors which is available at this price with 144 hz, I purchased this item for 11950/- and for average gaming purpose 24 inch far better. also the design of the stand and holder is very impressive. However the border of the screen is thicker. but we can ignore it when compared to the price . There is no need to think much this  if the price is on offer"
1,monitor was delivered on 17 aug and on 11 sept suddenly a blue line ran through the displayi am currently on a call with acer while writing this review and it has been 20 mins since the customer care has put me hold :)))))))ps : will update the review and write hows the acer service
5,"Best for gaming I bought it at a great value of 12300‚Çπ 144hz monitor u can switch it to 165hz and it is really awsm picture quality. 24inch is best for 1080 , 27inch monitor will decrease your pixel density for 1080 it will effect your user experience.Recommended for CS:GO players."
4,"I have waiting to buy 144hz monitor for almost year, but i was not able to afford till now. I searched for the cheapest and best feature full monitor at price of 13k. This is best monitor you can get at this pricePros:-1. 165/144 is works as mentioned in the discription2. Freesync is awesome for games. i play pubg pc alot and i usually get fps around 80-100 avg lag and stutter but after freesync turned on it feel butter smooth (free sync range 48hz-165hz )3. Brightness is good4. Stand is good no problem thereCons:-1. Viewing angles are shit if you look straight it looks fine but if you bend a little the monitor get dark in some region2. The Bezel size is too much but it doesn't matter too much. this is the best Monitor you can get at this price"
5,Very good monitor but colour not too much accurate compare to ips and side view angle colours are very very bad but am very enjoy with 144-165hz and 2k resolution gameplays.Pros.1. 144-165hz works very well.2. Freesync enable monitor also gsync support but u need to dp cable for this feature.3. Looking sexy nd stand is very attractive.4. Colours are good compare to others TN panel.5. Brightness are awesome yes it's too bright üîÜCons.1. Colours are not well don't expect much.2. Side view angle colours are very very bad images shows full dull and blackish.3. Monitor are not steady because stands is small and monitor is to weighted nd his moving by air comes from your ceiling fan and coolers.4. Monitor not support 2k 144hz on dp only work 2k 30hz but works on hdmi well. I don't know why but yeah am face this issue
5,"I have been using 60 hz monitor from last few years... and saw few videos on youtube for higher refresh rate for gaming and tempted to try one. Was on low budget and got this with discount.The higher refresh rate of 165 hz 0.5 delays (which is lowest) and 24 inch just changes the whole experience for gaming. Someone who is in to FPS games and plays daily has to have to monitor. Its a complete package at good price, vesa mount, dp HDMI port, different modes for gaming movies etc.The only thing i miss is speakers but you can anytime use external speakers.All in excellent product and delivery..... very happy."
5,"First I was saving for Acer 144hz monitor which costs around 13k on amazon but while I was browsing for it one day I saw this one and was surprised that it is just the same as it and has 165hz refresh rate and is also cheaper as I got it for 11,915. I immediately bought it and I am happy I did. Gaming performance is very good if you have a 60hz monitor please consider upgrading if you can. Viewing angles are surprisingly good for TN panel, you can see the display clearly even when sitting on the ground. The display has good brightness and color reproduction. You can tweak further by going into the Nvidia color panel according to your liking. Overall it is the best buy at this budget as no other 165hz monitor is near it in this range."
3,"I have been using this display for more than a month now, Here is my impression of it.The display quality is good and it can be easily used as a secondary display to your laptop or you can use it as your main monitor too.The color production is fantastic and the 165Hz that it provides is something you would love to experience, Keep in mind, Windows only allows 120Hz natively, So you would only get to experience 165Hz in games.The biggest CON of this monitor is its stand, The stand is so pathetic and is really not build sturdy enough. The display would constantly wobble like those bobblehead toys while you are typing on your keyboard on a table. It wobbles so much that it would be enough to annoy you into stop using the display altogether. The display even wobbling while I am writing this review. Giving three stars solely because of the stand."
4,The monitor came today with superb packing.Got a good initial feel even after un boxing but it didn't last after I booted the monitor. Got back light bleeding in the left middle screen and right bottom of the screen. Ordered a replacement and hope it'll be in my hands soon. But except that everything is fine but got irritated when playing black things.edited- got replaced today with a good panel monitor without any bleeding and counties enjoying ü§©üòç
1,"I fall in love when I first saw this I was like omg this is it <3 <3... I would 100% not recommend this to anyone, the worst monitor I have seen.. 165Hz? my phone feels faster lol..I loved it so much I would have given 0 stars if there was an option for it."
3,In dark areas the banding is horrible and takes you out of the immersionthe monitor has an unfixable forward tiltthe color accuracy is badthe only possible use for this is just office work and gaming upto 165 fps and nothing elseinvest more and buy a better monitor i wish i did that
5,"monitor is nice... 165 hz .. 1920x1080p.. 0.7ms .. 27 inches .. TN panel... as TN is best for gaming.. not for video editor and movie watcher as the color accuracy of TN is not good go for IPS then for that but for only gaming best monitor at budget just at 18000rs when i buy it .. remember the technology used for enjoying 0.7ms response time is MPRT , u have to turn on in monitor settings to enjoy.. btw turning on enhances experience but u can't able to change brightness contrast related stuff, freesync is also disabled in this mode.. the major thing u have to do with MPRT is to turn on every single time u boot ur pc... FREESYNC monitor but if u have nvidia card u can use GSYNC in this monitor as it is GSYNC Certified Freesync monitor (remember to connect display cable for 165hz Gsync/freesync support) btw nice monitor using for 7-8 months no problem at all in starting as it is 27 inches and i jumped to a 27 inch monitor from a 20 inches monitor but if u settled with it one time u cannot able to revert to a smaller monitor again.... and go for it if u get it in deal as over 20000 its not justify it price"
5,"First of All my expectations with this was high and it is fullfilled , in the picture the stand is black but u get red black combo which looks op üî•U can vary it's Refresh Rate from lowest to highest (165.003)Free DP Cable with Jaw LocksIt's 0.5 ms 165Hz Screen is so damn smoothRn I'm using it with my lappy and PS4 gonna build PC SoonOverall i just Love the product"
5,I bought this monitor checked everything it's great monitor just found one flaw of the monitor it has black colour defectiveness cos whenever black colour comes on display then tiny little white colour shows in display maybe stuck or hot pixel so I request for replacement but go for this monitor it's awesome overall üëç
4,"1.Best for 1920x1080 gaming. 2. 400Nits super bright.3.Accurate colors. (Need lily tweaking if preferred).4. With Gsync compatible FreeSync On 165hz monitor, you can play warzone high settings at 150Fps(min)  fixated provided you have 2070 super or above graphics"
5,"Got this on an offer for 10,700/-I am very happy i got this monitor. AMD freesync comes on by default. No need to go to the trouble to turn it on. Just go to your nvidia control panel or amd panel and change the refresh rate to 165 and see the magic. I play Dota 2 on my PC and earlier i used to play on 60hz. I switched to this and I can never go back. I am using GTX 1070 with this monitor but ill suggest get a AMD card for even better performance. But yeah even Nvidia cards work fine. The games run very smooth and it improvers your gameplay. Also videos and overall use becomes very smooth. I will definitely suggest this to everyone. (only viewing angles are bad so dont buy if you want to build a HTPC)"
5,"When I was buy the price was 12k it's really good too much bright I save my brightness level to 55, it's really good for gaming, it's a TN panel but the quality of the display, colour it really good, you don't face any problems with this display. It's also good for entertainment purposes, I didn't face any problems colour is good."
1,A big size monitor for gaming but when u connect hdmi cabel atleast 144hz should working but no its only working 75hz with hdmi and when u applay 165hz its not working anymore and when u apply more than 75hz then its flikring and some black line comes on screen so i refund it and give 1star so don‚Äôt buy this go with others. And picture quality is very poor very very poor
1,This monitor has a decent performance ..But the quality of product is too bad i got a damage product in which there was a gap between the panel and the bezel . I replaced the item and after one week i got the replaced monitor which has the same damage problem ..
5,bought a week back and when it arrived it was good and then while testing the screen i found a green pixel on the right side of the screen and requested for replacement and recieved new one and till now there hasnt been any defect with this but for thoseewho want to buy it and are coming from ips displays { i am on TN pannel for the last 3 years so i didnt notice it} the colours are good but they will change on viewing from other angles and it is G-sync compatible freesync monitor.
5,there is TN panel but viewing angel and color are good enough than my expectation. It gives true 144Hz and 165Hz .But you may see little ghosting issue that can be ignored. You noticed the issue if you focused on screen to see the ghosting. One problem is OSD application is not working properly. You need to use monitor button to adjust settings. Overall the monitor is a good choice for daily work and games.
4,"Its Good for Gaming and Entertainment,Only thing that i noticed is that this monitor's stand was like already used with scratches but it was beneath it and you cant even see it,Its 1ms gtg on 144hz but 0.5ms is a marketing gimmick,Input lag is pretty low good one for competitive gaming,also couldnt see much difference on 144 to 165hz,The other model KG241QP is the same with the basic features that u need while this ones got some additional features that some ppl doesnt even use,This ones Display port is kinda hard to connect and eject as it had a lock,Overall great monitor for 11997,If you want to save some bucks go for KG241QP as you dont wanna spend 1000 rs higher for 21Hz more which is literally unnoticable,Its a TN panel but colours are good for gaming as i tried it on rainbow six siege and can clearly see everything.I already bought a Samsung C24FG73 which has amazing colours when compared to this,But its marketed as a gaming monitor but its only for casual players as it has like 24ms response time bcoz of VA panel,If Casual and want more colours Go for C24FG73,as its great,also for ips consider Acer or MSI,But for competitive go for Acer or Benq zowie as TN panels are the Fastest of the lot. Also dont spend more than 15K for tn panels as they are not worth more than that."
2,"Do not buy TN panel unless you really want that competitive edge for FPS gaming, I went from a IPS 60hz display to this and colors suck compared to IPS display and honestly I can't see much difference between 60 hz and 144 hz. Better buy a IPS or LED even if its 75 hz."
5,"This review is after 8months of use...1. Monitor gets black screen in between.2. Monitor not have one more HDMI PORT, and USB port.3. Speakers are useless.4. Viewing angles are not good.5. IPS panel is best.This is main partAcer warranty is no use as no good response from services.Good @13800Buying at this price and leada to regretting...Solution Buy Samsung monitor or any"
4,"The screen display of the monitor and customisation according to the gaming is good but I am so negative and disappointed with the Audio system both the headset jack output, the audio clarity was poor on my philips external speakers and inbuilt speaker is too poor the 4W inbuilt speaker can't able to meet the performance of my laptop speakers...I strongly recommend for other products if you are looking for a monitor with inbuilt speakers...And I feel a remote or better user interface to operate with all those features..."
5,"This is how it describes - 165 hz.Feel the difference.After switching from 60 hz to 165 hz , there is nothing left in the product to complain about.I play Valorant and can see the frames like a silk cloth.Brightness is more than enough, viewing angles are not bad.Build quality is superb, especially stand.Must buy for budget-friendly seekers.I got it in 14.6k - 2 days delivery. Big thanks to Amazon."
4,"Might be good for gaming but if you are planning for office work - it's not good.The monitor can't scale up FHD to 27inch, so text becomes a lot pixellated. Circles are not proper, text lines are bold on one side, thin on other.Stick to 24 inch or less on FHD.Go for 27inch qhd or 4k if you want proper display"
1,The monitor that arrived was damaged or more likely as if it was completely submerged under some thick fluid.... Had to replace the item... It was really disappointing... Hopping this time they don't mess up... Will notify and edit after the replacement...
5,Monitor is stunning and has excellent picture quality
5,"Hi Dear,I am very happy to buy this Monitor. Picture quality is good. I was waiting for last three months for amount to be reduced. Finally it is reduced from Rs. 9500 to Rs. 7999. Then 10% cashback offer in My AMEX card.* Picture quality is good* Looking fancy and decent design.* I was brought for this developing purpose. So now feeling good for my eyes working in late night.* HDMI Cable not available only VGA Cable.* Edges are not properly fitted. But okay."
4,"Slim and very stylish monitor. Picture quality is good. I am using macbook so cannot compare to retina display. But at this price point, I would say this is a excellent piece.The highlight is the metal stand which is stylish and sturdy. Many monitors don't have metal Base. I love the Matt finish on the stand and love the black finish.Just got it today. I will see how it goes and update my review if I see anything strange.This product is China made so had to  sterilise it before using. üòÇ. Just joking."
5,Best product
5,This is the best monitor I could have purchased in a decent budget. I have compared this monitor with every other branded monitor and bought it. It has all the features that a branded monitor has and is budget friendly. It comes with an almost 24 inch wide screen. This is the best find and has an HD resolution with 1980 *1980 pixels. It has a sleek design and comes in silver colour. It can be mounted on a wall or can be put on desk. VGA and HDMI cable is supported. Though the inbuilt speaker is not as good as one can expect but overall a great product from zebronics. If one is looking for a sleek and budget friendly monitor then this product should be one's first choice.
5,"It's good for daily use.Everything is perfect with it.the design with almost zero bezel.no bleeding.But the colours are not vibrant for a Full HD display.not recommend for photo/video editing, gaming etc.best for casual daily use, reading, surfing through net,trading,movies etc.Recommend."
5,Sleek design.. White color makes more stylish.. Picture quality is awesome. Tried both as a TV and monitor.. 1) As a TV: picture quality is very much cool but In built speaker doesn't sounds good. Made only for notification sounds and not much loud.. 2) As a monitor: Blue light filter is much helpful for work from home purpose.. Perfect choice for ppl who are working from home
4,I bought this Monitor couple of days back and delivered it swiftly. Thanks for Amazon prime.Pros:Good display sizeGood picture qualityEasy setupCons:Can be provided with better speakerYou can't adjust the viewing angleOverall it's worth the price less than 8K and has a better picture quality than expected. Ran through couple of display test video from YouTube. Passed all test and HD resolution is good.Finally packaging was good small and adequate. Easy to carry for shifting purpose.
5,My Monitor is suddenly not working properly. Developed Screen resolution patch from below screen. nearly 75%. I need replacement for this. It is under Warranty.
5,Awesome productImage quality is goodVery satisfied with the product
5,An excellent monitor for the price.  Pictures are sharp and steady at high resolution.

4,"Excellent design, especially back side.Very narrow Basel and slim.Good finishing and colour, useful in offices where it is visible from backside too.In built speakers.Only one thing, all the connection sockets are backward, so wall fixing difficult.No indicator in front side."
5,monitor at a good price and its value for money
5,Goog
5,Best display. But if you want to buy it for speaker look for any other monitor.
5,Overall best
5,Best best
5,Gud looking clear pic quality & lowest cost worthy of purchase
5,Nice üëç
4,Moniter is good one but stand is not adjustable. Screen is looking some in band position. When seating in front of screen it is very awkward position to work on monitor. My samsung monitor was adjustable. And one more thing wall mountain clamp was not received
1,"By comparing the 1. Pics from the product description, 2. Pics posted by other customers in the review section and 3. Pics I have attached with this review, it would be evident that the product I received is completely different. i.e the back projection is bigger than the original, stand fixing arrangements are different, shape/size and cutout in the stand are different, description on the adaptor is different.How can a product from a branded company like zebronics differ when the model no. in the product description on amazon and on the product I received is the same. This proves that clearly, I have received a duplicate/first copy products.Further, if you can see the 4th pic I uploaded, the screw hole given to fix the stand is useless, as the hole is inside the monitor body and the screw can't be inserted."
5,Super picture Quality worth buy
5,Good quality
5,Nice product.
5,SERVES THE PURPOSE VERY WELL AS THE PICTURE QUALITY IS UPTO THE MARK AND THE MONITOR IS REALLY VERY SLIM IT LOOKS FANTASTIC.

5,Good quality
5,"The below reviews are based on my usage after approximately 1 month & have included some comparisons with my other monitor Acer RT240Y(the left monitor is Acer in my photos), as both are similarly priced. Please note that this is a 2020 model for Dell, and mine was manufactured in March 2020. It comes in the box with HDMI cable, so that is a good thing for plug & play!Pros:1) This is E2420HS which the seller provides,which actually is supposedly a costlier model than E2420H, which is a good thing!2) Loved the height adjustment for the monitor (can be seen in the photos) which I don't get in my other monitor RT240Y. I liked this!3) Speaker of this monitor is surprisingly good! Of course,it does not have enough bass or anything for music playback, but for Skype, usual content, movie watching etc this should do very well.4) Packing for this model from seller is absolutely top quality!Cons:1) NO 3.5mm audio jack for the monitor. So can't connect to ext. speaker (I have that in RT240Y, so I like it better in this feature)2) The screen seems to be less vibrant with a bit over flashy white in terms of colour output. Liked it better on my RT240Y3) This is mostly nitpicking, but the monitor swirls sideways on the stand. I wanted the entire unit more Sturdy if possibleOverall, a good buy & I can definitely recommend. I am super surprised on the speaker quality for this monitor so that overcomes all cons for me personally."
1,"The product says it is made in India, but, in the box, it is mentioned that it is made in CHINA. Not sure why Amazon is lying."
5,"Dell E2420HS. Yes, it is E2420HS, as the product images suggest (but description is of E2420H). It is an awesome product. Side bezels are thin, has in-built speakers. There are no Display Port, but HDMI instead. We can use it as TV also, by adding ChromeCast hardware through HDMI port. Great deal..!!!"
1,"This product has 16 Amp input cable, which is normally available in Bath rooms and kitchens only.And worst part of Amazon is, they are not taking this product as return, they will only replace.Very very worst experience with Amazon and this product.It's loss of money for me.I hate Amazon for this and will publish this in all social media as much as possible, that how Amazon is cheating the customers."
2,"No It does not have a display port, wrong information by seller. The main reason for me to buy this is item two ports HDMI and DP , it does comes with only HDMI and VGA."
2,The placement of input ports - HDMI and power are badly placed - struggle to connect to input devices - mine also came with loose power port connection so with slightest movement the power would get disrupted.. Also no Bluetooth ports or anything and sound output is low .. not worth 10K that I paid for ... also had to buy 15 to 5 A. Plug converter to use in the house else u will have to unnecessarily occupy the ac/ iron plug points ... Make sure u have one before the 10 day return policy wanes away
4,"I purchased 24"" DELL monitor. It was delivered within couple of days and price was also very competitive. Easy to assemble.Two issues 1) The monitor came with 15 amps power plug which is not suitable for 5 amps power socket at homes. Fortunately I had 5 amps power plug from my old monitor that came handy to swap.2) Outer package was damaged at several places, however the inner packings [ looks like they were the original DELL packaging] in good shape and hence the package survived transportation. Not sure why the outer package is so much damaged for branded electronic items."
5,"I have been using this monitor in my office. this is very good for text based works, like coding in IDE or terminal. This does not create pain in eyes. It has speakers as well in it."
5,Picture quality is good. It's height adjustable and has both vga and hdmi port. Very good for office work.But they gave 15 amp power cable and vga cable was also missing. I had to buy both the cables separately.
4,Good monitor for daily use. Good feature of adjustable height. Using it just for an week now. No issues as such. Easy to assemble. 16a power chord provided. Please ensure you purchase a 6 amp to 16 amp converter before purchasing the monitor.
2,"display is good , but the in built speakers are not good"
4,Picture quality is good. It's inbuilt speakers are fine. It has one HDMI port and one VGA. It doesn't have USB and Bluetooth. It has height adjustable and tiltable features. Overall it's a good product.
2,"16 AMP plug provided, No VGA provided.. in this lockdown where will go and buy these two items and test it .. not expected from apparoretail .. very bad ... Spoiled complete experience.."
4,Its a good moniyot for the price offered. Suitable for notmal office wotk and entertainment purpose. Well built. Will lsst long for sure.
2,The power cable !! 16 A for a monitor for home users and no mention of it in the product spec as well.
2,"It comes with a 15 Amp power plug, now where am I supposed to go and get 15 Amp to 5 Amp converter during this lock down in bangalore."
4,LCD quality is not awesome but good
5,The ability to adjust the height and angle of the screen easily makes it an amazing buy.
5,Excellent so far and especially speakers as pointed out by many.
4,Very good build quality and picture quality.....Thanks Amazon for fast delivery....
1,Current supply  wire is not good to dell monitor it is worst
5,it is very good choice during this pandemic.
5,this monitor works very good
1,ok but not use printing  monitor  this  is low  wast of money
5,Worth money !
4,Nice
1,Received damaged product and they refused to accept return
5,"It's really good for the developer , the best part is you can rotate it in both directions (horizontal and vertical). I really like this monitor"
4,"Overall good product in the 27"" monitor range. Like the adjustable height, tilt and orientation. Thin bezel makes the product look sharp.Not so satisfactory on the text display. You can actually see the grid when set at 1080 resolution, which might be upsetting (can offest by using dark theme). But compared with thrice the price point to a 4k monitor, this is a compromise I took( used the 4k ultrasharp monitor in office)If you have the budget go for the Dell U series 27"" monitor. Otherwise, a good 27"" monitor in the budget."
5,"Overall a great monitor. Might be one of the best in 27"" for this price.The display is great. No leaking white from the edges. I would suggest this for anyone looking for a 27inch monitor for daily or office use."
1,"update:After many months of follow up, Amazon accepted the return (even though Dell/Seller did not provide warrantee)  and amount was refunded. Thank you........................................There are three major problems -1. Seeing vertical line on display within 1 week of usage. (Problem with return is that I have already thrown out box etc after 2-3 days of use). Dell is saying it has tampered S/N and cannot provide warantee. Waiting on Amazon/Seller for replacement.2. only regular display port connector provided (not miniDisplay, not HDMI) which most laptops dont have. So I had to order hdmi cable separately.3. Display quality is not great compared to my older monitor. (better to go for high resolution new models)Even though price was attractive and had positive reviews here earlier, vertical line issue (1) makes me feel cheated with substandard/returned product."
5,"The review would specially cover my purpose of purchasing this monitor. Apologies, if it does not serve the purpose for you.purpose of purchase: Productivity!. I wanted a wider screen where I can keep multiple windows side by side. while I type in an IDE (coding), I should be able to view a webpage or a terminal or any other tool in their original size as if they are on full screen.This 27 FHD screen is awesome.- Watching movies with movie mode on is an awesome experience. (if you buy for that reason)However, If you have one of the below requirements :- programming- browsing internet- productivity such as keep multiple screen sides by side to view all of them in original resolution.THEN YOU SHOULD NOT BUY IT. Better go for a higher resolution even if they are costly. TBH, I got the monitor a few days back and I am already in the market looking for a new monitor with a higher resolution display. specially 4k or QHD.pros:- Slim- Screen looks awesome- Great viewing angles. no issues there on any video- Multiple view modes for watching movies, gaming etc. This typically activates a preset profile that changes colour, contrast and brightness.- you can tilt, rotate, skewCONS! -- this is just a wider screen than your laptop. assuming you are using 1080p, it would just make things look bigger and probably the font won't be that clear.- it only provides DP cable. If your laptop doesn't have a DP port, you will either have to purchase a new HDMI 1.4 cable or buy an HDMI to DP converter For example: if I am using an IDE and want to keep another tool open on the side, it appears that the two windows are cut in half and does not look good."
3,"This monitor is great. I recommend Amazon to keep return window short for devices like this. The monitor I received was a returned monitor and the previous person used it for at least a week and packed it lousily and returned. Though I felt bad about returning a product during this pandemic, I had to, because the item is used and the warranty was already running."
2,"If you are planning to use it for text based applications like programming, documentation etc, this is not a good fit. Text is not at all crisp and you can see the pixels..27inch may be a bad Idea for full hd resolution..some applications were slightly blurred.. tried lots of setting changes but couldn't make satisfactory.."
5,"Best Monitor ever , I'm very happy with this purchase , picture quality is excellent , lots of ports , and much more.I buy from ZRPL Seller and it's packaging is very good , delivered with care.Note : HDMI Cable not Comes with monitor.Thanks ZRPL & Amazon India."
4,Text is very clear. No apparent jaggies or pixels despite 1080p on 27 inch. Windows 10 display at 100% text size is easy on the eyes.While watching movies/videos I discovered to my surprise that color. contrast and black levels look poorer than my old Dell 23 inch monitor. I cannot compare side-by-side (old monitor is dead) but black is definitely greyer than previous monitor. However the videos and pics still look good because of bigger size.Why is this so expensive though? Don't know.
1,The one I got is repackaged and has dust inside on various cables which were there inside. When I installed the monitor I got a sound suggesting some screw was loose inside the monitor. I am thinking of returning it (I have 24inch model of the the same monitor which I got directly from Dell and I love it but I am suspicious about the quality of the one which I got today from amazon).Update after 2 days: I placed a return request and waiting for a new product to be delivered. In the old product one of the USB port was not working as well
5,"Monitor has 3 degrees of freedom. It can move up down, rotate along vertical axis, and rotate along horizontal axis. It has total 4 USB ports. Only thing I disliked about it is that it has small openings at the top for exhaust. They could have kept it at the bottom. These existing openings at the top will accumulate dust if not covered with piece of cloth. Overall a good to go product!! I would recommend it."
4,"Good product, I like the features like adjust height and rotation in both horizontal and vertical way. And the USB Type-B input acts as a simple docking where all you peripherals can be added to monitor and connect it to your laptop/desktop every peripherals will be connected to your device. So that no need of connecting peripherals to multiple devices when you switch. Image quality is pretty good, not great1080p and as it is mat finish you see little dull in colors. Viewing angle is appreciable, no darkness with angle change. Blacks are not properly managed, you still see light bleeding in minimalistic and it can be ignored. Overall from my opinion it's a worthy product."
5,"If you want to use this at home for Work purpose , simply go for it. If you are expecting high refresh rate and gaming compatibility (gsync etc) ignore. Simply great for coding, browsing and casual use.Only dissatisfaction is that the delivery ppl have opened the box and damanged the box."
5,"I have recently order this beauty after enough research, this is an amazing master piece in monitor segment . this is the correct option for the professional , entertainment use.. I tried using with my windows laptop, macbok pro A1708, ipad pro 11, this connects with all the models listed and very useful and explored all the features , Horizontal, vertical mostly good for developers ..simply got for it ..!"
3,It's a great monitor. And it delivers in almost destroyed box and with something broken inside the monitor .The usb ports are also cheap quality.  Product is good but not the delivery
5,"the product was delivered on time, the box was intact with the the waranty card.Waranty was made active from the day the product was shipped.the product functions normally and is a good fit as a regular WFH monitor. definitely better than than a 24 inch monitor.no HDMI cable provided , instead a DP cable is provided which would not be of any use as most laptops will no have a DP connector."
3,"Amazing Monitor, matte finish offers amazing viewing angles (you can see it from absolutely any angle). However, it's too large and 1080p at 27 inch is not optimal. Go for 24 inch.As for Dual Screen, again 24 inch is better - 27 inch is too large for dual screen and just becomes uncomfortable. 24 inch is optimal.Source: I use 24 inch dual displays of the same model at work, and have a 27 inch one at home"
4,"The product is what it says, and has a decent picture quality, however within the given price tag (around 20k), there exist similar monitors that provide even more features like attached webcam and in-built speakers. If you require the flexible stand, then go for it, otherwise I'd suggest buying another one (a BenQ or Asus monitor)"
5,"No second thought, just go for it.I did an extensive research on monitors available. Found this to be best in price to product ratio.People complained about FHD resolution on 27"" monitor, but i really don't have any as picture quality comes out to be very good."
4,"Very good build quality.Though it may not have all the features of the other monitor vendor models, this monitor is well built and does whatever is expected of a monitor for daily use.I brought this along with a different monitor and I must say the quality of this product is impressive in comparison."
3,Pros:1. Reasonable price.2. Features like tilt and height adjustment.Cons:1. Low resolution for 27 inch. If you are okay with low resolution then best buy otherwise it will bother u
5,"Super monitor, good picture quality, easy to setup and a horizontally adjustable stand. I use the monitor primarily for coding and sometimes for watching online content and am satisfied with the picture quality."
3,received a defective item. moniter screen showing blank screen even power is on with hdmi cable plugged with my laptop. Not reliable product.
5,"I bought this monitor for setting up my workspace at home amid the current work from home situation. A worth buy and in case if you are considering a 27-inch monitor, don't hesitate and can surely go ahead. The build quality is really good and then dell reputation for their products could lynch you for the purchase.I bought it from ZRPL seller and it's been a great shopping experience and no hassle."
4,So far good its been less than a week.. delivery received in good condition. bad part is No HDMI cable and prices have dropped than what was offered in amazon festival time...
5,Liked this product and it has all feature as per mentioned.Packaging and delivery was fast and best.It could have one more hdmi but now I manage this using hdmi splitter so no issues.Thank you team
3,"Pixels get blurry and are not sharp. The screen is also not colour accurate. This monitor is Inappropriate for text and colour oriented use (programming, MS office, video/photo editing). However would be okay for watching moving content (not sure about games, don't play). You get what you pay for and this is true for this value priced screen."
4,Got this as extra monitor for coding purpose and it met my expectations.Little bit delay experienced while playing youtube if the video is played in extended monitor and audio In your laptop.I‚Äôm not working on any photoshop software and still the video clarity is really good.Finally the matte finish helps staying long work hours
5,"Nicely packaged and delivered, üëç to seller, monitor build quality is really good, good picture quality. Adjustable stand makes it flexible."
5,"Good quality, height adjustable is necessary. compare to other cheap monitor its Best DELL product only cons is price  but it has quality"
1,The monitor was damaged as you can see in the pictures.
5,Upto the mark & very satisfied with this purchase; Only thing is we could have got HDMI cable with this instead of display port + there should have been a description on the 20A power plug for which we had to arrange a socket
1,within a week a blue spot came on screen. do not believe this seller. The monitor is good but I think the seller is selling counterfeit products.very disappointed..
5,"Very smooth picture quality, does not drain your eyes even when u work for long hours.  I wish that they would hv included speakers and camera. It wud hv been a wonderful full package. Worth buying, in case u spend long hours in front of system."
5,I had bought this product last year and it was superb. This year I wanted a second screen so I got this. Not only it came with a different plug to last years 10A (this year it‚Äôs 16A) but the HDMI cable is missing. The return date is over so can‚Äôt even return it.
5,This monitor is very good one anti glare and IPS display is awesomeIt doesn't comes with hdmi cable but otherwise it's a great product
5,If you are looking for a monitor in the range of 20k then this is a very good product. It has full HD display but there is not much difference in full HD and UHD display at this size. I am using this for last one month and it's serving it's purpose.
4,Dell could have provided high performance HDMI cable along with the monitor. Other alternatives are behaving so weird and experiencing slugieness.
5,Height adjustment and swing adjustment is Very convenient for user. I am using this 27 inch monitor for my share trading. FHD supports for display indicators as very clear.
1,This is a good monitor.  But these guys sending defect pieces  intentionally. No standard verification
1,So much black bleeding issue. first received was so much black bleeding issue so I returned and got new one of same monitor but that too black bleeding same places so I returned again it's was not a issue of particular item the overall this product itself defective cheap panel.Final: if your into gaming and mostly use in lightning condition then you can go for it. But if your both movie and game lovers and use it movies it's definitely not worth it.
5,"In this price range you can't get anything better than this, it's Contrast Ratio 4000:1, brightness, 5ms response time and VA Panel Everything is soooo good. Which other brands like, LG, Samsumg, Dell, Etc can't provide in budget segment, Go for it, Oh One thing I forget it's curve that is awesome, you will not repent after buying this...$"
2,VGI and dvi port missing. Only Hdmi and display port available
3,"Dont buy the product by seeing the Product image. See the images which are in customer reviews. They have shown one image and sent other image.Overall, received the product for 13k.Cons:1. I see some blend issue when the screen is black.2. Panel is plastic.3. Only single USB port.Pros:1. Good for gaming."
5,Don't have VGA but worth price overall best performance
3,Decent monitor but needs some manual tweaks to get best out of it also only hdmi 1.4 so can only go 120 hz 1080p on hdmi
5,"Value for money,I am using for my gamming  ps4 pro"
5,"if you are looking for a budgey gaming monitor obviously go for it , its picture quality and display area is awesome too good for the price"
2,The product page has misleading specs. The monitor doesn't have VGA or DVI ports as mentioned.
5,The curve screen is cherry on top. Perfect gaming experience.  144hz response rate is a definite difference maker for hardcore gamer where every frame counts. Movie viewing experience may differ on the quality of video. Overall it's a good product by Acer.
5,U have to on FreeSync to get a good video quality otherwise it will flutuate the screen.
5,Best gaming monitor....Value for money ‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Fantastic monitor I must sayüòç. Those negative reviews are not for this monitor. Firestick works flawlessly. Only missing thing is internal speaker. Can buy with
5,Best one
5,It's is amazing moniter but they have written 165ghz but it's actually 144ghz only
5,it is really good infact due to the VA panel there is good picture quality along with good refresh rate
2,It's good value of money .There is 60hz display with HDMINot tried with DP cable
5,Very nice product but button quality is too poor but worth for money
1,Return is yet to be picked.
1,Damage product received again and again
5,Fine
5,165hz is awesome for gaming
5,Value for money
1,Not great
1,"No. 1, Qiaoguang Road, Chenjiang Street, Zhongkai New and High-tech Industries Development Zone, Huizhou, Guangdong, P.R.China. DUMP THIS CHINESE PRODUCT"
5,everything works fine and smoothness of 165 hz is lit....Pair it with a good gpu for 1080p gaming its great. got it for 12699/- at sellVirtual resolution works finecolours are accuratebezzels are less to compare
2,i have a bad habit of watching movies and very bad habit of measuring frame drops or quality drop now when i installed this monitor neflix HD had vidible stuttering and lag though it is 144hz dont know why but it has this problem and also movies in vlc player there was much more lag and stutter in movies but for games it worked butter smooth no problem at all on my old samsung 22 inch monitor no movie has lag it is butter smooth maybe 1080p is not enough for 27inch and text icons also on windows 10 looked bad fuzzy grainy unclear returned it i guess for 1080p we should stick till 24 inches only
5,"Day 1 review:Great Monitor, worked perfectly out of the box.No faults in LCD, perfect delivery by Amazon.On MSI website you can get 36 months warranty by registering.Performance is up to the mark, exactly as advertised.Curved display is truly special.Great for my personal use, gaming, movies and work.Will update the review if anything falls short, but so far 5/5!"
4,This review for Msi ...!best monitor in this range...Best color production & brightness....Go with this...!
5,"I purchased this almost 3 weeks ago. I have been using it daily for browsing, video editing and gaming. I game almost 2-3 hours daily and I did a lot of research in finding the best monitor under 18k which fits my requirement of FULL HD, 165hz and 27 inch screen. This one hit the bulls eye. All the reviews of this monitor online are positive. I would strongly recommend this to all those who love gaming and video editing."
4,The the performance is amazing and the overall pc is good but it isn't 165hz when you open the settings for increasing Hz the maximum available option is 144hz
5,This is so nice monitor (in VA panneIs). I was looking for high refresh rate monitor with good pannel but price and choice of products were mot matching then I got this monitor in 14.5k. In such a price range I was only getting TN pannels. I've played games with higb refresh rate its a very good monitor for gamer who does not play e sports. Talking about video quality color reproduction is good. I think if u get this monitor for 14.5 -15.5 k then it is good to go Monitor.Pro -1. Built quality2. 144hz refresh rate3. Good color reproduction than TN4. Better viewing angles than TN5. Good VA pannelCons-1. Might get input lag if u are an Esport player. (Casual gamer STFU and buy)2. Color reproduction is not at par with IPS pannel3. It's hight is not adjustable.
4,"This monitor does tick some of the boxes, however if you are looking for deepest blacks, great contrast, full frame to frame dispay then you might be disappointed. Overall if you get this monitor for a discount then it's vfm. However 27"" is overkill at 1080p. Go for 24"". Note that although this is almost bezelless, display has a cm border around it so it has ""internal"" bezel so to speak."
5,Very nice
5,First time using a curved gaming monitor.Looks & feels great.Awesome experience.
1,worst colour production and screen flickering issues very lags when playing picture quality is also very worst pls go for qhd monitor
5,The screen is peeling out
4,First time using a curved gaming monitor.Looks great. The colors are bright and I can easily get constant 120Hz refresh rate out of the HDMI cable. Awesome experience.
5,"Picture quality is fine , good gaming experienceAnd overall monitor is good"
5,"If you want a curved monitor with high refresh rate for gaming and design, just buy this one. It is just so good I am loving the experience with it."
5,Good viewing angles. very good built. will suggest to buy. no bleeding or ghosting issues in my experience.  shipping was good no damage what so ever.
5,Just go for it....
5,Best budget gaming monitor in the market right now soo happy with the outcome ü•∞ü•∞
5,liked everything
5,Perfect
5,Beast for gaming
5,üòçüòçüòç
5,It's just awesome .. I'm really loving it!!
5,"For gaming ,"
5,"I don't usually write a review but this particular purchase from Xtronixapp made me do so !!I got the product for ‚Çπ23,990 and just 10 days after the purchase it went to ‚Çπ21,200. I asked amazon if they could give me a refund of the difference (Coz I heard that they do give). They said that this isn't possible and if you need so then you need to return the product with an issue. I was facing with the freesync but that wasn't an issue for me and they were asking for the picture of something one couldn't. Like seriously, who can capture the black screen issue which I was facing for like a split second and at any random moment. Their so called Technical Guy was kinda rude and so much knowledgeable that he didn't know anything TECHNICAL and still land up in Technical department !! Irony,ehh ??I took a moment and searched for the seller on Google !! Explained him about the matter and he himself said that he would be compensating me with 2k !! It wasn't the exact difference but yeah he did and that was appreciable !! Love to the seller !!As far as the display is concerned -It is awesome - Just go for it ‚ù£Ô∏è (You can just buy it directly from the seller , Just Google his name and contact him, very down to earth)"
5,Excellent for gamingNice build qualityGood colour accuracyNo back light bleeding in my unitOverall satisfied with the product
5,Good
2,This is a LCD monitor and not a LED monitor as mentioned on the product page as well as on the box. On the product it is specified as LCD and the viewing angles confirm that. It is good only if you see the screen head on (same level as the monitor and directly from front). Not good enough of kept at a height.
4,"Nice product. Came on time. Very easy to install. A power adapter is no longer necessary, it is direct connection with an AC power cord.  The only issue is, the seller's description said it is a LED monitor, but, the product and the product booklet says it is a LCD monitor. The technical difference hardly matters to me, but, the product description and the actuality should have matched."
5,"Bought this monitor for a decade old Pentium PC. Price is good for 18.5 inch branded monitor. Picture quality is good enough, no issue of dead pixel and it is LED (not LCD as written in some of the reviews). This is not meant for gaming or even for software development; considering larger, faster and vivid monitors available now-a-days. But this will get your job done for occasional mail check, social networking and office work. Could also be used for your IoT or DIY job where you need a secondary monitor or a display for your Raspberry Pi etc."
4,I just needed a LED monitor to replace the old CRT monitor that is occupying lot of space. This computer is only used for preparing word documents for official purposes. So I was not keen of buying a high quality monitor at an expensive price. This model suit my needs. It is also branded. During a sale I got this for Rs 3500. It is not a IPS monitor. So viewing angles are not great. Only the person sitting opposite can view properly. The color rendering is not bad and not great. Overall buy it only to use as a desktop monitor for day to day works. To watch movies or gaming choose some other LG model at a higher price.
5,"Pachage was good. Good monitor for home use. Side viewing is also good not very good because its a TN panel. Its not LED it backlite led, its an LCD monitor"
5,The monitor I got @4511/-. Its a very useful and good product in this price. The picture quality is good. VGA port was also supplied. My old LG monitor worked for 11 yrs continuously and then after its retirement I purchased this one. after one week of use i feel so comfortable with this. although i generally don't use it for a long time so can't tell about heating issue. moreover i don't play games so don't know if gammers will love it or not. I am happy with the product.... And thanks to amazon for timely delivery. overall rating 4.8/5.0
2,"According to Amazon website this computer Acer is flexible. It is written on the website that the horizontal viewing angle is 95 degrees while the vertical viewing angle is 65 degrees.When i installed the desktop and started using it, I found that it is fixed. There is no movement at all. Called up call center to complain. Surprised how can a company claim movement and then ship a different product.  Looking forward for resolution of this product"
5,"Awesome and the main point is that after sales service of Acer is superb... previously I have purchased a same product though not form Amazon. I faced a problem after 6 months and I make a docket to  acer ,after receiving my complain within 15 days during the lock down period they alter the product. I am very very much Satisfied from Acer."
5,"Product was ordered on Saturday night with a promised delivery by Sunday 9pm..it was delivered well ahead. Kudos to Amazon's logustics support.Coming to the product- it's good for the price point bought it on Amazon sale..plus you get a warranty. It's super light, easy to install, it's a LED monitor unlike the box side label description says LCD. Refresh rates are good and I Max resolution is 1368x 768. Has screen different modes on the monitor settings which is well hidden below the bezel. Overall happy with the product.Note: it has two inputs on rear panel, RGB slot and Power Cable slot which can be directly plugged into UPS or normal AC power socket."
5,"I buy this for my kid because crt monitor has continuous radiation for which it was very tough for a child to use computer.monitor first I received was faulty.after replacing it was satisfactory.It is only 19"" in size so I think gaming purposes using is not possible.I read pdf,viewed cinema and using microsoft office.I am satisfied"
5,Very good product
5,LikesStunning crisp clear picture qualityIPS HD display like we have in smartphones todaysleek and thinLight weightCables are of good qualitybetter packagingUnbelievable affordable price @ 4500DislikeNo TV portDesign is basic but not really bad!I would recommend to buy this product at this price range!!
5,"Nice product. Came on time. Very easy to install. A power adapter is no longer necessary, it is direct connection with an AC power cord. The only issue is, the seller's description said it is a LED monitor, but, the product and the product booklet says it is a LCD monitor. The technical difference hardly matters to me, but, the product description and the actuality should have matched."
1,Don't buy it...this monitor show LED but this monitor is LCD ....so don't purchase.....seller misguide customers.....
5,Using this monitor for more than 5 months n writing this review after  usage of 5 months.Good product at this price range.Good packaging of product n shipping of monitor was very good.And very good supplier.üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ
3,"quality of stand bracket is not so good.it have very low quality stand bracket(i prefer to buy samsung or LG or Dell),not stiffed.the total monitor will dangled if there is little shiver in your computer table.Graphics=goodbrightness=goodgaming=HDMI is not available,only VGA port is there...thus so so for gaming...(why not you just buy a gaming monitor) otherwise its ok for normal work condition."
4,It is a good looking display with small Bessel. Considering the size 18.5 inch it's resolution is very small. I can even see each individual pixel sometimes. Since it has TN panel image refresh rate is high as mentioned in the product description and since it is powered by led backit it is producing good amount of brightness. At the same time it having poor viewing angle and color reproduction is not that accurate. Considering the price it is worth.
4,BEST MONITOR FOR GAMING OR FOR OFFICE WORK
4,Colors not so true or good. Can be purchased just for using general office work and internet surfing. Not has HDMI port.But for this value nothing fancy can be expected.
2,is it a led monitor or LCD monitor?  I think it is LCD . One place at the box it says LCD. The view is not clear when looking at fron an  angle. LCD is like that. Don't fool customers
5,"Good angle view and light weight monitor, suitable for gaming and office work, i purchased this for 4k price, go ahead this monitor without question"
4,Slim monitor and good quality. Only problem is doesn‚Äôt have HDMI option.
5,Very good product at this price.
4,Good monitors. I wanted to buy 2 more but seller has suddenly increased price by 400 rs !!Suggest the seller to follow fair practices so that he doesn't lose customers.Cheers
1,"It is not led and the brightness is yellowish after using for 1 month and the display is not up to the mark and now finally the screen is blurry I want to exchange it, and I had change the rating."
2,"Display box shows 18.5 inch which is around 47 cm. But the monitor is 43 cm in size which reduces furhter inch from 18.5 inch. So there is conflict of size in the provides information. Also, the box has tilt option to the monitor view. But the monitor has only static view."
5,"Its been over 5 months and no issues found so far. Features wasnt much of a priority for me, as long as long as the picture quality was good and it was easy on the eyes and it seems to have passed on both of these points."
2,"Not good for gaming. Picture quality is ok and thing to note, it is LCD and not LED monitor. The cover says LED but clearly mentioned on monitor's back it is LCD. Even the pic quality confirms it"
3,The LED panel put pressure on eyes......
2,"Screen color is VERY unstable, many times its bluish and flickering, used for one day so far, hoping it will last. It was cheap, but maybe that's why it was cheap as its not A quality product...."
4,Decent one. Does the required job. There is no 1080p resolution support and no HDMI support in this monitor. So decide accordingly
2,"it is a LCD display with LED Backlit, so pictures quality is quite low. Also viewing angel not satisfied. but it is a good product for replacing CRD monitor."
5,"The product came in good condition, works well with good definition."
5,Using this as my home CCTV monitor. Its always turned on.Picture quality is great!Sharpness and colors are also great!Best buy under ‚Çπ5000/-
2,Very poor picture quality.  Manual is an apology for instructions.  May be Acer hates its own product but somehow wants to sell it.
4,"It is a great monitor in its price range and is suitable for outdated computers which only supports analog output(VGA). However if you have a brand new System that supports HDMI output or digital output then this is not the right choice to go with, you would have to go for higher models that supports HDMI input."
5,Good quality and very good price. It's the same thing available in retail stores too but at a much higher price. This size of montor with this quality is best in this range. Completely worth
5,Acer 18.5 inch (46.99 cm) LED Backlit Computer Monitor - EB192Q (Black) good work
5,I purchased by discount it is good worth for e.
4,"Good product, could have cone eith Dvi or hdmi"
5,"Amazing Display , i use this display for animation but i play game also i thought this is good for gaming also.... I've Played games like pubg & Gta V it's refresh rate is also good. Overall i recommend this monitor .... Light weight & good Quality."
3,"I was hasty in buying this and realised that it is not LED backlit as that information was not available anywhere. I had a BenQ 22 inch LED monitor which was much better than this. The only reason I bought this brand is to ensure My graphics card (Asus) has no compatibility issues as HDMI output did not work with my BenQ Monitor. Better to opt BenQ, HP or LG."
1,"The monitor showed irregular white patches right from day 1 in the lower half which became quite evident in a white background. It was possibly due to irregular contact/compression from the ?circuit board behind. However, it was tolerable. Next problem started by the 2nd year of use: The On-screen display (OSD) menu comes on and off randomly without me pressing any buttons. I then increased the transparency of the OSD menu to make this less annoying. Now, in the third year of use, the monitor has started showing flickering horizontal lines in the lower third, which is difficult to cope with. Hence, I find this monitor to be of poor quality and not value for money."
1,"Really I like this monitor but Amazon has sent 2 times factory seal opened box with black screen bleeding.Picture quality is awesome in this monitor but black screen bleeding is ruining the show.Pathetic service by Amazon. Only upside is we can return but down side is they are going to send this to other customers, may be to you.I really want this monitor, Amazon please send me new monitor. I'm buying new monitor not refurbished."
4,"PRO:Picture quantity is really good considering the price. I generally use this for graphic design work. Colors are good.  Monitor is ultra thin with minimal bezel that gives it an premium look. Not too large, not too small Fits perfectly on your regular table. Mine came with an HDMI cable to connect to laptop/desktop. Screen finish is matte which aids in deflecting any annoying reflection. Overall value for money.CONS:Brightness is too much even on lowest setting. Might cause stress on a long use. Giving 4 stars because of this."
1,"My monitor adapter started malfunctioning, if I try to reach all possible channel to seek help, but none of them are taking responsibility including Amazon. Instead they are making very nice statements like its not under the warranty, I purchased it in May-2020.  So I guess while purchasing from ASUS be careful.. Service centre guys are also so irresponsible."
2,Screen was bleeding at one place. Got it replaced. Even the replaced one has bleeding issue. Don't knw if I should keep it or just get rid of it. Any suggestions welcomed.
3,ProsColor Quality Amazing +Accurate ColorsGaming Mode60hz refresh rateGood  Gaming for console Ps4 & XboxConsNo HDRLight Bleeding from Day 1Sound 6 /10
5,"Best Monitor, good thing is reasonable rates it's giving quality and it's non chinesse product.Amazon delivered on time during lockdown."
5,Amazing graphics. Just too much bright for night even at lowest brightness.Marvelous quality else-wise
5,i use this for gaming only and i must say that the monitor is really good with various levels of blue light reduction thing go for it
5,Excellent value for money.
4,"Product is good, But don't take this stupid seller Its display is very good this product value for money You can buy but not from this seller"
5,Value for money.

4,"Got this monitor finally after weeks of hunting around for good Dell or HP size 24 screens.This is a decently good screen. The colours are vibrant and comes with an array of settings and options that you can personalize to your viewing tastes but can be a bit tedious to get it right . The monitor looks good but looking at the back panel it felt a bit plasticy and cheap but the front looks cool . The thin bazels are practically invisible .The speakers I have not used much and doubt the 2x1.5 watt speakers are strong enough .If using in a dark room ensure you switch to night mode else the brightness hurts the eyes.ProsMatt screen with no glareCool look and sleekGood output in colour and display is crisp and customizableTilt feature is thereExtremely thin bazelComes with inbuilt speakersGreat viewing angelsConsThe backlit can be a bit too bright and needs to be extensively adjustedThe buttons for menu are very plasticy and make a loud clicking sound and the screen wobbles when making adjustments else is sturdyBuild quality is not that greatThe screen reboots Everytime you switch on or off additional speakers you may have connected to your desktop ( if monitor is connected by HDMI). I am guessing this is something to do with the inbuilt speakers . Not sure if other monitors do the same .In all its a good screen , the contenders were dell s2415H (didn't buy it because of the reflective glare - if your ok with that then buy it without hesitation) and HP 24es - it's a beautiful monitor but was unavailable so went for Asus."
4,"This is a value for money monitor, in this price is a good monitor . I have a little issue , my monitor headphones Jack is not working.but otherwise very good quality monitor."
1,very bad colour ips pannal is also very bad
3,"The stand is good for my quad monitor setup of 27"". It's sturdy. But the base is not heavy. It's hollow from bottom side. So if you fit a screen on one arm it topples on that side till you add another screen on other arm. Also the arms resting in air so there are problem in symmetricity along the arm length. For my setup left arm level is slightly (4-5mm) lower than right arm. So the screens are not fitting with corner to corner perfectly. If this does not bother you, you may consider 5/5 points for finishing and sturdiness."
5,"Really a good product and genuine seller , good support and will surely recommend it .Well designed and well made product ."
5,I bought this product for setting up my 4 monitors and i must say the product is a 5/5.Easy install and proper working.
5,A great product for the price good finishing and quality
5,"Highly recommended for multitasking and increasing productivity. Strong, sturdy and value for money."
5,Good
5,This is my second one..... Cheers worth it... More studier when compared to quad setup .. I got 2 of these..
5,"One of the best investments. Highly recommended if you don't want to drill holes into your table! good one, strong."
5,"Very nice , strong product"
5,EVERYTHING IS SUPERB FOR THIS PRODUCT:1) BUILD QUALITY2) CONTROLS3) THE PACKAGE COMES WITH IT..EB=VERYTHING INCLUDED EVEN ALL THE TOOLS REQUIRED4) I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY STAND WITH THIS TYPE OF QUALITY CONTROL AND FINISHING!!
5,"This purchase, im not sure if the price is right since its my first dual monitor stand. Given the situation with the pandemic, it felt like decent investment for a wfh setup.First impressions, the package is huge, equal to a single days suitcase.The parts were packed well and organized. Super sturdy and solid. Got a lot of extra screws to fit a monitor.Instructions were easy to follow and i completed the setup in 30 minutes mostly coz i had to redo some work coz i ignored some instructions.My review? Love it., Super satisfied with the purchase, realized that every part has a purpose, either aesthetically or functionally. Definitely recommended specially since i dont have to attach it to my table and exist standalone. Worth the extra 800 when compared to the cheaper version."
1,"The stand is heavy as is expected to handle the weight of two monitors, robust and very good engineering and finish. Unfortunately, the product and its replacement, both had a manufacturing defect. The monitors if fixed to this stand would either face the ceiling or the floor - see pics. Basically a 90-degree rotation in one of the frames which can be fixed by drilling holes on the metal arms using a drill - we did not want to do this. The finish and engineering were of the highest standard - but unfortunately had to return this twice. I will be happy to buy this if the problem is fixed."
5,"Its worth the money if your goal is to get the job done.  It has a sturdy build, the base is heavy and the mounting stand also feels sturdy. The paint is delicate so better get the assembly done on a cloth surface. The plastic bits are not very nice but since it hides behind the panels, I wont complain. There are a lot of reviews complaining of batch defects which may be true but the box I got had no issues. Its just like any other product from Amazon its either a peach or a lemon depends on your luck. I would say go for it if you really need it for that sweet looking dual screen setup else just use the stock stand from the monitors and use it side by side."
5,"It is a very nice product if you are looking for a dual monitor. Alignment and Sturdiness are very perfect.The found issue in the manual document not well described just pictorial representation. Majorly issue found direction set in Monitor mount part Initially, I thought defective piece, but It is Ok. (need to a loose screw).Last point, No need to search lot and lot time on the net to found the best stand it would make you mad. This price range this one of the best products. I found it perfect for my dual monitor 24"" dell P2418D and dell P2419H"
5,I Am Motion Graphic Designer. I have been using dual monitor setup for the past 10 yrs.... I have used many dual monitor stand. This dual monitor stand is so strong and steady. I am having two dual monitor stand one in office and one in home. Both are holding two 27inch monitors..... If you are looking for a dual monitor stand.... Worth buying this product..... Very high quality...... Premium finish......
5,I purchased around 21 pcs for my office and they are amazingly well built. They are sturdy and very easy to assemble. Its nicely packed and you get every single tool inside the package which is required to assemble it. I researched many product before finalising this one and I don't regret for it. This is surely a great value for your hard earned money.
1,"I received the product, however, the orientation of the monitor arm is wrong. It either points upwards or downwards. It is unable to rotate along an axis that would actually make it usable.I asked for a replacement hoping for a piece that would actually work, however, I received a defective piece again.Have finally asked for a refund. The actual build quality seems fine, however, the product itself is unusable unless you want to view the monitor from a supine position, which i'm guessing is not something most people want to do."
1,"Good built product however, like few others experienced it has wrong orientation. The monitor shall face downwards instead of facing you. Manufacturing defect in this Feb imported lot. Ordered replacement but faced similar issue"
5,"Mind blowing product.Was not so confident while purchasing because of some reviews but when got delivered it was easy to install.Quality is nice, strong metal with great finishing.Received all required items in package.Thank you Amazon Basics for such a nice product."
1,After installing the vesa mount were facing downwards. Seems like a manufacturing defect and still amazon ships the product without checking it
4,Overall nice product in this price range
5,I can rotate the monitor whenever I went just need a longer HDMI or Power Cable
3,A solid stand but its clamps are way too big for the table. Just keep in mind that you will need a lot lot space in order to make this work. If you have a huge table like a dinning table then its perfect stand for you.
5,"I have 2 22"" monitor and It works perfect for me. Very good quality materials used and all the needful things are provided in package."
1,As mentioned by few members that there is a design fault material sent. with this  product the monitor faces downwards or to sky and not facing you. both time got same faulty product.
1,Useless product.
5,Highly recommended if you have dual monitors.
4,Rubber Sticker for the base is not a good quality
5,This product is for connecting dual Monitor.
4,Best product
4,It‚Äôs LCD NOT LED. Don‚Äôt confuse with the product description.
4,"Bought for daily use like multimedia, docs editing and light gaming.At this price point don't expect mind blowing display on this monitor.Pros- Easy and clean setup.- Good Picture Quality. Blacks are especially good. ( Need to set that via OSD settings)- Curved Display for a monitor in this size and price range.- Anti Glare matte black screen.- Very Thin Bezels on three sides. Bottom is also fairly thin and very minimalist looking.Cons- Perhaps the biggest con I felt was that it didn't come with an included manual. Had a really bad time, spending almost half a day to adjust its OSD settings as it has only 1 power button for everything. After a while I figured out the power button alone controls all the OSD settings. Even in its online manual this is not mentioned and I found it in another related model's manual.- Only HDMI and DVI port. ( But what do you expect at this price range anyway ?)- The back cover feels a bit cheap sometimes and its not so easy to take off and on all the time. ( Wont be a problem if you close and just use the monitor.)-Missing height adjustment option. Need to keep some material below to raise it up.Overall is a good priced curved Monitor if you are a light pc user looking for curved display at this price and size. 4/5.Edit: Also its LCD not LED."
4,"Great monitors, nice curve and using them both at the same time is a great experience. Quality is good and everything is working fine. I am not a gamer, so using them for office and home purposes.ProsCurved, almost bezel less, good qualityCons,1. No vesa mount which is fine at this cost2. Very slight - Pixels can be seen and not as crisp as other monitors again which is fine putting the cost in mindI loved it and using then everyday without any issues so far. Will post a long term review after a month"
2,"The pixel density matters. More than 22"" monitor always needs higher resolution. This monitor will give you maximum of 1080P resolution. That is why you will not be able to read texts. All are blurry. Go for a QHD monitor for above 22"" or 4K if your pocket permits."
5,"Firstly, Its a LCD VA Panel with a LED backlightPros:Good Contrast Ratio,Deep blacks,75hz refresh rate,Build quality is good,No backlight bleeding what so ever in my unit,Felt very smooth while playing Cs Go and Valorant with 4ms response timeCons:Colours are not very punchy out fo the box specially in videos . (Need to change the settings for that)The brighteness at the lowest is a bit highOverall the panel itslef is good considering its a VA Panel  with deep blacks and you can change the settings for a more punchy look but not for content creators"
5,"Awesome picture quality, excellent contrast, Curvature looks nice,especially deep blacks look like OLED!Previously, i owned IPS monitor, but after seeing this, i fall in love with this monitor ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èI think this VA monitor is far better than any IPS Monitor in this price range."
5,Good picture quality. Tried some videos in Amazon prime and it was good.
5,really nice display I got it for 9000 and I am happy with it so far.colours are excellentgood blacksit has some very little manufacturing defects but what do you expect from a cheap curved monitorrefresh rate is 75hzI find it too bright at the lowest brightness too so that's the only complaintoverall I am happy with the purchase.
4,"The button to control the settings is actually a joystick under the belly of the display right below the logo of AOC. It's very fragile. Quality could have been improved, but for this price it's a decent product."
4,Surely looks more expensive than the price. Feels somewhat washed out even with the adjustments
4,cd was broken in thw box. and tha panel of LCD was not pasted accordingly. strap is coming out from the main body
1,"I ordered the product on 16th March, 2020 and I found a dot in my screen. On raising a service request at AOC on 19th March, they said after lockdown they will attend. Today I called the customer care and found the request was closed on 5th Aug without even telling me.Even the screen has different brightness levelThe issue is in panel. Brand new Monitor had panel issues.Also on talking to customer care, they informed installation should have happened for the same. But nothing was provided for meI wonder how Amazon is authorizing such sales of the defective monitor"
1,Had oder this aoc monitor ... And it got cracked from inside  within 14days. Its 100% faulty product by amzon india.  product has 3 years of warranty but aoc india is refusing to warranty they doesnt have good customer services .and thier email system is bot replying.. Customer calling service is very very bad they are very confusing ... They only tell to mail which is bot actuallly which is telling us to pay n repair then why 3 years warranty . This monitor is very cheap parts from inside very very cheap.. Had lost now 10600rs now be carefull guys before buying ... I am in big losss now its just 14 days only 14 days and amzon cant even replace it .. Guys its just 14 days ...
5,"I have been using this monitor for more than 2months and the display quality is really good.....best for programming ,gaming as well for watching full HD videos......no regrets.....you can buy it without thinking....really awesome product"
5,Nice look and good picture quality. Worth for the price offered for this product. Every AOC monitor comes with 3 years of warranty and peace of mind. My previous AOC monitor git replaced under warranty after 2 years.
5,Superb product realistic view ..I am very much happy with this product.
1,ok monitor looks great it is made of plastic but looks quite premium because of its build quality and white colour. picture quality is also good brightness level is high enough. display doesnt reflect lot of lights either. only reason why i gave one star is because it is defective one it turn on and off itself making a weird electric current sound from the back wire. i have ordered replacement i hope i dont get defective one again
5,Don't go for Samsung 24 inch curved monitor which costs same as this but has thick bezels and back light bleeding issue.
1,"Not led display, this is old led display, don't buy this."
5,I purchased this curved monitor on 30\09\2020 i have say that i am not gone on reviews i picked up this monitor becoz its style and uniqueness is very much i like before Samsung Curve monitor working fine and very well. I recomment everybody go for it and last but not the least special thanks to seller and amazon
4,"It's a great product. total worth for the money spent. one problem is that, if you are watching it in dark, or with dim lights on, then it's kinda too bright for the eye, I completely reduced all of the brightness. I still find it too bright."
5,Worth spending money
4,Picture quality is good. And it even has speakers which are too low but good..as there is no mention of speaker I thought I got the wrong one but it's the same one.build quality is average but for this price it's good.
2,Noticeable Manufacturing defects... Which you don't expect from such an old Brand like AOC
2,Overall this product looks good but expensive for a LCD montior. Also wrong product description here
1,This product is not LED it's LCD. Inbuilt speakers not working
5,nyc product and also value for money . but no user guide in the box. after all good product thnk u amazon

5,"Just got this monitor today.Panel is of very high quality and there is minimal IPS glow(good thing) which washes out the display on sides(this is present to some extent on all IPS panels).There is a slight backlight bleed issue on the left edges but not pronounced enough to send it back. Other than that, only con I can find is that color gamut is very low and monitor starts looking vibrant only after I move both contrast and sharpness to 100 %.Otherwise its a great buy at a great price and of great quality. Regarding gaming, if you are not a competitive gamer, this monitor will work just fine at 60Hz(if you have AMD GPU then you are all set as it goes upto 90Hz with freesync)Edit: color range issue is gone for the most part after I changed to a warmer gamma presetEdit2: So, I take everything back. It is an amazing monitor IF you are able to hardcode some settings that will be glossed over during auto setup. So, you have to manually color calibrate the monitor to correct slight blue-shift in its panal then you have to go into nvidea settings and setup custom resolution. With that you can set the color depth to 8-bit and overclock the monitor refresh rate upto 75hz which will make the colors look far more rich(almost to the extent of native HDR due to high quality panel) and monitor much more suitable for gaming. It will essentially make this on par with monitors twice its price."
5,"Samsung Display is the best display, I think. It is a true IPS panel. Awesome picture quality, vibrant colour contrast. Better than LG Monitor. ""Game Mode"" option giving Lag Free Gaming Experience.I can't understand, why other Customers' gave absurd comments & issues. I have got Genuine product with original accessories. Got it at 8000‚Çπ, I think, the Price is not possible Without Amazon."
1,"I bought this monitor with the intention of VESA mounting it. Most VESA mount arms in the market have groves for both 75mm and 100mm, so that you can fit monitors of all sizes with it.This monitor, however requires that the mount arm is 75mm ONLY. if it supports 100mm also, it's going to interfere with the bottom unit, thats non-removable.Shouldn't that be put on the bloody website?"
5,"Received the package in good condition, delivery could have been faster.The display is very good, calibrate the settings as per your needs.Pros :1. Slim form factor, color resolution at its best and most vivid and soothing.2. No screen bleeding issue ( till now using it for 2 days, ips display in large screens sometimes have it)3. Refresh rate, & response is very good. (on video playing, i am not a gamer and very happy at 4ms response rate)4. Flexibility with display settings, gives you 4 options in color tone, i prefer warmer tones as they don't strain the eyes. Eye care mode is also there, it is handy when using in low lighting.Cons :Difficult to point, however if some knit picking i do, then Samsung could have provided at least 1 level of height increase option, (that might have made the form factor slightly delicate and would have forced Samsung to increase weight of stand for balancing).Will update the review as i feel anything changes."
2,"This monitor might seem like a good deal,But its not.1. Picture Quality and Colour Reproduction is Below Average for IPS.It's has a major shift towards warmer tonnes and yellow.2. Most surprising is how it doesn't even produce crisp text and lines. Abysmal3. It's Grey to get time is noticeably worse than any monitor I've used in past 10 years.4. Gaming is not good as input lag is not that great. But it ain't a gaming monitor, so it's fine.5. No Speakers6. Backlight bleeds from all sides, and especially extra from bottom edge.So,In closing Benq & Dell has much better monitors in same price.Last thing,Which I'm not blaming on monitor cause I'm not sure,It causes huge strain on my eyes."
5,"I was worried about how bad the backlight bleeding would be on a budget IPS monitor. But this Samsung monitor is quite amazing in that regard. After my Dell UltraSharp 24-inch died, I was a bit skeptical about  this monitor and how it would be in comparison. But I am happy to say that this monitor is even better than the UltraSharp. The Dell monitor had horrendous amount of backlight bleeding although I got used to it. The Samsung monitor's bleeding is within tolerable limits. I would have loved it even more if Samsung had included a HDMI cable instead of a VGA."
1,Screen bleeds on all the corners!!!! Terrible for something that is so pricey and has nothing special about it but just the price. Its a known fact that this is a manufacturing defect and the vendors and manufacturers usually argue and do not take responsibility inspite of knowing that it is a product defect!!! The customer is usually stuck with a defective product and a big chunk of money out of the pocket! Do not buy this product if you want value for money!Extremely disappointed!!!
5,"Great monitor by Samsung. I already had the 22"" variant, been using that for 2 years. Just got the 24"" version for a dual monitor set-up, and it works great! The monitor also has a response time option, though 99% of people don't need to worry about it. I play FPS games a lot and these monitors work great!Colors are good, brightness is great and the monitor looks good."
5,"This is the best 1080p monitor I have ever seen in an AH-IPS segment from a trusted brand Samsung!After Few months usage review:-This monitor is capable of upscaling content, it can be synced to your AMD graphics card for better picture quality & viewing experience in gaming!There is minimum light bleeding in 24"" but I never faced even any light bleed in the 27"" version of this model! I have both!This monitor in price of ‚Çπ8800/- is really worth the money as per my review, this is the best monitor for YouTube, Movies &... sometimes U can use it as TV if connected to Set Top box & external speakers!!Overall 4.5/5 StarsGuys just go for it without jiggling with other competitors!"
5,"Great value product, got it for 9999 on some promotional offer. Have latest freesync and can be overclocked. I will soon update the review with gaming fps. No speaker though but most monitor's inbuilt speaker aren't good anyways, we always purchase them separately"
4,Good display - connected it to my PS4 via HDMI and via VGA to my desktop. Very bright and has good colours. The backlight bleeding that others have posted about is not that distracting and you really have to look for it to notice it. It does not bother me and I am quite happy with the purchase. I would have given full 5 stars if Samsung had packed a HDMI cable with the monitor and also provided one more HDMI/DP port.
4,"This is an OK monitor in terms of clarity. I have used 27 inch FHD HP monitor with more clarity than this 24 inch FHD Samsung monitor. I highly recommend to turn on Samsung Magic Upscale to help with clarity. With upscaling turned on this monitor is usable for reading text, programming, web browsing etc.I am not impressed with this unit and will think twice before recommending it to anyone. I had expected better from Samsung.It would had been great if Samsung had included preset picture modes like Gaming, Text, Normal etc. I find that to be very useful to quickly adjust brightness to be comfortable with the time of the day and what feels comfortable to my eyes at that moment."
4,"A slim and stable device from Samsung. It is a basic level monitor but still somehow seems to give an impression that is is bigger than the 23.5 inches. I did not see any color bleeding. The blacks were deep. I do not use this monitor for gaming. Hence, it has not been fully pushed to its limits. But it has performed admirably while watching HD movies. I would recommend this product!"
5,"I bought this primarily to connect my macbook and work (lot of programming). The monitor is wide enough to split screen and work on two applications at the same time. I love this feature. The display quality is excellent and i have even started to prefer watching movies and tv shows on this rather than on my TV. I think this is the best value for money big, wide monitor available."
3,Colors are good. I use it for coding purposes and serves the job. Eye saver mode is good addition. The biggest con i would say is although samsung says it can be wall mounted you will not be able to find a wall mount for it in 2020 when all wall mounts are vesa compliant. The issue is screws are 75 X 75 but all the mounts support also 100 X 100 and the stand that comes with this monitor comes in way of installing a mount. Poor design by samsung.
4,"Have been using this display for about two months. No issues with the display panel. Use it as an external monitor to extend my laptop‚Äôs display. Even used it with a PS 4. However, the stand is is useless. Understood that at this price point you don‚Äôt get an adjustable stand but the one this has stoops a little. I have another Dell monitor and when you place them side by side the Samsung one looks like it‚Äôs leaning towards me. So I threw away the stand and got myself a dual monitor desk stand. Overall the display panel is good."
1,We excited to get this in the great Indian sale.Bought all accessories as well.The screen had bleed issues. placed for replacement. got a replacement next day.The second one had similar issue. placed return and refund order.Bleed is fairly visible on darker/black backgrounds.Amazon service was quick but the entire product batch seems defective.
4,Great monitor for gaming...Mild panel bleed present which is noticed only in dark...Picture quality is too good for details in gaming and movies but graphic card with HDMI in required for full clarity of monitor
1,Does not come with HDMI cable which is de facto now a days ;((üëøüò≠
4,I am using the product for work and watching movies.con - - no adjustable height - product was marked at much higher price during sale so as to give a feeling of higher discount. - little bit of colour bleeding while watching hd videos.
1,"I have bought this LED monitor and this was worst mistake by me. It has a Permanently fixed Nob on its back and it can't be removed. That being said, no wall mount can be fixed in it. Have tried buying multiple stands online then returned then explored multiple markets to purchase compatible mount but no luck.Atlast approached samsung to install it if they have compatible stand with them, even they denied we don't make it and it can't be installed. They shouldn't even give 4 holes on back to mount if it isn't compatible for mounting purpose.Please avoid samsung and Purchase either Lenovo or dell or anyother brand but no samsung pls."
1,"Panel is not proper, edges are bleeding light! it looks like refurnished piece! I am thinking wether I have wasted 9k"
5,"After a long search for a suitable monitor, I finally chose this model based on the recommendations of my technician. And I am happy that I did. The overall quality of the monitor based on its performance, looks and picture quality are excellent. I am happy that it was worth it."
3,"PROS: The monitor, size and picture quality is great.CONS:  monitor height cannot be adjusted. It can't even be tilted back and forth so there's no adjustment possible. Makes it difficult when I want to tilt it to a certain angle and I can't.No audio port."
5,"Very perfect at a very cheap cost. For gaming it's not much good but average. Not recommended for pro gamer. It gives true colour of picture. There is no more needed to adjust colour balance. Its IPS panel and 14ms responds. At this price point,  no negative for me."
2,"I was expecting quality from Samsung. This 27inch monitor has serious screen bleeding issue. I returned the first one and got the replacement. The second monitor also has the same problem. Thank you Amazon and ""Appario Retail Private Ltd"" (Seller) for the top class customer service and the refund."
1,has serious screen bleeding issues. waste of money. there is nothing great about samsung.so please dont be fooled by any sale.have applied for replacement . just hope that product is good next time otherwise  i need by amount refunded at any cost. such unprofessional business done by samsung . selling defective peices for sale online. please test the unit for any defect properly and send it appario.
5,"I love the specs, been using it for a few months now and zero complaints. Perfectly suits my needs while editing vids or photos. Only this is I wish the mount could be adjustable, but it's not a deal breaker."
2,"The damn monitor cannot be mounted using a wall mount or desk-mount bracket because the factory-fitted stand that comes with the product comes in the way of screwing in the mount. Cannot even imagine that Samsung will get this wrong. Turns out, this is a common problem with many Samsung monitor. Appears as if they sub-contracted the manufacture to some small-time manufacturer with a poor design studio. My purchase was a waste."
1,Do not buy this product. It has a screen bleed is pretty bad. I wish I had trusted other reviews that mentions screen bleed. See the images posted by customers in the review. I trust Samsung brand but this was a surprise to me. The seller doesn't answer your questions and asks you to contact Amazon. Surprising!!Note - There is no mention of Warranty by the Samsung warranty for Monitors above 14 inches in 3 years.
4,"So far good, product as per the expectations, using this monitor for screen extension for office work. Dont see any buttons for modifying the display settings, would have to look for the way to update it.No HDMI cable with the box, had to purchase from the local shop."
1,"Worst Product, Its been 1year 2 months now display is gone now please don't buy not even worth for a year."
4,A decent purchase. one HDMI and one VGI port are available. It is light weight. if the table is not sturdy the monitor keeps shaking when near a fan and that is irritating. controls are good. decent size for working. Happy with the purchase so far.
4,I bought it to keep an eye on resolution of the video I'm making. So far it's good. The only concern is company doesn't give HDMI cable along with the purchase. Neither Amazon is offering any combo to purchase HDMI with it. Rest is good so far and wish for good experience throughout.
4,cant expect too much at this price range and for wahts its worth it delivers. i have a 13 year old 24inch LCD form samsung aswell.. picture quality wise my older one still has better colors while the new led one is more sharp and bright.
5,"Got it two days ago, had to spend 300 rupees to buy a HDMI chord to connect to my laptop. The color display is excellent , movies from Youtube look great. I don't do gaming so I don't know how it works for thatI hope it lasts for a while!!"
4,"Excellent product in this price range ,i got it on 9500 on a offer period,very good picture quality,overall a great monitor by samsung.But no inbuilt speakers as mentioned.1 hdmi port and 1 dvi port.No HDMI cable provided.But the picture quality is excellent.loved it."
1,"Not good.. After 1 month monitor suddenly stopped working.. Not loading screen, showing black screen.."
4,everything fine..just gets the job done..it‚Äôs got a sharp ips colour accurate panel.except for the one thing that when ever i change the audio to some other device.. and switch back to the monitor it doesn‚Äôt work.. i‚Äôll have to pull of the power i mean turn it off and on to again work properly.. except for that that‚Äôs an amazing product
4,Decent HD monitor for GSync and 144hz on a budget with a brand name. Brightness is a tad low compared to other monitors 50% on my Acer is equal to the 100% on this monitor. Speakers are tinny and aweful. Colors are not all that vibrant compared to Acer TN monitors. GSync works well and the gaming experience is immersive just because of the sheer size I upgraded from an Acer 21 inch and the 3 inches surely make a difference.
1,Monitor is good for gaming but one problem text is bit blur...So can be used for gaming only not for official purpose...
5,Very good monitor. Speakers are not very loude . Can be used in landscape and portrait.
2,This monitor doesn't have good viewing angles. It says 144hz but it's limited to 120hz. Had to calibrate a lot to get good visuals.
3,This is not ips pannel. It's TN pannel. It has has bad viewing angles. Seller not mentioned in the description. Think before purchase
5,"Dell monitors are of good standard quality as always and got delivered in 2 days. Kudos to Amazon. Bought it at 10.5K after 10% discount with bank offer.Pros,1. Good for office work. Initially thought that it is little bigger and later realized it is perfect size.2. Color reproduction is accurateOthers :1. No height adjustment (pay more for getting this option)2. One HDMI and one VGA port (not a con as you already know how many monitor has before buying.3. MADE IN CHINAThis monitor serves all needs like office work, surfing and browsing including watching movie. I don't play games, so don't know about how it plays out.  I'm very much satisfied with the purchase with 3 years warranty don't hesitate to buy this in price range mentioned above."
1,"I have all setting, and windows color calibration but the colors are still over-saturated. The overall monitor is good but the color are not real, for developers this monitor is good but for those who want real colour it's not recommended.the main issue I found in yellow and green shades and tried all setting and talk to customer care but problem exist."
4,Excellent product. Have been using for a week now and we love it. I am putting only four stars for now since I don't know the long term performance.. so far it is really good product.
1,Don't buy this monitor. It suddenly stopped working after the 3rd day of purchase.  Screen started flickering. It was still within amazon return window. So returned it and purchased a new one of Benq EW series
5,"DELL never seize to amaze you with their design and quality. After a lot of analysis and comparision, I got this for 11K change and I'm completely satisfied with this product. Packaging and delivery is fantastic by amazon. Go for it if this falls in your budget."
1,After couple of months of use the HDMI port failed. Now I have to use the VGA port. Not sure how to engage Amazon or the seller to replace the product.NOTE: when the product was delivered initially it was a broken screen which was picked up by amazon and replaced. So its not been a good experience with the product
5,"Best in class monitor, good looking, clear crisp sharp display. Good delivery with safety by seller storazeBiz.Overall nice product."
4,Crossing my expectations limit .. really nice picture quality .love it
4,No Issues seen either in delivery or the quality of the monitor.
5,Looks like an expensive monitorA great monitor for this price.
5,Good screen. Worth it.
5,happy to have bought this.
5,Like
1,Worst Display
5,Good quality
4,"This is a nice economical entry level full HD LCD Monitor with backlit LED. It has a wide range Of input ports (no USB port though). I am using it with my Amazon FireTV stick and streaming Amazon Prime, Netflix, Disney + Hotstar, etc. as well as my old Lenovo laptop. Connected my old Altec Lansing 2.1 speakers for a much better sound output quality and volume than the 2 built in speakers. Only item that would have been very useful is a remote control for adjusting volume, picture quality etc. And a little more gap for ports from the corner to fix audio out jack would be very helpful.Delivery was super fast, contactless and on time thanks to Amazon‚Äôs amazing delivery service plus I got a 10% discount for Prime day sale !!"
2,"Only For those who care about quality otherwise good product:Build quality of the product is not good. It feels cheap. Metal parts are left unpoliished(Made in china). Buttons make loud tuk-tuk sound when pressed. Panel looks purplish instead of black because low quality LED's are use used to make the panel. Brightness is good but that does not matter, because what is the point of it. This is the reason why it is not good for watching movies in night.For gamers its is good. Take Care."
4,For that size full hd ll not to be great idea if you are working close by screen you can see the edged some of the oval objects Because of the TN panel can give you faster respond but if you are not player or once in while playing game it is better to go IPS panel butwhat is the best is ?The software of the BenQ is working nice sensor is very active and usefull if you are working long hours it really nice to have it those sensor no need to adjust screen backlight and also giving so many other option you are not having problem of having huge screen in dark night it doesn‚Äôt tire you eyesColor gamut is not really great i am not saying worse but not definitely the best .dark seen in the movies are not good at all
2,1. Audio in Monitor doesn't work2. The Brightness can't be adjusted if brightness intelligent is turned ON3. Not height adjustable
5,"BenQ is the Best Monitor I've used, I've been using BenQ monitors since 2010, & this is my 3rd BenQ monitor that i bought for gaming For my 3rd PC that I Build myself. A TN panel Monitor with Refresh Rate is 75hz with 1ms Response time & 1920x1080 resolution Is Very Good At this Descent Price, You are getting so much. Believe me this is my 3rd BenQ monitor, and the other 2 that I've used in the past were also amazing i still have 1 of them and the one that i bought first i sold 2 years ago & it was working good after 8 years, the 2nd one is still working fine, BenQ is trademark for Monitors, If you've a good budget then you can go for ZOWIE Gaming monitors That is a Subsidiary of BenQ For Gaming Monitors."
3,Picture quality is good but why you mention about speakers. Speakers are  not inside this model.
5,"Purchased 27 inches Benq monitor mainly due to WFH scenario ongoing in our country today. The product delivery and packaging was good. Coming to product, its working as expected. No more headaches due to staring at 14inch screens. Adaptive brightness works like a charm, automatically adjusts the brightness according to daylight vs dusk vs tubelight. Had low blue light - > multimedia, web surfing, office, reading and epaper which helps in reducing the blue light exposure. Would recommend this product for those who need that additional BIG screen which will reduce the stress on your eyes"
4,"I am very satisficed. one complain. it has no brightness control and only have brightness modes. you cannot reduce or increase brightness manually. You have to set certain modes for which brightness is predefined. That is the one I find annoying otherwise, product is very nice. Must go for it if you don't have a long hour job and wearing glass."
5,"Good Monitor , Use Reading mode , Surfing mode , Sensor automatically adjust brightness . you cannot hang it on wall . Buttons soft , Assembling very easy , usage and adjustment easy , hight adjustment absent . circular adjustment possible."
4,"i have been using this Benq monitor for couple of months, and every day at least 6 to 8 hours, so far no issues, no stress on eyes. It is good for eyes, however need to monitor the performance for at least one year then only we will know the exact performance of this monitor."
5,"I needed a separate screen for office work and casual gaming. After a lot of research on different models and customer reviews, I decided to get this model which was on sale for 12.6k. It has a decent response time and 75 Hz refresh rate which is good enough for light gaming. If you go for a 144hz monitor you'll have to look for either a smaller size or a larger budget because for 27 in there isn't any good 144hz monitor below 15k.There are several different modes for brightness, especially the low blue light mode which is preferred for long working hours.It's only been 1 day of use so I can't say much but for now, all I can say is there are better options for 24/22 in monitors but for 27 inch this is easily the best one. So go for it. It seems to meet my expectations. If I run into an issue, I will update it here."
5,"Bought this screen for WFH. Had overscan issue initially. Its fixed on running the software provided by BenQ. Display is good. Does not have height adjustment. Has tilt adjustments, no back light bleeding. Decent buy."
4,"I received this BenQ 24"" Monitor which is FHD, it should have HDMI Cable & Audio cable but both these are  not there. It is putting me in difficulty. Can you arrange these cables/ connectors. Otherwise I will have to purchase these from market, quality will be doubtful."
5,"People cursing it for being LCD, but the truth is all LED monitors are basically LCD. So the company isn't cheating customers! As per me, best monitor in market. Go for it"
5,"Working fine. Happy with the productHas everything that I need. Has automatic sensors which is good. Has reading, web surfing, multi media modes."
4,"Picture quality is very good, useful for work from home. As it mentions it automatically adjusts the brightness but that doesn't seem to be working all the time.And sound is not there for this model, though you can connect speakers."
5,Picture quality is excellentI have taken this monitor for official and personal work and absolutely it's working excellentThanks alot
5,The picture quality and colors are amazing. It's an LED display and different viewing modes don't disappoint at all. It even has automatic brightness adjustment. Has all ports as advertised and comes with hdmi cable. I wish it had discount but it's one is the best choices you can make.
5,Overall a great product üëçüèº
1,"The product quality is very poor, also the picture quality is not good too!"
1,"Two words only ""BAD PRODUCT"" in every field as declared by compony. Don't want to waste my time to list out endless flows of items.Only good thing returned and refunded timely."
4,"I loved this display,"
5,"Best monitor for 1080p gaming...great number of modes, easy operation and all sorts of ports.....more ports offer more flexibility."
4,"Good, I am  happy with  the quick buttons provided to adjust brightness  to my requirement.HDMI cable is not provided which is basic for any connections these daysI had to  spend  another  500 for that"
4,Good
4,"Works as expected for normal office work. the speaker is too feeble, cant use it to take calls. Its of no use."
5,Working very nicely. happy so far
1,"No builtin speaker, no hdmi cable instead  they give vga cable.go for gw2480 this has audio output and give hdmi cable"
5,Cool display monitor
4,The Monitor is perfect. all over its very good. but the display settings are quite complex.
4,good monitor for office use
5,I am using both Ew 2780 and 2480.It‚Äôs really an awesome experience and really enjoyed working for long hours.
5,"love it, it works amazingly"
5,This has made my life a lot more easier when I work from home. Really a bang for the buck.
5,go for this if you are looking for a budget 27 inch monitor
5,Good .. worth for money.. picture/image  quality is good..
5,No doubt  - Awesome product . Very much satisfied
5,Really good monitor. Using it for Work as well as for gaming on Ps4.9/10 !!
4,Good nice working
5,Good product. But the description in manual says LCD but it's LED monitor.
3,"You will NOT be able to use the USB ports on the side of the screen until you connect the Display Port cable, even if you have connected the HDMI cable. With HDMI cable, you can use only bottom USB ports and not the side ports.Research is tiresome and eventually we go buy the reviews and rating but I would say do a bit more research and not give up to find out more monitors, i am sure there are better monitors than this."
3,I should have gone for monitor with audio output option. Now I cannot connect speakers to monitor.
5,"I done lot of research before buying this model. This is the best middle level monitor you can get from dell. Others are high defenition series which is way costly and only needed for color sensitive works. For a developer who is in front of a monitor 12 hrs, this was good enough. Was skeptical about dead pixels but none found for me. This was once delayed didnt reached me and they cancelled. I ordered again with more benifit got in cost due to SBI offer. I can send detailed review if have some time.. There are some negative comments.- Audio not there. I was aware about it, I dont want everything from a monitor- Seller related reviews. My seller was Appario Retail, once order was failed anyway but that was due to lockdown and courier issues. Otherwise this seller looks fine.- HDMI cable not there. There was different cables provided , but not standard one. For me that was also not issue since I already had it."
4,"I will write the most relevant question.Can I connect my laptop with this monitor using just a type-C cable? ----> yes, via adaptersWill I be able to charge my laptop at the same time via type-C? -----------> NO.Connection can be setup between laptop's type-C and Monitor's HDMI, but since HDMI can't provide power to laptop, the laptop has to use its regular power adapter.So, NO YOU CAN'T USE A USB TYPE - C CABLE TO DELIVER CONTENT TO MONITOR AS WELL AS CHARGE YOUR LAPTOP.Having said that, this monitor is awesome. Super sotthing on eyes. I often end up working late at night with all lights off and the min. brightness can still be ok. If you have a small LED table lamp, then you can place it behind the monitor to light up the wall a bit, and you rock.Happy Dell Monitoring :)"
5,"Great monitor for the price. I've hooked up to a Lenovo T450 laptop which is a 14"" FHD screen. So the dell doesn't look as sharp as the laptop but I try to keep some distance between myself and screen when I work (2' from laptop 3' from dell monitor) & it works out fine. I mostly do programming for reference. At a 4-5' distance I use it for streaming content from Netflix etc. It's definitely a much better experience than the laptop. I would suppose a 2k resolution screen would be better for video content but this is my first monitor and primarily targeted at extra screen space for programming so wanted a cheaper setup for now."
5,"I loved this monitor because it can be tilted, rotated, swiveled all with the stand that it comes with. I am a programmer and I like keeping the monitor vertical while coding and horizontal during other activities and this makes it so easy. The brightness and pixel quality is too good as well. I didn't check if it is VESA mount compatible but it looks like it is (however, I don't see the need to use an extra mount because the stand itself does all the mount's job well).Possible improvements that Dell could do -1. I wish there was an Audio out to this. I could have plugged my firetv to this and connected my speakers. I wouldn't need TV then. Well, an alternative is to use HDMI Audio splitter but that costs around 1.5k more.2. I wish the bottom bezel was also thin like other 3 sides."
2,"Left half of the screen more brighter than right. Has backlight bleeding too, around the corners.The colors look washed out, trying to manage by setting gamma value to below normal, using color calibration.The seller is also cheating by mentioning china manufactured product as Indian origin.Waiting for a replacement..Update: Product out of stock with seller, getting a refund. Let me see if I find out a better product than this one..."
5,After researching through multiple monitors I finally settled with this Dell monitor and I'm loving it. Feels like built to last and feels like quality product unlike other brands for similar price.If you ask me I would recommend this. Rest all you research and decide the best one for you.
5,"I have been using it for last 6 months and it is really a great buy. This has also been my usb hub, I have connectedmy speaker's usb power supply, with gaming keyboard and mouse. Also the tilt and height adjustment makesit great fit for programmers."
4,The picture quality in this monitor z really nice. It has both VGA & USB ports so I can switt between my laptop and existing desktop on need basis easily. I feeel the price is little high and my friend bought the same monitor with a great discount through another channel. Please note there z no inbuilt speakers and you have to buy a HDMI cable separately as the one which comes along with it doesn't fit to our Indian ports.Overall it's a good monitor.
4,"After a lot of research i found a mid ground to buy this DELL monitor. It is value for money for me, does all what I need. I just see one issue which is related to product build, materials are fine but structure is so delicate that you can easily see inside with slightest of force. Other than this it works perfectly and its stand is sturdy enough to handle its weight in any orientation.Note: Check my seller feedback for DELL warranty of Amazon purchased products"
5,A good choice. Product is as shown and as described in the specification. Very comfortable and ergonomic. Monitor is bright and accurate in color. It's stand is sturdy and does not sway. Height can be adjusted and monitor can be rotated. A bit pricy though
3,Its a HD monitor but dell doesn't give HDMI cables...most of them need hdmi cable to connect..as its the latest..two waste cables which are old and with big slots which doesn't fit in lap tops...dell should provide hdmi cables...
5,Need help to update the name in the invoice. By mistake I gave my alias name.Not getting proper support from Amazon customer care.Product is really good.
4,"Monitor is more suitable for programmers. It has tilt-able screen which gives flexibility to serve different angles. Also, one can rotate the screen to have portrait view port.Though there are alternatives available from BenQ which cost less than DELL."
5,"Very good monitor. Dell could have provided DVI Connectivity , webcam and microphone. I have Logitech web cam, but it hides small portion of the screen while keeping over the monitor."
5,"Great display. Both look-wise and functionality-wise, it's great! There are 6-7 display modes which you can set based on time of the day, or purpose being used for. I use it both for WFH and binge-watching. I have been using it for only 10 days now, and really happy with the purchase. :)"
1,Received cracked screen
4,Worth buying at this price range...The basic stuff like document reading and office work can be handled perfectly..The anti-glare works well under lightsOver all excellent for office work and not good for gaming or editing stuff
4,Good value for money monitor that supports vertical alignment.However it does not support MST or daisy chaining via itself.
4,"Very good product. Packaging is nice. Delivery is very good. If HDMI cable is supplied with the product, it will be very helpful."

4,"An HDMI cable would have been nice to have, the display port cable is not always useful for some customers."
5,value for money. not fancy or milti functioning but does the job smoothly. good for office use.
2,I am using Dell monitor which is 8 years old and recent one HP monitor which is 2 months old.  When compared to these 2 the lenovo monitor doesn't meet the expectation.  There's no sharpness on the monitor. Tried with all the setting but it seem to be very bright or contrast and not able to get the right sharpness.  The plastic quality of the monitor is too thin to handle.  The logo in front is out of proportion to the monitor size.Overall not satisifed for the price paid.
5,"I wanted a bazel less, fullhd monitor  which has comfortable viewing angles , Found this for cheap(rs.6200) but the quality of this product looks premium. Fully satisfied with this monitor. The Image quality is very good. I was expecting a HDMI Cable with it, But it was not there."
5,"AFTER 2 WEEKS OF USAGEI bought 22 inch of 7500/- Rupees. It's worthable product. Only 1 VGA, HDM, Audio Jack port. (VGA Cable only coming with box)Picture colors & quality has awesome. There is no lag. Smooth experience. Anti Glare. Wonderful movie experience @day also night time. It's giving premium look & edges are look like Full HD display.I went to HP showroom for same Price & same inch, but that's not a Full HD.  But, This is worth for money If you're buying below 8000/-"
4,"I have been using this desktop monitor for about 10days now. based on this below is my experience.My Purpose of usage: I bought it to use it for working from home and includes coding, browsing, emailing and office related work.I have seen some videos from youtube and the picture quality is awesomePros:* very good display for ""working from home""* has bluelight filter option if you want to use it* the monitor can be tilted (veritically) slightly for better angles* while brightness is high, we can lower it* packaging was neat.Cons and Limitations(in descending order of what I really miss in this):* it takes 5 seconds for the monitor to light up after switching on. This i felt was a big gap in experience.* while it was already mentioned, that only a VGA cable will be provided, however i felt that adding an HDMI cable would be of great help to the end user, given most of current laptops rather support hdmi cable. That would have made me have a better experience. Else we have to purchase an HDMI cable seperately.* The menu buttons to change the settings should have been back lit with led, as if the room is dark, you can't see the buttons. Will need to switch on light* if you change the brightness , it does save it. However if you move to another mode say ""bluelight mode"" and want to go back to previous mode, the brightness would have reset in the previous mode and will have to tune the brightness again* Height can\'t be adjusted(but it was already mentioned in other comments, so can't blame the product as i was aware)* The base mount while strong, does shake if you type the keyboard hard(probably because it shakes the table)* would have been good if it had an enclosure to hide the cables* can't keep moving the monitor every now and than, as the screen panel would be delicate(but again it is same for any LED products be it tv or monitor)* could have given additional hdmi port and one USB port(no usb ports at all)"
5,No words to say its really really awesome picture quality and viewing angle amazing brightness and sharpness.. 100% value for money i bought this for 6999/-Hdmi & vga port and audio jack  supportExcellent edge less displayThankyou amazon bring me a wonderful monitor to my viewIbrahim
5,"This monitor comes with a really nice panel. The response time is around 4ms which is nothing to write home about, but still ok for basic gaming. The refresh rate can be overclocked to 75hz which is a good feature. The best thing about this monitor is that it has zero backlight bleed. Blacks appear absolute black. Brightness is excellent and color accuracy is decent. I can actually work with krita and other digital illustration software with this monitor. A great all rounder. The bezels are really thin, making it perfect for dual monitor setup. It also has a audio out port. The monitor should be shipped with a HDMI cable."
5,"Ordered this Lenovo Monitor after thoroughly going through all the reviews and other monitors in this price range.  The first monitor delivered to me had a small pixel break in the bottom right corner, no external physical damage. I immediately contacted amazon replacement for the product, uploaded videos and photos of the issue. Had to follow up with them and my replacement was initiated and i got the replacement monitor - which is awesome. Bright and crisp hd 1080p. Loving it. Will update the performance over time. Thanks Amazon for the price 6999/- inr and quick replacement."
1,"Monitor is good but there service is not. You can buy only if you are ready to accept the unavailability of service center and their irresponsible answer. In some cities they don't even have service centers for monitor. I had dead pixels in my monitor when I contacted them, their customer service agent said ""this is a small problem you can use it like this, we will proceed further only when it has a bigger issue""- how great reply was that. Only for this reson I won't recommend this Monitor."
4,"Purchased this monitor for around 6k. I use it for media consumption and web surfing, and performance has been good in these areas. Colours are well reproduced, and the monitor itself is easy to assemble. The narrow bezels (except for the bottom) means it's nice to look at too. Contrast and brightness are somewhat lacking compared to more expensive monitors, but the price tag justifies this. There's no HDR support either. You will need a HDMI cable, since only a VGA cable is included in the box.This is a monitor for someone with few requirements and fewer rupees in their account. Gamers, media editors and enthusiasts may want to look elsewhere."
4,"I got this VA monitor just below 7000/-. It's HD monitor with 21.5 inch 16:9 screen. So this is a good screen for gaming or watching movies or videos but not good for study and office works. A 4: 3 screen is a best choice for study purpose. Samsung syncmaster series available some 10-15 years back were great for this purpose. The screen has a little reddish tone that you can't correct. So for long work schedule your eyes will get tired and you will enjoy a good sleep. But in perfect white screen you eyes don't get tired so soon.VA screen is a compromise between IPS screen and TN screen. Its viewing angles are better than TN screen but colour rendering is poorer compared to an IPS screen. So it's not an substitute of an IPS scree. If you like crystal clear picture with vivid colours go for an IPS screen. If you like dark theme like white text on black page VA screen will show some typical problem. It takes time to make black pixels while  you scroll page also when you play a game with dark background.The screen brightness is too high for eyes in normal lighting conditions. so reduce brightness, however the screen brightness for no reason varies when you scroll a page, which is irritating. It may be a software froblem or screen motherboard  problem. The  base and column is not sturdy. The screen will oscillate when table is rocked or floors vibrating.This was the cheapest FHD screen when I purchased it otherwise there is no other reason behind its selection. Go for Samsung, Benq, LG etc FHD IPS monitor if you have money."
1,Please do not buy this monitor as it looks amazing on website but not at all good. Its picture quality is very dull and shows fade yellowish colour instead of white colour.....Instead anyone can buy LG's Monitor. Little price variation but far better than this monitor...
1,I‚Äôm writing this review after a use of 6 monthsThe display is okay for the price and works fine. Quality of display is also good for the priceBut in 4 months time i started getting shocks on my laptop connected to the display. On further inspection the electrician found the culprit was this display.They have 3 years warranty but the service only happens if you get the display to their service center or mail it to them. And its a pain in the a$$ to deal with their service Center executives.A good product otherwise might be the piece i got was faulty. But a salty experience nonetheless.
4,"Got it today. I was a little disappointed with the packing. It was very ordinary, the seal was also broken. But thank God, nothing happened to the monitor. I am quite impressed with the physical structure of the monitor, just that the stand looks quite outdated. But its fine, after all, it's the display and the colour reproduction that mattered the most. This monitor has a great display, the viewing angle from the side is also good... As of now, at this very moment, I'm pretty much happy with this monitor.."
5,"I bought this monitor at a price of ‚Çπ7499 but when it was delivered to me on that day amazon reduced the price to ‚Çπ6990 thats very unfair and makes me feel cheated.Product Review:The packaging was okay. Amazon doesn‚Äôt put extra packaging on top of product. Simply put shipping label on top of the brand packaging and ship it. Product is working super good, picture quality is super good and audio output is also good. HDMI makes everything soo better."
5,"Loved the monitors, i ordered 2 of those Lenovo 21.5 inch L22e-20 Monitors and it works as expected. Can do normal office work with ease and if you're a gamer or watch 4k movies a lot then this product is not for you. Smooth transition b/w multiple screens/displays. Supports AMD-free sync if you're having an AMD chip in you laptop/pc.Overall its a good monitor."
2,"The viewing angles are not what it says in specs, the image looks distorted as even if you by 5 degrees from center of screen. There is something wrong with the contrast the image looks too white. Even after trying different settings and different machines mac/windows."
5,"I have given 5 stars because it is the best (in this range of price) Monitor for my use case. Here are my personal thoughts.Here's why you should buy it:- You are planning to use it for Gaming- You are planning to use it for watching Videos/Movies or other Multimedia- You are planning to use it for Programming/Development- You plan to do basic editing where the colour doesn't need to be too accurateHere's why you shouldn't buy it:- You already have a monitor that has higher colour accuracy than this one (which is 72% NTSC) because if you do, you're probably not going to like it- You need higher colour accuracy- You're going to be doing pretty much colour accurate work like Video (advance stuff like color grading, color correction, etc)Also, things you must make sure you know before buying it:- This is a VA Panel and not IPS. Please research on Internet the difference between the two- The blacks on this Panel are pretty dope but the viewing angles are not as good as IPS ones- HDMI Cable isn't provided in the box, you'll need to buy or have it with you before hand (unless you plan to use VGA)Final thoughts, the monitor is pretty damn good. Id definitely recommend to anyone who's looking for similar price and use case. I've always been a fan of Lenovo and honestly, I haven't been disappointed by any of the Lenovo products I've ever had. I was scared of the packaging though, it was looking like it had been opened but it wasn't, I was just too skeptic. But make sure you do check your package."
4,"Product arrived in brand new condition with average packaging, within the stipulated delivery date. Monitor works perfectly for watching movies, gaming or office work. You can use it  for gaming and other purposes without using the in-built feature of AMD FreeSync. I am not using FreeSync and face no issues of lag or glitch because of it. Value for money !"
5,I'm very much impressed with the quality of the monitor outputGo for it if you are looking one within the 7-8k rangeLooks very sleek and light weight
5,"Reviewing after 2 days of purchase:Received the monitor in good condition. Original product packaging was good enough. Amazon only provided one layer of additional package and it was enough.In the box, only VGA cable is present. If you want HDMI cable, then you should buy it separately.Build quality is good for this price. Except, that the stand is too thin for the monitor size and it leads to shaking of the monitor even on slight disturbance.Display is enough for doing office work and watching videos. I didn't test more than that.Both VGA and HDMI connections works well.Overall for this price (6999 INR when I bought) it looks totally worth it."
5,"Amazing product from lenovo , edge to edge display with a beautiful and minimalist design , amazing connectivity including HDMI and audio jack ! Picture quality is amazing ! And it's crisp with good contrast . Brightness is enough for a will lit room . When run on 60hz , no tearing or lag was seen , completely seamless experience. Installation wise it was plug and play ! Overall a perfect product ! Must buy !."
5,"Though I haven't tried gaming on the display, it's an excellent product for 1080p video/movie so far. I have connected this display to my old laptop now I don't want to do any thing on my laptop. Build quality could be better. Easy to install. HDMI cable and power cable are long enough for proper desktop management. So far no regrets."
4,"The product is best of best, with small to no edge corner make look great as well the viewing experience.GAMING:If you're a true gamer you might not like this monitor because the refresh is visible as it moves frame which is kind of totally odd while playing.ENTERTAINMENT:Perfect without a doubt go for it. You won't feel the refresh issue here.CODING/PROFESSIONAL:I bought it for this purpose only so here's the deal if you don't care about watching frame moving to another frame that feels like as a developer so goes for it."
3,Disappointed is the reaction! The color clarity is pretty amateurish and the brightness/contrast puts you off!! Doesn't really has the feeling of a LED display.. should have gone for DELL which could have been a better buy!!
5,Wonderful service from Amazon.The monitor serves my job in every aspect.To test the quality i played a 60fps 4k video and it gives perfect display with proper colours and refresh rate.It is also good for gaming. Tested Fifa 18 and Far Cry 4. No graphics delay found.So I will recommend the product to all the users looking a led monitor under 10k.
4,"Picture quality is very good other than the annoying dead pixel (there's just one but now that I've seen it, can't un-see it).The overall build quality and image quality is very good.Haven't tried a lot of gaming on this but it should be decent, don't expect frame-perfect performance.Definitely a worthy recommendation if you can get it in some offer."
3,I really dont understand.. There is VGA cable with the product but not HDMI. Laptops also dont provide VGA ports nowadays. 500 rupees lesser than other brand monitors because of this. Better you buy other monitors... Dont have to go through the hassels of fetching hdmi cable.
1,"I had just received the product. It had dead pixels, dust on-screen and scratch marks on the monitor stand. I immediately called Amazon customer service. They responded positively. Excellent customer service! Promised replacement within 5 days. Hope I get the replacement soon. Will update on the replacement after I get it."
5,"this monitor can be connected to a PS4 and also to the computer , the display and the performance is very good, no lag when playing ps4 games and overall I really love the monitor. If any one are looking for multipurpose monitor then this is for you."
5,"Things i like- sharpness, good colours, borderless from sides. I play on ps4, its comfortable for eyes as well as you can carry long gaming sessions.Things i dont like - no hdmi cord included. I am still not able to figure out picture settings. The screen has refresh rate of 60hz so good for only consoles and low end pcs"
5,"Absolutely loved the product. It has many viewing options that inspite of the light from the front, you will still be able to read the content on the acreen clearly.Worth it. Don't think.... Just go for it in this price segment."
3,Picture Quality is average not HD. Misinformation provided by seller that it includes HDMI cable. Only VGA cable is included. Amazon Firestick is not detected so thats another misinformation.
1,"Low brightness, some shade producing. Low picture quality.We can't conveniencing the customer support team to replace the monitor"
4,"It's been 3 Days and I really liked the Picture Quality. What disappointed me was, there is no HDMI cable that came along. However, there is VGA Cable, but my office laptop doesn't have VGA port. I have to buy HDMI cable separately.I am using it with my personal laptop and I am really happy with it."
4,"To keep it short,1. Viewing angles aren't that great2. Picture quality is decent.3. [Main reason why I wrote this review] The monitor's stand doesn't really provide good enough support. If you have a shaky wooden desk, you'll get a bobble head effect with the monitor when typing because of the single, thin, centred, flexible stand"
1,"After purchasing the monitor on 22dec2020,within a month it stopped working now lenevo people also asking for purchase proof even after providing the invoice copy purchase at your risk people. Great experience."
5,Design is superb. Assembly was easy. Display is crisp and beautiful. Works nice. 90Hz Full HD display. Value for money. Size is perfect for WFH.
4,"The monitor is the best budget one, they should have provided hdmi cable instead of vga cable. Amazon packing was pathetic, the entire package was torn, luckly the product was not damaged"
1,This product is worst. The colour quality is poor. I replaced this product for screen fickering issue but now they have send me different monitor with bad colour quality. Pathetic customer care. No help from there side at all.
5,Got it at discounted price of Rs.6999/- which is a pretty good deal. Product works as description and meets expectations. Fast and safe delivery by Amazon.
1,"The Lenovo monitor is a good monitor with 75Hz refresh rate and QHD IPS Panel.There are edge bleeds on the monitor, especially at the top, which is forgivable for an IPS panel.What is even worse is that the seller Appario Retail sent me the monitor with defective pixels ""4 times"".Normally Amazon allows only 1 replacement, so I had to return the order after finding that 2 times I had dead pixels in the monitor.Then I proceeded with another order, hoping that this time situations would improve.Unfortunately, the 3rd monitor (in the 2nd order) also had defective pixels, which made me upset and I chose a reeplacement.Sadly, the  4th monitor sold by these fellows have 4 dead pixels in it. I would have to live with it now.So guys, never ever purchase this monitor from Appario Retail Private Ltd.Its quite shocking that a reputed seller sent defective items 4 times!"
5,"Awesome product . I already have an acer EB321HQU and it works great so I purchased another one but sadly product comes defective so I returned it and went for lenovo d32q-20 .Screen quality is same ,black are really blacks , 2k resolution works great for coding , movie etc...Go for this rather than 27 in full hd . This screen will give better result in 32 qhd than what you have in 27in fullhd.Found no issue so far , vesa mount is bit low so I have to rotate the monitor 180deg .5 star from my end."
5,Day one review.Definitely value for money product. Is colour accuracy is as good as ratina screen... Also with 2k you get more real-estate to work...
1,The product is not good and when I try to return it they asked me a lot of questions. From now on will buy from Flipkart.thank you.
4,"I'm using an msi b550 tomahawk with an RTX 2060 GPU. It's a nice 1080p monitor, but, my PC doesn't allow me to adjust screen brightness from the action centre, so everytime I have to use the monitor's control for that.  Another wierd Problem I encountered is that the motherboard throws random error codes (no boot problems though) if you turn on the monitor before the computer itself. I couldn't find an exact reason for this, but it is there. You get no speakers in there, kind of expected in this price point,but the headphone jack does the job. Viewing angles are better than I expected, with little or no color shift even at a 170¬∞ angle. Overall, this is one of the better options for a 75hz panel to consider, if you're in a tight budget, or even looking for a secondary display.Update: Monitor is running fine, but noticed a problem: smearing. Tried turning off overdrive, capped refresh rate at 60Hz, still there is a noticeable smearing present. For an average casual user, it may not be a problem. But I don't recommend it for competitive gaming or exclusively text based work , if you are into that. VGA error problem on my motherboard is still there, but it doesn't affect its working. Currently I'm using it as a secondary display."
4,"Overall it is good for productivity for office work. It is not 'near edgeless' as mentioned in the instruction, the frame is about 1/2 inch thick, that is miles away from being called near edgeless.Picture quality is decent, better than 1080p.It serves for both productivity and entertainment, so a worthy investment."
2,"I bought a Lenovo monitor because I was really happy with my previous one, but this one seems to have horrible contrast. Attached a photo comparing the two. The one on the left is is my old monitor, and this one is on the right. I dont understand how two monitors from the same line of products by the same company can be so different. All the settings on both are the same too. Avoid if possible, you can get a much better one"
5,"I wanted a full HD display as I own a Yoga X1 and my existing one if HD only. So was looking through 100s of products with various screen size, technology behind it, value for money, brand etc....finally chose this one and I am happy...First monitor i received had an issue like a black mole inside the display...so Amazon replaced it quickly.Now about the product...It's a perfect size, not too large and nor small...perfect for home office...very sharp images and bright screen. bezels are thin which gives a premium feel...really value for money...."
5,"I love the screen , 3sided bezel look gives an awesome look. Comes with hdmi cable as well that's really nice.."
5,"Good monitor, works well with AMD processors with too many options which you can tweak to your liking. With Intel works as a standard 1920*1080 , and worth the 8k spent on it. VGA as well as hdmi works, and it comes with hdmi cable."
5,Worth it for the money I paid.
4,I use it as my workstation monitor and its good for this purpose. I think gaming experience is not that good though there is setting for Max performance.Size is very good with very little bezzel
5,"Value for money, Backlight Bleeding, Replacement Received New one so Good,"
5,"With the rich QHD resolution, this makes the perfect screen for work as well as viewing media."
3,Becareful its has pixel bleeding.. i got replaced but still small portion  came out bleeding  .. that is not too disturbing  so i kept it .. the picture and color accuracy  is ineeded worth the price  .
1,I got this product delivered today and its not worth the money. Amazon is not ready to take the product back also for me to buy another product. Very very disappointed !!Recommened everyone not to buy this.
5,Very good quad hd monitor.
5,Size of the screen and quality is awesome... also supports 4k videos on youtube
5,Works as described. Picture quality is just like ips in this range. Not recommended for video editing/graphics. Color space is sRGB. Perfect for work/normal use.
5,"Using this Monitor as a TV, Good viewing angle, Price is also good as compared with the other models. Latest model, I recommend"
4,"M using this lenovo"" 24"" moniter with ps4 , amazing gameplay , picture quality is good ,thanks for Amazon this stuff ."
4,Picture quality can be improved for the price point
4,Decent
5,Value for money
4,Good
5,I am using this monitor for my office work since one month without any issues :) Thanks Amazon
1,"Picture quality is not good, colours are not accurate"
1,Item Not good
5,Very good product and timely delivered by Amazon..
5,Picture clarity is not that good
1,Green patch showing on screem
2,"Picture quality very is good with 2K resolution, thickness is optimum.But bleeding problem on top edge is very distracting, may he manufacturing defect. You can clearly see in picture.Amazon kindly arranged for immediate replacement, but same problem persisted with exchanged unit as well.I've to go for refund as the last option."
5,"The colour accuracy is really great. Looks great with narrow bezzles. On paper, the brightness might be just 220 nits (theoretically lesser than its competitors). But upon using it, i found the brightness to be just perfect in a well lit room too.Good for professionals (CAD, 3D or photoshop work) as it boasts of 103 percent sRGB. (I didn't need a monitor for gaming which was above 60hz so this was just perfect for my use case)The only downside is that the plug/power cord provided within the box has a chinese plug head which means some of you would need a connector/spike guard to power it on. I didn't have that problem as my switch board has modular switches so it easily plugs in.The backlight bleed is negligible. Nothing to worry about there.Generally you get deep blacks with led displays and not ips displays. But believe me, while using this ips monitor, you won't feel anything odd. For it's price, it is offering much more than what you pay for.The height isn't adjustable but frankly, thats not something you do on a day to day basis. It has tilt option though. This 24 inch monitor has a standard height for itself which is perfect in terms of ergonomics.Overall i am totally satisfied with the purchase."
5,"I bought this monitor purely for the colour accuracy and I wasn't disappointed at all. It looks, feels, and works like a professional monitor right out of the box. It boasts of a 103% sRGB rating and is pretty much accurate. Aa a designer, I use it primarily for graphic designing and rendering applications. The brightness is perfect for an office or home setting. It has advanced options for setting up colour profiles if required. The only thing that could have been better was the contrast ratio. This monitor has the standard ratio of 1000:1. If it was 3000:1 it would have certainly been better but the panel technology won't allow for that I believe. Overall it's a great beginner monitor for professional and at this price (INR 9k) this is one of the best out there."
5,Display is so colourful and it's anti glare finish really amazing. Borderlands design really give it an edgy style. Overall for editing purpose I say go for it.Prefer lower brightness only. Some Filter settings may change the colour of the display.
5,The color accuracy is so good.This is best budget monitor for WFH.I was not sure when I ordered it.The build quality is good and best value for money.
5,"This is a really good monitor, the picture quality is good and response time is also spot on. No second thought on going for it."
5,Very nice product. brightness is very good and colour accuracy is super fine. Loved it.
5,One word awesome!
5,Best
5,"Only bummer is that, it's comes with a Flat pin power cord and not the traditional round pin. You can buy a converter."
4,Summary - It's a good monitorüëçNow the details‚Ä¢ It's a 1080p display for 24inch screen so if you're sitting any closer than 60 cm you'll notice pixelation .‚Ä¢ On Google you might find 102% sRGB (CIE 1976) but I truly prefer my eye vs the numbers so I don't think it is yaa it's accurate like 96% but not 102% cause only problem I noticed is the colors are a lil brighter .‚Ä¢ It's response time it 7ms and refresh rate 60hz so it's okay for casual gaming.My final verdict - It's really good for a home pc or a basic gaming pc . And to all the photographers yes the colors accuracy is good.For any other question Please text me on my Instagram - @pranjal_mikaelson
5,"102% SRGB AND IPS PANNELBORDERLESS ,Anti glare and wall mountableAWESOME PRODUCT , Strongly recommendNice packaging and slim PANNEL"
5,"Amazing Product, Superb Clarity, good for WFH and even office use. Proper size. Good product for web designer, coders, programmer."
5,Atlast a worthy monitor.I seletecd this monitor specifically for design & art.It's completly great.Make sure you use it in bright area.
4,"All I wanted was a 27-inch Full HD monitor with inbuilt speakers (or Audio out) with HDMI port. I chose this one over Benq due to its positive ratings and I already know that Benq monitor has a poor audio out quality. Philips didn't disappoint me. Colors are vivid, Smart Contrast gives pitch black for the screen. No dead pixels too. I hope Pixel Orbiting feature saves from it. Cables are supplied for all three Input ports.The downsides are:1. Power adapter looks like a laptop charger and it comes with a large 16-amp plug. I had to find a CPU power cable to use instead of the supplied power adapter.2. This is a 2018 model (as per Philips website) at 15k. There is already 2020 model (named V series), which is available at 12k, with same features."
5,"In 27-inch monitor's segment the options of branded monitors (from Samsung, LG, Dell, Philips, Sony etc) are limited. After extensive search I zeroed in on this model. Before this I was using Samsung 19 inch speaker less monitor which was not Full HD.It is to be noted that monitors of major brands do not have speakers in their most of the models.Major attractions for choosing Philips Monitor are1.Full HD 1080p with crisp picture quality(images): I have tested with YouTube. It also plays well 2K HD (WQHD 1440p) without any interruptions). Therefore, display panel is ultimate. Monitor is therefore, FHD & QHD.2. IPS displays with extra wide viewing angles of 178/178 (horizontal/vertical) degree with Anti-Glare coating.3. Ultra Wide-Color- wider color gamut for natural looking colour. Colour reproduction is much better than normal FHD TVs. Watching Netflix, Prime Video in high quality is awesome experience.4. Very bright with Smart Contrast Ratio of 20,000,000:1.5. Refresh Rate of 75Hz. Higher refresh rate (75 Hz in comparison to 60Hz) produces better video quality, reduced eye strain, and even improved gaming experiences.6. Effortlessly smooth gameplay with AMD FreeSync‚Ñ¢ technology.7. Narrow border display for a seamless appearance (nearly borderless bezel display on three sides)8. Less eye fatigue with Flicker-free technology9.LowBlue Mode for easy on-the-eyes productivity10. Three types of Video Input Interface. Analog VGA, Display Port (1.2) and HDMI (Digital, HDCP).11. Audio/Headphone out and PC Audio in (for VGA connection): 3.5mm Jacks on the back side.12. VESA Wall Mount option availability (100mm x 100mm). Bracket and screws are not included. I had to buy separately. Wall mount saved space on computer table.13.Built-in stereo speakers for multimedia (though sound quality is not very good but decent type)14. 3 Years Warranty: Most Samsung Monitors mentioning only 1 Yr manufacturer warranty. But this model has additional 2 years (Total 3 Yrs) warranty for peace of mind.Minor Shortcomings1. With remote, this monitor would have been Full HD Non-SMART TV. Except for remote control, monitor is perfect Non-SMART IPS LED TV at low price.2. Sound quality is not that good. But with audio output, the same can be connected to external speakers/sound bars/home theater system. I have connected via blue-tooth transmitter to my home theater system.3. Connections could have been on side rather than back side. In case of VESA Wall Mount, little space is left to manage connections.Overall, I recommend this monitor to Desktop Computer Enthusiast. One can go blindly for this."
5,"Good Monitor. Received with no dead pixel, my observations -In the package: Monitor with Stand Power adapter with cable VGA cable Display cable HDMI cable Audio cable Quick start manualPros: Light in weight (~ 4kg with stand) Narrow bezel, modern look Anti glare screen is very useful especially for over bright seating places Low blue mode is good for long working/reading Display quality is good In-built speakers Perfectly usable as TV with any HDMI source for a 12'X14' size room (speaker volume may pose limitation for bigger rooms. One can still use external speaker by using audio out port in the monitor)Cons: Has power adapter of size like laptop adapter Speakers are there but not powerful (still better than its peers, 2X3 = 6 watts not 2X2 = 4 watts) Controls button location is not friendly (joystick type is good but should have been paced at either side not at bottom) Only tilt, no height adjustmentAs a make shift arrangement (refer image) existing stand can be put in two of the vesa holes to fix the monitor stand for a lower height (with extra support from other two holes at top, courtesy: local hardware shop, two metal strips total @Rs. 30/-)"
1,Screen got Damaged with in a month and philips is asking me to travel to there service center which is 132 KM Away in vijayawada to collect
4,"colours really pop on this monitor.......really good for budget editors as it has NTSC 93%*, sRGB 124% coverage.......but it still has little bit bleeding issues similliar to Lg,Benq,aoc and acer"
5,"A small suggestion would be to make the stand and the monitor fit sturdy, Its shakes when you type on the keyboard, except that it has excellent colors."
5,"Nice monitor, less strain for eyes. Worth for money."
5,Monitor is awesome.
5,Very nice üëç
5,Impressive product
3,Product is ok if it is priced reasaonably near 12 k to 13k.24 inch monitor with same fearures and brand will be getting it for 7.5 k after banknoffrr. Then what is the point of spending duoble the price for just 3 inch more size with all features and same brand.Really need to consider this case.
4,"This can be picked for normal work related priorities, Don't expect much with respect to gaming as the screen refresh rate is not great that you would expect for gaming.Speakers - Useless. Don't consider speaker while ordering this product. One of the worst and cheap audio quality. Didn't expect this from Philips."
1,"Complete white screen at first delivery, not even the on screen display menu is showing. Upon returning the first time to the seller ""appario retails"", they have rejected me the return by saying that they can't replace a defective screen. What a bad experience for such an expensive monitor. I won't buy from this seller appario retails again."
5,"Quality of the monitor is good - does what it says.The monitor's power supply blew up for some reason - Benq's customer care service is one of the best in India from my experience the device was repaired very quickly.Older review:This monitor was really good while it lasted. After 3 months of limited usage, the monitor now does not turn on. Given that it costs arm and leg, this is not acceptable. Now I will have to look if something can be done about the product I am not sure given I bought it from Amazon.Edit: Very quick reply from their service email. I shall change the ratings if they can manage to either repair it or replace it within 3 weeks (I am leaving the country after that)."
5,"Honestly, no written review can do justice to what this product is. BENQ always was the platinum standard for eSPORTS monitors.Please go to youtube and see what pros have to say.The name says eSports, so yes, this is for gaming, you should know what you are getting when the title of your product says ""for eSports""I use this for CS and VALORANT and the difference between 60 and 240hz is something that cant be put in words"
4,"This monitor is meant for first person shooter multiplayer gaming, like CS. The high refresh rate ensures a faster response.Otherwise the colours look washed out at some places and oversatured at other. I use it as my secondary monitor, primary one being an IPS panel@75hz"
5,"Original product, high quality."
5,So I've been playing csgo professionally for a while and used a lot of monitors. This does stand out one of the best 240hz monitors
5,This is the monitor best suited for CSGO gamers or even for fps games. I bought the 240hz monitor and am completely happy
5,"Go for it blindly, the arous kd25f is a tiny bit better than this because it has a 2nd gen panel but you won't notice that big of a difference. Brightness was not an issue at all both with dyAc on and off."
5,This monitor simply changed my game play in every single game. When combined with 240hertz refresh rate its amazing to see its performance. Great product for this price point.
1,The only reason why I am giving 1 star is because packaging quality was poor and feels likes its refurbished.Other than that its good.
5,Perfect for gaming .. amazing refresh rate for super smooth frames
1,Pathetic
5,DAC+ clarity are out of box
2,A really bad monitor for gaming ... colors are soo bad i recieved monitors with dead pixelsI hope amazon fixes my problems
5,The best display for gaming. Don‚Äôt think twice. Just buy it.....!
5,"Best monitor experience specially 240hz is insanePrice is little bit higer but if you can afford it, get it"
5,It's perfect for my expectation
5,"It's just amazing, no flaws, no cons just amazing"
5,Good.
1,When i bought this monitor ..it started showing a heartbeat wave type patch on the upper area of the monitor and after few days suddenly a black dot appeared on the screen ..when i interacted with service centre about this they straightly rejected and blamed me for the black dot .They said i have used some wet cloth on the monitor but since the day i bought this i never have used any wet cloth. But still they told me this thing is not covered in warranty. This is horrible. People trust in BenQ and this is just losing customers.
3,I wanted a crisp display as a programmer. There are a lot of good things about this monitor.The display is amazing. The ports are more than sufficient. It has a stable hinge with adjustable height and tilt.The one thing that is not documented anywhere is that it that quadHD / 2k displays don't play well with macOS. You need at least a 4k display ( 5k if you can afford it to match the retina standards your eyes get used to while working on a macbook pro ). The text/font on macOS looks super blurry and hard to read. I tried everything under the sun to fix it but to no avail. I have sore eyes with just a week of usage. Asked amazon to return so that I can get a 4k monitor.It will probably work better with windows but i suggest not buying this one if you are a mac user.
3,"Amazon's delivery is on time as always. Kudos for fulfiling wishes before time.Coming to the monitor, it feels premium and the picture quality is just exceptional.But the model i received is faulty, it has serious colour bleeding issues on top left and bottom left corners. It doesn't display true black and the bleeding is very annoying if the picture is black and dark colours.In short :Pros,1. The stand is just amazing. Movement is fluid.2. Colours are great.3. Editing in this one is treat to eyes.Cons,1. NOT FOR GAMMING.2. Suffers from serious colour bleeding issue.3. Bezels are outdated in 2020."
4,"**update october 2020 after one year of use**I have been using this everyday for 12-14 hours and no issues. No color bleed or light bleed, no new dead pixels or bright ones. Seems like a product built to last.******good monitor for editing and movies, casual gaming but beware of low response times. some ghosting in fast games...and sure its still good if you play 1-2 hours a day, for RTS games its beautiful. colors are great, well built and nice stand, 10 bit panel quality and brightness is good. beware of 1 or 2 dead pixels. i got mine exchanged due to too many dead pixels. replacement is ok. and hey the speakers are good for only windows sounds and a little noise. the stand is great and u dont need 4k monitor in 27 inch as density becomes irrelevant beyond this level. for 32 inch go for 4k. 27 covers a lot of desk space."
5,Best thing I have bought after a macbook for my setup. Dream come true for coders. Perfect 2k monitor fits a text editor and a small browser and a terminal screen if you need so. Works perfectly with macbook. Color reproduction is perfect. No light reflection. I am able to work in a perfect daylight. Vertical setup for log monitoring and what not. This is the one monitor you need. You dont need a wide angle monitor for coding. This monitor is big enough
4,"The monitor itself is top-notch with all the features and cables that one could require for a professional workflow.If you are considering this, you might most probably be comparing it to the BenQ BL2420PT. The main differences between the two are as follows:1. This comes with HDMI cables in the box.2. This one is 27"" as compared to 23.8"" of the BL2420PT.3. This one has a panel bit depth of 10 bits (8 bits + FRC) which isn't true 10 bit display. The BL2420PT comes with a 8 bits display.4. The number of ports on this monitor (PD2700Q) is lesser than that of the BL2420PT.  The BL2420PT has an additional 3.5mm Audio In port and a DVI-D Dual Link connectivity.5. The display area on this is 82.45% as compared to 81.85% on the BL2420PT.6. The BL2420PT has a light-sensor built into it for the monitor to adapt to the ambient lighting. So if that matters to you, the PD2700Q is probably not the one you should go for.Having stated the differences between the BL2420PT and the PD2700Q, there seems to be no obvious winner. Depending on your preferences and needs, either will serve the purposes of photo and video editing, and other content creation better than any other monitors within the sub-26000 category.All in all, if you don't necessarily require a 27"" monitor, going for the less expensive BL2420PT is not a bad option since the differences are minimal at best. Depending on your desk space, the BL2420PT might even be a better fit for your setup.Personal Experience:Unfortunately, I received an unit with a dead pixel. At this price range, a display with a dead pixel is unacceptable, and the Quality Check of BenQ has to be improved.I have applied for a refund, and cannot order the same monitor since it is out of stock as of the time of writing. Will purchase the cheaper version (BL2420PT), perhaps.Edit: I applied for refund on the 12th of July. Nobody has come to pick up the Monitor til now (20th July). Picked up on 22nd July after contacting Customer Rep. on 21st. Amazon Customer service is prompt. Highly appreciated.Received refund on 24th. Good service by Amazon."
4,"Good.FYI,consider below points before you order your display for primary use.  your height  your desk height (in case of fixed)  Monitor vertical height  And the chair which you use (stool chair, or normal office chair)In my case, my height is 5.6 feet, table height is 28.5 inches, monitor vertical height is 19 inches(17+2) its 32"" monitor ,Chair - normal office chair.When I placed the monitor on the desk, the monitor top is above my eye level (the top side of the monitor was at the height of 48 inches) and for me it is above my eye level ( foot on the floor & elbows at 90 degree).. and unknowingly I started tilting my head little up.I normally work for 13-14 hours a day and I started getting the pain at the bottom of the skull where actually the neck tilt happens.."
5,"TLDRPerfect for professionals and semi professionals on a budget who exclusively make content for the web. Though it comes factory calibrated, the calibration isn't too accurate (according to my SpyderX pro but after calibration it's just perfect. The factory calibrated white point and gamma are spot on, therefore your calibration tool wouldn‚Äôt have to create an aggressive correction profile, therefore yielding very accurate colors.BUILDMostly plastic but feels solid. Anti glare finish on the panel works quite well while keeping the viewing angles excellent. Has enough IO to satisfy most except type C or USB 3 passthrough.COLOR REPRODUCTIONFrom factory it comes calibrated with a calibration report but since colors shift overtime, recalibration is of course recommended. I calibrated as soon as I received my display to gamma 2.2 and white point at 6500k (with the display set to sRGB profile). There was quite a difference in the colors but the white point and gamma remained pretty much unchanged. From factory (according to BenQ) the display may have an average ‚àÜE of upto 3, which is not ideal, so it wasn‚Äôt surprising to see a fairly big change in the colors after my calibration. It does indeed cover very slightly over the sRGB gamut and that‚Äôs a good thing. The max brightness advertised is 350nits but with my testings I only got 336nits at 100% brightness.As for backlight bleed and dead pixels etc., there‚Äôs nothing major. My unit doesn‚Äôt have any dead pixels but does suffer from a minor backlight bleeding issue but it‚Äôs perfectly normal at the price point. Even some very high end displays that don‚Äôt have full array backlights do suffer from backlight bleeding. In any case, the bleed isn‚Äôt visible whatsoever in day to day use and can only be noticed when viewing a completely black scene. All in all, nothing to worry about.One issue I did find, however, is that it doesn't support 10bit colors over HDMI. You must use the display port for that. Also windows tends not to switch automatically to 10 bit color in my experience. If you do have display port and you can't choose 10 bit color manually within windows or your graphics driver, you're out of luck. Most of the newer desktop graphics drivers do support 10 bit output. Newer laptops with Nvidia GPUs that support the NVIDIA STUDIO DRIVERS (GTX 10 series cards and up) will be able to utilise the full 10 bit color depth but you'll need to toggle it in the nvidia control panel. HOWEVER, if the laptop main board is hard-wired such that the nvidia GPU doesn't get interface directly with the display, you're out of luck. But that Shouldn't be the case for newer laptops."
1,"I'll tell you outright to avoid buying this.TLDR;- QHD resolution is not coming up on MBP13 2019, PS4 Pro, Windows PCs.- 15A giant plug included which means most definitely you need an adapter! I don't know whose idea was it to put this giant plug in a monitor.- No auto input switch! Like even my 2011 monitors had that feature!- Very clumsy OSD- Pros: flexibility in adjustments. A shame it's just a showcase and not practical.UPDATE: Have returned this. I'm pretty sure this monitor could work for some folks but if you're daily driving a Mac, I would recommend doing a thorough research and buying a different monitor. BenQ definitely has some excellent newer models which are worth checking out.I will state that BenQ makes excellent monitors. However, this one is pretty old and will almost likely cause issues for you. I own an MBP 13"" 2019, an aging gaming PC that's capable of driving QHD resolutions and a PS4 Pro. I expected this monitor to work out of the box with all of my devices. I did notice the review about this not supporting Mac but I took that with a grain of salt, thought the reviewer forgot about some tweaks that are usually necessary with QHD monitors.Boy was I wrong. This one was a hot mess right from the moment I got it out. For starters, the plug is a huge one, the one that comes with 15A heavy duty appliances! Why would you include this in a monitor? I had to go buy an adaptor to be able to plug this in.Then I plugged in my Mac. Things were blurry, resolution was locked to 1920*1080. I tried all the tricks in the book to override this and make it work in QHD but failed. I thought fine, maybe I need to go buy a DisplayPort adapter. Maybe.So I thought to myself, ""surely this should work with a Windows PC"". Wrong again! The same scenario, resolution locked to 1920*1080. Nothing in the OSD to change this. Fumbling around got me nowhere. Wasted hours of my day doing this dance.Fine, I thought. Macs have a terrible rep, my PC is old. The PS4 Pro should at least support QHD? You can guess what happened next. It was locked to 1080p‚ÄîAGAIN!So, there you go. It probably was QHD by the year of release standard but it definitely is not able to do that anymore. The OSD is so not intuitive and you get lost all the time. I couldn't even tweak the hue, color temperature as they were all locked. I reset the monitor settings many times but nada.The OSD is probably one of the most atrocious ones I've seen and I expected it to be very easy for a product of this range. It doesn't even have auto input switch (couldn't find it no matter where I looked!). So there were occassions when I'd turn off and turn device back on and the monitor would just not show anything. I have to manually change the input to something else and back to HDMI to get it to work.All this was quite jarring to me since I thought I owned a more premium BenQ DesignVue product but it was worse than my budget 1080P monitor. I had suggested a different QHD BenQ to my friend during the sale and he's able to use it just fine with his Mac. I was paranoid enough to verify it by asking him for so many proofs.To sum it up, this ain't it. There are better BenQ and other QHD monitors out there. This one is dated (I should've used that as an important criteria) and it'll unlikely work out of the box for you.I'll be going to return this or check to see if I can get a suitable replacement for now."
5,One of the best monitor at this price range. After lots of search I choose this one and I am very happy.It filled my all requirements what I was looking for in a computer monitor.Thanks to Amazon for the awesome product.
5,"I bought this for personal use to do day to day browsing and watching some videos. Works as a great entertainment monitor in a 120 SFT room.I do not see any big difference in terms of colour. As i mentioned I am not a professional and hence I may not understand or need colour accuracy. But I liked:a) 100% all direction adjustable stand.b) No irritation to eyes, both in terms of using it for work/leisure as well for video watching.c) Overall appearance of monitor - classic looks coupled with modernity.Worthy for the price."
3,"I tried LG27UL500 and because of bad screen quality of LG, I increased my budget by another 10K and purchased this.BenQ Monitor is good,  very sturdy and good picture quality.  There are very few Picture modes and brightness intelligence technology don't work with all of them.The monitor which I got has a damage on the right bottom where the case is not closed properly a small plastic material is coming out.. I thought this is a damage that has been caused in transit.  so ordered for replacement.2nd BenQ monitor came.  the cap which closes the brightness intelligence sensor has come off, while unpacking! Looked at it and some how I placed it in place. Brightness intelligence sensor working properly.The bottom of the screen has slight red color, and top has slight blue color!!! and also I can see two small dots of lights glowing at the bottom.. With such a flaw how come they call it a Designers' monitor. So costly. 40K!!Its just wast of time.."
5,"The product is very good for the price. Not at par with Dell but Dell is very expensive, Dell sold at more than double the price of BenQ. So, considering the price factor, I am very satisfied with this BenQ monitor. I purchased this monitor at Rs. 25,990/- whereas the same configuration for Dell is priced more than Rs. 56,000/-. So don't expect much at this price range. For the overall common purpose and some graphic works, this monitor is more than enough. Photographers may choose different monitor built specifically for them. Lastly, my sincere thanks to the seller, Amazon and the delivery service for safely delivering the piece during this Covid-19 Pandemic where lock down and containment zones are the common norms."
1,"BENQ PD3200u 4k UHD Monitor.sole purpose was to have a extended monitor to Work from home.The story this far: Monitor bought on 19-10-2020 was received with damaged pixels.Booked a complaint with BENQ. BENQ did not respond on time. However, Amazon replaced it on 21-10-2020.Unfortunately this replaced monitor too was found to contain damaged pixels and other manufacturing defects/damages like the monitor mount stand metal is full of deep scratches and screw thread portion is unevenly drilled - even a 20 years old metal will not have such damage on the metal.after one day long conversation with amazon for first replacement, i lost the hope of a second replacement with amazon.after booking the second complain with BENQ , still no response they are good at selling scrap parts.despite the monitor features that it has eye care and low light etc. .. it comes with dead pixels and panel airbubles.guys don't waste time with the defects, damages, follow-ups, chaos of explaining and searching  etc.. after spending your hard earned money on a monitor which is approximately INR 69,990/- !!the way i trusted and spent huge money , they don't trust when we say some thing is wrong with the manufacturing or operational issue.it really hurts when every time i look at the monitor."
5,"The Only issue is that i purchased it on 6 Aug 2020. But the warranty is showing from 6 June 2020.No dead pixel. No flickering. No backlight bleeding.The model looks old but sturdy.Overall best monitor under 80k.Note- It has no HDR. It is a professional monitor so it shows real color. So if You wanna buy just for media consumption (watching movies, youtube etc) then you should buy a lower model that comes with HDR, it will be cheaper too due to VA panel.I make youtube videos for Civil Services Examination. Crackers IAS Academy on Youtube.This is the best investment i have ever made on a display."
5,"This piece of Monitor is the best in its class. For the price you pay, this is the best one you get. This comes with the most accurate colour correction scale as compared to any other branded monitors. If you are the one who wants performance over the external looks with value for money then Go-Ahead for this one. For sure there is a noticeable frame around the screen in this model. But if you check Dell or Samsung, you may get the thinnest frame but the price is around 10K more than what BenQ is offering with this model. With 2K QHD this is one of the coolest monitors in the market. For those who believe in ""Talent brings Creativity and not the Good looking or High-Tech Gadgets"" this is the One Hot serving tea. I personally choose ""Performance"" over the outer looks which comes in my Budget."
5,Excellent screen. Very smooth functioning of the tilt and height adjustment. The big screen real estate is very helpful working on multiple windows at the same time. I only wish there was a cable management design integrated too. That would make it very neat package while using too.
1,No sense of putting money in this I have acer qhd 32inch whose display is better. Within an hour of use its gets heated I have used 10's of displays but none got heated. I have first time seen such heating and i didn't expect these from benq. The button are at back which makes them difficult to operate in triple display setup the cad cam and dual view mode are useless they just change brightness and contrast. Which even I can do by myself the black stabilisers is also useless. Never buy this for pivot or stand those too are useless. Not at all recommended not recommended for autocad or animation users or dual view lovers
4,"Solid performance on MacBook Pro 13"" mid 2018 Big Sur 11.1. I was afraid the text would be fuzzy however at the right distance the text is clear. Colours were accurate right out of the box. The stand is very sturdy and easy to install. The On screen display menu is easy with tactile buttons. Very pleased with the performance so far.Mainly used with Capture One and Affinity Designer apps."
4,"ProsIPS Display: Accurate color from all viewing angles.Build Quality: Nicely built with a sturdy metal stand and premium material.Color: 10-bit color depth, 100% sRGB, and Rec. 709 for Reference Grade Color.DualView Mode: DualView to showcase designs in two modes (e.g. sRGB and CAD/CAM) side-by-side.Display Rotation: Height, tilt, pivot, stroke, and swivel adjustments.ConsScreen Bezel: The monitor bezel is quite huge and doesn‚Äôt look attractive.Display Resolution: It‚Äôs not a 4K resolution screen. (For some people it can be an issue)Speaker: The speaker's quality is bad. I recommend using either external or system speakers.Ports & Buttons: It doesn‚Äôt have a USB 3.0 port and the button build quality feels cheaper.Gamming: Not at all recommended for gaming as it has a 60Hz display.ConclusionThis monitor is primarily aimed at designers. If you don‚Äôt fall into that category, I‚Äôll suggest not to buy this. But if you‚Äôre a designer with a limited budget go for it. And for the photographers please take a look at BenQ SW320."
5,"I love this monitor for both content streaming and HD video and motion graphics workflows. The 2k resolution means it upscales most HD online content and that can make it look a little hazier then I prefer, but I'd pick this anyday over the much pricier 4k variant. The multiple picture modes are great, and the rec 709 and rgb spaces are quite accurate and useful for online video content production. What I love most is the way it has completely expanded my screen real estate going from a 15 inch Macbook alone. I did have some flicker issues in the first week, but a factory settings reset fixed that."
5,"This is a one month review. It works very well. No dead pixels or other coloring issues.Colors and Blacks are also rather good. Way better than what you'd expect from a 27"" screen.It has a matte finish. Not glossy.It doesn't have an external power block like most monitors, it's built-in. So, you won't have to spend a lot more on cable management."
5,"At 1440p, 27inch is perfect!! You get a ppi of 108... anything above 95ppi is sharp enough for the human eye... Not for gaming... as refresh rate is 60hertz....Colour  is calibrated, sRGB mode is 100% which will be good for printing digital work..It is an 8bit panel & with FRC reaching 10bit!!! Which is awesome..."
5,"2 weeks of usage and im only getting to love this more.Pros:32 inch - Its big like a beast, especially for somebody who wants to extend a 15inch laptop display. When the box arrived at my home, My family thought i was replacing the living room TV.Stunning good quality pictureMy biggest advantage is the Ergonomics factor. You can use this a vertical display or horizontal.Its got a tilt which does not come by default in many others.DualView and KVM is an advantage no other manufacturer is giving - though I dont have that use case.Cons:Never found anything really until now.  The buttons on the monitor may seem a little old fashioned, but thats really not a con. They well do operate like a charm.The Hotkey Puck for example is a little of the last decade."
5,"I am a hobyist photographer and i needed to invest in a true colour monitor for my workstation. I resrched and found very good review for this one from BenQ. Indeed excellent monitor. You need to have a good enough graphics card to drive this 2K monitor, when i conect my laptop throigh hdmi, the machine lags and performance gets affected. For the monitor, i am completely satisfied with the purchase"
5,This is the goto 4K UHD monitor for Designers. My eyes are pretty much adopted to Retina display hence I really wanted something that can match with retina. This is the perfect monitor under 50k! Made for creative people. Love it!
5,Best monitor for video editing. Rec 709 and srgb support. Owsm
5,"I am a professional video editor. And I must say, this is a great monitor. I love it."
5,Bought it for programming and office work. Used already for couple of days. Overall good experience. Texts are crisp. Build quality is average and mostly expected from one of the cheapest 4k monitors..not sure about the durability at this point.. great experience using it for programming.. plenty of adjustment options to fine tune.. pleasing for eyes..KVM switch is ok and difficult to get it working..built in speaker is waste..
5,"The first device I got was had a black line on the top left.  But when I contacted Amazon customer care and sent the images online they promptly send a replacement which arrived in 3-4 days. After that I have had no issue. The monitor is connected to my Mac and it works fantastically.I would recommend this monitor to all who are into graphics/ UI,UX/ video editing."
5,This is by far my best monitor for editing photos. The blacks are black & whites looks white. Contrast & color accuracy is very good.Price is very good actually for this type of professional monitor.
5,A very good product for photo editors
5,"Monitor came with sturdy packaging. Excellent overall deal. Calibration testing result document, USB hub cable (similar to printer cable but USB3 speed), HDMI2, display port cables were included. A nice guide to setup and very happy with the result. It also has eye care low blue light mode which we can use for office work/long gaming sessions as well as non image processing workloads. While doing color critial work, sRGB mode for web specific images and REC709 for more color range raw processing is used. If we wish to nitpick, Con is there is no way to know how much Adobe RGB gamut color coverage is there in monitor. Will know from HiRes prints later from dslr."
4,"I received this monitor on 10-Jun-2021. This is a one-day old review. I was looking long for 28""~32"" size monitor for my Photography editing as well as personal work. I finally zero'ed on BenQ. Here are my first impressions:Pros:- Brilliant colours. I am a Ps user and I am aware of colour gamut and correctness. While maybe the SW series may be better, I don't think that with 100% sRGB, this lags behind. I am not a professional photographer, so this monitor is excellent for me. Professionals and ""picky"" people may go for the SW series. The BenQ SW2700PT with 99% Adobe RGB could be better but note that is QHD (1440p) and not UHD (2160p).- I now know that 32"" would have been too big. Even with this 27"", at 1.5' away I have to rotate my head to get full view.- 3840x2160 pixels with exceptional clarity. I observed no backlight bleeding and BenQ Display Pilot software helps me to tune the monitor to my need and the way I work. For example, during normal use, I turn on the ""Reading"" mode that helps in toning down the brightness, etc.Cons: No matter how good, there are always some 'cons':- Expensive- Thick bezel and tad heavy and this affects the next point- The USB and other controls are somewhat inaccessible. It would have been nice if some USB ports were available on the sides. The manufacturer assumes that one will fix all USB cables and there will be no need to add new. To connect new connections (be it USB, HDMI, speakers/headphones, etc.) one has to lay the monitor flat. The monitor is heavy and I have to use a soft pillow to lay it flat. Then I can reach the rear connections. (see pics 2 and 3). This is the greatest drawback.For these 3 points, I have docked off one star.Another small issue. The monitor is shipped with a mains cable having a 15A plug. Cannot understand the reason why for the life of it. the power consumption is just 80W. I had to go and buy a compatible mains cable with a 5A plug and the original is useless for me."
5,"One week into using it and I'm feeling good about it. Currently using it with Mac pro, I was circumspect about it having read other reviews regarding its issues with rendering texts with Mac products but I have not experienced any problem.The monitor is sturdy, and has sRGB, darkroom etc options as promised albeit I haven't really explored them enough to comment on them.The one problem that i'm facing currently (which is frustrating) is that if I play full screen videos on Chrome, then the monitor seems to envelop the video with a yellowish tint, and it goes away if the video isn't full size.The issue is seen only with chrome, works fine with Firefox or Safari, so i'm using Fox as a workaround for now and looking into how to fix the chrome issue."
5,"Have been using this monitor for 6 months with mac book pro. I will mostly compare it with LG 27UL850 which is in the same price range and spec.* Need usb c to displayport converter. LG 27UL850 comes native usb c support (with power delivery), so definitely a downside if you have macbook.* Comes with usb hub (4 usb 3.0 ports), but if you use macbook you need another usb c to usb a connector. LG 27UL850 comes with 2 usb 3.0 ports, but it uses the same usb c cable used for display/charge.* Screen quality is very good, a bit better than LG 27UL850.* Stand is very sturdy unlike the flimsy stand used by LG 27UL850.* Benq provides an application called Display Pilot, which makes it a lot easier to change settings. So there is no need to fiddle with buttons.* Speaker quality is not great."
3,"The display is awesome, connecting it was super easy to my mac laptop, but i have put it on the table and whenever i am typing, the display which is on the stand is shaking, which is annoying alot, Wish they had a better stand, in which the monitor doesnt shake, hope if they read my comment, they can do something about it or ship me a new stand."
5,"I'm a professional wedding photographer and UX Designer. I bought it mainly for editing photos in Lightroom and Photoshop. A few days since purchase, it has been working very well for me so far."
3,There is a HOT PIXEL on the screen. Also there is a serious light bleed issue. I asked for a replacement and both Amazon and seller were helpful and the replacement was delivered to me on next day. So far absolutely no issues with the replacement product.  Its a 2560√ó1440 display with 10 Bit support. It also has sRGB and Rec 709 colour space. It is factory colour calibrated. Delta of my monitor is1.2 which is very good considering the price point. Display is good and colours are almost accurately shown. Recommended only for designing professionals. Not for gaming.
5,"I am a photographer and have purchased this monitor with a specific aim for Photo Editing and photoshop. Bright beautiful display with good colour accuracy. 27 inch in 2K QHD is more than enough for Photo Editing, as I don't think 4k is ever needed unless editing videos.For the price this a good professional photogtaphy monitor."
3,"Not even able to power on, didn't expect the monitor would come with a 16A plug which won't fit anywhere,  how can we expect to use a heavy duty at office space , it's not an AC or refrigerator,  contacted BenQ customer , they pointed me to regional service center who never picked up the call. If this doesn't get sorted out, I'm end up returning this. I've not been able to  test picture quality yet"
4,"Had some great expectations .1.Was aware of the fact that it's a TN panel monitor. Viewing angles are poor , but when seeing the monitor straight on , it's nice to use.2. It's having few modes like gaming mode , reading mode and manual RGB filtering. These are just some brightness changes as far as I've seen.3. It's good for viewing content or office purpose. Does not satisfy it's gaming monito tag.Get this monitor if you're in a budget or if you're looking to get a display for your second pc. Else stay away."
4,Review on the day of delivery:-1. Good packaging (including power cable and HDMI cable)2. Easy to install3. Awesome picture quality4. Very big and bright screen.5. Awesome controller (joy stick)Working very fine but only thing is viewing angle that I can't complaint on it knowing it's a TN panel monitorRecommend:- The cheapest gaming monitor in this price range.Note:- Don't buy this monitor if u need good viewing angles or if it's price goes above 7k better to go with IPS then.
4,"Picture clarity is good, but viewing angle is horrible. No speaker available in this monitor.Pros. Full hd, hdmi, 1ms response,  75hrz, game sync technology.Cons. Viewing angle, built quality,  LG brand."
2,"I bought this monitor in freedom sale, getting it under 7000 rupees. I was already aware that another LG IPS monitor 22MK600M has this issue with solid blue shades where it displayed fine lines. But to my ugly surprise it's there on this model as well. It turns out LG uses same panel across their budget monitors. I sit at least 2 feet from my monitor, yet I can still see it on default windows 10 wallpaper. Anything static blue is a pain to look at. Solid shades of blue are never going to be dispayed correctly.I have tinkered with settings, the only way I could get rid of it was to turn reader mode on which made the display very yellowish defeating the whole point of having an IPS panel.  Furthermore, I also did manual color profiling, changed gamma - it made no difference.If you are into photo editing STAY AWAY FROM ANY LG BUDGET MONITOR.I cannot show it through pictures, it is something you'd see with your naked eyes and it is indeed very noticeable.Giving 2 stars because of viewing angles and 75HZ refresh rate as the experience is very smooth.I will probably wait for a few days and see if I could get used to it, it's an eyesore to me right now. I don't notice it in games, but I do see it a lot whenever I'm watching anything with static blue. It is just not a good panel.I regret not buying the Samsung one while it was in stock.Gonna check for a few days, if I can't get used to it I'll ask for refund."
5,The delivery is fast that the product got delivered within 18 hours. The 22 inchs monitor feels huge in terms of size and offers features that suits a casual gamer. It's 75hz refresh rate and free sync offers smooth gaming experience when paired with a Amd GPU. Coming to the panel it's decent in its price segment but not the best one in the market. Overall this monitor satisfies.
4,"I didnt really care about monitors before.As long as I could see the game running in the screen I was good to go.I had a real crap monitor before,so after using this one,I can really see the change.I can finally watch onii-chan yamete in good quality.But this monitor is supposed to be 75 hz and when I opened nvidia control panel,it showed 60 hz(I will post a picture).Dont know if its actually 60 hz and they scammed me or I need to change some settings to make it 75 hz.Either way,I could not be bothered because I'm too lazy.Overall a good monitor and if u were using a bad monitor before,u can see the change.Cheers.."
4,"I bought it primarily for the two HDMI ports. I can use it with my laptop and Fire TV stick without having to change the cables. I mis-understood the description on screen split. You cannot have two views on the screen. It is more about how to use multiple monitors to get split screens. Initially, I was concerned with the audio output since volume was very low, until I found the volume control. Pretty decent output. Single button or joystick to enable and use the screen menu."
5,"This is a good product and loved it! The color tones are good and I cannot comment on the gaming performance as I do not use this monitor for gaming. This is an excellent buy!However, the HDMI cable was missing in the box and I had to purchase it outside for Rs. 400. But, the best thing about Amazon was that Amazon refunded the 400 Rupees I spent on the HDMI cable when I reached out to them for support. This was an awesome support by Amazon."
1,HDMI port is not connect pc showing pc arthing power saver mode I try various time to customercare team but no one is responding. S  products quality is not good attached image for your reference also warranty card not signed and stamped by seller. Poor quality from seller please don't waist your money.
1,"Worst and horrible viewing angle, all connection slots are on just Center back of Monitor,  no VGA cable,  if you plug the cables in the back of Monitor you will feel sinking like flesh of a dead rotten fish, no display always as the switch for cables are on back of delicate Monitor,  you can't tilt the monitor,  also adjustment panels are worst to adjust,  the mounting stand absolutely doesn't keep the monitor in fixed or stable position,  rather tilting forward as if it will fall. The built quality is worst for this price of 7k approx, screen flicking repeatedly, I extremely apologize and regret I didn't buy Ben Q Monitor which I previously bought from Amazon,  I choose it just because the seller was delivering very short period, this is first day of purchase thinking I would try to return within limited time of horrible 10 days return policy and that too doubtful. HDMI cable does not work."
2,"The only and noticeable issue is colours look lifeless.But what is point of this product when you already have 22MP68VQ, which looks more vibrant, have better design and have almost same features even it is 4 years old now.I trusted LG that they must have made improvements over old products which are really good but LG disappointed me.Most bad thing you can't return only replace."
5,The resolution is sharp and the 75 fps allows for a more seamless gaming experience. You initially need to install the drivers but that is not an issue. The best part is the on screen management software which allows dividing the screen into mutiple zones - each zone capable of running a different programme. Delivery was fast and secure. A quality product at affordable price.
1,"I read lot of good reviews about this and purchased. But very much disappointed with the screen. I know it was TN panel before buying, i thought for programming that won't be an issue. But this one is not at all good. It has a lot of backlight bleeding. My eyes were irritated and started paining. I thought it may be an unit issue, so i placed replacement again i got the same issue. It is not an unit issue, it is a panel issue.Apart from this, seller was very quick. They delivered replacement also fast. Return also fast. Yes i returned this one. But gudos to seller."
5,"If you‚Äôre coming from a HD to FHD, this monitor is going to amaze you. The picture quality is pretty sharp. Used it with PS4 too and let me tell you the photos do not do the monitor justice and a 75hz refresh rate with 1ms response is just the perfect cherry on top. If you are a first time PC builder and on a budget GO FOR IT, it won‚Äôt disappoint you. The picture quality is amazing even from 6-7Ft."
5,lol picture quality awesome very good picture quality I love this ‚ù§Ô∏è this quality low price this monitor around 7k but 1 problem I see some heating this monitor only one problem testing on soon I add more details.... this monitor you can use gaming 75hz and others work no problem....Test results Heating problem automatically solve now no heating problem and picture quality ok no problem paying game good quality pictures nice üëç if you think buy good monitor and to price low then go buy this monitor ...This monitor ips panel gaming + watching movies very good 7k price..... if you think only gaming then Tn panel it low 6k price only offer time price...
5,This moniter is an absolute bad boy...Extremely clear...No stuttering...Comes with Radeon Free sync (I have an RX 550 GPU it works beautifully)...And the 4 ports make it seem like an actual TV..On a budget and looking for a TV? Go for this Bad boy..
4,My Concern was successfully connecting and extending my screens to this monitor from my Macbook Pro and Surface 2 Laptop both which are doing good so far with a very specific HDMI Dongle meant for these latest laptops I purchased after trying several HDMI VGI connectors and ending with one latest available in Amazon.comDont know the long term performance and upcoming Summer whether this monitor can withstand temperatures above 30- 40 DegC
1,At start it seems tat the product is great..but after continous use of +2hrs...bluriness comes in...u see that ur text in black has extended shadows...My product was replaced and even the replaced product had the same issue..
4,"The monitor is working good. But there is some software or hardware error found which is corrected after adjustment. The one error is in the alignment of display towards right side of the screen and gap in left side of the screen. This was adjusted by setting the display setting.- Usually alignment of display for all side setting set at 50 means at center between 1 to 100. But the horizontal alignment in setting was set at 55 towards left then the screen/display is adjusted to the center.  As the screen what is set was saved and remained in 55 horizontal alignment  and there is no need of setting every time, I adjusted with what ever the monitor that received.The packing was not proper shows that the pack was removed before and repacking done to deliver again.Overall the monitor is working fine and using everyday. Setting and features of the monitor is good. HDMI connection is working well. The view angle of the monitor is good even at 160 degree."
3,Did not use the product. Openned the box and was not happy with the shape of monitor. It is too rectangular. Does not give a good look and closed the box asking for cancellation.The image shown in site did not give me the actual shape of the monitor. This is like showing new 10 rupee note and delivering  old (I mean the dimensions. Dont know how else I can describe this better.. apologies)
3,"The Monitor looks good. The package was packed good. The CD that came with the package is scratched and was outside without any cover. The HDMI cable packed inside the anti-static cover was damaged (you can see the silver wire inside the insulated black cable in the picture). I accidently touched it and got electric shock. Also, the invoice copy (in paper) was not attached with the package or found inside the package. Asked only for the replacement of HDMI Cable, but the customer support executive said that they have the option to only replace the whole monitor along with the cable and assured that this time no damaged items would be delivered. So, applied for replacement.Very frustated to replace the whole package for just one damaged HDMI Cable."
5,Very delicate monitor for a 12k product from LG taking its customers for a ride.  Looks and works like an OKAY product to be used as monitor.Long term review after few months of usage if it works well..Apart from being very delicate .. everything else is superb abt the product .. am not a gamer so cannot say on how games will play on this screen but for normal day to day work and movies its simply superb
5,Arrived in a good packaging. Comes with a HDMI cable. I bought the IPS one. Picture quality is awesome. Refresh rate is 75hz only when u connect through HDMI (VGA limited to 60hz).Many of you will come across reviews where people are complaining that IPS monitor having BACKLIGHT BLEEDING ISSUE.  Basically all IPS Monitors bleed but only when you will wake your monitor... i.e. when you power on it or some similar actions like that. But once your monitor is ON there will be no compromise on picture quality and then there will be no BACKLIGHT BLEEDING ISSUE! So relax all ips monitors bleed a little only when they are partially powered on.
1,"Seller not mentioning serial number in the invoice. Monitor got faulty within 20days and replacement is within 10days, when I reported this problem to LG service they are asking for the invoice with serial number. I have reported the issue and its been over a month and still not got the invoice with serial number."
5,"Great value for money (got for 6.9k) compared to other monitors. Decent color reproduction. Anti glare, dual hdmi. Another nice thing is, separate power adapter given, so no heat inside monitor, so there is no holes in backside of monitor. Monitor fully molded, so better dust proof. No support for settings profiles, but not a big deal. Overall nice buy."
5,"Got this to supplement my work from home office setup. Great way to work on excels and read through and make presentations. It is very helpful when you are having virtual meetings when you want to share your screen but also have a look on who all are on the meeting. It also has a reading mode where the display colours change to a reddish tone, this makes it much easier on the eyes when you are working long hours."
5,"-> simply awesome, I got it at 6500 bucks in amazon sale.-> The monitor settings are easily accessible.-> Bezels are somewhat wide, but IPS panel backs it out, viewing angle are too good-> It has got 2 hdmi ports, power rating is 19W adapter-> display has also got energy saving option and picture mode, i usually use 'reader mode' which is suitable while working-> audio controls can be easily accessible too if speakers are connected to aux port.-> Hdmi cable was provided in the box"
1,"The picture quality and pixels on this monitor is terrible. I just received it today and I cannot look at the screen for more than 5 minutes. Upon calling amazon or LG I received no help or support. The service manager, Vishnu, was extremely unhelpful and kept interrupting me to a point where I had to ask him to let me speak. Extremely dissatisfied with the product which doesn‚Äôt meet it‚Äôs stated standards and the after sales service from amazon. Never purchasing anything again"
2,"Namaste. The accompanied CD is not displaying any manuals except some content headings. Further, somewhere in the CD displaying that the CD is meant for USA only. On the cartoon was written as compatible with ""ON SCREEN CONTROL"" features but I couldn't come across any such feature. I did not operate the push button given in the bottom, not knowing what is that for BECAUSE there are no instructions manuals. Please guide me how to use ""on screen control"" mode and also provide me with compatible CD, manuals etc., Thanks and regards."
2,"I needed for my WFH. Everything looked normal but it didn't suited my eyes. Got headache watching it. Before this too i had another LG 20m35 model. On this with 1920 res i tried 59, 60,75 frequency. For all, all looked good but none suited me."
5,I think I am the first one who writes the review about this moniter in india ... It's super awasome got it for 6.5k in Amazon sale ... No negative reviews yet ... Outstanding moniter in this price ... 22 inch IPS panel with 75hz and 5ms ... What's else do u need for this price ...It has 2 hdmi and one vga and moniter has tilt option and wall mount ... Simply 10/10
1,"Received the monitor with screen damaged. Observed that it was a returned product by someone sold to me without even any prechecks. This is alarming as the genuineness of process being a question mark. And got a replacement today again with a screen dead pixel... oops pain. 2nd time refund initiated. However ordered fresh again, let me see how that comes... BAD!"
3,Build is bit flimsy even for this price. More of a cost cutting solution than a low price solution. My wife's benq is better at the same price range. Though it is also not bad.
5,"Review:Colours -- 5/5Viewing angles -- 4.5/5Brightness -- 5/5Resolution -- 5/5Play GTA5 on it and absolutely enjoy the experience.Mounting and installation of the monitor is very smooth.Would highly recommend to everyone!PS -- Got it on a sale price of Rs 6,899, which feels like an absolute steal."
5,"Got this master piece 3 days back for Rs 6600. At this price this monitor proves to be the most satisfactory one.Pros:1. Comes with HDMI, VGA and 3.5mm audio output jack - cannot expect more at this price2. Manual as well as on screen controls for changing monitor settings3. Volume also can be adjusted. 30 percent volume itself is good enough in headset.4. Viewing angle perfect as mentioned in description5. Screen extension and duplication works perfect6. Reader mode is the beauty. Already the monitor has anti glare screen. Reader mode makes it further more comfortable.Cons:Nothing so far, only improvement could be placing the manual setting button in front instead of below screen.Packing and delivery was superb by Amazon."
3,"Horrible viewing angle. I had a samsung monitor(TN panel) which has better viewing angle than this one. The stand is not good it cannot be adjustable, in this budget we can expect atleast an adjustable stand( my samsung monitor which was worth rs. 4000 has an adjustable stand). Picture quality is average, disappointments are there. Build quality is also not good. So the overall price is too high. You can spend 1k or 2k more and have a good monitor."
2,"it is not 75 hz display ,Its 50hz only .Amazon given this as 75hz . its so sad that given wrong details .Clarity - its just ok . i dont think its full HDViewing Angles : Not good from sides , i dont think its an IPS displayColor bleeding : yes some what good amount of color bleeding :(I bought it for work  purpose , for that its just ok ."
3,"Writing this review after almost 5 months of usage.This is the best monitor I could afford at this price point. Also, LG is not Chinese.I use it 16 hours a day on daily basis. Display quality and performance is good. Though its software could be improved (some picture modes doesn't work properly)However, There are two problems with this monitor.Firstly, right end of the monitor gets HEATED after moderate usage even if there is a Fan but no AC in the room.Secondly, sometimes screen turns very very dim all of a sudden without any reason and slowly picks up. I don't understand this weird behavior but it's annoying when it happens."
5,The product is very good both as a monitor and also works well as TV . I have connected it to Tata sky DTH and it works well only thing is you need a speaker which can be contacted through 3.5 mm jack available backside of the monitor
4,"The monitor is quite good for the price, I have been using it for a week now, I haven't had any issues whatsoever. The build quality is really cheap and the stand is also very wobbly. Display is good as it is an ips panel, so viewing angles are good. Overall, a good 1080p monitor for casual use. It is to be noted that the offered 75hz is not available without HDMI connection.I would recommend to buy other 1080p 144hz display for anyone who wants to game, because it massively improves the quality and experience."
5,"Pros:1.Superb picture quality(FHD) and plays 4k videos without any distortion.2.Zero bezzels,slim and sturdy,anti-glare thus perfect for work from home3.75hz,4ms display in this price range, perfect for gaming as well4.a masterpiece from LenovoCons:1.Could have been given in-built speakers and USB port"
5,"If you need gaming, picture, editing , anti-glare(better than 60hz android TV) in low budget monitor fair enough big screen of 27 inches go for this . It has less colour saturation when compared to other in this price and size.Slimmer and borderless. Looks descent.Cons(does not matter):‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨ wish it would have more external ports to  avoid more mess‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨  Wish it would have inbuilt speakers with  an additional 1k but when you need  entertainment external speakers are  much better for any monitor or LED TV."
5,"Pros -+ Picture Quality+ Size (Not too large)+ Panel QualityCons-Not height adjustable, but you can keep a book if you want.The biggest change is that eye strain is way less than before. I was using Macbook Pro 15inch 2015 model, and I couldn't work for long hours even after intermediate pauses.I would definitely recommend someone who wants to take care of his eyes."
5,"This monitor is best for docking station and PC setup. I use it as a docking station to work from home as a software analyst and as a product photographer, both jobs require a large screen with sharp accuracy and this monitor meets the requirements for all my needs. And that 75 Hz is awesome for gaming too! Without a doubt its more than what you pay for."
5,This Lenovo 4K monitor is really fantastic. Very good for photo & video editing. You should just buy it and check yourself.
1,"Its' just been 3 days since I got the monitor. It seems to work fine so far. My only real issue with this purchase was that they sent just a VGA cable with the monitor. VGA cable for god's sake!!!! I am not sure who in this day and age even has a VGA port on their laptop or desktop. I now have to spend extra to buy an adapter. Also, VGA quality is terrible in comparison to HDMI or displayport. I really expected better from Lenovo India."
1,Got a defective monitor. And I've been trying to return the product but it's getting cancel. Tried to return 2 times already!!! .PLEASE BEAWARE WHEN BUYING THIS ITEM.
5,Good product
3,The monitors stand is not adjustable

5,All good
5,Only complain for not including HDMI cable.
5,Go for it.
5,"I recently bought this monitor for 16.6k.Given that I stream videos for long time, I was looking for a decent screen size monitor with impressive visuals, preferably edgeless. This monitor offers a 27 inch FHD IPS panel, near Edgeless and you can bend the screen upto 178 degrees as per your comfort.The monitor stand makes it pretty handy and easy to carry the monitor around and mount it like you want and the audio-out jack is another add-on. One month into buying this monitor, I‚Äôm really impressed and hooked to it so far with my little brother and I fight over it for games and movies.If you are searching for a monitor with a good display and a budget of 15-16k, go for this one. Am sure you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
5,The screen won't have the picture quality of a laptop's but it is a good product and worth having as an extra screen to work with for a home office. The size is perfect for 1-1.5 feet viewing distance.
2,The buying experience was absolute chaos. Got a used one that too a different model altogether without mounting screws from Time To Strike seller. And replacement even did not happen. Took a month for refund.
1,Actually I wanted led TV
3,"Monitor to stand fixing screws were missing in the delivered shipment. Please send the fixing screws , otherwise we will return this item"
4,"Excellent monitor, but needs another hdmi input so one can connect to at least two sources,"

5,"Design looks elegant, picture quality is amazing, well caliberated display with right amount of brightness and contrast. There are various modes like Scenery, Reading, Darkroom and Blue light filter which is useful during gaming for hours.Only Con is they have not provided HDMI cable in the packaging.The product is well priced. So, if you are looking for a stylish 1080p monitor with 60hz for gaming and multimedia, then just go for it."
5,1. Superb viewing angles2. Very very good price3. Amazon delivery has been timely as always4. Clarity/sharpness as expected. Grey on white is clearly visible.Very happy to spent money on this.
5,Reviewing after 8 months of usagePicture quality was nice....as they said there was no flickering...easy to install ...occupy only small space ....decent design...frameless monitor...But don't expect high volume from inbuilt speaker. The sound is moderate for mild music
4,"Nice For Watching the Movies and Pictures, For Gaming it's Good."
4,Nice LED monitor from Asus.  Slim design.  But I don't know why Asus provided speakers?  Audio quality is very poor.  You need external speakers.  So if you are planning to buy because of  speakers then you will be highly disappointed.
5,excellent
5,"Great viewing angles and color (true 8-bit), and the anti- glare coating does its job well without the 'sparkly' effect one usually sees."
5,"Pros: Picture quality, build qualityCons: no mounting holesLow speaker volume."
5,"I bought this Product for 10,200 rupees I Arrived Early And Is Vey Easy Too Use But the Is A Problem Of Speakers The Sound Vey Low The Screen Is Good Should Buy But use An External Speakers"
4,It's been 3 days since I got this. It got a slim back and a great display quality with flicker less and blue light filter. The minimal bezel made it so astonishing. The frame drop is up to mark. Great Purchase
4,Ok good quality.. But colurs is normal picture quality
4,Not satisfied with screen bleeding. It must be checked before shipping. Rest is fine.
5,Very big screen but speakers volume is less
5,Go for it...It's really awesome.. Vale for money..Only concern is it does not come with HDMI cable..
4,"If buying because of inbuilt speakers then it is not good at all , inbuilt speakers were useless . Everything else is great."
4,Using it for last 1 year. No problem at all. Good color production. Overall good.
5,it really looks stylish and works great

5,The monitor comes with a lot of modes and options and is really good for both gaming and non-gaming purposes
5,it is good but did not provoid the hdmi cable
5,Good quality as always from ASUS colors are bright and it also has blue light filter which can be used for long night and it has 5ms resoponse time and definitely bang for buck.

5,"Moniter is good performance, Gaming, and Video&Photo Editing,"
4,Just now received the product.....I didn't get warranty card üò∂
4,Nice display clarity but sound is very low.
4,"+ves:Size : As Expected  ( its 16:9 format wide screen)Viewing Angle : Since I already inquired about the technology & it suits my purpose of work. It was not a surprise. BTW ( if you go to sides , the screen is not visible )Glaring :  After contrast & brightness adjustment, its not glaring to my eyes.Gaming : Not suitable for gaming.Movies : Good wide view.Office work ( this is what I bought this for in the lock down period )  : Very Good.Speakers : No Speakers.HDMI View : Good ( cable was included in the device package )VGA View : Not Tried ( Although, the cables have been sent as part of the device )Overall : 100% Satisfactory"
5,Does what it says it will. There is a display colour difference between my ThinkPad and this. I m using it as a 2nd display for my wfh situation. Fits nicely into my 3' wide study table along with laptop. Have set it as display extension to the right of laptop so it is a seamless transition form one screen to the other. Comes with both HDMI and VGA input cables. It is good for office work and the occasional video watching at full HD.
3,"The built is very average. The metal parts where you have the stand, the ports are of an average build  of a generic quality. I expected a better product with good finish from dell but this is not the one. For those make in india fans... we are not ready my friends. the quality of products that we are manufacturing, the packing, the attention to finer details, the care, the precision is missing big time."
3,"Very good packaging. All items delivered. Monitor working fine.Brightness is less, already preset at 75% but increasing further, does not improve the image brightness in display.If we use for monitoring CCTV, just keeping one feet above your eye level, or viewing monitor from a small angle too makes the dimming/blurring effect and strong ghosting effect such a way that image/picture becomes non interpret able. Unfit for CCTV usage."
3,"From yesterday,  these vertical lines started to come one by one. Can anyone confirm what is the reason for this."
5,Just the right size of monitor for my desk; sharp picture quality.Matched with the cordless keyboard and mouse bought separately.All three items of Dell make.
4,The monitor frame was not in tact and it seems to be some miss handling while transit. Otherwise the monitor is good.
1,"This product got me highly disappointed. I have used Dell monitors in the past but this monitor was absolutely horrible. The colours are not vivid, the blacks are not blacks black enough...Overall very poor quality monitor. I was pairing this with A dell 21 inch monitor which I had purchased about five years back...The old one is far better than this"
5,prompt delivery and good product received
3,It's goodI has a high quality vga and HDMI cableProduct is same as described in descriptionYou have to adjust the display settings on your own  for your eyes the default display settings are not eye friendlyAnd the side screens are not clearly visible

5,Nice monitor with this price range. Display as fine for office used.
5,Good to use as monitor for budget and gaming pc and also well adjustable stand for smooth adjustment
5,"Very good quality. Received in perfect condition. High quality display. Am using with hdmi, which is a big plus."
3,Monitor is okay. But HDMI cable is in damaged conditions. It was bad experience. I lost the confidence level of Amazon.
5,It‚Äôs a great product at good price - works the way it‚Äôs described / helps to have tireless working with clear display
4,"Screen is good, light weight.Stand is not adjustable in vertical direction."
4,Dell 19.5 inch monitor good.but picture quality when compare to Samsung monitor  poor

3,I not get warrenty card in box
1,It worked for few days fine but now started screen bleeding
5,"This first became available in amazon on Amazon Prime Day on August 6th. So this is a new curved gaming monitor from Lenovo. When I first saw its specs and then the price, I was quite shocked to know how it could be so cheap from rest of the competition. Under 20k you are getting a 27 inch 165hz 1 ms response time VA ( Vertical Alignment) panel with a curved display. I mean no other monitor of this spec is available for 20k genuinely available from amazon. Therefore, this monitor is full on value of money. Also the performance is good and the screen is good. Having used an IPS panel before, the colours in this VA panel cant match the IPS but however changing the colour settings from your GPU software (Nvidia Control Panel in my case) can bring out very vibrant colours and I do not have any complain on it. Overall a must buy product considering its price."
5,"One of the best gaming monitor! Lenovo G27c-10 is built to deliver an immersive and smooth gaming experience. From its curved screen, Full-HD display, 165 Hz refresh rate, to the AMD Radeon FreeSync‚Ñ¢*, this monitor makes your gaming experience incomparable.One glitch is no in built speakers and camera. It would have made a complete package"
4,"Faulty product delivered. I have requested a replacement, I hope the replacement comes out good. I must admit this is the first time I have received a faulty product on Amazon.Update: received replacement monitor and works good. The delivery of the replacement was very fast and better packaging than before. I hope it stays good."
5,"I got a manufacturing defect product and got it replaced promptly by Amazon.No problems with getting a replacement and customer support was very helpful. I think vendors purposely send defective products to get rid of faulty stock and try luck if customers don‚Äôt notice or fail to replace within 10 days.The product is excellent and worth every penny. Excellent color, refresh rate, display and performance. Awesome gaming experience-no lag."
5,"The displays are good i bought 2 happy with product I am not a very tech guy or knowledgeable person to give pro review for this product but it looks good the stand is very heavy and well built, while writing this review i am still waiting for gaming Lenovo i7 gaming cpu to arrive will add more once I use display with it üòä"
1,"This is the product I got after I issued a replacement. I purchased this product on oct 9th and the warranty was already started from Aug 25th. There is screen bleeding on top and bottom screens. I mostly work on black background so I noticed it and confirmed it recently. They couldn't give me quality product after I issued a replacement. I paid Rs.19499 for this Monitor still they're not ensuring that the product quality is perfect. Amazon delivery and their customer support is excellent but the retailer is just... Beware this is not a 165hz monitor its a 60hz monitor.. From POV of packaging, The power cord can be accessable from the outside of the box (Photo included), and there is scratches and grooves on the box."
5,"When paired with a good HDMI cable and set to utilise the GPU, this device can make for an amazing experience from software development to gaming.It will take a couple minutes to setup and get going but make sure you do that well to avoid further problems."
4,"Good build and finish... Colors are good, it gives 165hz on provided hdmi cable becouse the monitor supportd hdmi 2.0Its very big, looks great and gaming is immersive.The look is slightly off compared to ips panels...For gaming this is ok, of you also do professional work, just buy ips panel not va or tn"
4,"Beautiful display, perfect stand and overall very happy with this product. Though you would consider buying a Display Adapter as the HDMI supports only 75Hz and to get 165Hz you would need a Display Adapter."
1,TRASH MONITOR. DON'T EVERY BUT VN PANEL MONITOR. I MADE A BIGGEST MISTAKE BY BUYING THIS MONITOR I SHOULD HAVE WAITED FOR LG ULTRAGEAR OR MSI 144HZ 1MS MONITOR. I brought this monitor in hurry because i wanted to attend my apex legends tournament.
5,"First of all thanks to Lenovo for thinking about budget gamers like us. This monitor come in a price bracket of 17-20 thousand which great according to the features it offersPros1.) It comes with 165 Hz refresh rate, it is a free sync monitor, hence you have to turn on G-Sync if you are using a Nvidia GPU.2.) It is curved which makes your gaming experience more immersive.3.) It‚Äôs VA panel monitor, you can say a mixture of IPS and TN panel because it‚Äôs viewing angels are also good like IPS and has 1ms response time and 165Hz refresh rate like TN panel.Difference between IPS, TN and VA panelsIPS - Mostly used by professional for video editing and photo editing purposes, gives accurate colours and have better viewing angles, IPS monitors  response time is more.TN- Mostly used by gamers for high refresh rate and less response time. TN Colors are not that accurate and viewing angles are not good.VA- It is the mixture of IPS and TN panels. High Refresh Rate, Less Response Time, Good viewing angles at least better than TN panels and good colours.No brand gives you a monitor with this configuration in this budget.Close your eyes and buy it you will not regret."
5,Great product work with both G sync with nvedia and AMD free sync. 144hz refresh with VA panel. One DP and one HDMI port for video an 3.5 mnti audio jack for audio. DCR. Waiting period is close to a week was the only draw back probably due to covid.
5,"This is the first curved monitor I got, and I was sceptical at first, because I didn't know if it would feel comfortable.It was a bit tough in the first two days to find the perfect viewing distance. My eyes were strained after a while.But once I found the right distance (around 3.5 feet), it was more comfortable than a normal monitor.I play a lot of games and due to lockdown, I play for over 6 hours a day. But there is zero strain and it is amazing.Total value for money. And build quality is exceptional.Go right ahead! You won't regret it!"
1,"Actually, I brought this computer as per the high specification. Also, it comes under my budget. But after getting it, I am able to notice it doesn't have any serial number which tells it is fake product because serial number is the mandatory thing when contacting with the support team.  Which is the reason why I am having very poor picture quality. Also, there is lag when seeing videos too. Currently, I am returning it."
2,"I received the item with a broken panel. I was eagerly waiting for its arrival and then this happenned! I'm so dissappointed! And the refresh rate they say is 165Hz, but delivers 60Hz."
5,"No shortcomings, Best TN panel curved gaming monitor at this price range.5 star"
5,Amazing monitor. 165hz and 5ms response time in high end games.Great for gaming with accurate price. Only missing is speakers.Best for 2020.
5,"Wonderful monitor, the curved black appearance gives a premium outlook. The display is amazing! Happy customer"
5,Awesome Monitor. Buy if you have good space on you desk or table this monitor is pretty big. And one of the best 27 inch VA panel Monitor
5,"The monitor is fine, but when you are paying around 20k for it, you ought to expect a display port cable come inside the box, but that isn't so."
4,"Good for gaming, but not for multimedia, picture quality so dull can adjust still can see  grains on screen. while playing game may not find issue but if u want editing and all go for a ips panel."
5,"This monitor has a good screen, refresh rate, curvature and the right price during sale !"
3,"Worked fine for few days then started to switching itself off again and again ,I checked its settings,I checked my computer's settings but I didn't find anything that can cause that."
5,"Although I was worried about this since it wasn't a popular model, after using it for a while I am happy.The monitor works fine. Going from a 45Hz monitor to a 165Hz was just Wow"
1,Third class productIts 165 hz but its feel 90hz and gaming Smoothness is nothing improve brightness is lowPlease don't but this waist of money product
5,It's just awosam...I can feel every bullet I shoot best for gaming.
1,The display quality and colours are completely unusable. The customer care people were really supportive in replacing it for me.
1,The monitor is good but it started to bleed around the edges. Would not recommend this to anyone else.
1,"screen bleeding within a month, then got cracks on the screen without the monitor being dropped or damaged in any way."
5,"It have nice display , easy to mount . Good value for money"
1,"Damaged  products are sent, poor packing and quality, dont buy it pretty much disappointed with the product."
5,It's a nice one to start with
5,Awesome display great looks

4,Best under 20 k purchase blindly ur budget upto 20 k
5,"Great product. I really liked feature of built-in camera.I brought this to utilize my old broken laptop where screen was completely blurry and camera was off. Now it's absolutely fine working with my system.ProsBuilt in camera, Speaker enough sound for regular work.VGA and HDMI Compatible. We can easily switch between two system if you are working separately for office pc and personal system.All the cabales included in the box, including cable to connect built-in camera to PC.USB charging portDisplay quality is simply awesome. Best for those who are working from home. You will figure out the difference when you start working.Overall great product for work from home option.You can adjust this in 360¬∞, tilt,hight adjustment, rotate however you want. That's great feature of this product.ConsSaparate cable to connect camera-HDMi doesn't support built-in in camera feature.One more HDMi port would have been great.Price seems to bit high, again quality of the product looks great."
5,Superbly built and works like expected! Not disappointed one bit after using this for over a month. Amazing product and works as intended. The added camera needs additional cord (provided in the box).
3,"I have been using a Logitech C270 HD webcam and somewhow expected this to have a webcam of the same quality - was disappointed with that.The screen itself, the stand and general build quality is good."
5,"Excellent monitor. Windows Hello support, can charge other devices, can connect to multiple devices, camera privacy shield, beautiful design. Microphone reception is poor."
1,This product seems to have an issue with inteference with mic. The inbuilt mic is useless and it seems to disturb the mic connected to the laptop too. Extremely unhappy with the purchase. Picture quality is fine.
5,I had the same monitor in office and was used to it. Its a very good monitor in this price. Feature wise I like its ability to rotate into portrait mode as well as aligning vertical height. At this cost its the best monitor one can have.
4,The monitor is good but the integrated camera could be better ... has a purple hue on the picture
5,Good one
1,Waste. No camera quality

1,Waste. No camera quality
1,The monitor looks great nice design.  However the product quality is very weak. Customer support is not to the par. AOC is a brand not to be relied upon. My display is cracked and the mail I got from customer support is this.We‚Äôd like to inform that the display panel cannot be repaired/fixed and hence the entire display panel needs to be replaced which will cost 90% of the actual cost of the whole unit and service charge + GST.I am going to a more reputed brand.
3,"The person who are interested to buy this, this is a good monitor this is an all rounder monitor but the only draw back is that it is very fragile dont ever touch the screen and handle very very carefully this is not for rough use this is not for office work this is a pretty larg monitor good for editing video because of its larg and curved screen and also good for budget gamers handle very very carefully ‚úåÔ∏è"
5,Best monitor I bought it for 14500
5,"nice picture quality,eye comfort,worth,.....this one is awesome for gaming............"
1,Came to us broken and was malfunctioning
5,"Best monitor for this budget good build quality with curved display, very thin monitorFrameless displayBought it for 13500"
5,"Bright visibly vibrant colours. Power consumption is very less.93ppi monitor with Display Port, HDMI & VGA port. Has builtin speakers too.What more do you need?"
5,"Great picture quality and design. The most interesting thing is it has all sorts of ports like audio in, audio out, vga, hdmi, dva etc. Not the only the ports all connecting wires to those ports also comes in the pack. Sound quality is not great but honestly at this price, it's awesome."
5,"Before buying please confirm that it works properly with your current graphic card ,it is specially ment for Amd card only not work properly with N-vidia cards"
5,"Pros:Very good looking. Sturdy design, Antiglare screen matte finish screen looks very impressive. Bezels are also superthin.Contains 3 ports aux in/out, VGA, HDMI and Display Port and ships with all cables. Colors, contrasts are good. Low blue light mode is really good. It removes almost all blues if you compare it with ur office laptop screens. Very nice in reading documents.+3years of warranty.Cons: Speakers are ok ok not great. And it ships with 16A power plug...you may need a converter 6A to 16A if you are using an power extension or 16A power socket is not available near your workdesk. You need a very small vesa mount base else bigger base will block its ports.Conclusion:Worth addition to my wfh kit. Zero regrets of my investment."
5,"This monitor is one of the most complete monitor in the price range. For connectivity, it has a VGA, HDMI, a Display Port and Audio in-out along with all the cables. It gets a joystick toggle switch for power and monitor adjustment. Some minor issues are the gap between the screen and the lower panel, and the base metal plate on the stand which seems to be made of poorly casted aluminium instead of the usual pressed metal."
5,"if you are looking for COLORs then i suggest you this, it is THE BEST Suitable Monitor for Graphic Related work in very very reasonable price, for me it is perfect monitor for Color Accuracy.BUT sound increase level is very bad I feel, sound quality is still enough good."
5,"The monitor is so gorgeous. Works flawlessly. It supports 75 Hz. Although I do not see any difference between 60 Hz and 75 Hz. If you are looking for high refresh rate monitor avoid 75 Hz and go for above 90 Hz.VGA cable, HDMI cable and Display Port cable are all included in the box. Just think about it, not only the monitor has a DISPLAY PORT, but also includes a DP cable in the box. How awesome is that.Still lot to test but so far I am in love with this monitor at this budget. Far far better than LG or Samsung options at this price point of 10k. Above 11k it's better to go for ACER 144 Hz monitor.Will update if I face any issue down the road."
5,Picture quality of this monitor is truly amazing.Speakers are good for listening voice.I use it for designing.
5,"There can not be a second thought to buy this phillips Monitor in this price segment. Colors are vibrant,  blacks are black,  no bleeding, light weight, thin, multiple input ports and USP is super inbuilt speakers. No need of external speakers if you are not playing music for party. I would say this ""a super buy""."
5,I got this monitor for work from home and some gaming and i don't have any regrets. Seeing Samsung and lg panels having severe bleeding I was afraid that same might be the case. But I am seriously impressed NO bleeding at all. And comes with cherry on top GSYNC!!! ü§©. It works like a charm.
5,"This has wide color and great accuracy. Value for money and highly underrated. Has decent speakers. Stand could have been slightly better, but other than that this ticks most of the boxes around 10k price point and there is hardly any competition for all the features it offers."
5,"Good colors, excellent display, rendering, games, low blue light light, sound is okay. Only con is vesa mount screw very close to ports."
5,Built quality is good.Picture color accuracy is perfect.Color balance with other screen is 99%.Audio quality isn't good bcoz of 3w speaker.Overall value for money.
5,The best monitor in this price segment. I am completely satisfied with the overall product. I strongly recommend it for office/multimedia purpose.
5,Good product
3,Sound is very low
5,Value for money... Loved it.
5,Good picture quality
3,"Bought this monitor based on the fact that it offered over 120% SRGB and that it has VGA, display port and HDMI. The image quality is quite good and the software is quite good too, letting us set up various parameters to get accurate color. At that price point it is worth a recommendation. The downside is service quality of Philips. It is plain hopeless. My monitor fell from the table and damaged the screen. I phoned Philips helpline and was able to get through after several tries. The service personnel seems to be contact center agent who started off by stating that they will first depute a person and that I would have to pay charges. I simply asked them if they could supply replacement screen to which the agent had no answer. After a fruitless half hour talk I hung up and decided to dump the monitor. A search online for Philips service centers that handle monitors provided no results for Delhi, Mumbai or Ahmedabad or even India on Philips India site. The monitor is made in China and Philips seems to simply wish to sell without providing any service. If service is important then buy any other brand that has service centers across India."
5,"Let me be honest, this has to be the best value for money Desktop monitor that's Color Accurate and has a minimal Backlight Bleed with the kicker being the sRGB coverage as well as a 75hz IPS panel with barely noticeable Lag in Games.This is an all rounder panel that can be used for color critical work and gaming.10/10 Recommended."
3,"Overall product features are good for the price, except the VESA screw position design.With current available VESA mounts, all are supporting 75x75 & 100x100mm. means, when try to use this universal mount plate, its 100x100 mm plate area at bottom extents & cover connectivity PORT area & unable to plug cables. VESA screw positioning should have moved upward further or should provide 100x100 as default VESA support standard. Never expect such design flaw from Philips brand."
4,"The clearance for the VESA mount is so little that if you attach a 100mm mount, it will block access to the HDMI & Display Port. I have to shave a portion of my HDMI cable shielding to plug it in. It will fit a 75mm mount easily but if you have a 100mm mount, it will be hard to get your cables connected. Other than that the monitor is excellent with good colour accuracy and birghtness."
1,"The product description is misleading, the monitor is made in P.R.China.The review images clearly shows that the monitor is made in China."
4,Good
4,As usual my review would be on end user side rather than being technical.1.First of all the screen have thin bezzels and it is not bezelsless.When it is switch off it gives you a fake promise of bezzeless due to its protection film cum glass.2.Why I have purchased it.I need a wide screen for my wildlife film editing and I have one more samsung 27 inch curved HD monitor for content viewing.3.1080p vs 4K yeah its true you will see the pixel but only you will focus your eye on screen from a 4CM distance.While working with a normal sitting position this is awesome.4.Who should buy.A  Video editor (pro and advance )or by a photo editor.A big No for Gamer this is made for more on budget centric commercial sector then for a pro gamer.You will like it while editing movies with any software like sony vega filmora or adobe primier .Multitasking Yes it is very easy for them.Casual game.It can be but I would suggest to go for a more 100hz refresh rate and delay responce.The thing which I dont like it there is no height adjustment in stand.I/O port are limited.No inbulit speaker but most of the movies editor has Studio Speaker.HDR:Buy it for everything but not HDR.It just a vivid+ mode note an HDR but still it looks pretty (at least for me)Material:Plastic.Stand are made of metal and plastic which looks goodFinal verdict:If you are video editor no matter whether u are pro or beginner just go for it.At this price range this is the best but if you have a budget go for min 2K resolution.Gamers:Unfortunately mates this is not for youMultitaskers/programmers:Close you eyes and buy.Entertainment: Can be but wide screen is not recommended without a curve for Entertainment1 star is missing as there is no hight adjustmentConsidering the price tag this nice product from LG
5,Nice product. Exact solution for my trading requirement. Extremely happy with this deal.
1,Cons:1. the main feature of the display is to use the on screen display for multi tasking. However i found that the CD provided doesn't have the on screen control software. I looked in the lg website and it says no so software available.This makes the display less useful.2. Also the advertised HDR10 effect while playing movies is not great. it looks over saturated.
5,"After a lot of reviews on ultrawide displays, I was lucky enough to find this under a price of 25k on Prime Sale. I‚Äôm using this for design purpose primarily, video editing and viewing HD movies. The wide screen helps in splitting screens and comes really handy in the WFH scenario. So far the experience has been splendid, I‚Äôd add additional review post a month of use. Delivery was smooth and arrived next day."
4,"Got this monitor for my WFH setup. Serves the purpose but some facts you should know before buying , my personal views on those :1. Very wide , better than 2 multi monitors .2. Color accuracy is spot on , eye candy for movie and videos consumption.3. Monitor looks sleek and awesome when switched off as well.4. Great for ultrawide gaming as well fantastic colors with 75Hz refresh is a very good feature for this monitor.5. This supports HDR 10 and it looks good , but keep in mind its not the HDR picture mode in settings. HDR is totally dependent on your PC . Anything lower than intel 7th gen and nvidia 1000 series wont support HDR. And if your PC supports HDR then you can enjoy it on this monitor without setting it to any mode(default).Why gave it a 4 star :1. As few others have pointed out , the split screen feature is not available out of box , I haven't used it till now.2. A little disappointing , but the multi input seems to be gone from this model WL500 which was present in WK500 üò™.3. A very important thing to know , this is a 2560*1080 p monitor , I am used to a 14 inch laptop with that 1080p resolution. The 34 inch will definitely have a lack of Ppi and hence the text and icon quality is really bad. If you intend to use it only for office work or productive work I would say dont buy this big monitor with such low resolution. (One point , I sit around 3 feet from the monitor)Ps. If you want to see more lines of code or more text from a file at a time , you are going to be disappointed bcoz of how distorted the text looks üò¢I bought this monitor only because I have just started working , and my budget was hovering around 15-18k. I got this at 25.5k in Prime day sale , so just got it. And 1440p uktrawides are crazy expensive !! almost 50-60k more just for that resolution bump !!!I am totally happy with this monitor for media and color accuracy. But the small texts look really bad. The skype application on windows looks pathetic , so i have to use it on my laptop only. Please keep that in mind and go for this monitor.Though there is a trick you can apply by supersampling with help on your dedicated GPU (Not Laptop). That may give better results. I have only laptops so can't try that yet.Overall get this if you consume a lot of media as well as need a bigger screen real estate monitor. But know that text is going to look bad and that's a sacrifice you gotta make at this price range."
5,"For quite some time I had wanted to get a dual monitor setup but the mess of setting up of two monitors with their stands was also bothersome. So I decided to go for an Ultrawide monitor also thinking of the future updates i would be making to my workstation. When I received this product and connected with my existing cable, i was upset that it wasn't clear enough and everything was looking so dull and faded. I started looking around solutions where people were writing scripts to darken the page for ultrawide monitors. After using it for 2-3days, I hated it and wanted to return but as a last ditch effort, I connected it with the cable that came with this and all of a sudden, an Avataristic display sprung to life! This monitor is amazing and deserves every bit of recognition among developers as its of perfect size and fits everything I want in it. And, its relatively cheap! Absolutely no complaints, even though its not 4K, it does not matter, the resolution and the HDR have filled my plate. I was having some trouble connecting this via thunderbolt 2 port on my macbook but was able to get that working with 4K Belkin MiniDP to HDMI Adaptor (has to be 4K even if the monitor isn't 4K, it surpasses the 1080p resolution, it being 2560x1080 and thats why needs a 4K adapter) I also use a macOS app called Lunar to control volume and brightness right from my macOS instead of the physical controls"
5,"I had been using LG 27inch for about a year and that was good - but split screen would constrict the width a bit too much. LG 34 inch ultra wide is perfect for those who need to work on two windows simultaneously - ample width for seamless work.Picture clarity is awesome. Monitor controls are via a small joystick, using which you control the picture settings per your need - provides quite a few options.No flicker - very stable display.Improvement areas: For wall mount, VESA holes are provided in a cavity - so you need longer screws to attach the bracket. Also, the HDMI/ power ports are behind the monitor and connector point outwards - so, when you wall mount, they hit the all.... would have been better if the ports are provided facing sidewards..... If to be used for table stand - its perfect..."
4,"The primary purpose of my purchase was to use it for my home office setup. Besides my office work, I use it for web browsing, media consumption, non professional photo and video editing. After 2 weeks of usage, following are my thoughts:1. I was initially looking for a curved QHD monitor and the prices for even the 2016 models were around INR 85K. At INR 27K it is a solid buy. QHD monitor will have a much better resolution but this monitor serves my purpose2. I would not recommend it to a professional photo or video editor. I would rather suggest going for a 16:9 aspect ratio 4K panel3. For multitasking it is awesome. The OnScreen software comes in real handy. One criticism is that the monitor came with no instructions for downloading the OnScreen software. The LG India website does not list it in the Software & Support category for this model number. However, I realized that it is same software for all models. I ended up downloading it from the LG US website by typing in an alternate model number. Works like a charm4. It is great for media consumption aswell. Given the 21:9 aspect ratio, for most of the youtube content, end up seeing black bars to the right and left. However, I find the content still immersive5. There are 2 HDMI ports and 1 audio out. It is adequate for me but it will not be future proof6. I really wished that this monitor had in-built speakers. I use my bluetooth headset instead7. I did not try gaming on this monitor but 60Hz/75Hz refresh rate will be ok for casual but not competitive gaming8. The stand that came with the monitor is just ok. While it is stable, the monitor has a tendency to wobble a little bit while typing hard on the keyboard. The monitor can be only tilted up and down. There is no ability to adjust height.In conclusion this monitor is a good value for money despite a few missing features"
5,"I needed one good big monitor instead of multiple smaller monitor for my trading. This has fulfilled my purpose. This is good. I don't play games so don't know much about it. However, this is good for watching videos too. One can buy it."
4,Pros1. Excellent for multitasking. (Use 6 to 8 Excel sheets together)2. Screen Split software by LG is great but a bit slow.3. 34 Inch Wide screen format makes work flow a lot easier very seamlessly.4. Matt finish is great for direct sunlight use. (However max brightness could have been better)Cons1. The company stand does not have any movement in height or any other axis. (Bought an Amazon basics Stand)2. If you are used to 4K laptops the display quality is just adequate.3. No built in speakers just in case you want to use a fire tv stick to play content.
5,"34WL500 - Firstly I brought this monitor for 21500 INR after applying offer (1500 INR on credit card). Was looking at the reviews and the price of this monitor for a long time, price was fluctuating between 27k and 25k and the negative reviews were mainly due to gaming. When the price came down to 23k, I decided to go after this. My intended usage is for VirtualBox running on laptop and display for my desktop PC ( no gaming). The split screen and dual control works like a charm. You can download the software from LG website for any 34 inch monitor. Only negative I see here is height is not adjustable, but for my home setup this was not an issue. For this price range I doubt you'll get a 34"" widescreen monitor. Setup is very easy, probably less than 5 minutes to get it up running, LG also provided a Hdmi cable. And finally thanks to Amazon for delivering it before the scheduled delivery date."
1,"I wished for a wide screen to get away from multiple monitors for my programing needs.This monitor is one of the worst when it comes to text rendering and reading, which is majorly what programmers do.My 6 year old Dell monitor (21.5 inches P2214H) is much much better at it.My assumption that the more than full HD display and a sufficiently wide monitor should suffice my need is broken. This monitor is not designed for coders. Worse, this is not a returnable product so I essentially burned down my 26K :("
4,"I use Dell U2415 (24inch 16:10 ratio 1920x1200) Dual Monitor Setup at work as well as at home .  So my comparison of this is based on that.  I bought this when I moved to my  hometown due to covid19. The screen real estate is good enough for those who are used to two 24inch monitors. You don't have to pan you head like a dual monitor setup. The effect of lost screen real estate is small since there is no bezel in the middle here. Unlike Dell ultra-sharp monitors, this has a physical menu joystick. The touch sensitive menu buttons on dell monitors are really annoying and the menu changes when there is no input detected and they take while to switch inputs . In this one when a new input is detected , there is an OSD popup informing that. There is a headphone out which gets audio through HDMI, volume can be adjusted using the joystick.I use this with the integrated graphics (Intel UHD 620) on my laptop. I find the image quality to be normal.  This is a decent monitor for work from home. May not the be the best option if you watch streaming videos. The videos on Amazon Prime and others are 1920x1089, even when the original content is 21:9, the streaming services adds padding. The 21:9 content on youtube is very limited.Things I did not like-Power button is using menu joystick, would love a separate power button.No USB hub. I wanted a DP over USB C, but that model is just announced by LG and not yet available in India.No DP port - It is standard now in almost all big monitors.The plastic feels and looks really cheap and is uneven in some places.The vertical resolution of 1080 is not a future proof one for gaming.HDMI cable included is not very good quality one."
5,"LG always produce good products. This is also an excellent product.After struggling initially with my mac pro 13' I am able to use the display at 2560x1080, 75Hz. Initially I was not able to use LG on screen software. It says No monitor connected. I connected with windows laptop and then connect back to mac. now everything seems to ok. This might be bug.Split screen works like a charm. I am happy with this since it increases my productivity to put windows side by side.Overall I am fully satisfied. Thanks Amazon for selling this kind of monitors."
5,"So big and best setup for Video Editing and Gaming!I use this mostly for video Edit and Trading!So amazing and the big 34 helps the edit panel very convenient for editing and for Trading, having four charts at once helps me track easily!Simply go for it if your budget is 30k"
5,"This is extremely good for Working, acts as two monitors.Controls : Joystick works pretty well to control Brightness, Contrast, volume and etc..No inbuilt speaker, works well with externals.Couldn't find the software to split screen, not even in LG support. Got the installer from a friend and its working good.Never tried for Gaming, so no review for Gaming :)"
4,"What a buyer must know but is not clearly brought out in the description of LG UW 34 inch WFHD IPS Display -1. The HDMI cable needed must be Mini Display Port ( mini DP) to HDMI type, if you want to connect it with Macbook. Do check if your PC/ Laptop has mini DP or regular HDMI slot. The cable supplied is suited for standard HDMI slot. I wish one more cable with miniDP to HDMI was also included, since this monitor supports two separate inputs  (from Different PC).2. There is some time delay in refreshing of charts occasionally. I use Trading View and Kite platforms for trading.  I have been refreshing the whole chart manually occasionally.3. Please note, that this monitor allows display of input from either of the two computers connected. So, there is a possibility that multiple programs running from your laptop which you display in various windows ( upto four split screens) may result in slow down. If you want two windows to be input from one PC and the other two from another PC so as to ensure that speed of the programs being run/ charts being displayed is not affected, this monitor WILL NOT serve the purpose. For eg. I have to run myFnO, Trading View, Zerodha Kite charts from the single PC - Macbook in my case, and this results in a lag in refreshing of charts in Trading View/ MyFNO/ Kite.So serious traders who can afford may like to choose next higher model of LG and spend another 10K or so."
4,"Good product no complaints  so far if you are working from home you need itFast service by amazonDon‚Äôt remove screws from back of monitor just assemble stand slide over it.Yet to explore lg driver for split screen etc but will figure it out if not then some other driver should be compatible from lg support downloadAnyway if you are a Mac user you can buy magnet app or tiles app from App Store around 5$  it lets you stack multiple apps on multiple monitors does not have to be lg any monitor and then each time you login your apps are set , point being there are always work arounds üòâ"
3,"Good ultra wide screen. But the main feature that I bought this, that is split screen doesn't work. The software that you need to install from LG website, gets installed but it never opens and keeps erroring out. Event viewer in windows shows that the application has thrown an exception. I tried many ways to get rid of the error but with no success. Only LG can fix it. they have to update their software. The main purpose for which I bought the monitor has failed. I am not happy with the purchase."

3,"Pixelated texts. I have a Macbook pro as the main laptop. This monitor is a big let down. I bought mainly for office work ( word docs/ Excel sheets), pixelated texts. I should have gone for a 4K monitor even with a bigger price point. Or better,  buy a 24 or 27 inch monitor at best and save the additional money. At 25k it is a waste for me. Amazon refused for return, I would have upgraded for a 4k monitor."
4,"I purchased it and today it is 25.01.2021 almost 2 month after purchase, I found it very good for seeing charts in a big monitor. Far(10 times) better then a laptop monitor. Your trading will get better and overview in market will change drastically if you start using big monitor. Though split screen is not of much use if you don't owe any good trading software, but in zerodha you can use it for two screens/four screens and, those two screens will help you seeing chart in better way. If you want to make a trading setup with this monitor it is good monitor atlease you should have one, monitor like this."
1,Disappointed üôÑ backlight bleeding...I requested for a Replacement and  the request was granted. But have not  picked up the monitor yet.
5,"The build quality is great, it's not thin like most LED TV, but it feels strong, the display brightness is way more then what I expected, I have a macbook pro 2019 and this display is brighter then that, I recommend use HDR or vivid mode for better experience, All the ports work well, the display or the adapter don't get hot with 38¬∞C room temperature. Well I miss the retina display of my mac because in retina and oled displays black color looks great but in this screen it is not that great, although in full black pixels you won't feel differences in the screen, the light scatters properly and it really feels premium. Overall it's a good display 34 inch is way larger then what I expected you guys should buy this."
1,"Was delivered on 19/Aug/2020 and its not even 3 months since I have started using it. Now there is a vertical blue line that has appeared on the screen and doesn't seem to go away. It's very frustrating to look at, especially while working. Please advice if anyone has faced such issues and was able to get it fixed or get it replaced."
5,I always have been usi g two monitors for my work... But with this size of monitor it gives me more convenient to use. Excellent picture quality. Split feature is very convenient. only con is that you will have to download software from LG site if you want to use the split feature...
2,"Not that good build quality and display was not that good.Its left and right edges have a blurness. I replaced one but still the new one have this slightly.Ic u nee perfection go for 80k price range ,otherwise it's value for 34 inch ultra wide series.thats all."
4,Onscreen control is not compatible with Windows 10pro. It shows only until Win8. Any suggestions how it can be used in Windows 10. Because Split screen feature is my main reason to buy this monitor.
5,"Its really awesome for music production and even light video editing. I also played games. As this is a 75hz refresh rate display, you wont get more than 75fps. But again 75fps@1080p is not bad for me as I am not a hardcore gamer. Or else the display is decent. No issue regarding display. I also never felt like pixelated because I work at distance of 3feet from the monitor, so for me it's not a big deal. Even I use it for document work and its decent though(personal opinion) rest all is up to you. If you want it for hardcore gaming then No.......go for something better with 144hz display. For music producers (beginner-intermediate) its a great choice. And about any flickering issues, no till date no issues."
5,"It took a while to get this running well. I have a 2017 Intel Macbook Air and the recommended settings for this display is higher. This needed me to do my own research and invest in a lightning to HDMI dongle that could transfer the data faster.To get split screen organization, you will need to download software from LG. And this model is not listed. So I downloaded software for something that looked like this display from LG's US website. All of which needed research.So to get this display to work the way I want took an additional 2-3 weeks of work. Once this is done, you are in good shape."
1,"I received thi monitor yesterday and on installing and switching ON, it shows only defective LED lines all accross the screen. Have immediately asked for replacment. Very upset as this was certainly not expected from a brand like LG !Will update status as it happens."
5,This is an amazing product at the price...The size is perfect and apt for work ...I would not be using this for gaming although it has a gaming mode. It connects seamlessly to two laptops/computers and the software enables to use both the connections at the same time.I am very satisfied with the purchase and amazon continues to serve well.
5,A very good screen with lot of options and it has a very good features like splitting up the screen in multiple windows and can do multitasking at the same time. I think its little pricy for this configuration. It has very good picture quality but not exactly 4k and brightness of the screen is also good for getting what you want see with battery saving options if necessary.
5,"It's fantastic.. definitely you can go for it..Good for Music producers , video editors and Programmers who wants to do multitaskingPicture quality is also fine..doesn't pixelate muchBrightness is good if keep at level10 for long time use without affecting the eyes"
4,"The functionality explained in the listing i.e., dual linkup and dual display (picture-by-picture) i.e., simultaneous display side by side from two sources is not available in this model. Although I purchased this monitor specifically for this purpose.Apart from it, the is a huge monitor (expect two 22"" screen combined) so if you really want this big only then go for it. Picture quality is good. It supports split screen but from the same source (one computer at a time) yet useful function. You have to install softwares from lg official website."
5,"It's huge, works like a charm if you need to work/view multiple windows simultaneously. It got delivered today. I'm yet to mount it on the wall. My son tried playing a video game and faced some lag. Just be cautious in case you are looking for a gaming monitor."
3,Monitor is binking. Dont know what to do. I had updated the driver and refresh frequency
5,"I bought 34WL500 from Amazon and found resolution 2560x1080 which is bad for screen size 34 inch. Atleast 2k(2560x1440).Texts were little blur, I started getting headache in 5 min of use.But here Amazon does amazing things....I was worried that the monitor was only replaceable. But Amazon accepted the return and returned the product.Thank you Amazon."
5,"Picture quality as usual justifies LG‚Äôs brand name. The ultra wide screen is useful to open 3 apps side bu side.The headphone jack doesn‚Äôt work, not sure if it‚Äôs problem of this particular piece, but I don‚Äôt need it so don‚Äôt bother much.Only thing missing is a height adjustable stand."
4,First delivery was received damaged. Replaced it within 2 days and all good now.Monitor is good for daily use and multitasking. Not tried any games yet so can't comment if this is good for gaming. On the costly side.
1,"Hi Team,I have recently bought an Acer31.5 inch monitor (ED322Q). I am facing a lot of backlight bleeding issues. While watching a movie or when the screen is black, I could see a lot of background light noise. I have attached a picture also for your reference.I would like to request you to please raise a replacement request as my entire work is dependent on this monitor currently. On amazon there is no replacement policy, all I could see is a return option. However, I would not like to return this product at the moment. It would be nice if you can replace the monitor with a new one and do proper quality control before sending a replacement."
1,"for colors and audio, monitor is use less, only you can enjoy big screen, dont waste your bucks, better buy a good products with extra money, I am asking for replacement. amazon is trying to refund money. When it shipped with out display cable means, some used it rejected the peice. It was sent. Recently one of my frnd order this product. It was shipped with white hdmi cable. It for office purpose and we are using it. If the price is below 17000, I am going to buy again, I missed when the price dropped to 16399"
5,"Looks great, sleek design. Curve is great, just the right amount. Nothing this big(32 inches) for this price.Using it for programming and browsing mainly."
5,Excellent product with excellent packagingSuperb picture quality
5,"Good monitor, Worth buying"
2,"first of all the monitor that i received was not 75Hz it was 60Hz, there was screen bleed and all the stands and wires seemed used and not new. i ignored the stand and wires but the monitor itself did not work properly, no option for return so placed a replacement"
5,"Got it for 14999. What else can i ask for a 32 inch curved monitor which is almost bezel less and having a beautiful stand. Using it for around 3 weeks. There are various pre adjusted colour modes to suit your eyes in any condition. Have all necessary ports in the monitor, i.e. vga port, dvi port, hdmi port, audio port. As it is a 60-75hz monitor, it is not meant for high end real time gaming.I will update my review later if anything bad happens to the monitor, for now it is working flawlessly and a pleasure to the eyes."
3,"Not good for 1080p resolution monitor. Text are cracky and very bad.Images, videos, pictures are super excellent. Good for HD video. Not text or programing as a monitor.Design is excellent.The in built speaker is so low, hardly audible."
5,"Pros:*Full HD monitor at this price is the best deal.*Large monitor is a treat to watch videos.*I use this monitor for my daily work. Easy to read emails and action it. (ensure you got minimum 1.5 feet distance from monitor) to avoid seeing pixels in the words.*1080p supported monitor and I have 4k LG TV. When I play the same video, I can see colors are bright and good in the monitor which is full HD compare to the LG TV which is 4k.*Games like American truck simulator and GTA V is good and especially while playing truck game it looks like we drive in real road due to the size of the monitor.Not sure about latest games.Trust me people, at night time, lights turned off and you watch a HD video with good external speakers and you have the best movie experience with this monitor.Thought I watch all marvel movies at past. Again I watched in this monitor during dark and lights turned off and it was a different experience.Cons:While using for work related emails and excel, you can notice pixels when you are too close to the monitor.Video anything below 1080p quality won't be nice. you see lot of pixels"
4,Awesome.. I don't have any issue with this one.. I recommended. This is budget monitor for Editing and gaming
5,Was looking to buy a TV when I came across this acer monitor and I changed my mind. 16000/- for a 32 inch curved monitor seemed a very good deal as no other monitor could match the price for this size. I don‚Äôt know how good or bad is this for gaming as I am not into gaming nor how good the colour scheme is when compared to others or if it‚Äôs good for programming. My sole purpose was to watch movies and videos and that is serves amazingly well. The picture quality is fantastic and the curvature of the screen gives a very good feel while watching movies. Never heard it‚Äôs sound as I connect my cpu to 2 tower speakers bought separately again from Amazon. Watching movies is now a very awesome experience. Delivery was very prompt thanks to amazon and the product looks very elegant and sturdy. Its sleek design adds to the aesthetics of my room and I am absolutely pleased by its performance. A product worth every penny spent on it!!
5,I saw multiple comments complaining about backlight bleeding. Indeed its correct but don‚Äôt expect a 15k monitor that too a curved one with 32 inch size to have all the feature n quality of 60-70k monitor. I purchased it for office work and its serving its purpose perfectly fine. The only shortcoming which could have been avoided by the manufacturer was to give provision for wall mount. Though you can still make it wall mount through aftermarket VESA bracket however you will have to shell out another 4-5k which do not make much sense.
5,Very nice curved monitor and I bought two. When compared to Samsung curved 27 inch it's price is less than 4000 to 5000 bucks. I think its stand looks better than Samsung stand. Initially I was going to buy Samsung but coincidentally reached acer and it was a good decision.
1,Worst part of the product is that it is not very good in pressure distribution at all part of the screen. Due to it curve nature it is having more pressure at the middle . If you are lucky yours may withstand that pressure for longelonger in my case display cracked within 2 months. Also if that happens you won't get any help from customer service.
4,"After using it for nearly a month I can say that this is one of the best curved monitors available at this price, it comes with a warranty of 3 years, looks r amazing and picture quality is good, something of this size and looks at this price has really amazed me. That said, didn‚Äôt give it full 5 star because it has slight back light bleeding issue, believe me u won‚Äôt notice it while u r watching anything, it is noticeable when the screen is pitch black. Also, the speakers r just alright. Since I needed this monitor to connect my laptop and do my office work, I find it really great"
5,"This monitor with curve screen look beautiful, colours are good for gaming watching Full HD video, I have 2 gb graphics card so picture look more clear and accurate. Best curve monitor at this price range."
5,"It is a piece of art. Exceptional build quality, curvey white and silver beauty.Got it for work/programming, and seems to be perfect. Initially had some issue adjusting to the monster of a screen(my previous moniter was just 20inch) and slight pixilation that comes with big non 4k screens.The default setting is soft and comfortable to the eyes. Perfect for my purpose.Got it with all sort of connectivity cables like HDMI, VGA, 3.5mm(audio only, no mic). The moniter also has two 3.5 mm ports for audio and mic in case you want to plugin a headphone when using HDMI.Highly recommended for programing and regular office work.Note- The inbuild speakers are probably useless, very low volume."
3,"The Product Spec says its 75Hz refresh rate, but it actually 60Hz only. Its the wrong info. conveyed to Customers from ACER itself. I checked in official ACER site itself, where it says this ACER ED273 Monitor is 75Hz but actually when we see the settings of the Monitor, it says clearly as 60Hz only.  For 60Hz monitor, spending 15K is little costlier only. My advice is that if anyone is ok with 60Hz then go for it.Eventhough its 60Hz, I dont see any issue/lag though am using it for my Office work purpose. Haven't tried with Gaming. Overall, Product is good but only disappointing point is that its 60Hz ONLY but where it says 75Hz."
4,"This is a very decent monitor within this price range, got on offer for 14299This monitor is basically for daily use and not high end video editing. The screen is big and you have to adjust the mode (if you go very close to the screen you can see the text is breaking since it is 1080p only and has 32 inch screen) to sit near to it to work especially if you are coding or writing a ms word file. The video quality is also good for watching movies. This also has speakers which has very minimalist sound ( ok if fan is off ). I recommend this monitor to those who wants a big screen to just do daily activities"
4,"I got this for 14.2K (inclusive of bank discount) and would say this is a steal deal !75Hz (atleast as read by my pc) , curved, FHD and 32"" at this price is fabulous.Also in box you get-power cord (and adaptor)-hdmi cable-vga cable-DVI cableAs read here, people see dead pixels,i'll be monitoring this issue and update the review if I face any.Conclusively, am pretty happy with this purchase.Cons : The screen bleeding issue is true...you would see bleeding on a blank screen"
4,"The monitor works like a charm, the screen is huge and it has good picture and audio quality. Sure the speakers aren't big enough for a large room but that can be fixed with external speakers. HDMI, DVI, VGA, and everything else as written in the product details.The resolution isn't high enough, if you notice closely, the picture will be pixellated. I would suggest you go with a 4K resolution if you're going for this size, but unfortunately none of them are this cheap.The curve is good, build quality is nice, just go for it :)"
1,guys dont buy this monitordisplay stopped working within 3 months  and got trapped nownon of the acer centres accepting it alsoand no seller details
2,Amazon misleading customers with a fakd description as it states free sync but actually its not what they shown. Secondly the refresh rate is 60 hz but it shows 144 hz. So gamers don't buy this you will get sick of screen tearing.
1,"Its just been 12 or 15 days and the monitor is having flickering pixels.On a particular color or maybe a specific range of colors, a shade of grey, there are flickering purple pixels, hundreds of pixels are illuminating as another color, purple...Also, its not my Computer that is not working properly, i tries taking screenshots when this was happening and then sent the screenshots to other devices to see if the pixels are in that picture too, but its not, the screenshot is clear with none purple pixels.Lemme tell you, don't buy this monitor seeing the price, go for a samsung one, i made a mistake!!"
1,Its been 1 month and display is dead ..applied for warranty. Will see their service too  ..Not recommended by me for sure ..
5,Working smoothly with gtx 1650
1,Good monitor but power on and off a major concernafter 1 yr big black line in the monitor unable to use
5,This is my first 1080p monitor so consider review accordingly.For first impressions I thought this is a way to big monitor and was going to trade it for a smaller one. But believe me in just a few hours of usage it became the perfect sized monitor. Text is crisp if you don't sit too close which you should not considering the size. The curve makes a noticeable difference. Overall the purchase is good as per price range. You cannot complain about speakers considering the price.
1,There is a DEAD PIXEL within 1 month of buying this product. Please check the photo I attached. it's small but it is noticeable. Tomorrow moght happen there may be dozens of dead pixels appear.I want a REPLACEMENT for the product from Acer. The product is obviously under warranty.
2,"Screen is too big and 1080p is not at all working for this size. It's good for watching movies or youtube videos. You buy big size monitor so that you can use multiple windows side by side but everything is so streched that it feels like using TV as monitor.Will not recommend it at all until you just want to watch movies and do Netflix. Selling 32 inch monitor at this price point is commendable but not worth it, instead go for Acer 24 inch monitor."
5,Really the best monitor 20ks can buy. I would definitely recommend buying this.The color tones are just perfect for daily computing. Deliver days could have been better.
5,"great buy at the price... doesnt have auto brightness adjustmentalso, the speakers are useless... could have been positioned at the front if possible but that may have impacted sleekness of form"
1,"A broken piece sent when bought during sale on discount, and when asked for a replacement, amazon team denied saying stock isn‚Äôt available with the seller, a great way to fabricate the number during sales and send defective products."
1,"Display issue....second hand product there are few dots available....finish is not good...I bought for  15000 over-priced u can go for flat monitor and a brands like hp, dell or asus"
3,"Check the pixel retio, for office not sutiable , for viewing movies and games this is ok, for working with terminals not good ,.  Build quality  is not so great if you compare with Dell monitors ,. Good for home use"
4,"Best product if you getting near 15k,as per me there is only brightness adjustment showing error it going high so difficult long time watch in dim light or dark room, on and off botton personally i dont like because if you move its in closing time its go to program and features. There than this you can definitely go for it."
1,"When I opened the box, the screen was damaged / the display had fluid accumulated in one side of the curve. Manufacturer/seller shall do minimum quality check before dispatching when this many customer reported complaints."
4,"This is a really good monitor for work. I would happily give 5 stars to this monitor but here are two reasons :1) Sounds quality is not good as i expected2) I received monitor on 29th August and Bought it for ‚Çπ17,499 but at the same day I checked price and it was ‚Çπ14,499.If you want to work or want something for entertainment then just go for this one!"
5,I got it at 14399 in offer and this is a very beautiful monitor with great picture quality and premium qualityThanx to acer for making such a beautiful and huge monitor in such a cheap price.If it would have a IPS panelThen it would be a lit üî•Attraction Magnet Design üî•
5,Very much disappointed.. requested a replace.. waiting for an update..UPDATE: Well the second one arrived today and it made my day.. !! Awesome..
5,"I am using this mount with my 32"", 6.7KG monitor for almost a week now. It is an authentic LUMI product, and it has been doing the job amazingly well. Exact details are not mentioned, but it seems to be made of some alloy of steel covered with matte finish paint.The instructions manual had descriptive steps with pictures to put together the whole unit, and the hinges can be adjusted using the L-Keys (included inside the box). The box also has spare screws and washers for the monitor. The VESA plate being detachable makes it easier to move around your monitor, if required.The base stand is quite sturdy, and it has rubber pads underneath it to avoid marks on the table. The main stand has an impressive circumference, and it does not wobble at all. The length of the main stand is reasonable too. For reference, I am 6'3"" and I have a few more inches on the stand to raise my monitor's height after setting it up at a convenient height while sitting. The three rotations mentioned in the description work like charm. Their friction can be adjusted using the L-Keys.Overall, it is a good product for the price. If you have been looking for a mount for your setup, you won't regret buying it."
5,"Totally worth spending money on this !!! I did go with the positive review and few youtube review. Sharing couple of pics of the actual product might be helpful for others to get to know the quality of the product, personally I suggest to go for this I am using this to hold 27 inch Monitor and definitely very sturdy material. Probably the stand alone would be weighing 6-10kgs easily.Really appreciate the product"
5,"Amazon & Seller did a good job.Item was not packed properly.So whoever is in charge of packing please put it in a proper box & pack it nicely when you send in the future.Quality of the item is excellent!I love the item personallyInstructions were easy to understandBase of the stand is awesome!Base of the stand is hard, not too heavy and smooth to touch.The rod is good too.All the screws were provided.Plastic holder for the cable is handy.It keeps the wires tucked in nicely.I use this stand for my 23"" Dell SP2309W monitor and it can handle the 6kgs of weight easily.Monitor can't move forward but it can turn up and down and sideways without any problem.Height is adjustable. Tool to adjust the height was also provided.So overall, the item is excellent! I would definitely recommend this product to everyone who is looking for a good monitor stand."
5,"Very strong material, looks durable and long lasting. Using my 32 inch tv on it and it is absolutely stable."
5,No disappointment what so ever. Very good product. No complain. Very neat.
5,Easy to setup. Using a 32 inch Lenovo monitor. Does the job
5,"Good value for mony product , very strong and highly recommend"
5,strong and efficient.. value for money
5,"Product as expected, good quality."
1,Joints Are Just Impossible To Move On My Unit.
5,"Really glad I made this purchase. Until the Prime Sale a couple of weeks back, I was using only my laptop for work at my table. Wasn't able to get the right balance of screen height and keyboard height.I tried putting my laptop on a small portable laptop desk and put my keyboard under, which was solved the height issues... but ended up with a very cluttered setup."
5,"My first IPS Gaming monitor, worth every single pennyWith this being a newly launched monitor, and with no reviews available, I took the plunge and purchased this monitor. And what a reward it has been! It‚Äôs been early days, but I have no regrets whatsoever. Since this has been worth it, I shall leave a detailed review here so it can help future buyers.1. First things first: IPS Gaming with G-Sync compatibility! These are the two main points that won me over. The colours are great on this monitor, and the G-Sync compatibility ensures no tearing at 144 Hz. Now, I‚Äôm more of an FPS guy. I‚Äôve played CSGO and Call of Duty with this, and it‚Äôs been a superb experience.2. Tilt and Height Adjustable :  A big plus of this monitor has been the height adjustable option. Now I‚Äôm a programmer during a day, and I spend large hours of my time glued to the screen. This height adjustable option is great from an ergonomic point of view. Less eye and neck strain for me.3. Display Port and cable: You‚Äôll get a display cable with this monitor, which ensures that you get the most out of this monitor in terms of refresh rates.4. Build Quality: The stand is sturdy, and doesn‚Äôt wobble. It has a really cool look with the Legion Blue colour that glows at night.  Pretty classy design in my opinion.Other cool things about this monitor are 400 nits brightness and the Anti-glare feature, which when coupled with the colour quality of the IPS panel, is easy on the eyes. The picture quality is sharp. I‚Äôve read that Lenovo‚Äôs coming out with a 1440p variant of this monitor a G27q-20, but I‚Äôve yet to see it here. So I purchased this one, and I‚Äôm more than happy with my purchase. An investment well made, indeed! The only thing I was disappointed with was the time it took to arrive, which was bit more than expected. However, it's understandable with the lockdown and my super high expectations of an Amazon fulfilled delivery !"
5,"Monitor has worked out well so far. My unit came with a Display Port cable. Luckily I had a DP port but not many folks would have it - and so then they would have to buy a converter/adapter cable to convert Display Port to either HDMI or VGA depending on their computer.The low blue light feature is awesome. I now use the monitor permanently in low blue light mode.I also like the height adjustability, very smooth and easy."
5,Very nice product
5,"Bright visibly vibrant colours. Power consumption is very less.93ppi monitor with Display Port, HDMI & VGA port. Has builtin speakers too.What more do you need?"
5,"Great picture quality and design. The most interesting thing is it has all sorts of ports like audio in, audio out, vga, hdmi, dva etc. Not the only the ports all connecting wires to those ports also comes in the pack. Sound quality is not great but honestly at this price, it's awesome."
5,"Before buying please confirm that it works properly with your current graphic card ,it is specially ment for Amd card only not work properly with N-vidia cards"
5,"Pros:Very good looking. Sturdy design, Antiglare screen matte finish screen looks very impressive. Bezels are also superthin.Contains 3 ports aux in/out, VGA, HDMI and Display Port and ships with all cables. Colors, contrasts are good. Low blue light mode is really good. It removes almost all blues if you compare it with ur office laptop screens. Very nice in reading documents.+3years of warranty.Cons: Speakers are ok ok not great. And it ships with 16A power plug...you may need a converter 6A to 16A if you are using an power extension or 16A power socket is not available near your workdesk. You need a very small vesa mount base else bigger base will block its ports.Conclusion:Worth addition to my wfh kit. Zero regrets of my investment."
5,"This monitor is one of the most complete monitor in the price range. For connectivity, it has a VGA, HDMI, a Display Port and Audio in-out along with all the cables. It gets a joystick toggle switch for power and monitor adjustment. Some minor issues are the gap between the screen and the lower panel, and the base metal plate on the stand which seems to be made of poorly casted aluminium instead of the usual pressed metal."
5,"if you are looking for COLORs then i suggest you this, it is THE BEST Suitable Monitor for Graphic Related work in very very reasonable price, for me it is perfect monitor for Color Accuracy.BUT sound increase level is very bad I feel, sound quality is still enough good."
5,"The monitor is so gorgeous. Works flawlessly. It supports 75 Hz. Although I do not see any difference between 60 Hz and 75 Hz. If you are looking for high refresh rate monitor avoid 75 Hz and go for above 90 Hz.VGA cable, HDMI cable and Display Port cable are all included in the box. Just think about it, not only the monitor has a DISPLAY PORT, but also includes a DP cable in the box. How awesome is that.Still lot to test but so far I am in love with this monitor at this budget. Far far better than LG or Samsung options at this price point of 10k. Above 11k it's better to go for ACER 144 Hz monitor.Will update if I face any issue down the road."
5,Picture quality of this monitor is truly amazing.Speakers are good for listening voice.I use it for designing.
5,"There can not be a second thought to buy this phillips Monitor in this price segment. Colors are vibrant,  blacks are black,  no bleeding, light weight, thin, multiple input ports and USP is super inbuilt speakers. No need of external speakers if you are not playing music for party. I would say this ""a super buy""."
5,I got this monitor for work from home and some gaming and i don't have any regrets. Seeing Samsung and lg panels having severe bleeding I was afraid that same might be the case. But I am seriously impressed NO bleeding at all. And comes with cherry on top GSYNC!!! ü§©. It works like a charm.
5,"This has wide color and great accuracy. Value for money and highly underrated. Has decent speakers. Stand could have been slightly better, but other than that this ticks most of the boxes around 10k price point and there is hardly any competition for all the features it offers."
5,"Good colors, excellent display, rendering, games, low blue light light, sound is okay. Only con is vesa mount screw very close to ports."
5,Built quality is good.Picture color accuracy is perfect.Color balance with other screen is 99%.Audio quality isn't good bcoz of 3w speaker.Overall value for money.
5,The best monitor in this price segment. I am completely satisfied with the overall product. I strongly recommend it for office/multimedia purpose.
5,Good product
3,Sound is very low
5,Value for money... Loved it.
5,Good picture quality
3,"Bought this monitor based on the fact that it offered over 120% SRGB and that it has VGA, display port and HDMI. The image quality is quite good and the software is quite good too, letting us set up various parameters to get accurate color. At that price point it is worth a recommendation. The downside is service quality of Philips. It is plain hopeless. My monitor fell from the table and damaged the screen. I phoned Philips helpline and was able to get through after several tries. The service personnel seems to be contact center agent who started off by stating that they will first depute a person and that I would have to pay charges. I simply asked them if they could supply replacement screen to which the agent had no answer. After a fruitless half hour talk I hung up and decided to dump the monitor. A search online for Philips service centers that handle monitors provided no results for Delhi, Mumbai or Ahmedabad or even India on Philips India site. The monitor is made in China and Philips seems to simply wish to sell without providing any service. If service is important then buy any other brand that has service centers across India."
5,"Let me be honest, this has to be the best value for money Desktop monitor that's Color Accurate and has a minimal Backlight Bleed with the kicker being the sRGB coverage as well as a 75hz IPS panel with barely noticeable Lag in Games.This is an all rounder panel that can be used for color critical work and gaming.10/10 Recommended."
3,"Overall product features are good for the price, except the VESA screw position design.With current available VESA mounts, all are supporting 75x75 & 100x100mm. means, when try to use this universal mount plate, its 100x100 mm plate area at bottom extents & cover connectivity PORT area & unable to plug cables. VESA screw positioning should have moved upward further or should provide 100x100 as default VESA support standard. Never expect such design flaw from Philips brand."
4,"The clearance for the VESA mount is so little that if you attach a 100mm mount, it will block access to the HDMI & Display Port. I have to shave a portion of my HDMI cable shielding to plug it in. It will fit a 75mm mount easily but if you have a 100mm mount, it will be hard to get your cables connected. Other than that the monitor is excellent with good colour accuracy and birghtness."
1,"The product description is misleading, the monitor is made in P.R.China.The review images clearly shows that the monitor is made in China."
4,Good
4,"Found this product really nice and with this price band its above average.Gave 4 star due to its wall mount and socket position - in/output sockets are just adjucent to the wall mount and pointed as 90degree to its back which isnot ideal.The smart image mode is really helpful to quickly chnage the mode as needed. eg. night reading, game mode / movie etc."
5,"The outer packaging made me skip a heartbeat for a moment. However, on opening the item, i found everything to be in place and in good condition. It came with a power adapter, a VGA cable, an HDMI cable as well as an AUX cable. Assembling the monitor and stand was a breeze as well. The screen can only be slightly tilted up and down. Picture clarity is good for day to day work. Sound from the monitor is sufficient, although emphasis is more on vocals. So don't expect it to be too good in that aspect for listening to music. Overall satisfied with purchasing it at 9,500."
2,"Pls beware it's not FHD, though specs claim.Can't vertically Adjust.LCD disay.---Don't fall pray to this.at this price a higher spec (FHD, 22+, Led) monitor."
5,"Overall great picture quality, good dark blacks and no noticable glare. For gaming, those buying it should note AMD FreeSync is not NVIDIA GSync. Though NVIDIA opened up a bit, this FreeSync monitor is not GSync compatible"
5,"Good for this price,picture quality is very nice,much better than other brands."
4,Product received as described. On time deliverd
5,Screen folding feature is good
3,"I wanted to get ACER's HA220Q which is very similar to this complete with external speakers&white look, is slimmer and runs at 1080p 75hz. Sadly, it ran out of stock on Flipkart(Thank You COVID) and on Amazon its going for 10000+ Rs. I got this one as a compromise but boy do i regret it. It says that it runs 1920x1080 75hz on Philips India Website and its false advertising, it only runs 75hz at 1440x900, the in-built speaker quality is trash(though i was expecting it to be), the overall build quality is extremely cheap recycled plastic. The Stand isn't adjustable and the Power Cord it came with is an April Fool's Joke. It has that Giant 16 AMP Plug that usually comes with Geysers&Induction Stoves, it doesn't FIT in my UPS and i don't know of any UPS that DOES. So, now i have to buy a 6AMP to 16 AMP Plug Converter too(and you too if you're going to buy this thing).Philips India boasts that ""its possible to view the display from almost any angle"" i say, that's A LIE! This monitor requires a specific viewing angle, otherwise the blacks becomes a brownish mess. I tinkered with all the settings, the viewing angle is very precise.This isn't the worst IPS monitor for the price but, i'm just not happy with the overall experience. I brought this because it was from Philips, a trusted brand which made excellent quality products. Now i know, Philips India is Philips in Name only. BTW don't take this the wrong way, Made in India Products aren't always Low quality, there are many high quality Indian Brands(TTK, Bajaj,Royal Enfield,Godrej) but Philips India isn't one of them. If it wasn't for COVID i wouldn't have gotten this anyway, i guess its just ""good enough"". Though, the image looks a bit stretched&smeared at 1440x900 75hz as its not the intended resolution this monitor is supposed to run at."
1,"Plz be aware, its a made in china product.I have purchased this product because in description it mentioned as manufacturer is Indian company but in reality its a importer company."
4,"Excellent second screen for work.Picture clarity is good, sound is better than expected, blares a little but good enough ."
5,Good product.
5,"Those who required secondary monitor as portable this is the best ,portable to carry , Easy to use , Plug and play for win10."
4,"Best monitor with this price point besides looking modern and attractive, frameless designs enable seamless multi-monitor setups. . with support of VGA/HDMI .HDMI 1.3-1.4b versions support up to 144 Hz refresh rate@1080p and 75 Hz@1440p, while HDMI 2.0-2.0b versions support 240Hz@1080p, 144Hz@1440p and 60 Hz@2160p (4K). & also....AOC Lowblue Light protects you from harmful blue light which, during long sessions, has been shown to cause eye strain, headaches, and sleeping disorders. ....And also comes withWide Viewing Angle features display color accurately at viewing angles of up to 178¬∞. This way, it does not matter where you choose to view it from, colors will be displayed perfectly."
4,"The AOC 22B2H 21.5"" is a good monitor for the price, I bought it for around 6000 Rs. note it's a VA panel don't expect amazing colours or brightness. coming to brightness it's typically around 200 to 150 nits which is very low so that's one downside of this monitor and but if somebody wants a monitor just for 22"" size and looks kind of good as it has 3 sides Bazel less it's a very good buy but don't expect anything more than that  for the price I think its a good monitors"
4,Very Much Satified with Product...Runs 4K videos very smoothly. Runs HD games smoothly with 75hz refresh rate. Thanks AOC.üëåüëåüëåüôèüôè
1,"The monitor had to be returned due to poor picture quality, even when used with HDMI cable."
5,good
3,"Hie Team,Why is the stand of the monitor so stiff ?I cannot even turn it left to right or up and down."
5,Worth buying it!Value for moneyJust go with it
4,Value for money
4,Worth the money. Could be better tho
5,Op
4,Nice
5,great monitor at this price
5,"Those who required secondary monitor as portable this is the best ,portable to carry , Easy to use , Plug and play for win10."
5,those of you reading this may be looking for a good monitor - primarily for office work and occasional movies/games. I was looking for same and found this after lot of research - the specs are not clearly listed here but it was pleasant surprise for me - this is a IPS not TN panel and also has flicker free and low blue light.for approx 7500 - this is steal Dell P1917s - has similar specs but costs more1280x1024 resolution on 19 inch screen is HD quality - has antiglare coatingwill share more after using for some timeit comes with VGA and DVI connectors - no HDMI - but no big deal for a computer monitor
1,Incorrect description and photo. Has only VGA port and no DVI port. And definitely no DVI. Even the model number is the same. Very unprofessional from Acer.
4,I needed them for dual monitor setup. Works as expected!
1,Don't buy this . They promise hdmi cable but only give vca . Careful while rotating monitor it might break .
5,Great product..
5,Nice product
5,Good
5,Nice Deal
5,"I got it for around 11.5K. At this price point it feels like a great competitor to Benq IPS monitor.PROS:--------------------Sturdy AF monitor stand:This ensures that the monitor is sturdy and minimizes the wobble. It has a better stand most of the other brands at this price point as they all offer plastic stand, the wobble from which would definitely be noticeably more. I don't think I would ever be going back to using a monitor with a plastic stand after using this one.-Good Picture quality:Out of the box the blue shade was a little bit more than it usually should be, but after calibration this was comparable to panels from LG or Benq. For comparison I am using a LG 27MP59G along side this and the picture quality from Zebronics panel is almost the same.I didn't face any issues while playing games on this but still I would not recommend this monitor if you want to play a competitive fighting game like street fighter or tekken on this.-Thin Bezels:The bezels are actully really thin. While the physical bezels seem to be paper thin, the actual LED and the outsides of the monitor make the bezel about 0.8cm which is great.-Budget friendly:There are not many monitors that offer thin bezel, great picture quality and viewing angles along with the 27inch screen size at this price point. Zebronics has definitely done a great job here.-Indian Company:Although this may sound really stupid but this was one of the reasons why I actually bought this monitor as I wanted to try something new, specially from an Indian brand and I am actually impressed. Hence this long review.-Included Aux cable:This may not be useful for everyone, but it was good to see someone include a aux cable out of the box since this monitor has a audio out port at the back.-Vesa Mount:Can't praise Zebronics any more at this point.CONS:-----------------Only available in white color:I feel this is mostly depends on personal preference. I personally prefer black monitors as watching media on them feels more immersive.-Buttons on the side:The adjustment buttons are available on the right-hand side of the monitor. If you are using a multi-monitor setup then you have to make sure that there is no other monitor on the right hand side of this monitor since that would hinder your ability to do any adjustments using the side panel buttons. This somewhat beats the purpose of a slim bezel monitor.-Only VGA included:Most of the modern devices have HDMI as the standard video output port. Zebronics could have included a HDMI cable instead of a VGA since HDMI is a better standard to use than a VGA. (they don't differ alot in terms of pricing).I fell this leads to decreasing the price difference between this monitor and some other monitors as they already have HDMI included out of the box (Benq) and you would have to buy a seperate HDMI cable with this one.-No monitor adjustment:I don't think there is any way to actually adjust the monitor but the more than sturdy monitor stand kind of makes up for this con.[PS: A great purchase and would definitely recommend this to my friends and family]"
4,Pro :Big screenpremium lookcon :1. brightness light make stress on eye even you tried to downgrade the brightness. not sitting work have an issue2. inbuilt speaker very low. even not auditable if you want to listen anything voice.but i am satisfied with overall  performance.
5,"Reviewing after a month of use, 60Hz 1080p display with very slim design. Display brightness is also good, Not using for gamming. but you can have decent output for that as well. most importantly it has 27inch display, which is definitely better to look at.Only issue I found that if you have a poor electricity wiring or no earthing, display turns off for a while when switching fan/bulb on/off (happened only once, might be due to low voltage supply). Also if you accidently touch the pin of your charger (Type c or B any) to stand of the display (which is made of metal) then it flickers. Disappointing!!!Apart from this issue, I found the display very well, no issues further."
1,"The main issue with this device1. It's not FHD or HD, this Delhi made local product.2. ""It has 500000:1 dynamic contrast ratio for deeper blacks, brighter whites and rich colours"" it's completely fake. It's not true. This device is unable to display black colour properly.3. Assembling: Bottom side screw not properly tight and screw hole is not on proper position.4. Power adapter: 100% Local5. Power Cable: 100% Local"
5,That's my 15.6 inch laptop next to this monitor. It's very helpful for my office tasks and also to watch HD movies. Although I had to replace the monitor on the very same day as it didn't turn on. But got the replacement the very next day so no complaints on that.
5,"This is a superb monitor, with good quality and cheap price tag.  Picture quality is good. Speakers are little disappointment, but what else you could expect in such price. Packaging was very good and secure and delivery was timely as well. Overall it‚Äôs a best monitor in this price range. Go for it."
5,Best for working don't purchase for gaming but best for working value for money best buy for it professionals
5,"I bought this 27"" inch zebronics monitor for trending purpose and I m very happy to buy this good looking monitor"
5,Everything was good but quality was not up to the MarkCons - no warranty card received ü•∫
5,"I must say . The best monitor at this price . 27"" for 12 k is just mind-blowing .I hope this monitor stands the test of time."
5,Best in price. Quality is ok according to price.
5,Awesome and good looking
5,Best monitor
5,"Worth the money and good quality. The stand is a little wobbly, but except that it is really good."
5,Good product
5,I think price is slightly high but quality screen size and design all is look fabulous.
5,Awesome product.
5,Amazing desktop for show off andbest design build quality and best brightness level amazing desktop after all very less bezel or you can say bezel less
4,"Just to give you the expectations, the one the seller deliver is different. this monitor does not allow to tilt it forward and backward like others in this price range. The speaker is just a namesake, even the mobile speaker sound better than this. I have never used this monitor speaker, its bad super low voice, no one can hear. the button for brightness and contrast adjustment is complicated to use.Best part, it looks good, takes less space, the overall quality is good"
5,Display was quite good
5,the monitor is very awesome
5,Really like it
5,i suggest buy under 15000 rs is best led
5,Best monitor ever
4,"It is a white frame and white plastic body at backside. I prefer black only. But the LED tv is slim in size,  frameless are beauty and stand design is more attractive. It would be helpful if the seller spply a wall bracket and a HDMI cable instead of VGA cable which is outdated now days."
5,Super
5,nice picture
5,Sandaar i like superb
5,Nice
4,"Its entry level monitor, not 4k, disply quality is poor compered to top brand like Dell,zebronics failed to compete with dell, samsung, LG"
4,Using after 15days..my decision is correct.. Quality and price are really great and perfect suitable for photoshop and video editing ( my opinion)
4,"Pros :- Nice product , ultra-slimCons:- little tilted , no height adjustment"
3,"I would give 5 stars for looks but 3 stars for picture quality as images looks washed out, contrast is not that good. Another najor drawback is that there is no tilt adjustment which would have been fine if by default the monitor didn't point slightly in a downward direction. As u can see in the image I had to manually tilt it backwards to resolve this by putting some cushining below the stand, 2 cardboard pieces u can see at each end. If u r looking to wall mount then I dnt think this should matter as I am assuming that monitor won't tilt downwards then, but I can't say as I haven't wall mounted it. I did a lot of research before buying n thought of giving this indian brand a chance but since there is no option to return this product I have kept it otherwise I would have returned it. Dnt go for looks, go for picture quality and buy any other brand."
4,Good
4,"Amazing Product. Really worthy at this price Range, Overall is is Good.Inbuilt Sound can be Improve a Bit..its Too Low...Rest is Great"
5,Trust me if you are looking for a DECENT PICE AND QUALITY MONITOR I would proffer definitely  because I was really scared of the comments which I saw above but when I received the product I really loved it for the money what I have paid it is fine because you do get the same size monitor with higher price BUT THIS ONE IS DEFIANTLY WORTH OF BUYING IAM REALY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT FROM PACKING TO DELIVERY PERFECT.
2,"Valur for money except for aux issue but won't recommend buying.Audio aux port doesn't work.Replaced the product received in another week but for new monitor also audio aux port is not working.Most people doesn't test it.I don't know if it works at all or just for showcase.Tried with aux cable that was in box ,tried other aux , earphone as well."
4,Display complaint
2,"Its installation and setup on table as well as on the wall is very confusing. There is no space/screw...for wall mounting. I tried to buy a wall mount for this monitor but could find one anywhere. I also visited its service center in Nehru place (New Delhi), surprisingly they also do not have any idea about how I can wall mount this monitor. Other wise in terms of design and look it's a good monitor."
2,"The monitor is good over all , the issue is that the base is not proper for a 27 inch screen . It wobbles , and slight nudge can make it topple .  I recieved the product with dead pixel.  Customer care cannot find the product based on serial number printed at back . Also due to the shaky base the monitor toppled and the led broke .  There is no option to connect it to wall or monitor stand."
5,"Value for money at ‚Çπ7260 rsThis is my 2nd day review will update more on futureProsGood colour reproductionVery good quality anti-glare coating but (doesn't make colours look so dull, almost like glossy )DesignZero bezels on sidesThere is no noticeable backlight bleeding issueConsNo speakerNo audio portAll these cons are negligible if you don't need those things. If you need you can opt Benq GW2283 For 7750rsOr Lg22mp68vq(no speakers but more other features but now priced higher than benq)Be careful while tilting the monitor don't push or pull by placing hands on your panel.there is no bezels on sides to support the panel."
3,"The monitor looks great with bezelless design, has a coating which not only good for eyes but also ensures no reflection even if kept near windows. I am using it with 1920x1080 resolution on my Windows 10 machine smoothly so all well with this.Though delivery story hasn't been nice. I got it without the necessary screws and i needed to arrange that myself somehow. Good luck with finding compatible screw if you get the same issue.Amazon solution in the matter was blunt that buy screws and we would reimburse (like I know what size & all or if its wise to burn fuel in searching for screws which cost less than 5rs). Another idea they gave to return the product. Thanks for no thanks. Not a happy experience and hope others don't go through that due to carelessness of seller"
5,"An excellent monitor with good picture quality, backlight bleeding is minimal and the stand is not an adjustable one...... excellent one for 7200/-...üëåüëåüëå"
2,Good morning at a low price and some pixel bleeding issue in this monitor. And also in this monitor comes with matfinish sticker
1,Product is damage. Product can't pick up üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠. Why????
5,"The product is very good for this price. It doesn't have a bezel for it which gives it a classy finish and a great look. The monitor is 21.5 inch with a Full HD 1920*1080p display which is good for gaming and editing. I use this monitor for editing and I can assure that this is the best LED monitor that you can get for this price. It doesn't make an irritation for your eyes. The best part is it has AMD freesync technology which gives you a better picture quality without a lag or flicker at all.I ordered this product and I got a monitor which had a small dot on the display. I ordered for a replacement and I got the monitor replaced just within two days of my request. The old monitor just had a small issue and when I requested for the replacement, Amazon just replaced the product with a good one. Thanks to Amazon üòä"
1,"As you can see in the image, it has hell of ips glowing issue. That's the Black screen in image which looks more like blue & dreamy in colour. I even exchanged it to see whether this particular one is diffective but the second one also turned out to be the same."
2,Monitor is good but 1pixel dead in my monitor I am confused what I do pls help me
4,"Pros:- Premium finish and looks- HDMI cable included- All fitting instructions and screws included- Easy fitting- Excellent packaging- Screen quality is awesomeCons:- Brightness needs to be a bit higher.- Screen adjustments should have been provided. Up-down, along with vertical tilt.- Menu controls are complicated.- No Audio port- No USB port- No in-built speakers"
2,"I was throughly disappointed and irrited when I first plugged in the monitor. The main purpose of this monitor for me was work and a bit of light video watching. And it failed miserably.The screen is very very bright. It hurts my eyes, the white is highly blue tinted. Correcting the white and the brightness is an living hell.Still I could not get it to a comfort level but I had to adapt a lotAdjusted for long work with low brightness, videos are not optimal in this setting, especially if the videos have dark scenes.Adjusting colors for white leaves other colors somewhat off.Natural colors renders are punchy but I would not recommend this for graphics designers because of some weird reason, artificial colors are too contrasted and is not accurate.Cannot comment its performance as a gaming monotor as I don't game."
5,very good product with good delivery. Worth buying as the screen size is good. The screen is not adjustable vertically however its very good for people who have long sitting hours since it keeps your head looking up all the time.
1,I am very disappointed in the product.... I could access the 75hz and nvidia gsync... But with a crappy panel it is no use... And they won't give a refund .. it's only replace.... I am waiting for a replacement... Will update after that.UpdateThe replacement has no problem. Although I feel like it has been sitting there for quite some time. The refresh rate and response time are legit. I could feel the slight difference. The inbulit modes are no use when gaming... Manually set it. For casual use it's good. The eye saver move just puts a warm filter.Overall a good product. If you are on budget this is a good product. But if you hav a bigger desk then go for the 24inch.
1,When it came in the screen was cracked or broken because the metal stand was on top of that screen don't put anything on the screen I requested for replacement
5,"Pros:1. The screen is bright, but not too bright that will hurt your eyes2. The screen is 75Hz, perfect for casual gaming3. Anti-glare screen, for lesser reflection of external lights, especially if you are working in a room with plenty of natural lights.4. Advanced eye care protection, I use this monitor for the office purpose every day for around 9-10 hours at a stretch. But no issues have been noted so far.An added benefit: a good quality HDMI cable that will suffice your need.Cons:1. Price can be a sort of negative side of this product, but if you buy it on deal days, then it will be a worthy product at the price point of less than equal to 7K.2. The screen refresh rate is 75Hz, so if you are a heavy gamer, then this monitor should not be in your wishlist.Overall,for work from home: 5 out of 5for gaming: 4 out of 5 if casual gamerfor heavy gaming: Not recommended.Thanks"
1,"Received a cracked screen monitor which was already used by someone. Ordered replacement, After much of hassel amazon agreed for replacement.Let's look at Pros and Cons:Cons:Monitor is very fragile and cheap quality plastic is used.Monitor position is fixed which is a deal breaker, as you won't be able to adjust or tilt it.Pros: Monitor has very good quality panel and IPS display (glares less and has good viewing angels)HDMI cable is provided in the boxOverall its not worth the product even though you have good panel for money you are paying!Finally returned the replacement and got the refund."
4,"Moving from a cheap monitor to 22inch, so first impression is very charming.if you are using hdmi, then colour depth is very nice. There is option in monitor for hdmi black which is phenomenal toolThe two cons I found, 75 Hz isn't much of a difference. 2nd is monitor is so thin that i cant bend angle without bending the screen which can reduce longevity.  Screen case isn't hard enough to handle the force required to adjust viewing angle. It is quite frustrating, although because of IPS display you don't require much of adjustment.Everything else is fine, from color accurate to Smooth video playback..."
5,I always buy Samsung TV's & Displays and I wasn't disappointed here. The Display as expected is superb. Very thin bezels and premium build quality. Very similar to what you will get in an iMac.Additionally the cable management provided on the back of the base stand is an added bonus.An excellent buy for the price. Highly recommended.
5,"Got this monitor as a part of my work from home set up. I tried an older 24 inch monitor, which was way too big for my liking. This would have also impacted my ability for any future upgrades.Set up is easy. Its VESA mount compatible, so will wait for some more time, before I buy another one.With the current stand, the screen is at eye level for me, works really fine from an ergonomic perspective, yes, the table also plays an important part.Overall, loving to work on this for the last few days. Will share an update in a few months or so."
5,"Lets not discuss about the picture quality because its Samsung. You can blindfoldedly trust it for awesome picture quality. One thing that i liked the most is its model. Really impressed by the design of the monitor. Second thing is its button on the back, instead of having 6-7 buttons, this monitor just have a single button which is actually a joystick-based button. I was confused while buying this monitor. But after using it for 3 days, its all worth it. Got it at Rs. 6750 during prime day sale."
1,Worst ever experience with amazon bought two of these monitors one piece was defective with full display so I have ordered a replacement ..these guys make you wait for a week n what I recieved was a more defective piece of monitor.. and now the payment will take another week to get in my account .. seriously don't buy this monitor
3,"The product is good, and it is as described, there was no damage, but unfortunately the screws for attaching the monitor with the base stand was missing. I was luck enough that I got an exact match from a local computer shop, but this should not happen."
3,"The monitor quality when working with a coding environment or browsing is good enough.But, when playing videos or games, the contrast is very low, despite trying across many settings.Also, monitor is not height nor pan adjustable.Good for non gaming / non video purposes."
5,"The response and clarity of the screen is top notch. Backlighting bleeding is not that severe for me, but for many it can be severe. This depends on the quality of build. Black is not that deep compared to other monitors. If you're looking to do image or video editing, it's best to calibrate it, as the built in settings may not be suitable. The 75Hz refresh rate is simply smooth and fluid. Do know that, AMD FreeSync feature is only available to AMD card users, as it supports HDMI. Many videos show gsync can be used in FreeSync monitors, but this is available only to monitors with display port, which this doesn't."
5,"I have a cheap laptop with a 1366x768 display. I have been doing graphic designing and always wanted a display upgrade. I bought this monitor. It comes with an HDMI cable, a stand, place for wall mount (wall mount not included) and a power adapter.Overclocking:I use it at 75hz and blur-tested it on Testufo. Its unbeatable. I tried overclocking it to 80Hz but no hopes.Power usage:Not a big load for your cpu as well as home power supply.Brightness and Contrast:Brightness is fine. The least brightness isn't the least bright (IYKWIM). Contrast can be manually adjusted as well as there are presets for different modes (ex. Cinematic).Others:If you experience frame drops, either your cpu usage is high, or the monitor is set to incorrect refresh rate (for ex. 59Hz instead of 60Hz)The colors are really great. IPS display stands to everything it advertises."
5,"Excellent Monitor at this price range...1. Stunning Design - besseless design is very good2. Good Clarity - Very good screen Quality3, HDMI Cable includedNote: If your Laptop doesnt have a HDMI port, then a VGA cable or Converter should be purchased to connect this.Thank you Amazon..."
1,It was actually a replacement of my original product that I received was defective. Amazon took my request and the vendor sent a replacement product which had this multiple cracks in the screen. Totally disappointed and asked for complete refund.
5,"Best Monitor on ‚Çπ7499/- 18-21/10/2020, Seller- Appario Retail 3 days delivery on Normal delivery So i happy. Good picture quality,Set, Brightness Level......80% (Balance back lightüëç)Contrast Level .......100% (good Colours üëå)Sarpness Level........60%(As you or default)You can see Picture Quality And Backlight issue about resolved*Note- Stand Quality is Very Very good And tough But Not Adjustable Monitor Screen And No Audio port this is very very Disappointed For gamming  And Using As a TV Monitor *"
5,Good monitor and does the job pretty well iam using it for work so no issues till now but I don't know about gaming as not into it. Colour quality is much better than HP as I have that as secondary monitor and it doesn't reproduce colours like this. Satisfied with my purchase can't ask more for 7000 .
2,"LED broke in few days of usage. We took full care, but then accidents touchs on sides happen. The monitor is bezel less but the casing is very weak and slight flick cause LED to get damage. Screws attaching the monitor to stand are not provided in the package, leading to loose placement on stand, again cause of accidental damage. All in all avoid if you get similar monitor at same price..you will avoid lot of inconvenience later. The cost of LED replacement is as good as a new monitor. On performance it is good, but be very careful, try wall mounting, but then wall mount has to be bought separately.Delivery by Amazon was impeccable and on time."
4,"I really like this monitor , as it gives good colors and the bezel less design is something that feels futuristic. It doesn't get dim enough for my taste. Everything feels so much good for someone who has been using laptop screens only for a couple of years.But you need to take caution when touching the screen by the slim edges, i felt like i would break the display if i apply even a little force. There is some degree of vertical tilt available for the display which is a good thing. Overall good monitor for the price."
4,outer thin bezel frame not properly fitted on top side.has  2-3 mm gap.another person has also mentioned it in review with screenshot.never expected  such blunders from a tech giant like samsung.monitor looks waste due to this assembly carelessness.
4,The monitor is really good and this is the monitor is not for gamers because of the higher response time overall the monitor is great with IPS panel .tHE MONITOR COMES WITH NECESSARY components like HDMI is required for a build overall a great monitor for its price.But theree some disadvantages too that you dont have inbuilt speaker and there is no aux input so you need to connect external speakers to use.You cannot use fire tv stick with this because it lags not having speakers.
1,"I regular purchase Samsung Products, writing review after 15 days. I have purchased two monitors and I am really disappointed by both the devices. There is issue of pixel, since last 2 days randomly monitor display blinks and there is serious issue of pixels sometime some pixel show's red/purple/blue.I wanted to replace both the monitors but amazon is not responding as per my expectation. There is policy of only replaceable item not refundable."
4,i am using this as a external display for my laptop. The laptop i have is 13 inch screen and causes stress on my eyes after continuous use. So went for this monitor and after a day of use i feel the difference. More comfort !Monitor is good i use it for office work and casual media or gaming for which it is sticking out well. Modern design and good built quality.You get value of the price you pay. Got this in Prime day Discount for Rs. 6575 and ita a good deal.
5,"Picture quality is quite good , eye care mode reduces strain a lot. Its just like the blue light filter feature available on smartphones.Also the 90hz feels little bit smooth compared to 60hz and can also be activated if you are using NVIDIA card. (Even though it says it works with amd freesync, check youtube on how to do it on nvidia)"
5,"1st of all thanks to appario retail pvt & amazon for the price drop(got it for 7195 rs) .Awesome monitor,great picture quality,well build quality.Premium looking budget monitor ..Only issue i'm facing is backlight bleeding/IPS glow .hope it is not a big problem !!"
5,"Originally it's more beautiful and stylish then in the images.75 Hz refresh rate and IPS panel is what made me buy this product.It's fabulous to watch movies and fast paced action scenes.Used just for a day, no cons yet, and hopeful won't find any :)Overall a value for money and trust of Samsung, makes it best in class for WFH + GamingCheers."
4,I am writing this review approximately after a month's use.I have bought this for about 7500 which I thought was a good deal.Being a budget gaming PC build I had to stick with a 75hz display.Initially I was a bit sceptical about buying this monitor as there weren't enough reviews but nevertheless went for it.I was a bit confused between the LG monitor and this one but finally decided for going for Samsung.Below are the mentioned pros and cons-Pros1.Good for gaming.2.Has amd freesync3.Crisp and clear picture quality Cons(or rather a con ;-))I wish the brightness adjustment button and the power button were placed in a better position as initially it was difficult for me to get used to them.PS : Thanks to Amazon for their super fast 1 day delivery ^_^
5,"The colors are very vibrant and it gives you very nice feeling. The eye saver mode is not that good but still works. The 75hz and 5ms response time makes it pretty choice for casual gamers though I will not recommend it for Pros since getting better monitor with more budget will be ideal. Still, if you want something decent in a good price then this monitor hits the mark."
5,So the product that arrived was not aligned properly at the top centre. There was a gap of approx 2mm between the frame and the display. Remember someone else had faced the similar issue. Not a good quality check. Also the product box was opened and just pasted with a thin cellotape. Have asked for replacement. Let's wait and watch. Will update the review once I get the new piece.Edit : the replacement arrived and I must admit it's gorgeous. No backlight bleeding. No misalignment. Good one.Had ordered two. Cost 6750 per piece including card discount.
5,"Ok, I was little skeptical about buying this monitor from Amazon as there were very limited reviews and the product was new but I believed in Samsung and ordered it. Boy this monitor is gorgeous.Pros,1) Punchy colors, good color accuracy, deep blacks (don't expect amoled level).2) Three side bezel less design.3) No dead pixels on the screen.4) 75hz out of the box.5) Made by Samsung that means no need to worry about servicing.6) Supports vesa mount.7) Comes with eye care feature (which is basically blue light cutter) out of the box.Cons,1) No builtin speakers and No audio jack for audio out.2) Little too bright for my liking (I always keep the brightness below 25).This monitor supports AMD freesync and refresh rates upto 75Hz, I don't have AMD GPU on my laptop to test freesync but surprisingly, I was able to set the refresh rate to 75Hz without Freesync (Please find the attached image). I was bit worried about dead pixels issue which is very common with most of the budget IPS panels but again I was pleasantly surprised to see no dead pixels on the screen (verified on Deadpixelbuddy)Also I was able to authenticate the product and register it online with Samsung India to claim 36 months warranty.  Happy with the seller for selling Samsung genuine products.I couldn't test the gaming performance as I don't run games on my laptop, will try to update this review once I'm able to enjoy gaming session on this screen.Peace.."
5,I bought this monitor mainly for office use. Does the job perfectly well. Colour balance is nice and vibrant.Only issue which i feel is absence of an audio jack in case you want to connect this to gaming console.
5,"The monitor's build and picture quality seems quite good. I was using a dell 22"" in my office, and this screen looked quite big to my surprise (Initially I thought it wouldn't make much difference, but I had to sit slightly away from the monitor to get proper view of the content)."
5,"Bought it @10350 in big sale,delivered on time.Positive:-1.Clear and crisp2.Eye saver mode amazing.3.Beautiful design at this price.4.Gaming or movie you throw whatever it handles very well.Cons :- If have any let me know.Guys If I‚Äôm giving it 5 star that means anyone will give it,I give 5 star very hardly and I bought this after 7 months of research.Just go for it blindly.Remember to update your NVIDIA SOFTWARE and then go in NVIDIA control panel and sync the resolution.(Guideline for non tech savvy people).Resolution Syncing Solution :- As when this led arrived I connected my laptop and I saw blurry screen and I forgot to update NVIDIA software and then sync it next day and oh man it synced very nicely and everything perfect after that.I called Samsung customer care but they couldn‚Äôt fix the issue so I did it by myself and wrote the solution here so you guys could sync right away."
5,It's amazing creativity from samsung it's osm and best monitor yet......i can do my work so effective and fluent manner......
4,Its an amazing monitor no doubt with great brightness and amazing color accuracyits also very big in real life and has very thin bezels but--The stand feels a little flimsy and the packaging was not the best i have received from amazon--The stand is also no adjustable in any way so if you have a low table it will be a problem But overall if your budget is around this price there might not be a better monitor to buy than thisI have reduced 1 star for the poor delivery but for my requirement the product is 5 star
5,"I got this monitor today as I needed it for extended display. Work wise it is great as it does not causes strain in the eyes. However, when I watch any movie with subtitle and there is a dark scene, the brightness increases and then decreases once the subtitle disappears which is a little irritating."
1,I received a damaged piece. Nothing was visible.. also package had flipcart sticker
3,Picture quality is good but there is backlight bleeding issue. Brightness level is average. Built and design is above average.There is no inbuilt speakers neither any microphone jack.You will notice those backlight bleeding while watching movies which is very irritating to me personally. Benq offers better panel monitors.
5,"Product is really good with good display quality. I really liked the eye saver mode which was extremely effective for using it during long hours of working. Sadly the one 1st I received had a stuck pixel and more backlight bleeding issue, and unfortunately the replaced one had more issues than the 1st one. As my work involves more with numbers, these stuck pixels are creating a confusion of a decimal symbol. :(It is evident that, in this kind of issues, neither the seller nor Amazon can do anything as it seems to be completely manufacturing defect. No one can be blamed here. Winter off seller provided a brand new one so no complaints, even Amazon's packaging was way toooo good... but unfortunately the product had manufacturing defect so even Samsung can't be blamed as this can happen in large productions."
5,"Very happy with product quality, delivery and seller. All specifications matching with description. HDMI cable came along with it. Syntronic Official seller is very good."
1,Do check out the seller rating while buying. I got the monitor with light bleeding issue. It was clearly visible on my wallpaper (dark). The package also didn't have mounting screws. Returned it and went for the Dell monitor.
5,This monitor was purchased as my 13 years Acer Monitor 19.5inch was out of order with no chance to get repaired.So researched deeply and arrived at this decision. Ordered on 09.08.2020 and received it today itself 4 days before as it was promised by Amazon.Thanks Amazon and thanks the seller.
4,"The price at 10999 is a bit costly considering other options. Also there is only one USB and One HDMI port.The system is good for single screen user. But for others with excessive usage of monitor with projector, second screen ...not a must buy product keeping in mind the range.Colors are good, with decent picture quality and indeed the overall look wise it is good design with no end to end screen and no border."
5,"I am writing this review after 6 months of usage and i am going to mention the pros and cons in detailsPros:1. Good brightness2. Though not mentioned anywhere but it is an IPS panel, its samsung's own version called PLS3. Colour Accuracy is good to excellent.4. Built quality is great5.no heating issues ( my avg room temperature is 36 to 38 in summer and in winter i operate it at 15 to 18) but I didn't feel any heating throughout screen and body6. Very little to almost no wobbling7. Power adapter is of good quality and has a good length of wire8. Wire quality of adapter is nice.9. Adiquate amount of height is obtained with the help of stand provided with this monitor10. Great viewing angles11. Great to see the vga port (compatibility for older systems)And now it's time for some cons i foundCons:1. No DP port provided2. Price if it was 9k i think the deal would've been much betterNow i want to say overall this is a great purchase for me from a brand like samsung which is reputed enough for it's after sales service and also quality assurance. Thanks to Amazon for nicely packaging and delivering it to me under 5 days in this covid scenario.Guys if you are having confusion that whether it is an IPS monitor or not i would like to clear the clutter that it is an IPS üíØ percent.üëå"
4,"Its nice product - very slim, light weight, edge monitor. Yhe brightness is quite high. I reduced it to 30. Checked many monitor under this range, but got this as the best.Reduced 1 star for not having in built speaker. Over all its a nice product for work."
4,Very good product for money. I git it for 11.5k. You will have to adjust the colors though.
5,"The monitor and its quality is too good.Samsung is known for its quality and they keep their words.I really like this monitorThe color combination, contrast and saturation is just awesome.But the seller of this product is not providing regeionable prices. I ordered this @ rs 10,450/- and now he is selling it @ rs 10,200/-This is not fair, rest I like the product too much."
1,"Yes, it has screen bleeding. It might be product defect. Test it this way1. Create a dark room during night.2. Set solid black color as desktop background.Observe the edge lining. You will notice the bright light bleeding.Suggesting don't go for it.Screen bleeding is not visible in day time and on colourful desktop background. Which is why most of the users might have not noticed it."
1,Its not even two months and the panel is not working anymore.Update : Its been more than a month now samsung guys still didn't replaced my LED.They are saying the part is not available in stockNever ever go with samsung guys specially in case of monitors. There services are below pathetic
5,"I have been using this for two months and I really liked it. Especially the Eye Saver mode - just for this, I will give it a 5/5. And of course, at this price, quality is real good."
1,"White on this monitor is YELLOW!!. It has a clear yellow tint and neither Amazon nor Samsung is taking responsibility to support this product.And I can't return with Amazon's return policy, only replacement is available."
4,"I was having second thoughts at first about buying this but I am glad to buy this. there aren't any dead pixels and the display is also good, the only con about it is fixed height, which isn't what I was expecting."
4,"Good for watching movies and doing the office work. Display seems very bright for me,i have to reduce it to a value less than 10. Good for moderate PC gaming. For consoles , you dont have audio jack or inbuilt speaker in the monitor"
1,Never buy this monitor as the panel of this monitor comes faulty. we have bought this monitor 2 months back and now we. are getting a red vertical line in the middle of screen.
5,Im heavily satisfied with the product . The big screen and amazing picture quality combinely gives me a wonderful viewing experience . This monitor is worth ur every penny
5,Good product with great picture quality. Good for gaming and office work.
5,"I bought this monitor a month back. Was quite skeptical as there were no reviews. Delivery took some time, but the monitor is worth waiting for. I just love the design and picture quality. This monitor is made is made i China FYI."
2,When i connect this monitor with my laptop i am getting electric shock from the laptop body. The monitor uses a 2 pin setup other that the 3 pin. So i guess there won't be an issue with the desktop computers issue will be present when it is connected with a laptop.
2,Its made in China and not in India. Over and out.
5,Great picture quality the colurs are well balanced and offers a very great experience while Gaming. Samsung is always famous for its displays and after buying this I can say its completely true.
5,"I had purchased this monitor in Nov'20. It's been 4 months, and I am happy, that its improved my WFH experience."
4,I got it for my home office. My experience is good so far.
5,Very nice and budget friendly monitor plus the Colour accuracy is really good.
5,Good product recommend
5,This monitor is having good screen qualityespecially anti-glare is I loved it in this monitor.
2,May not be suitable for coding/programming with VNC windows.
3,Missing accessories üòï
5,It‚Äôs worth every penny
5,I am happy with the delivery as it was delivered in good condition and on time.The display of the monitor is good and value for money.
4,"All I wanted was a 27-inch Full HD monitor with inbuilt speakers (or Audio out) with HDMI port. I chose this one over Benq due to its positive ratings and I already know that Benq monitor has a poor audio out quality. Philips didn't disappoint me. Colors are vivid, Smart Contrast gives pitch black for the screen. No dead pixels too. I hope Pixel Orbiting feature saves from it. Cables are supplied for all three Input ports.The downsides are:1. Power adapter looks like a laptop charger and it comes with a large 16-amp plug. I had to find a CPU power cable to use instead of the supplied power adapter.2. This is a 2018 model (as per Philips website) at 15k. There is already 2020 model (named V series), which is available at 12k, with same features."
5,"In 27-inch monitor's segment the options of branded monitors (from Samsung, LG, Dell, Philips, Sony etc) are limited. After extensive search I zeroed in on this model. Before this I was using Samsung 19 inch speaker less monitor which was not Full HD.It is to be noted that monitors of major brands do not have speakers in their most of the models.Major attractions for choosing Philips Monitor are1.Full HD 1080p with crisp picture quality(images): I have tested with YouTube. It also plays well 2K HD (WQHD 1440p) without any interruptions). Therefore, display panel is ultimate. Monitor is therefore, FHD & QHD.2. IPS displays with extra wide viewing angles of 178/178 (horizontal/vertical) degree with Anti-Glare coating.3. Ultra Wide-Color- wider color gamut for natural looking colour. Colour reproduction is much better than normal FHD TVs. Watching Netflix, Prime Video in high quality is awesome experience.4. Very bright with Smart Contrast Ratio of 20,000,000:1.5. Refresh Rate of 75Hz. Higher refresh rate (75 Hz in comparison to 60Hz) produces better video quality, reduced eye strain, and even improved gaming experiences.6. Effortlessly smooth gameplay with AMD FreeSync‚Ñ¢ technology.7. Narrow border display for a seamless appearance (nearly borderless bezel display on three sides)8. Less eye fatigue with Flicker-free technology9.LowBlue Mode for easy on-the-eyes productivity10. Three types of Video Input Interface. Analog VGA, Display Port (1.2) and HDMI (Digital, HDCP).11. Audio/Headphone out and PC Audio in (for VGA connection): 3.5mm Jacks on the back side.12. VESA Wall Mount option availability (100mm x 100mm). Bracket and screws are not included. I had to buy separately. Wall mount saved space on computer table.13.Built-in stereo speakers for multimedia (though sound quality is not very good but decent type)14. 3 Years Warranty: Most Samsung Monitors mentioning only 1 Yr manufacturer warranty. But this model has additional 2 years (Total 3 Yrs) warranty for peace of mind.Minor Shortcomings1. With remote, this monitor would have been Full HD Non-SMART TV. Except for remote control, monitor is perfect Non-SMART IPS LED TV at low price.2. Sound quality is not that good. But with audio output, the same can be connected to external speakers/sound bars/home theater system. I have connected via blue-tooth transmitter to my home theater system.3. Connections could have been on side rather than back side. In case of VESA Wall Mount, little space is left to manage connections.Overall, I recommend this monitor to Desktop Computer Enthusiast. One can go blindly for this."
5,"Good Monitor. Received with no dead pixel, my observations -In the package: Monitor with Stand Power adapter with cable VGA cable Display cable HDMI cable Audio cable Quick start manualPros: Light in weight (~ 4kg with stand) Narrow bezel, modern look Anti glare screen is very useful especially for over bright seating places Low blue mode is good for long working/reading Display quality is good In-built speakers Perfectly usable as TV with any HDMI source for a 12'X14' size room (speaker volume may pose limitation for bigger rooms. One can still use external speaker by using audio out port in the monitor)Cons: Has power adapter of size like laptop adapter Speakers are there but not powerful (still better than its peers, 2X3 = 6 watts not 2X2 = 4 watts) Controls button location is not friendly (joystick type is good but should have been paced at either side not at bottom) Only tilt, no height adjustmentAs a make shift arrangement (refer image) existing stand can be put in two of the vesa holes to fix the monitor stand for a lower height (with extra support from other two holes at top, courtesy: local hardware shop, two metal strips total @Rs. 30/-)"
1,Screen got Damaged with in a month and philips is asking me to travel to there service center which is 132 KM Away in vijayawada to collect
4,"colours really pop on this monitor.......really good for budget editors as it has NTSC 93%*, sRGB 124% coverage.......but it still has little bit bleeding issues similliar to Lg,Benq,aoc and acer"
5,"A small suggestion would be to make the stand and the monitor fit sturdy, Its shakes when you type on the keyboard, except that it has excellent colors."
5,"Nice monitor, less strain for eyes. Worth for money."
5,Monitor is awesome.
5,Very nice üëç
5,Impressive product
3,Product is ok if it is priced reasaonably near 12 k to 13k.24 inch monitor with same fearures and brand will be getting it for 7.5 k after banknoffrr. Then what is the point of spending duoble the price for just 3 inch more size with all features and same brand.Really need to consider this case.
4,"This can be picked for normal work related priorities, Don't expect much with respect to gaming as the screen refresh rate is not great that you would expect for gaming.Speakers - Useless. Don't consider speaker while ordering this product. One of the worst and cheap audio quality. Didn't expect this from Philips."
4,"The monitor can solenly used for gaming, I was not satisfied with the picture quality and the brightness, if you are looking for a all round pc usage avoid this monitor, if need only to gaming this would be best for gamers out there"
4,"The product, overall, is a good one, barring the disappointing in-build speakers that come with the monitor. But, at a 10,700 rupees price point, 2HDMI ports and a 75hz screen is worth it. But, dont buy it if you need good in-build speakers...overall, satisfied for what I paid"
5,Best experience to use this product all settings best part that in this led 2 HDMI port there ... Value of money product
3,"I bought this monitor for the general purpose in September 2020. After using 20 days screen start fluctuating. I checked and found ports are loose. it has 2 HDMI port and both are loose.Color calibration is also not so good but brightness and contrast are overall good, You can buy for general purpose but for photo editing, it's not good because of no good color accurate."
4,If you see closely the pink strip at the bottom is just stuck over. Finishing is loose stand shakes and it look like they brought a display and attached AOC stickers over it.Performance is ok not a great display.I should have brought Dell :/
5,"The monitor loads pictures/graphics/videos etc. very fast. The 1080p resolution is very good. The colors are very bright and clear. I use it mainly for home and work. However, my neighbour kid has played games and seemed to like the monitor very much."
1,The monitor got a stuck pixel in just 2 weeks . Very Bad. Now addition i also have a line at the bottom
5,This monitor is really good. I'm using this to extend my laptop display using VGA port. It's HDMI port is also working fine when we connect through TV tuner. Its colouring and brighness features need to be set when you seat very close because it is kind of gaming monitor so sharpness can impact your eyes. Overall I find it is very good.
2,Pro :Screen size is bigCons :Build quality is not good (I could see gap between the display and the borders )Overbrightness ( Even after Reducing brightness to zero  )Not suitable for general useAll colours appear a little dull
5,Monitor is really good specially for gaming the colors r very good and vibrant the screen size is 25 inch which also point at this price point so I will recommand to go with monitor
5,Sound / volume is not great
5,Very good product. value for money
5,This is good monitor. But picture quality is not so good  since its a TN panel. Other than that everything is so good.
1,Product with infected. VGA port with issue they deliverd
5,"quick delivery, good price, good quality.. i got just what i wanted...Happy that i selected AOC instead of Samsung."
5,"Best and cheap gaming monitor, inbuilt speakers are not upto their standards other than that its worth it"
3,Its build quality feels so cheap/
5,Value for money. Good performance
5,It's very good product
5,AOC monitor good collect the waste.
5,"Hd smoothThis is an edit that I am doing after using this product for 16 monthsreason why I am doing this is like anything just HD smooth would be an understatement will need to get away se 144 hz but back when I brought this one man trust me it was like the best its legit 1ms response helps u to take down ur enemies , give them no time to react , sounds badass right go ahead buy it and experience (sighs, buying this  monitor with 1ms response rate and 75hz refresh rate wont make u a  good gamer or if you want to get better then you will have to giving more practice do periodic aimlabs and  watch pros play)"
1,"10% off on ICICI Debit EMI transaction never worked for me. Though, I had the eligibility and balance (bank confirmed that) the offer never worked. Amazon customer support is of no help on this too.Advise to Amazon: Either solve customer's issue or document resolution mechanism for such issues clearly. This is frustrating and time consuming for customers."
5,G2590VXQ gaming monitor is power packed with AMD Free Sync Technology which synchronizes GPU with the monitor without stuttering the image display. Its Flicker Free Technology and true to life game color give you the most detailed gaming experience. G2590VXQ also comes with an extremely low input lag and a response time of just 1 ms.
3,the mount can hold up only 3 24 inch monitors.If you hook up 3 27 inch or 32 inch monitors the side monitors will slope down and it makes the setup look wierd .
5,"The product is very well built, sturdy and value for money considering the price tag. Would not hesitate to buy another if the need arises. Manual is self explanatory."
2,"I was really looking forward to use this monitor as it sounded perfect for each of my needs of work, leisure, gaming and large display*QHD resolution*IPS display*HDR""AMD Freesync*75Hz refresh rate and*32"" screen sizeTrusting LG and Amazon I ordered it on the day of launch only to be disappointed by the poor build quality(See images)Uneven panel gapsUnreasonably high screen(IPS) bleedingOne of the other reasons I opted for this monitor was the support of a feature called Dual Controller where one can control 2 machines with one set of keyboard and mouse basically magic! Sadly found out that a necessary part of using this feature called Picture by picture is not supported rendering the 'Dual controller' useless. Also dosent work with VPN connection which many of us need on work PCs"
5,"I bought this monitor a while back and here's my experience:The Good:1) Has IPS panel thus has excellent viewing angles.2) Anti glare coating3) Height , tilt and z-axis rotation4) Plenty of pre-configured picture modes5) Gaming mode with black stabilizer6) Multiple inputs7) Easy to use joystick controlThe bad:1) No y axis rotation.2) HDR is not that great, still looks premature and may wash out the colours a bit.3) No build in speakers.4) Very heavy"
5,"Iam quite happy with the performance of the monitor. LG 27UK650 4k IPS.I had bought a benq 32"" 4k VA monitor at 39k, but returned it due to poor performance. There was also a grey display bleed on it. The colour reproduction on it was not accurate, especially red. It was also too big for my eyes and got strain after using it. Remember that Pixel density matters and viewing distance. Decide for yourself on that.LG monitor with IPS panel is much better. Iam using it with macbookpro 15"" and didn't go for LG 27UK850 (43k price) as the only benefit in that is a usb-c port (and additional usb 3.0 ports often unused) with reverse charging. But if you use a single usb-c to HDMI port (good quality with 60hz at 3k price) it also works in the same way but no charging happens. And it is always good to use the original company charger for laptop for longer battery life than using low 60watts of reverse power in the case of LGUK850. Hence LGUK650 (33k price) was apt for me as I use an additional 2.1 speakers (better than ibuilt speakers), taking audio out from the monitor. The menu and the joystick is very intuitive and also easy for volume control. I also noted that audio switching in usb-c to usb-c sometimes doesn't work automatically (in benq) in utube.Colour reproduction in this LGUK650 is superb and is at par with my macbookpro. Good contrast ratio. Sleek design and white back makes it even stunning especially for my led light bounced on the wall. Stand is also sturdy as I use a height adjustable table. I haven't figured out how to run the mac in clamshell mode without connecting power cable to laptop. Probably it doesn't work.Go for LGUK850 only if you really need usb-c at that price point."
1,"Received the monitor today and I'm very impressed with the bright display and crisp colors, the text is sharp and clear, the color calibration is good out of the box.The build quality is also good.Unfortunately, I got a defective panel which has severe backlight bleed issue, I could have accepted it if the backlight bleeding was equal from all corners, but it is worst on the right side and affecting the color uniformity, as you can see in the attached white image, it has a red tone on the left side and blue tone on the right side, it is more visible in real.I'm giving 3 stars due to the mentioned issue and going to request a replacement, I'll update the review and give 5 stars if I get a good panel.If I get a defective panel again, I'll reduce it to 1 star.*Update after replacement-I have received the replacement, and surprisingly it has the same problem! I can accept the backlight bleed or IPS glow, but can't accept severe color variation on the screen, you can see the color variation in the attached image, color tones on the right side and left side are totally different, is this acceptable? Going to return it and I won't purchase any monitor from Amazon from now on."
1,Looking at the specs I ordered without any second thought. The first monitor had huge IPS glow. Thinking a defective piece requested for replacement. The second one had IPS glow and huge backlight bleeding. The stand material looks so cheap. I did not expect this from LG. I think they are selling defective products via Amazon.
3,"I've bought this for my Xbox One X.If you have premium console like Xbox one X and Ps4 Pro then go for it. For PC gaming 4K resolution is too much even for my GTX 970 card. If you want to buy this monitor other than gaming, its not true HDR even itsupports HDR10. Don't use HDR Effect feature for SDR content it looks ridiculous.After one year of usage corners are turning to red after watching for 3 hours then back to normal only after turning it off for 1 hour."
4,"Let me start by saying this first: This is a good SDR monitor which is decent for HDR usage - It is not great.I not going to waste time one reviewing the trivial stuff such as ergonomics and style - you can get that from anywhere on the web. I am going to focus on performance and colour reproductionSDR performance----------------This monitor has a really good SDR performance. It has good colour gamut and brightness and decent contrast ratio (1200:1 native). Colour really pop and it comes packed with several colour profiles. In my experience the most accurate - not the most good looking - profile is the SMPTE-C profile. However I switched to the 'Custom' profile and manually adjusted the other parameters like: colour temperature, rgb levels... and got a better result that has delta Es under 0.68.The panel has pretty good gray uniformity, but the black uniformity is not that impressive; but, it is not a deal breaker, and you have to expect it from any consumer grade IPS panel.HDR performance----------------The monitor does suppoer HDR signals on both HDMI and Display Ports. It is not a true 10 bit panel; it uses 8 bit panel with FRC. This is pretty common now a days while HDR is still in its infancy. The thing is you wouldn't notice much of difference between true 10 bit and 8 bit+FRC for consumer applications. A true 10 bit panel only makes a difference for true professionals such as Colour graders, those in the photography industry, and movie industry who generate HDR content. If you only want consume HDR games and movies 8 bit+FRC should not be a concern; in fact, there are other more important considerations such as: brightness, contrast levels and black levels.The peak brightness of this monitor is only 450 nits, while HDR specification requires at least 1000 nits. This is where it gets tricky. The HDR specification was originally developed with TVs in mind; they were not meant for PC monitors which sits much closer to your eyes. For PC monitor 1000nits brightness if unnecessary; such brightness levels could damage  your eyes. This is why VESA came up with the DisplayHDR specifications that are meant for PC monitors. This new spec has 3 levels DisplayHDR 400, 600 and 1000 - the number indicating the target brightness level. So this monitor KIND OF meets the entry level DisplayHDR 400. I says kind of because while it meets the brightness level requirement, it does not meet other criteria listed in the specification - so this is not a DisplayHDR certified monitor.Contrast levels should be around 10,000:1 for good HDR performance. This is required for showing details within dark areas; a lower contrast will result in the dark areas being too dark or grayish hiding away the details in them. Sadly, this monitor does not even come close to 10,000:1. The monitor only has 1200:1 contrast ratio. This is expected from IPS panels. VA panels on the other hand offers better contrast ratios and hence better rendering of black and dark scenes - but they suffer from bad viewing angles and does not provide great colour accuracy.The black levels on this monitor is also not that great. In a dark room, blacks appear dark grey. It is not much of a problem in a moderately lit room. This is due to the lack of local dimming. There are IPS monitors with local dimming, but they are insanely expensive.So the HDR performance is just decent. The main reasons by it fails to provide a great HDR experience are the lack of local dimming and average constrast ratio.That being said, let me remind you one thing: HDR on PC monitors is in a messy state. I have not found any monitor that meets all the HDR criteria yet. Some new panels are expected to come out by mid-2020 that could improve this. But at the moment there is no point in wasting a lot of money for better HDR performance as the gains don't justify the price.Gaming performance------------------Very good monitor for gaming; at 5ms the response times are really great for casual and semi-pro gamers. The only serious limitation is the 60Hz max FPS. But then again, running modern games at 4K at even 60Hz would require a beast of a PC; so, I wouldn't worry about that for now.If you are a professional gamer or mostly play fast paced games like CS, you should look elsewhere; this is not the monitor for you.Multi-media performance-----------------------This is a really great monitor for watching moives and streaming live sports coverage. The colours look really impressive and as long as you are not sitting in a really dark room, the black levels are also decent.Even though the monitor is limited in its HDR rendering capabilities, it does manage to make a significant difference. I have watched several 4K HDR Hollywood movies and they looked amazing. I have found that sitting in a slightly lit room gives you the best experience with this monitor.General usage performance-------------------------Becasue of the high pixel density of this monitor everything is crisp and clear. You will notice no aliasing with text. In Windows a scaling factor of 150% is required to make texts readable.Usual Issues with IPS-------------------------Backlight bleeding: Backlight bleeding is when the LED backlight steals its way through the panel into the foreground. This usually manifests as a whiter or yellow tint around the edges. Sadly almost every IPS panel has this problem. And the panel I got hs this issues, although not very serious. I can see a tint of yellow in places along the bottom border. This appears to be caused by the bezel pushing a bit too much into the panel; indicating a manufacturing oversight. However this only becomes visible when brightness is increased above 50. However when in HDR mode, the monitor switches to high brightness and this bleed becomes noticeable, especially when the scene is dark. If the content you are viewing - games or movies - is not too dark or black it is not an issues. But when you are watching  movie with top and bottom black bars, this yellow tint is a bit annoying.One thing to remember here is when it comes to IPS there is a thing called panel lottery: no two panels are the same, it will depend of your luck; you may end up with a really good or a bad one or something in the middle.IPS Glow: This monitor does have IPS glow as does any other IPS panel. Unless you are in really dark room and watching dark content at an angle, this wouldn't be a problemCheck the attached image: The whitish overlay is IPS glow. The yellow tint inside the red circle is Backlight bleed. NOTE: IPS glow and bleed always look exaggerated when photographed. It is not that profound when watched in person.Usual Questions Regarding HDR:1. Does this monitor support 4K HDR @ 60Hz over HDMI?Yes, it does. The HDMI ports on this monitor are HDMI 2.0 and supports HDR meta data. One thing to remember is to enable ULTRA HD Deep Color from the monitor settings for the HDMI port you are using.2. Does this monitor support 4K HDR @ 60Hz over Display Port?Again, yes. Now this is something a lot of people seem to be confused about. LG data sheet says that the monitor has DisplayPort v1.2. Now the version 1.2 originally did not have any specification for HDR meta data; this was added only in Display Port 1.4. Now the thing is there are no Display Port 1.2 or Display Port 1.4 devices. These numbers - 1.2, 1.4 - are just versions of Display Port specification document. So a manufacturer could implement a device with a Display Port and implement some features from v1.2 and some from v1.4. This is what LG has done. They have implemented support for HDR metadata into this monitor. So if you connect this monitor to the display port of a source device  (Console, PC ...) that also has implemented the HDR metadata support, it will accept 4K HDR signal at 60Hz. At the moment, GTX 10XX and newer cards support this. GTX 9 series does not have support for HDR meta data.3. How to enable HDR on the monitor?There is nothing to enable. When the monitor receives and HDR signal, it will automatically switch to HDR mode4. How to enable HDR on Windows 10?To use HDR on Windows, you have to first enable it. To do that go to Display Settings - you'll see a toggle there that says 'Play HDR Games and apps'. Just enabled it. Note that this will result in everything else in Windows will look washed out. This is normal and is a known problem when Windows tries to map SDR content to HDR colour space. Unfortunately there is no way around it. Hopefully Microsoft will come up with some solution.Alternatives:From my research, there is only one alternative around this price range:Benq EW3270U - This is a VA panel and provides much deeper blacks and contrast ratio. But it has very limited brightness and viewing angles.Summary:A very good monitor for the price asked. Does support HDR at 4K 60Hz. Has common IPS issues like IPS Glow and Backlight bleeding - but nothing too serious. Very good SDR colour gamut. HDR performance is limited due to average contrast and brightness levels. Great viewing angles and pixel density."
5,"Resolution is excellent, I use it as a secondary screen with my retina display MacBook pro and it puts the retina 15"" display to shame.I also use this as  my PS4 Pro monitor and the graphics are crisp and sharp at 60 Hz. Still waiting for games that can deliver true 4k and HDR.Price is high but compared to buying it in North America and lugging it all the way to India, the price is just right.Cons: I wish it had two display ports so that I could run both Gaming console and Computer on Display Port.10/10 in my books"
1,"It seems I've got a bad piece. There is backlight leakage from four different areas around the edges (see the attached image). At first, I tried to ignore it, but after watching 3-4 hours of Netflix, I noticed that light leakage was causing significant obfuscation of visuals in the affected areas. I have now requested a replacement and am hoping I'll get a substitute that is free of any defects. Will post an update about it. Other than light leakage, I am overall borderline satisfied with this piece. üòê**UPDATE (10.10.2019)**The replacement arrived this morning. And with it, frustration and apprehension. I received a defective piece originally, which got replaced by an even more defective piece üò° ü§¨. My mind just cannot grasp how it is possible for LG's Quality Control engineers to miss such defects during the testing phase, unless of course they deliberately ignored these faults. Please take a look at the attached images. The one marked ""Monitor No. 2"" is what I received in replacement. Even a 5-year old can take one look and tell that something's not right with the panel.I wonder if these big MNCs have completely abandoned all Quality Control checks from their operations. And it's not just me complaining; take a look at other monitor reviews on the internet, of not just this brand and model, but others too. Thousands of independent evaluators and users are reporting issues like severe backlight leakage, poor color reproduction, discoloration, and what not. Even Dell, the undisputed king of computer monitors a decade ago, is these days receiving flak from users for poor quality products. Shame on LG, Samsung, Asus, Acer, Dell, and all other manufacturers for selling defective products to unsuspecting customers. While we customers struggle with returns and refunds, they get to sit on their laurels and count our hard-earned money. Not fair. Poor quality control practices are a LOSE-LOSE prospect for everyone. The CUSTOMER loses his faith. The SELLER loses his business. MANUFACTURER loses customers' trust and profits. So, why do it?What now? For starters, I am not going to buy LG monitors anymore. Two failed products in a row is my threshold limit. I have neither patience nor money to waste on LG's junk anymore. I am also now totally apprehensive of buying any expensive products at Amazon because I am scared of putting myself through this tedious and uncertain process of returning/replacement/refund again. What if Amazon refuses to replace or return a defective product in future on some technicality in its policy? I'm starting to see disconcerting risk in it now. After many years, I am forced to reminisce the good old days when one could walk into a store; see a thing for what it is, touch it, feel it, use it; and if satisfied, order one for the household. In an email, I have appealed to Amazon to disclose return rates and/or other relevant data on product pages to enable customers to make informed decisions. This can also shame errant manufacturers into tightening their Quality Control checks. I hope Amazon's management will initiate positive and effective action in customers' interest.I have requested for a return of this defective monitor. As and when the process is completed and I have received my funds, I will post a final update. Until then, üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è."
5,"I have been splitting hair between 34 inch and 32 inch display. Having already used 32 inch monitor previously it was difficult for me to consider 27 inch. Interestingly there are way more options in 27 inch range. If you want IPS 4k panel, you will need 65k+ budget. In 34, if you go to 2k res it is again 68+k. I could see pixels in 32 inch full hd previously. Hence my criteria was 2k minimum with IPS. Frankly this was the only monitor that fits this criteria within budget. I am happy to report that with 2k res, everything is crisp. I love this ips panel, no light bleeding for me. Love the colors as well. You should know that this monitor runs at 60 H at 2K res and 75hz monitor at Full HD. This is NOT a 10 bit panel in case you were wondering. This is 8 bit panel and probably FRC to match 99% SRGB space. The monitor display is matt finish minimizing the reflection. The stand is sturdy and very well made. I did not like the HDR mode and prefer the standard mode. I bought this monitor for 25499 Rs. In USA this model is sold for much less(250 USD, 18000 INR). But that is the exact case for almost all monitor and electronic items. The monitor brightness is pretty good and i am running it at 77%. I like the dual controller where i can use the keyboard and mouse of pc1(hdmi1)to pc2(hdmi2). The box includes one hdmi and one display cable. The box delivered cleanly without any damage at all. The borders are really slim and that makes this monitor look beautiful. The matt screen floats front and the borders are inside the screen which looks so good. I have run the dead pixel and light bleeding test and happy to report my panel is flawless. I will use it for my office work and photo editing for which this monitor will be perfect. Remember 4k is going to be hard on your graphics card and 4k ips panels are crazy costly. So glad i got this finally. And if you are thinking about 34 inch dilemma like me do ask yourself is Full HD 34 ips or 2k 32 ips as they are similar budget. Attaching pictures to help you decide. Other reviews had not been helpful for me so i was in a doubt. I decided to make this review to help others like me. Get ready to spoil yourself. One thing i must note that when i connected external speakers via the headphone jack on the monitor the speakers were not very loud even at 100 percent, so i connected the speakers from the headphone jack from my laptop directly. One other thing is that the ports on the back is little flimsy as if you too much pressure to connect the HDMI, the entire port board seems to go inside, so just connect carefully."
1,"Quality is average,  dosent look like 10 bit hdr sceen. Blacks are not true black. ,the price is drop by 3k after Amazon August sale, this is frustrating and seller is clearly deceptive."
1,"After using one year:The monitor developed blind spots on all corners and the colors faded away. Many people reported this issue but I thought it was one of such issue. But not the case, this monitor not worth buying. Save your money on some other good one like Samsungs. Don't waster your money one this.Following is my initial review after purchase:This is the best monitor I have used so far. I was using Dell 24 inch full HD monitor and I want to upgrade to UHD just for the added real estate for my development environment. Here are some points I noted so far.- The monitor works only at 30 fps with HDMI 1.4 output on UHD. 30 fps means lots of blurryness and flickering. So if you need 60 fps output, make sure your system supports HDMI 2.0 or have displayport available.- If you are using Intel NUC, you may want to purchase mini-DP to DP conversion cable as NUC have only mini displayport.- The monitor comes with DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable & HDMI cable in the package.- The monitor can be tilted and height adjusted which is very convenient- HDR mode is just awesome, the colors popup and sharp- Since the edges are very narrow (near bezel-less), the size of monitor is same as my old 24 inch monitorSo overall, it is very good monitor and recommended for everyone."
5,"Bought monitor during non-sale time. Govt reduced gst for monitors. So price of the monitor gone down abit. I bought it for 34k and 1.5k cash back and zero cost 6 month EMI.Coming to the monitor, i always prefer LG monitors with IPS panel. My previous monitor was a LG IPS 24 inch monitor, which served me more than 3 years without any problems. Picture quality of this 4k panel is so good. 28 inch is perfect size for gaming. Played alots of 4k games with xbox one X, including RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2, witcher 3 etc. Colors pops up. Even though the peak brightness of the monitor is 450nits, colors pops with all HDR enabled games. Played horizon zero dawn PS4 god of war and so many PS4 games with HDR, and I am not going back playing SDR games. God of war looks phenomenal even with base PS4 with HDR enabled. If you are a console gamer like me who doesn't prefer TV, GET THIS MONITOR. Worth every rupee.There is small amount of bleeding in this monitor. Not noticeable generally.Overall, i am totally satisfied with this monitor."
3,Gr8 picture quality but too much of backlight bleeding in my monitor. Thought of getting replaced with new one but only refund is available. Loosing my offers now
4,"Packaging was good. Delivery was quick. Make sure you buy from Appario Business seller on Amazon.It was a surprisingly light weight box.My First Glance Review :1. I don‚Äôt think the panel supports HDR as Windows 10 refused to detect any HDR capabilities. HDR is listed only under effects as a kind of ‚Äúcolour filter‚Äù in the settings hence, HDR is not massively supported. This means, Netflix might not detect HDR capability in the display.2. Brightness is very good indoors and even 60-70% is more than enough. The display also has an anti glare coating (nowhere mentioned) which makes it worth every penny in a studio environment where I have a window at the back and flood lights everywhere.3. It‚Äôs a 75Hz panel that supports FreeSync1. Don‚Äôt expect smooth gaming but it is more than capable for office work, YouTube, emails, texts, media, etc.4. You‚Äôll love the real estate of the screen. It‚Äôs huge and Windows10 does a great job at scaling.Tip- Download LG‚Äôs OnScreen app to toggle modes on the fly.5. The all-in-one single button can feel a bit flimsy to use but it‚Äôs a nice implementation.6. The plastic body feels a bit cheap and scratchy however the brilliant display makes up for it.Overall, not amazing for gaming or for consuming HDR content but good for everything else.I‚Äôll update my review in a month to see if something changes."
5,"12 days review:Pros:* You get real QHD (2560√ó1440) resolution* Brightness is too good. Photo and video is shot at 5% brightness.* Good refresh rate. Videos at 60Hz runs smoothly.* Installation is super easy* Overall looks cool on my table* Video editing, web designing is a breeze with this IPS panel screen* 3 years of warrantyCons:* Doesn't have an inbuilt speaker. (Not a deal breaker)Haven't tested gaming yet, will update on AMD freesync and refresh rate once i run some games on this display."
4,"The monitor is really good and even the IPS glow/bleeding is minimal but I'm using it with a Macbook Pro M1 and the text is really blurry. I think that MacOS is not really detecting the OS, as it shows it as a 31.5 monitor, while its actually 27.Even the Onscreen Control app doesn't detect it. I'm waiting for an update from LG or from Apple.For now if you wish to use it with Mac OS, avoid it or look for a 4K monitor.Update:So I was able to update the LG onscreen control app. The laptop now works fine in full native resolution of 2560x1440 but there is not way to scale UI to 125%, so every thing is really small. Its something that Windows supports but MacOS only supports 200% scaling and that too on 4K displays.You can use SwitchResX to create a custom 1080p HiDpi resolution but it doesn‚Äôt work on new M1 macbooks, as of now 03-Feb 2021.Tried both display port and hdmi methods. No luck."
1,The LG 27UK650 Constantly flickers while watching Youtube and on XBOX ONE X...Appario Retail Private Ltd- Going to return it. Kindly replace this defective Monitor
5,"I researched a lot of monitors and narrowed to this and 32 inch from Lenovo. Both are quad HD. But this is way better - mainly with brightness and modes. Mine did not have any light bleeding or dead pixels - Luckily no issues.I went with Quad HD not only since 4k is costly, but you will need a Display Port to get higher than 60 Hz on 4k. My laptop only has HDMI. also having Quad HD is better than Full HD for my photo editing.Tips for work mode - I use with Reader mode and my eyes doesn't strain after few hours, like it used to do with my previous 24 inch. If you want really crisp text, set the resolution to Quad HD and then set the scaling to 200%. This way you can still work from 5/6 feet away and see clear text.Movies and videos are really vivid. Try some wildlife or sea related videos, you will really see the colors. I haven't tried gaming on this yet. But tried to set at 75 Hz and it is good.There are no individual buttons, but a single joystick like button to manage the settings. There is also OnScreen control software which you can download from LG website (there is nothing for this model, but you can install the software listed for some other model - it still works). For Windows OS, this is better than using joystick.With windows I found no issues. With linux usage, I found some screen tearing with intel drivers on Quad HD resolution (I'm still researching how to fix this)."
5,"I bought this monitor for 21.5k during lightning deal. Picture Quality is amazing. I use this monitor for 60% coding, 20% YouTube/Netflix, 20% Gaming. Overall very satisfied.Few good to have features that is missing:1. no height adjustment. So, you cannot keep your laptop in front of it and work.2. no usb C port. Need to buy Usb c to hdmi adapter for macbook.3. No inbuilt speakers. I connected my external speakers to TV using 3.5mm jack."
4,"Great Monitor...got this at 22999/- on great indian festival .... Using it for couple of days...First Impression : Wow , just wow... no edge bleed no dead pixel nothing everything is perfect... ips glow is balanced... HDR option is great but at 22k price what i got i am happy with it... bcs HDR is a pricy aspect... but you will be happy with it...Picture Quality: Is top notch... true ips panel with excellent viewing angle and color production ... true gem i can say...Display port cable and hdmi cable will be provided with the container .... so no need to worry.... just buy it without any second thought...  and yeah you can enable gsync with it... it has freesync version 2... so you can enable it with gsync via nvidia control panel...So Happy Puja... and stay safe and enjoy with your family and if you are a single like me then just enjoy by yourself üòâ..."
1,"Update Dec 2020:- After replacing display panel 3 times in just 2 months. LG replaced the unit in OCT 2020. Since then it is working fine. I will update review again if I face any issue. Also warranty is for 3 years not 1 Year which I assumed earlier.I have used Samsung, Dell and HP monitor in last 15 years. This LG monitor is worst. Cheap quality plastic has been used. Now the real issue. I have purchased the monitor in Sept 2019. After 2 months (Dec 2019). it started to show black line on right side. Since it was under warranty, Screen panel was replaced by LG.In March 2020, At the time when India (most of the world) is under lock down and we need to work from home. This LG Monitor stated to show red color in all four corners. As day starts it screen looks normal and as day progress red color started to spread and become darker. It is still in warranty so I will get it repair when lock down will be taken off.I didn't except 2 big issues in just 6 months of usage. I will push hard to refund or replace the whole monitor not the just part in it.Now my bigger concern is what will happen after 6 months when warranty will end. I think repair cost will be huge.PLEASE DONT BUY IT. EVEN YOUR ARE GETTING IT CHEAP UNDER ANY SALES & OFFERS."
5,"Bought this monitor on prime day sale and it's working flawlessly. Ppl who are saying it doesn't have HDR10 just bcz of 350 nits brightness they should get some hardware knowledge and can check this monitor specifications on LG website too. It's not a typical TN panel with 1000 nits brightness lol.So far it's working good , display and colour quality is gorgeous  , software is easy to use , multiple modes to suite your needs and many more."
5,"My unit has one dead pixel in the lower right corner when new.The stand is absolute rubbish. The monitor is always shaking, even while (for example) typing on a keyboard in close proximity.The panel itself (my sample at least) had minimal IPS glow and close to zero backlight bleeding. This was the major consideration to not return the monitor as there was never any guarantee that a replacement would not present those other issues.The colours are excellent and you get three- and six-colour adjustments which help get a more accurate presentation. The pixel pitch is just right for slightly older eyes - not so small as to make text hard to read, and individual pixels are just about indistinguishable at a couple of feet.The 75Hz limit is problematic for those looking for high-refresh panels, but this has no aspirations to gaming anyway, so it's a compromise. ARGB support is really the only thing that makes this uncompetitive with my Dell U3017, the colours are slightly off even with a wide-ish gamut. But that cost three times as much, so it's not a fair comparison."
2,"This was my first LG monitor(probably the last as well) and the first thing i noticed out of the box was the display was not calibrated as can be seen on the features page. So, took a while for me to set it up and trust me it was not easy. So, overall it was tedious process.The comes the backlight bleed test which was so uneven when seen from different angles. Primarily, the right half of the screen looked off which i assumed for IPS glow but then did some research, compared it side by side to some other IPS monitors only to find out this cannot be entirely IPS glow. This was a mix of IPS glow, backlight bleed and poor panel assembly. Hence, had to return it which was hassle free thanks to Amazon.The replacement was delivered the next day, and that was a complete disaster!! it was a used product with power on time of 37 hrs along with the issues listed above amplified which was quite obvious considering it was a used one. So, this is the first time facing this issue with the seller as its a reputed one and have previously purchased lot of products from this seller which were clean. So, not really sure what went wrong this time.So, coming to this product would say the build is good however the quality control by LG should have been much better. Would not discourage to go for it as all panels are not equally made so you never know you might get a good piece."
5,"Bought this for 27,000 Rs. The Monitor is an effective option at this price range for 32 inches as Acer is the only other manufacturer that decently prices monitors in India. Prior to this I had a 32"" Full HD Acer Monitor which was average. This monitor has a nice matte coating and its color reproduction is the best I've seen in an LG. No issues with PWM on low brightness. The viewing angles are good. There is no back light bleed on my unit or any dead pixels. Consider the speakers to be non-existent.The unit is very easy to setup after removing the packaging. Takes about three minutes to set it up. If your priority isn't FPS gaming or Art Editing, this monitor is probably the best 32"" choice you have in India as those two setups would anyway cost you more than a lakh. QHD is also a perfect resolution in this size for casual use such as office work, entertainment and gaming. 4K would be overkill and too graphic card and memory intensive at this point. The jump from 60 to 75 Hz is noticeably better though I didn't expect any change. As a film producer, I've seen and used a lot of professional equipment and know that this is a good purchase. Will give a 4.4/5"
5,"It works flawlessly with my PS4 pro with resolution set to max and HDR turned on without any hiccups. It has two HDMI Ports HDMI 1 & HDMI 2 you can easily connect PC in one port and console on other port and switch between them by pressing provided button going to input. It also have different kinds of display presets for gaming like FPS 1, FPS 2 and few other modes. You can customize as per your liking in the custom mode. It has audio jack just above DC adapter connection behind the panel. Through which you can connect your headphones/speakers without even needing the audio jack in the PC. Display is IPS, Res- 4K and supports HDR10, display latency- 5ms. So if you have a gaming PC or consoles like XBOX One X or PS4 PRO then this monitor would be your choice in this price segment."
5,"Using this for programming, video & photo editing.Very good colors, excellent balance of cost and quality for a 4K UHD computer monitor."
1,"Worst thing about this monitor is price bought it on prime day sale for 26k and current price is 24k....About screen - great viewing angles, good color reproduction... Its not true HDR, not meant for gaming... Bing problem is even FULLHD videos will not look great in this screen you need minimum 2k video.... For that u need good internet connection.... Love sports doesn't look best trust me even though I've 100mbps connection.... So consider these before buying"
5,"Let me begin saying that I use this 4K monitor as an external display for my 2018 MBP. The colors and contrast are just impeccable. I'm an engineer and a photographer by trade so I LOVE to see proper color reproduction and at the same clean, crisp, anti-aliased text when I am coding.The packaging on this is beautifully done! The product came in good shape and I haven't had any issues like other's complain. I'm sorry it has happened to you. Electronic items like these are a throw of dice sometimes.Anyhoo, right out the box the contrast, brightness and gamma didn't look that great so I tweaked the settings according to the lighting in my room to fit the bill. TIP: I try to match the display quality with my MBP's retina display to get that consistency. You could also go deeper into the color config of the monitor RGB's HS (hue and saturation) sliders if you want to ""fine tune"". If you are using this for your MacBook, please make sure you calibrate the display and create a profile for it (under System Preferences>Displays>Color).Cable management is neatly done behind the display panel I love how wireless my desk looks!Picture quality is rock solid. And for the price (~31-32k) it think it an amazing value for money. Also, if you guys are using MacBook Pro with this display, please buy a cable good enough to give you 60Hz frame rate on the Display Port (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07BBHCPXH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)"
1,"1. All HDR display flavours won't work except HDR effect, will not use vivid option in on screen support software from LG site2. When attached to type-c 4k 60htz the HDR video will stuck for fraction of second intermittently3. While using as a duan monitor with Lenovo yoga s740 or 750, the apps will crash with her enabled and with max resolution and dpi set to around 125%. I am sure about this testing because when I used 27UL500 on same laptops everything was stable.4. When split more is enabled for 4 windows then apps will flicker frequently.5. Using MS Teams for video or audio call in monitor screen will crash the application when it works fine on laptop main display itself and also work fine with LG 27UL500 model so offcourse it's ab issue with this monitor and it's compatibility with Lenovo yoga s740 4k ips laptop."
4,"I'm using this with a Ryzen 3700x and Geforce RTX 2070.Pros- Decent sharpness as you expect from LG- Stylish stand, thin bezels. Good for multi monitor setup- Color calibration is good for Photo/Video editing.- VESA mount compatible- Works with LG display software. Saves unnecessary button clicks.- Comes with both Display and HDMI cables.- Minimal branding. Great for aesthetics.- Audio outCons- Brightness issue. I have another 27inch LG27GL650F FHD monitor side by side and the brightness is lower compared to that. I had to spend a lot of time calibrating and trying out different profiles to reach an acceptable level of brightness. Problem seems to be in the firmware rather than the display itself.- Takes a lot of time to calibrate. Specially if you are connecting through HDMI, the brightness seems washed out.- Overpriced in India. Should not be more than 30-31K.- No G-Sync. Not suitable for competitive gaming if you have an Nvidia Card.- In FHD mode (125% zoom), icons gets pixelated. No super sampling.- Viewing angle is not that great this being an IPS panel. Expected better from LG.If you are looking for a 4K for media consumption, light gaming and decent Photo/Video editing, go for it. For anything more than that, you might want to go for a Samsung display."
2,"Best budget 4k @60Hz display for gaming(4k alert, RTX2080TI recommended), moderate lvl creativity(99% sRGB only) and HDR(entry level, but still very bright +350 nits, eyes strain alert). I was really doubtful about Indian stock quality after reading so many negative reviews. But I received a perfect screen with no back light bleed(as it should be). Although IPS glow(which is normal for IPS panels) is there and you might notice that in a dark room with a dark scene/image. But definitely not a deal breaker considering the selling price.Update: Display showing image retention issue. See pics. Selling lower quality monitors in India."
5,"I bought this monitor in sale in Nov/Dec 2019.It's refresh rate is advertised 60Hz but with it's cable provided and extra cables I had, it doesn't seem to work.After seeing review, I tried different cables,  USB type C hub etc etc.. but it didn't work as I expected and as it is advertised.What I tried:1. A dozen HDMI cable. USB Type C Hub.2. Provided HDMI and DP cable.Result:  Refresh rate at 30Hz with No HDR.  (See attached pictures).Expectation: Refresh Rate at 60 Hz with HDR as advertised here at Amazon or site.Advise: Avoid this  purchase if you are expecting 60 Hz and HDR as features on 4k.Oct 5, 2020: Sorry for creating confusion. My sincere apolise for above comments.1. It does support HDR and refresh rate 60Hz.My laptop supported HDMI 1.4 that's why it was not working. Buying a usb c to HDMI cable worked perfectly."
4,"This monitor works perfectly for office work and very light casual gaming.even if you are a moderate, it becomes extremely difficult to connect the monitor to your your PC as many PCs have different display ports like the mini display port, type c and HDMI. It is very difficult in India to find a reliable 4K converters for that matter even 4K cables. HDR in this monitor does not work that great so if you are looking for HDR effect then you will be hundred percent disappointed. The response rate of the monitor is fine.one more throwback for this monitor is that it does not get recognised as plug and play you have to manually download the software from LG website. I am using the latest version of windows 10 operating system but even then there is no plug and play."
2,"- The resolution is good but compatibility with various devices like firestick or even computers is not quite good. Cannot make the full use of the resolution.- Colors are not accurate straight out of the box. It is very hard to set it.- Menu/Software is not quite good to make the best use of the resolution. No manuals provided.- Headphone jack is of very cheap quality. Audio out of it is CRAPPY. There is also a small delay noticed.- Made of cheap plastic.- For watching TV, even 10K worth of TV would do much better.- Adaptive Response time is not quite good. Not smooth most of the time.- NO RETURN is so ridiculous. Forcing to keep a inferior quality product.- LG customer care of not quite prompt and does not sound knowledgeable."
5,"Best monitor you can buy in this price range. I wanted a QHD monitor since 4k is limited on content and need proper GPU to run smooth ( issue with office laptops). This monitor has excellent colors, contrast, viewing angles and ports. I got it for 25k and run great on 75Hz at 2k.HDR playback is also very good( tested on youtube), people saying you need 1000 nits for proper HDR need to check again since HDR has different standards. A reputed company like LG won't say its HDR without proper certification."
1,"Pathetic Seller he sold a defective piece and i had run behind LG for  getting it fixed. As per LG they will replace only with in 1 month of purchase and amazon also has the same policy so finally after repairing it, again with in 1 year of repair same issue resurfaces. now again i have to run behind LG. its been an year and not even a single apology or any concern from the seller. Always the same one liner we cant do anything its passed the replacement window from Amazon."
2,"The monitor is good if there are lots of bright stuff on screen and/or the room is well lit. Terrible backlight bleeding right from unpacking, not at all good for watching movies or anything with dark scenes or backgrounds. HDR is a gimmick at best on PC and doesn't work well, colors seemed washed out - you'd have to dig deep into nvidia settings and tweak to get a proper output for HDR content.Connects fine with HDMI but the display port does not support HDR. Xbox One detected HDR and switches to it while playing games or video."
4,"Orderd on 23 dec 20.Delivered 25 decide 20.Reviewed on 4 Jan 20.It is a good budget 2k (1440p) monitor. Received both dp and hdmi cable. Make sure while connecting your dp port don't have any part of cabinate coming out as obstacle for connection. Because the dp cable has larger connector part, otherwise you will see no display. Refresh rate is 75hz on 1440p resolution through dp cable, did not try on hdmi cable. Thankfully no dead pixel, no ips glow even in dark room. Also stand is not thay wobbly. Enjoying old games at 2k with dual core (pentium g4500) and r7 260x 1gb. Even crysis 2 is running good and 2k with highest setting. It has Freesync2 version and working great. No real hdr, it is just increasing brightness and adjusting the other parameter.Try contrast 60-70, brightness 50-57 to enjoy good colour and to protect eyes.Final verdict it is good to enjoy 2k gaming, watching movies for regular and casual user/ gamer."

4,"It's sturdy, reliable and good.Note that swivel is only 45¬∞ so if you want shift from landscape to portrait it's not possible. Otherwise it's a steal for the price.4 star coz I got a bit used product. But overall a very good product."
5,I was looking for a light weight LED screen to be connected to my shops DVR and finally I came across something with a known  brand name and at a favourable price. The Quality is VERY good - I have it connected to a HD-DVR system with full-HD camera. The control buttons very plasticy and frontech could have done better.
4,The price is a bit on a higher side. The company should lower the rates of the monitor and

5,Nice product. I am very interested in your product. I want to make a review this product in yutube channel. So I request you to give me a free sample of this product if you can.
4,Good quality
5,"This cover is perfect fit for the monitors. Because it doesn't have elastic in the bottom (like other covers online), and because it is stiched in a rectangular (cuboid kind of shape) mode - it fits very simply on top of monitor. If monitor cover is tight, tendency is to forget using it on monitor after work."
3,"I am reluctant to use this cover as the material is rougher than a gunny sack. With daily use, it would definitely leave scratches on the monitor.  To protect from dust, one have to compromise on scratches. A soft layer inside would've helped. Disappointing purchase."
4,Good enough for use. Design is bland. Serves the purpose

1,The order is partially delivered. There is no power adapter.
5,"suparb display, smart looking"
2,Screen bleeding is a major flaw. Both ordered and replaced product had this issue so returned it for refund.I suggest buy from local shop and check for bleeding before buying it.I bought a Samsung monitor from local shop which is 1.5k expensive but checked for bleeding issue before paying for it and also stand is more sturdy.But it also depends on your requirement and if your eyes can tolerate bleeding then you can go ahead with this product. For me it‚Äôs very annoying.There are people who believe that bleeding is a normal thing but trust me it‚Äôs a design flaw or damage product.For me paying so much money for a defective product gives no satisfaction rather pay a bit more and get a good product.Only take away from my review is that don‚Äôt settle for a monitor having screen bleeding even if it is minor.
5,"First of all, don‚Äôt mind the reviews about screen bleed issues reported, either they have got a defect batch or expecting too much from a 24inch monitor worth 8K. Has it got screen bleed? Only if you are looking for it, that too in completely black screen, nothing disturbing of that sort. If you‚Äôre looking for exceptional viewing experience spend more and buy an advanced monitor. With this monitor you get what you pay for and some.When I was booking the monitor there was deal of the day happening and the price was 8100 and when I ordered I got an instant bank discount of 800rs, so I got the monitor for 7300, which is a killer deal for this monitor.Coming to the package, it was really well packed, monitor was completely protected by thermocol and packed inside one. Very good packing. Mounting the monitor was just plug and play matter. No height adjustment. You get HDMI and VGA cable with it, I connected through HDMI cable, that should give a better viewing experience if you have got a good GPU. Power adaptor is also of good quality.I was using AOC 19inch monitor before and this sure is a big monitor and will get some getting used to. HD videos are splendid and games play rather well on this screen, this is not a gaming monitor, but for what you paid, you won‚Äôt be complaining.I did a monitor screen test online and this monitor passed the test with flying colours.Extremely happy with my purchase and I will update if any issue crops up."
4,"This is the best 75hz 1080p ips budget panel for now,But there is just one flaw that made me give this product a 4 star instead of 5, and that is the screen bleed,If you buy this monitor for more media consumption than gaming, you will definitely notice the screen bleed happening in this monitor and you can't do anything because it's an lcd panel.If you don't mind it then it's for if you're on a tight budget."
3,"I returned the monitor because of annoying backlight bleed of display but the replaced monitor was same issue. My first purchased monitor imported date was june 2020 and second one was april 2020 that means different production batch, but the same bleeding issue found. This is a series manufacturing defect I think.. may be I am more sensitive to light bleeding. But my old samsung monitor doesn't have this issue, still working....Pros: *Natural/realistic colour reproduction* trending new design* A+ grade energy star certified* Value for moneyCons: Noticeable screen Backlight bleed"
5,"Got this monitor for Rs.8300/- with amazon instant discount, Not gaming segment monitor but got it all. 1080p 75hz,IPS panel,AMD Freesync. No Complain."
5,Didn't have lot of expectation when I bought it. It was supposed to be my secondary monitor. But after using it for few days. I must say I am totally impressed and satisfied. Very soothing on eyes for long hour working and pretty decent for gaming.
4,"The screen is good nice viewing angles, good color accuracy, and you can customise according to your comfort,. The first thing immediately noticable is that the monitor cannot be tilted and its hard fixed unless you have a vesa mount. Then secondly you will see some screen bleeding at the top right and left corner area. Although its not much noticable when screen is in use but for people who are thinking of video of photo editing and gaming , might face minor difficulties with this. Overall good product and i recommend to buy this if youre on a tight budget. And yes it support 75 HZ 1920x1080 16:9 ratio resolution.  Great for casual gaming and office work not recommended for serious gamers or video editors and content creators.AOC please make the stand bend compatible and fix the screen bleeding issue."
5,The borderless finish is really impressive.I would say it to be the best product in this price range... As an IPS panel users may feel a bit of whitenning type of view comparing to a TN panel... I also purchased a same sized Dell IPS monitor of higher price & I didn't feel any difference between the picture quality...
5,"Best 75hz IPS display 1080p monitor at 8.5k budget.I was bit skeptical when I planned to buy this. But, then I compared lot others like LG, ACER,SAMSUNG then concluded with this.Believe me if I say this.. It's awesome. ü•∞Vivid displaySharp tones of brightness and contrast.Bezel lessAdded bonus - If you are looking for a vesa mount monitor this will look epic.Just buy it.! üòá"
5,"This is a fantastic monitor for your daily use. I am not a gamer, so cannot talk to it.  But excel, youtube , full HD videos and picture editing are crisp. Viewing angles are good. The IPS panel does the job for you. I am happy. Plus got it for Rs.7700 in the sale."
5,"Very good display.. whole body of the monitor is plastic but no complaints ""a value for money product""."
1,"I had high expectations from AOC and without any doubt I placed an order and got delivered within a day, thanks to AmazonHowever when I plugged in with my system I was disappointed what I saw -Screen bleeds everywhere for dark and grey backgroundsScreen bleeds becomes more prominent and annoying under low light.Placed return right away."
1,Never ever buy this product - No value for money. Worst product ever used as Monitor - There is no sharpness and clarity - especially the text appears weird on the screen. It causes discomfort while looking at the screen as the display is distorted.Another reason not to buy is that they offer only replacement and no return - one can imagine the trauma if you cannot return and buy another one.
5,"Best monitor in this price range, Am using it as external monitor for my laptop.. no bleeding or any issue detected in my piece by gods grace. Thanks to appario retail & Amazon ..."
5,Picture quality is excellent. Eyes will not strain even after using continuously for 10-12 hours of usage. Right choice for CAD applications. Base plate could have been metal/aluminium reinforcement. Overall very good FHD monitor.
4,WRITING THIS AFTER 3 DAYS OF BUYING ‚úåÔ∏èüëçIt has a screen bleeding issues ... But It's Looks only when black Background on screenPicture Quality AwesomeWall MountableHDMID.SUB... GOT IT IN BIG BILLION DAYS 8200 RUPEESSIDE FITTING IS NOT WELL ... BUT ITS NEGOTIABLE ... BUY IT ... IT WILL NEVER DISAPPOINT U
5,Just go for it in this price range. Picture quality is good. Also have sRGB and many mode for adjustment.AOC known for Monitors and did the job done.You barely get 24inch ips with 75hz monitor and also give two cables HDMI and VGA.I compaired alot and got it. And I'm satisfied for this purchase under 8.5k.üòÄ
5,"Value for money 200percent very good just go for it if you are going to buy a monitor under 10k the best one is this , i am very happy with this product display was amazing , better than my hp laptop really my phone not got photo clearly but monitor was amazing"
5,Best monitor at this price range and you can feel the difference between 60 and 75 hz if you have the eyes for it
5,I bought it for 7100 after using coupon and Amazon pay credit card.Picture quality is good. It takes little bit of time to get used to such a big moniter.As a programmer POV they screen size adds more space to work on. Recommended for people having budget under 8K-10 K
4,No speakers available. But picture quality is good.
5,"Every thing is goodLow cost 24"" best budget monitor."
4,Only one problem that i found is screen bleed. Picture quality is good. Average TFT...
5,It's really good and met my expectation.
5,Its Awsome
5,Wonderful for this price. Great picture quality. Blue light filter is available
5,Picture quality is nice. Default contrast value is 50 but have to reduce it if room is dark. Contrast and brightness can be further enhanced by using the bright frame.
5,"There's a bit of backlight bleed, guess that's okay considering the price paid. Overall pretty good."
5,Display is awesome... Stready well build.... Value for money product.....go for it.
5,Delivery is goodPacking is good and safeProduct is goodI am satisfied with this
5,Sharpness is really good. Colours are vibrant. Light weight.Cons: Flimsy stand needs more Rigidity
4,Picture quality is good. Thin bezel. Reasonable price.
4,Monitor is showing 'no signal'  and I don't know where to raise a complaint. Amazon please help
5,"great and cheap, with thin bezels. other similar monitors cost upwards of 10k even at stores."
3,Dislike: There is a lagging Picture in HD quality videos
5,Value for money.Antiglare panel.
5,"I was looking for a monitor for the past 2 years to match my desk decor. Thanks to AOC it blended perfectly well. With three sides frameless, it looks as if it was custom-designed to fit my workspace as you can see.  Not to mention the picture quality and ease of connectivity. I am now enjoying long working hours without any eye fatigue."
5,I was a bit sceptical as there was not enough reviews on this monitor but when ahead and bought it as it was the cheapest 24inch IPS display. I bought it for 8700 on lockdown period.Pros- Text is crisp (good for coding)- 75hz screen- Good screen quality (according to the price)Cons- The stand is a bit flimsy.
5,"One word = Top class monitor in budgetPros: Super display, best brightness, 75hz on hdmi is great, no bleeding at all, blacks are deep alsoCons: plastic body, no internal speakers, made in china like all others"
5,Best product
1,"I have purchased this monitor two times and returned, I feel the following in respect of this...(1) The resolution of this monitor is FHD which is not sufficient for any 27 inch monitor. if you want to buy 27 inch monitor its  resolution must be 2K or more than it.(2) The most annoying thing is that both time the monitor which i was received, It was already registered at DELL site for warranty and it was started 6 month before. Thanks to Amazon customer care for there quick support and help for returning this items.(3) I was facing eye strain and my eye became red due to long hour siting in front of it, It is not safe for eye also."
5,Very nice
4,"I got this for my 27 inch monitor. It fits snugly and the material is also good. I got the black color one. I got it for Rs 350, I think 300 is a more fitting price for this."
5,Good quality Monitor cover.I encourage  to everyone to buy this.thanks.
3,I thought it was full cover. But it seems to be like half cut in back side.
1,I want to return it and and make the refund fast.
4,Cover really stops dust whenever we leave monitor unusedMaterial is good
4,Very Good
5,"Nice product,  good quality! You must have if you have 27""."
5,It‚Äôs an absolute must have
5,"This review is for the 28 inch 4k CB282K. Been using it for 2 days so far and its a reeeeallly good display. Blacks are as deep as you can expect from an IPS display - very minimal backlight bleed (unnoticeable 99% of the time) and excellent colour accuracy all around. It came supplied with a colour calibration data from the factory with delta E less than 2 but they failed to mention what mode (sRGB? USER? Standard?) mode they calibrate under. Even without custom calibration with a Spyder or a Colormunki the colours are to the T when compared with my other calibrated monitor. sRGB does look a bit off though - slightly washed out and oversaturated.  HDR isn't great but one can only expect so much from a 300 nit peak brightness and edge lit display. Still does add a solid punch to HDR games / videos though when activated in Windows. The speakers - just mute them off and do yourself a favour.Overall a solid buy if you don't mind the lack of usb ports. Would highly recommend - especially at a steal price of 27000‚ÇπUpdate : Calibrating the monitor with a Spyder Elite gives me a delta E of around 1.4 with an excellent 2.2 gamma. Colours are mostly on point but for red, black and green which shift off more than delta E of 2 but still lesser than 3Update : 6 months now and the monitor works just as good as it did when I bought it"
5,"I was searching for a monitor since very long time as it's really hard to find a 16:10 monitor in the budget. I came across this and checked around the other review sites and voila, it was a great deal.If you are familiar with an aspect ratio of the monitor then you probably know that monitors have switched from being predominately 16:10 (typically 1,680 x 1,050 or 1,920 x 1,200) to 16:9 (usually 1,600 x 900 or 1,920 x 1,080). This is to cut production costs by tying them in with flatscreen TV manufacturing which also supports a 16:9 aspect ratio. As you can see from the above resolutions, you lose a considerable amount of vertical screen real-estate with 16:9 compared to 16:10.Pros:- Extra vertical real estate- matt finishing screen- Vesa mount- Built quality is really great- Brightness and picture quality is excellent- Very budget-friendly as you might pay up to double to it' price for other monitors with same 16:10 ratio- Good for graphics usageCons:- Speaker is decent but not enough for sound.- It's not bezel-less. There is a very thick bezel almost around 1 inch.- No VGA port is available. you have to use either HDMI or other display ports available in it.Overall it's a very nice monitor and people like programmers or graphic designers can use it efficiently for long hours without affecting their eyes."
4,"Its an amazing product. I got this as n upgrade for my laptop screen. This supports 4k 60 Hz. The screen is LED which bleeds a little bit in the dark but once you reduce brightness then it is okay.PROs :1. Support HDMI 2 and DP 1.2 : The HDMI cable supports 4k @ 30Hz. May be that is the issue with my laptop HDMI o/p. Its running GTX 1050 4GB model, 16GB DDR4 2600Mhz with Core i7 7700HQ. Anyway, I plan to order  a DP cable and test it. Update: DP cable worked like a charm. I am getting HDR and 4k@60hz enabled via windows. The included HDMI cable doesn't support the process. Go for a DP cable.2. HDR support. It does support it. the peak brightness is bit low at 300/400 nits so the HDR is not amazing but it is there. Windows doesn't recognize the support though. May be I need to install a hardware driver.3. Speakers are fine enough. I do not use them but they are there.4. You can calibrate the colors as you want. Supports sRGB space.5. You do not need any screwdrivers to set it up. It latches well. Set was literally 2 mins.6. It can swivel 90 degrees and can move up and won by a feet or so. It can tilt as well.Cons :1. The colors are not accurate enough for movie production works but at this price point none of the displays do.2. Company has not provided the details on the SRG colour markers. They look bit washed off. HDR works fine."
4,"The one I recieved was a November 2018 manufactured monitor. The manufacturers seal was broken on one side of the box and I was skeptical as I opened the rest of the packaging. Everything was fine and as new inside with no signs of cosmetic wear. The really good thing about this was that Acer included all three cables - DisplayPort, HDMI and DVI and this was really great as one of my devices supports only DisplayPort. As expected the Pivot, Tilt and Height adjustments work as intended and the cable management slot can comfortable fit all your cables at once. I'm really happy with this purchase."
5,"I researched a lot to buy a good 27-28 inch monitor. For 27+ inches monitor, going for atleast 2k or 4k resolution is a must in my opinion.Pros of this monitor:1) Height, tilt adjustable2) Price3) 4k resolution4) Display: Good colour saturation and great viewing angles.5) 3.5mm audio output port and decent inbuilt speakersCons:1) No usb hub2) Comes with a 16A plug. Not a con, but I had to buy a 6A-16A converter to plug it.In conclusion, without any doubt, working professionals or developers or light gamers can go for this."
5,"Have been using this monitor in last 2 days. Very good monitor at 27k. Using this for office work and in free time I plan to use it for entertainment purpose. I can view 4 documents and multitask with ease. Sharing the screen during teams call requires us to Zoom in so that the fonts/words are visible to others. The speakers are ok for entertainment purpose. Haven't tried my hands on gaming, but I feel it will not disappoint. The 4k clarity is amazing. Not sure about power consumption for a daily 9hrs use of office work. The stand and build quality is good. There is no plastic bezel on 3 sides, however the glass has very thin black bezel which is negligible and the bottom side has thick silver plastic bezel which I also use to tilt/swivel this huge screen as per my seating/viewing comfort. Overall it is a good addition for work from home & home entertainment purpose."
5,"I got this monitor after a lot of research for 4K monitors.  I use this mainly for work and occasionally for photo editing.  The image quality is very good, and three side narrow bezel design make the monitor look good too.  I use this with my Mid 2014 Macbook Pro with an MDP-DP cable.  I had trouble driving the monitor over HDMI as the laptop doesn't support a 4K monitor officially.- Exceptionally good display quality- Good brightness and natural looking black- Different user settings based on your usageCons:- Take a few seconds to start up- Speaker ouput is very flat.  I don't recommend using this as the primary audio output device"
5,"Firstly, I bought this Monitor for PS5 even though I didn‚Äôt had it at that when I bought it but now I have it and Ohh man this display looks beautiful.I was use  it with my laptop for regular use. It has many modes on it and I generally use it in user settings where I use about 30 brightness and 25contrast and that is more than enough for me.Whenever I see movies or play games on Ps5 I just put it in HDR mode and the brightness and contrast increases automatically and that‚Äôs the real thing to look for.As an IPS panel this has screen bleeding which is normal. I have it on all 4 corners , you will see it mostly when the screen is fully dark . Otherwise you won‚Äôt see any screen bleeding. Check out the pictures I have attached those are while hdr is on.It has inbuilt speakers that sounds just so normal, my phone‚Äôs speaker is more better than thisüòÑRatings: 7.5/10This is a good monitor for budget around 26-27k."
5,"An excellent product, I bought it specifically for it's versatile and solid build quality. I was impressed with the picture brightness, the extra pixels definitely is a big factor in the Picture quality.The stand is the biggest plus, it is so sturdy and able to rotate the monitor in all 4D directions.Speaker is decent for everyday office use.It came with an amazing bunch of cables, which average users like us don't even need. I beleive the cable itself was worth 2,000Don't be fooled by other sleek looking model. This is the best 24 inch monitor in the market."
5,"This is the first time I am writing a genuine review about a product on Amazon. I have purchased this monitor twice for two of my places. Let me tell you that this is an amazing screen, gives you ultra comfortable viewing experience, it is light on eyes and is just supremely awesome. The sound level is not that high but you can always connect a speaker to it via aux cable. If you are looking for something to comfort your eyes for you have some reading or other work on laptop, it is the best choice, please go by my words, it is simply the best."
5,"I am using this display with Mac, the display quality and colour calibration is very good. Plenty of adjustments for every user. The tilt, height and angle adjustment is good. Brightness is decent for most users, with good Antiglare coating. The sound quality of built in speakers is nothing much to speak of. Certainly a very good IPS 4k display, comparable to more expensive models."
5,"It has a lot of connectivity (DVI(w/HDCP)/HDMI/DP/USB-hub/Audio-IN/ Audio-OUT). Great for professional and programming work. The one I received is manufactured in March 2020, not in 2018, as mentioned in some old reviews.Minor issue:Audio quality is OK but not great, which is useful though in special situations. DP of the monitor can take Audio-IN through itself. When DP is connected analogue audio-IN is disabled internally. In my Linux system DP is not transmitting audio through it and as the analogue audio-IN is disabled, I can not feed audio to this monitor. However, I have tested that in Windows 7 audio over DP worked. Probably analogue audio-IN will work with DVI input only (yet to be tested). An option for manually selecting audio input channel would have been very useful.For Acer: If customer end firmware upgrade is possible for this monitor, please provide us an updated firmware with this feature."
5,"I choose it because of height adjustable option and I get what I needed.Pros1) It's Built quality and stand really good.2) Brightness and picture quality is really good.3) I recommend it for professionals who spent 6 to 8 hours daily in front of computer screen.4) it's good aspect ratio and wuxga relects in picture quality. For same to get in other we need to pay nearly double of its cost.Cons :1)  speaker is not enough.2)  doen't come with VGA Option.3) will get 2018 model, which I think company updated with latest B247WL.Overall as compare to cost, built and picture quality it's worth."
3,"The monitor is Good, but bit costly w.r.t features and quality. Wait for offers to buy it, otherwise not value for money you pay.but poor quality plastic used. Lack of USB hub and port feature is a big minus of the monitor at this price.Resolution and its brightness and its all direction movement with pivot are its big plus. speaker volume is just OK for meetings for single viewer and small closed room.Monitor cost with 22-24K price could be good."
4,"Good anti-glare screen with and height adjustable stand and 4 port USB hub, but the bezels are uniformly thick all around and same size as the bottom bezel. The pictures show very thin bezels on the top and side and thick one only at the bottom but that is not the case. The speakers are almost useless because a phone speaker sounds louder than these. Also the screen rotation to portrait mode is only clockwise and not in both directions."
5,"I don't know if many know the USP of this LCD is it's aspect ratio of 16:10 not the regular 16:9. Folks who know what it is will understand. Rest all can get cheapo 16:9 consumer models.Only downside some might think is it's almost 1"" thick bezel. Not an issues with me though."
5,Been using this for last 3 months. Works fine. It acts as minihub as well as I could connect my Wireless mouse/keyboard adapter. The type C works fine. With this setup I only have to connect / disconnect my different laptops and the workstation comes alive. Only word of caution is check your laptop's battery wattage and the monitor's before purchase. Mine is Dell laptop and does a slow charging because of the mismatch.
5,"Good One, QHD resolution, has one Type C port, two HDMI, one Display port, one 3.5 mm audio jack and three USB A ports. Work very well as of now. Color accuracy is great, Different display modes are present, looks very neat design. Overall I am satisfied with the purchase."
5,The monitor is fantastic. I use it for office work as a second display for my laptop. Initially I was leaning towards a 1080p resolution display which was obviously cheaper but the extra money is definitely worth it.Picture quality is excellent and the pre set colour schemes are great. Ofcourse we can customise as well.It‚Äôs height adjustable mechanism and tilting features with 2k resolution makes it a winner in this segment.
5,"There are not many options in 1920x1200 resolution, and this monitor is one of the value of money options. Display quality is good, there are enough port options to connect, and it has built-in speakers. It is a little thicker on the edges compared to some other monitors, but at the price, it is a good buy."
2,"This *was* an outstanding monitor, for its time. After doing a very detailed research into this monitor and looking thru reviews, data sheets etc, I've decided not to purchase this. This monitor series (B6) dates from 2012/2013 when it was introduced. Acer has moved on to B8 series now and old garbage is being dumped in India."
5,"This best suited my Mac Mini M1. Only the plastic border at the bottom is of normal quality, if you ignore this one. I feel this is the best monitor in the price range."
5,"I would say this is a must have for any serious multi-app users. The picture quality is amazing and response is very good. The one change Acer can give is the ability to lower the monitor still further along the desktop mount, but this is not a big issue. It's a great product to for productivity boost."
1,"comes with 16A pin, no normal extensions or ups has 16A socket to connect.Its even harder to search 16a converter"
3,Good monitor but speaker are not that good
1,The colour temperature is changing randomly
5,"I love the monitor, perfect for work. Love the height adjustment rig."
2,"There was gap between the screen and the lower border, have requested a replacement, will see how the replacement monitor turns out."
5,"Provides all that required cables for different types of connection and best part of, it is height adjustable."
2,You can easily get a better monitor with this price range
5,Its a good monitor for the price and got it couple of days earlier too. Thanks @Amazon
5,Good quality
4,"Great screen.Few of things to know:> The display quality is great. No backlight bleeding, colors and backlight are good.> The stand isn't as easy to maneuver compared to other screens I've used (like the ThinkVision) - it tends to take a little more effort to tilt or adjust height. It's not a dealbreaker, but something to know.> If you use USB-C to connect your laptop, the same cable charges the laptop, connects the display, and the speaker on the monitor.> The monitor does have a speaker but the speaker quality isn't good."
5,Good display quality only speakers are little weak point.speaker should have been little loud in my opinion. otherwise it's good.
3,Is usb c play some music & videos directly?someone plz confirm it so that I can purchase it.thanks all.thanks amazon.
3,"Nice monitor for HDMI to HDMI connection, for VGA its worst, no details for the cable provided inside box. I took this with the intention of VGA TO VGA cable, but HDMI received inside the box.And Amazon have no answer on this.Regarding the features shown..like On Screen Control, this features not supports ir not avilable with this. Even if you check LG support page you will not find any of firmware or Application for this feature.Both LG and Amazon dnt have answer on this. It's like they cheated on this feature because on the basis of same I purchased this from Amazon.Amazon team again I request you to resolve this issue or take back this Monitor."
5,"Nice and meets my expectation.!! Don‚Äôt expect a very high end monitor but significantly better than other mid-range monitors. I‚Äôm using it as my 2nd display for my home office and it meets my requirements. Love LG split screen feature, so, I can have 2,3,or 4 displays in this monitor at the same time. Has HDMI & VGA ports and you get HDMI cable along with power cord with the package.Only drawback is that its height can‚Äôt be adjusted."
5,Nice product.
1,"Its just the same one (Samsung) that I've already. So want to return. Please, need to buy a 22 or bigger piece.Though description as 19.5""., it's not that much, and not much height also; it's bluffing, the height is from base actually[from the stand !!!] my old one 12 yrs. old Samsung monitor is pefectly good, just I wanted a big monitor, but fooled."
1,"None of the features mentioned in the description are available. Completely wrong description by amazon.like On Screen Control, this features not supported with this monitor, no software CD in box. Amazon cheated on this feature. No VGA cable received in box. Amazon team can I request you to resolve this issue."
1,Got delivered with a deep scrach as in the attached pics. Returning the monior.  Will update the review and rating after delivery of the new monitor.
4,"Monitor does its job as an extended screen for my laptop. Display is good. Assembly is simple. The only complaint I have is that the screen tilts slightly forward after assembly. Its very slight,  but I am used to vertical or even inclined back display. So I just use a notebook below the stand to get the angle I prefer. They should have put an incline adjustment for this price.  Overall its good."
4,the picture quality good not great like samsung monitor if u have a budget 5 to 6k go for it Samsung monitor it is ok  monitor one thing i liked in this monitor  HDMI port  and audio port HDMI cable included in the box
1,"On your search column I had requested for a TV SET but your displayed Monitors as well. Having no idea about a Monitor, I thought the same to be a TV. As such Monitor is of no use and request to replace it with a TV even if the cost is upto Rs.7500/-.J.Sethi"
4,Panel opened in power but side. But it's work good.. panel damaged
2,"It works as it is intended for. But worth to mention that, it is backlit and you won't be able to see anything if you don't sit straight to it, a slight variation  of angle even make hard to see the display. Built quality is not so good rather average one and the money they are charging for this is too much. It is not value for money product."
4,"Got the product in 4 days of Order. The product quality is good in price range. However, i only got HDMI cable, LED stand and Power cable. Wall mount is missing in the package. I purchased it around Rs. 5,400. Good LED at this price point.Also no cost EMI option for 9 months is an advantage with lot of Credit cards to choose from."
4,Certainly value for money. 2 weeks since I purchased. Good to be used as an extension monitor. Not good for high resolution image or video.
5,"Product comes from LG, so was expecting a good one and got one as per expectation. Dislike is that did not include the VGA cable even when it says it comes as part of the package. Didnt get the CD as well but that I think is OK as it just plug and play.Rating is for the product, not for amazon."
2,I bought the new one but to my disappointment the product seems to be renewed and not original as the whole frame came out although screen not damaged. I fitted the frame but it doesn't seem to be ne.
4,"TV delivered today without remote. Am not sure if we purchase TV, can't we get a remote along with TV. Am surprised to get this delivery without remote. also no volume is coming"
1,The display quality is too poor.HD has to be deleted from the description.Amazon has to seriously think of rating the products to save logistics costs by return of goods
5,"Very good product, picture quality is very good, monitor is slim, power cable has built in adapter."
5,"Needed this monitor for dual screen setup with laptop.Working perfectly with my lenovo laptop.Very easy to install.Bought this only for office work, watching lectures and TV shows.Definitely it is a steal deal!!!"
1,Very worst product no inbuilt speaker and not mentioned and no replacement also very very very bad poor response from amzonProduct details are not given properly.
3,"Very light weight,  and very delicate"
5,The tv has come without a remote so can‚Äôt use ..help how to get the remote
5,Good product
5,Very good
4,Ok
5,Awesome product
4,Viewing angle not good bcoz of TN panel...! VGA cable not there in the box! Only HDMI and power cable was there! Please arrange Vga cable for me
2,I have not received the wall mount with the product as it is given in the details.
4,Nice product
4,Overall good Monitor in the price range
1,"Such a poor resolution, it is not LED. Such poor colours, pure wastage of money. Completely disappointed"
4,Good product at good price..  as usual amazing speed delivery by AMAZON !!
4,Like
3,This is very basic
1,Simple monitor - none of the features mentioned in the description are available. Completely wrong description by amazon.
5,picture quality
5,Super
3,Not as good screen quality as wanted from hd
1,Worst product return this item no replacement return to refund please
4,No wall mount included as mentioned in specifications
3,"Sharp images, vivid colours, responsive monitor. It's a gorgeous IPS panel (anti-glare). This packages a premium experience for a not-so-premium price.My qualms:The monitor wobbles a bit when using the buttons, so be mindful of that.There is a significant amount of IPS glow under low light conditions. If that bothers you, look for a non-IPS panel.In general:Ideal for desk usage. Stand won't swivel so usage is restricted to the horizontal mode. You get the standard port setup - 1 VGA, 1 HDMI. It'll get the job done for the average user. I believe it's an 8-bit, so professional photo editing is not the ideal use case.Setup from the box is ridiculously easy. The quick setup manual's pretty helpful in case you get stuck."
5,"Those who are looking for WFH or Study purpose go for it blindly as we have multiple option on display settings to adjust your own requirements.I would like to reiterate on Display clarity which is best in class and comes under great pricing. HP always rocks and gives their customers what they need!Special thanks to Amazon for the best package, I have never seen such kind of packing for any of the orders I have placed before üëçüèª"
5,It is excellent. Built quality is very good. Looks elegant and display is also good. Better than Taiwan companies like AOC and Benq
5,"The monitor from HP has amazing appearance. Thank u Amazon for lightining delivery , I got the package on very next day of order."
2,"There is no inbuilt speaker or atleast head jack , even it is not possible to return this item"
1,"Not good for WFH, Causes Eye fatigue. Picture colours are also very artificial."
5,"My first high refresh rate monitor & im not familiar with high ref. monitors but when i heard about this bad ass! i thought she is the one and only one who will suit me... ppl says those speakers were suttle i dont think so... i sold my 5.1 surround coz this speakers were enough for me and my room!Go for this and worth the buyingQuality wise there is some build issues but we are not going to use this for trekking, its going to seated in a corner of our room right!and first I got a unit with dead pixel later I returned it within the return period and got a good unit and this review is almost a couple of months later and yes still I love her !"
5,"Where do i start from, it uses AU optronics panel which is much better than panda panel, Colours out of the box are perfectly calibrated, very vibrant, My unit has almost zero noticeable ips glow, monitor gets very bright enough and it‚Äôs eyeCare technology makes proper use of that sensor which adapts screen brightness and temperature. Im using this with my rtx 3070 with dp cable and yea gsync works when you enable it in nvdia panel. Box was perfectly packed and sealed. Go for it, you won‚Äôt regret. Overall it feels and performs premium it has better stand although bit bulky."
5,great for gaming nd watching movies i personally recommend buy at around 18500 gud for this price u get great deal
5,"Picture quality is awesome, display is bright enough I'm using at 80%.Build quality is good.There are no issues in the display penal i received.Can refresh at 144hz through both hdmi and display port (hdmi cable only inside box).Inbuilt speakers are average, good sounding for built-in speakers.HDR is meh, sometimes is looks good, sometimes ok.Auto brightness feature is cool, works as intended.All in all its a good monitor for under 21k with premium features like amd free sync premium, also supports nvidia G sysnc (only works through display port cable)."
5,Console gaming monitor 10/10. Not all monitors support high frame rate compatibility with consoles this one does officially and excellent for the purpose . Other tasks are done perfectly as well . With a screen time of 15 hours at stretch no strain on the eyes surprised.
5,Picture quality is good with 99%srgb and 1000:1 contrast... The au Optronics pannel is high in quality.it is best for gaming with 2ms gtg and has 3 ama modes i found 1ama works great. Fr fast fps games.it is suitable for playstation player too.HDR is just an filter and not tru hdr.Light sensor works greatSupport 144hz thr hdmi too.Free sync primium support and gsync through dp cable..
5,Display gets pretty bright and is also color accurate. I'm using this for casual FPS and Netflix. It has hdri mode which I find lack luster along with the inbuilt speakers. But otherwise it's a solid display. Build quality is good too.
5,This benq ex2510 monitor is great for competitive gaming. It has lot feature and someone of the features are worst like low blue light filter and especially HDRi. HDR in this monitor is like colour filter. This monitor is lot better compared to other monitors in this price range (for competitive gaming). I really love it.
2,"Bought this monitor after a lot of research. But it did not mention anywhere that you need a 16 amp power outlet, the one that you need for microwaves and A/Cs. Even 55in TVs use 6 amp plugs. The funny part is the monitor's power input location indicates that it needs the standard 1.6 amp"
5,"5 star productGood colors, Good design, High refresh rate, great for PS5.Fully satisfied with the monitor."
5,This product is best for 1080p gaming by a mile. The ips panel gives 99%srgb color scale. The in built speakers are average‚Ä¶ not that great but they do the average job. Dont use it as a TV i would say. 144hz with amd freesync gives smooth display. Although its not g-sync certified u can enable it thru nvidia control panel using a display port. Tbh i researched a lot before buying this monitor and i can say it exceeded my expectations.
5,"I suggest you watch the review by Hardware Unboxed channel on YouTube.In summary this has the best pixel response time ~4.5 ms. The refresh rate is truly 144 hz!Only concerns are -1. A bit expensive, 17K should be the ideal price2. The panel only has 100% sRGB gamut coverage"
1,Picture is often smudged. Huge stuttering issues that is evident even with adaptive synch on and off. Tried all the picture modes and nohting could handle the darker black shades. Don't buy this .
5,Superb
4,Perfect monitor for gaming and everyday work. The swivel and tilt function is very good. Just if it could have more io ports I would have given 5 stars
4,"Monitor arrived with a stuck blue pixel, visible only on black screen. Ordered for replacement, arrived after a lot of days, only this time it was a dead pixel, overall not a good experience, ordered for refund."
5,My review for BENQ MOBIUZ 24.5I am using it for 1 month now. Its awesome experience for me you should go for it. And thanks to appario retails for perfect product.
5,Best monitor for full hd 144hz gaming
5,Got a defected product. Successfully got it replaced within 3 days. Thank you Amazon for this wonderful effort and product.
5,This is a good 1080p display which is good both for content consumption and gaming. If you are in a strict budget fo 15k INR .. Go for it !!
5,"Best Monitor For Both Gaming And Productivity Use. Great Display, Colour Accurate With 144Hz Refresh Rate."
5,So far it is the best 144hz ips monitor.But it could have been cheaper.
4,Totally worth the money.
4,Excellent monitor. It only lacks more I/O options otherwise would have been perfect.
5,I wanted to have a good monitor for my design and gaming work and it turned out the way I expected.
5,Perfect Monitor for gaming
5,Beautiful display. Very much satisfied.
5,This monitor is awesomeNo doubts
4,Just got a two days back. Amazing built quality. Nice screen. Hopefully lasts long.
4,Speakers not as good as mentioned....but ok for normal use.
5,Excellent Monitor...
5,Excellent for gamingAuto hdr respectable speakers
5,Best Gaming Monitor
5,good stuff
5,"Really really great monitor. Great blacks. And probably the best contrast ratio(4000:1) in the under 15k category.Con: whites aren't as perfect.(but most monitors under 15k and maybe 20k are like this)Also recommendation to everyone reading: it's not worth buying a 24inch monitor that's 1080p. Go for a 22inch 1080p. It's the same reason 6inch phones need 1080p. The pixel density makes a real big difference. Also,Va displays have the best contrast ratios and much better response times than ips. After doing lot of research you will find that modern VAs are the best choice. And this Philips one is truly worth it.Philips seems like the best deal here."
5,"Coming from LG, lenovo and dell IPS montiors, this little monitor is phenomenal. It has replaced my current 27 inch 2k monitor as my primary display for work.The resolution is 'good enough'. The monitor brightness can be reduced quite a lot and doesn't hurt my eyes. It is vesa mountable which is unthinkable at this price.I really love it."
5,"Better than any IPS monitors available for same price range. Also note 75Hz refresh rate. Though not much of a difference, still you can feel it while gaming. And the transition of colour Is so smooth and eventual that it feels like live change. Philips simply rocks. I want them to produce more and more quality products like this.I liked the black and white mode in the settings!"
5,"The monitor has a slim profile, it's a VA panel display which is between IPS and TN and that's good in a way for multipurpose use. Philips provides both VGA and HDMI cables in the box, thumbs up for that. Overall all I got this for a steal deal of 6.2k and it's worth every penny...You can buy this without any hesitation."
5,The monitor looks very beautiful with thin edges. I highly recommend.
5,would recommend to buy
2,Malfunctioning....
4,No doubt Phillips at his best and one of the oldest brands in India
4,"Refresh rate is not 75 hz ,its 60 hz."
4,Good one for the price range
5,"Philips name is assurance for good quality.some people think that va panel is not good,they should see this va panel monitor.this monitor will change their opinion."
3,"I have 2 27inch 4Kmonitors, Samsung and LG.Samsung monitor is fine.The LG monitor, it doesnt support the wait. The hydraulics starts to slump and the monitror sits on the table.I think its a weight issue.I want to know if I can replace for a heavy duty model?"
5,"+ Very compact, declutters my desk+ I was able to make a small adapter to have the left-side VESA interface hold my laptop+ I separately bought a non-VESA adapter for my Samsung monitor+ Cable guides conceal the wires well.+ Good response gas springs for moving the laptop and monitor around- Load bearing is lower than 6.5 kg (my monitor weighs 5.7 kg, and is already overweighing the spring tension)- The surface area of the clamp is very low, so it scratches/indents the table surface. (I have added wooden pads both above and below the table between the table and the clamps to distribute load on the table better)"
5,"I researched quite a few dual-mount stands. I was looking for a stand that offered me flexibility to adjust along X, Y and Z axes. Based on my research, the Amazon Basics and Rife stands came up short in that regard.This stand is quite sturdy. The clamp into the desk feels secure. The monitors do not seem at risk of falling (I have a 24"" and a 22"" monitor).The stand has built-in cable management, so the desk looks clean and clear.Keep in mind: the monitors are screwed directly onto the arms rather than onto plates that are then inserted.The mount comes with instructions on how to install. However, I did not find videos online on how to setup. Those would have been helpful. E.g., I only realized by accident that the arms had built-in cable management.If you are looking for a dual mount that offers you the flexibility to tilt, swivel, rotate, bring closer, move higher, go for it. For quite some time I contemplated between this one and the Amazon basics mount. I'm glad I went for this one.I have no trouble recommending this mount."
5,"Before buying i was confused because of no reviews when i purchased, But now i am very happy with product and its quality.I have  27inch,  24inch monitor and its able to hold both of them easily.Movement are very smooth i can rotate, move up/down, left right with only one hand, also.Overall very nice product, i recommend to other also.Thank you"
1,"The worst product, 5k for this crap don't buy it, horrible build quality, trust me it's the worst don't waste ur money on this crap."
5,Easy to install..not much efforts required to Mount it...worth buying it.
5,"I got this in July so I have had about 3 months to try it out. I use it with two 24 inch monitors from Lenovo and it works just great.I keep moving the monitors around and the movement is smooth and easy. No problems there. I installed it on one table initially and then reinstalled it on another. Installation was easy.The cable management is amazing. Along with what I've done with the monitors, there's just one cable that comes out of the base clamp.The only thing I didn't like was the clamp itself. It should've had some sort of rubber/silicone thing to grip the table top better. It sometimes just slips around a bit. I might just drill a hole in the table and use the alternative clamping instead.Even with that, it's extremely sturdy, does everything it says it does and wasn't too hard on the pocket. Seems like a good buy, no regrets yet!"
2,Really disappointed to know after opening box no VGA Cable as well as Power Cable (though shown as part of pictures when I opened the Monitor box) and neither with HDMI cable without it how we can use pto duct . Hope will get those by Amazon or vendor or dell atleast
3,Gives a blurred view.  No idea  how to correct this.  No proper support from dell.
5,"best for office purpose, picture quality is good not best, colors are also good, setting interface is easily accessible, overall a good monitor for the price range."
5,Good
3,its a lcd screen not a led screen
1,No HD Input as incorrectly mentioned on the product.
1,I got 19.5 inch monitor also VGA and HDMI missing
1,"Without VGA cable , how the monitor will be connected ?"
4,cable wire  is missing ????????????
5,Good one
1,Power cable not included in the package. But not mentioned in description. Highly disappointed üòû.
1,"No cables (VGA or Power) also it's 19.5"" and not 20"" as advertised. Have returned the product."
5,very good...
5,Excellent gaming monitor. Very bright for a TN panel. HDR support is excellentBest size for ppl confused between 24inch or 27 inch monitor.I recommend for gamers. Height adjust at this price is a steal Stand is sturdy and solidComes with only HDMI cable. U will have to buy DP cable if u need. HDMI supports 144hz so no need to worry.I'm happy with the product.
2,"This Monitor have heating issue and the front part of monitor heated, not too much but yup it heats after use 1 hr. You feel kinda blurness  in it.  Fadeed color. I feels like my eye got some problem but it is in this monitor you feel  .Its not for content creater or watching movie as well. I planed to return this and take my money back."
5,Quick Delivery. Nicely Packed.Easy Assembly.Great Picture Quality considering its a TN panel and a really bright panel. Hdmi cable included. Using it on144 hz no issues so far to use gsycn you have to use DP which is not included. Stand is really sturdy and panel doesn't wobble. People complaining about dull colours need to get their eyes checked.I wish it was a 2k panel coz you can see pixels if you sit close to the monitor.
5,So the Monitor is pretty good compared to other monitors(Acer.etc) Cheap ones. Other cheap monitors comes with a lot of quality control issues. Damaged Screens(White Shots.etc). Now I have seen some dumb people say that this monitor is not good compared to IPS.... Obviously IPS is in its own league.You can definitely go with this monitor. Better buy it on Amazon because you can return it easily if there is any small issue which is not possible if you buy it via a local dealer.
1,"This monitor works fine for a few weeks and the runs into all sorts of issues with the panel and the replacement that Lenovo sends has even further issues. From my current experience, it would be best to avoid Lenovo when it comes to displays as they clearly have some sort of a quality issue and their customer support is absolutely pathetic."
5,"The picture quality is decent for a TN Panel. Didn't experience any ghosting, corona or artifacts at higher overdrive levels. The stand is pretty sturdy. Though the display claims to support HDR, I wasn't able to get it to work.The HDMI cable it comes with is a high speed one."
5,"Already in love with this Beauty, It packs 144hz and Extremely Solid Build Quality for the price.100% Recommended."
4,Not recommended for fps games. I doubt if it's truly 1ms. So much blurring while sprinting nd while fast crosshair movements. Brightness is good. Picture quality is decent for a TN panel.
4,Over brightness. Only for gaming. Not recommended for office use.
5,Supports 144hz over hdmi. Very satisfied :)
5,"Very nice picture quality.Packaging very good, very prompt delivery."
5,"If u r looking fr a budget monitor, then go for it blindly. U will get this product under 15k in sale."
5,Go for it
1,Its only running on 120 hzz ..and does not include Dp Cable
5,Very nice Lennovo Monitor.
5,I got this monitor on flipkart at 9.5kit is very good value for money if you get it under 10000.
3,Screen Quality is not that much rich as expected . M not satisfied .
5,Best of all gaming monitors
3,Power cable not found even after the first replacement
4,"This is one of the few budget monitor arms on Amazon that has a grommet mount option as well as a small base (clamp mount is provided too).Easy to reposition monitor without having to exert strength - as long as the bolts are loosened enough.Good build quality and a sturdy product, not sure if all products are the same but my unit came with a few defects.One of the arm swivels had the a part of the plastic buffer piece broken. It hasn't caused any issues till now and probably won't, but a defect none the less.Second, the 'mounting screw', that is used to connect the stand through the table, doesn't go in straight and is noticeably slanted. This affected mounting slightly as I had to drill an oval shaped hole in my table instead of a circular one. It didn't cause any stability issues but was a minor hassle.Cable management clips included are honestly useless. Better to invest in a few velcro straps as it makes it infinitely easier to hide and organise cables.Would've given 5 stars, but cutting down to 4 mainly because of the slanted mounting screw.Overall product is sturdy and very convenient to have in a PC setup. I have been using it for a month with a 24inch monitor (Acer VG24YP) and no issues with the stand.Even with the defects, I can easily recommend this to those who need a budget grommet mounting monitor arm with a small desk footprint."
5,"This could be the best product that I bought online. In the world where chargers are being removed from phone packages, this is easily the most full fledged product. There are plastic holders fo the tools given along with this.Sturdy: I am using this for Acer KG281K monitor, which is 28inch 4k monitor. This can hold my monitor perfectlly. If you tighten the screws perfectly during assembly nothing slips and when you want to tilt you can tilt with easeAssembly: Assembly is easy enough, every instruction is given in the documents and Screws are labelled as well.Just try not to misplace or loose any small part while storing unused parts or may be during assembling also.If you want any specific measurement or any limitations (that is not available in details), post that as question and i will try to answer it, if amazon sends me a mail for ur question."
5,"Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è: one thing that's not made clear in the assembly instructions is that some steps are optional ( you only need to do one of the two 2.a or 2.b & same with 4.a or 4.b ), also if you pick 4.a or 4.b, you only need one set of screws e.a/e.b or e.c/e.d.  The instructions were only images too, no text to explain most of the stuff.Now for the product review, I accidentally ordered it thinking this was the Amazon basica one, but I accidentally ordered something better. The product quality is solid and it weighs 1.5kgs ( I think ), and they claim it can support upto 8kgs or weight. Some features are better than advertised for me at least, the vertical swivel goes to ¬±90 for me instead of 45 that they claim, it can rotate ¬±180 on the y-axis meaning that you can put your monitor in vertical position too very easily.The height adjustment is not hassle-free thought in case anyone needs it frequently, you need to decide one height, losen the bolts and set it on that height and just keep it there unless you wanna deal with the bolts again and again. The rest of the Axises can be accessed seamlessly and you can adjust the smoothness with alan wrenches that they include.Some people may require to have a philipshead screw driver if they wanna bolt it down in a drilled hole."
5,"A tad bit pricey compared to amazon basics one. I havent tried the amazon basics that comes for 2k. But this definitely works wonders. Even though my monitor which is a tv btw,  is heavy as hell, this does the job brilliantly."
5,"Material provided is very solid, heavy and premium quality.  But  no wire management, But value for money product"
5,Value for money. Meets the purpose
5,Using the holder in a grommet and is very sturdy.
1,Chin item..not so gr8
5,"The build quality of this product is really amazing, assembly is simple and looks amazing"
5,"Definitely recommend it, it's sturdy and made of good quality."
5,"Good product, solves it's purpose. 5 star."
5,Exactly as shown
5,Nice product
5,Worth the money spent
5,üí•Detailed Reviewüí•üëå Sturdy and well designed üëçProduct description: ***** Received as describedInstallation: **** Medium Efforts(easy)Build quality : ***** Very Good
5,Easy to install practical and very useful Works as expected Wonderful product I am happy with the product good packaging
5,Made of very good material. Must buy if you want to buy dual monitor stand Superior quality stand Great Fit!
5,A couple more inches of vertical motion range would have made this a killer product!But I am happy with its sturdyness and ability to customise the tension of joints at the VESA mount level and at the arm levelI used a LUMI VESA laptop mount to mount a laptop to this instead of a monitor
1,I purchased and within 3 months its developed dead pixels. When contacted hp they say that they will not repair or replace. Also they says that minimum there should be 5 dead pixels in order to service. Now I wasted money and unable to use it also. Bad service. Bad products
2,Out of the box the colors are not accurate. Installed HP drivers and the quality improved. Still for people  looking for working and Gaming monitor this is not good as most of the text are having blurred edges and small font are not clear... Adjusted sharpness and tried multiple settings but unable to get it right....Tested with Lenove T480 and Acer Predator laptops.
1,Specifications not clear on amazon. No inbuilt speakers and hdmi is not working. Customers should have an option to select a different product during replacement and not same product when you are not happy about it. First time experienced a negative approach from amazon. Please look into this and provide a better product
1,"Within 2 months Product started showing its nature. See the attachment, nothing else to say..........."
1,"I ordered it for Work for home purpose, First time I received a defective piece having black dot on screen, next time in replacement I got a screen with pink coloured blur visible form 5 ft on screen, so please don't go for it. Save your time."
4,"Can be adjusted to 75 Hz refresh rate, but the AMD V-sync doesn't make much of a difference.Its very power efficient and a good product."
5,screen looks nice and awesome experience. i really liked it
4,Have some screen bleeding issue. I returned it. And get another fresh product it's all ok. So I give 4 star
5,Superb monitor ...a different feel while using ...display for ULtra HD videos like AMAZON and NETFLIX is excellent.For gaming its too good and good refresh rate ....
1,Wrong product . Mismatch between product description and delivery.
4,Except the stand everything is good when compared to 22f. 22f is steady.
5,HP is the best company in terms of computing. the built quality is very good. The monitor looks very premium. They picture quality is really good
4,good
5,Looking awesome
2,There are unwanted linings on the screen ..The vendor should maintain the dignity and integrity of customer services..
4,USB portal is missing... Otherwise picture quality and good for office work...
1,Display quality is very poor. The monitor spec is 1080p. But it's really looks like 240p
5,For official purpose as part of wfh and completely satisfied
5,Very nice and fabulous monitor for editing
5,Good nice
1,With HDMI it's very hard to see screen
5,This is good plz buy it
5,Good
5,1 no.
5,Super
5,This is the Best monitor I have ever used... It comes with AMD free Sync technology and it is perfect for High-End Gaming...I'm in love with this ‚ù§Ô∏è
5,The product is an excellent quality product. I purchased from an HP Official Outlet store near me by just seeing its design but I also got the dicount on it of about Rs. 1500 . The monitor also came with overclocking capabilities and AMD FreeSync also works with the Nvidia Control Panel also I have overclocked with my GTX 1080 Ti and it gives about 80 Hz max overclocking capabilities and the colour reproduction is great. You should absolutely go for this monitor .
1,"See the picture, no quality screen"
4,"Looking super, exlent view. But off-line Price is Rs:12500/- only. Frist check outside outlet. ....hsjs and and and and s"
2,"It is not 75hz, please don't fool people."
5,I'm having a blast of a time working on this monitor. The colors are so pretty vivid and the picture quality looks amazing on this one. Loved the design too. The best LED monitor in 24 inches range.
2,I am decreasing the three stars because the packing got damaged. The shipping agents and the delivery agents are not at all properly handeling the packages properly.And the original Asus seal was broken and other plastic tape was sticked above it. Thought this was the situation monitor inside and all the cables and accessories were unused and brand new.I so did not return it .The monitor is working fine no issues !Right side monitor is the Asus Tuf .
5,The quality is amazing. Good haptics. Good panel without backlight bleeding. It‚Äôs better then Samsung or a dell monitor.(But it‚Äôs a gaming TN panel not IPS panel.)OSD Menu very good. Every adapter included.5 Star monitor.
5,"Had searched for lot of monitors finally settled down to this, i was only worried regarding the TN panel since switching froM IPS but trust me this is amazing panel good colour reproduction and best thing is that Size is adjustable with a single touch plus you can rotate it as well and best thing is it has space in the middle of stand for your cable managment and at back it has stand for your Headphones and love the bezzels its less compared to rest trust me Just go for it"
4,Best monitor comparing to samsung acer benq at this price range while using this monitor i didn't felt any image ghosting and flickering 0.5ms is ture .  Though my graphics were getting very High temperature comparing to other 144hz monitor with 1ms i m on 2060super eith i9 32gb ram 3000mhz other monitor had little bit ghosting issue but there was no ghosting at all in this monitor my issue was my system was getting hot easily because of this monitor
5,"Monitor Design= 5/5Response Time= 5/5 You need to do setting for faster response time which is trace free in osd menu.Refresh rate= 5/5 165hz is true and has difference between 144hz and 165hz.Colour Reproduction= 5/5 not as ips but still colours are good and you cant expect those colours from tn i think it is the best tn panel for colours.Quality=5/5 PremiumG-Sync= G-sync is actually good like if your playing a game where you cant reach fps more than 165 then g sync will make your experience smoother and you will not see any lag or input lag but still it depend upon your PC Hardware because g sync will not help you if your getting fps less than 40.Display=5/5 Best.Cables Quality=5/5 you will get HDMI And DP Cable In Box.Note-Use DP Cable for 165hz because u cant reach 165hz with hdmi due to hdmi version.G-sync note- G sync will not limit your fps even if your getting fps more than 165 or lower than 165,it helps with input lag.but dont use v sync with g sync on it will cause heavy input lag.Thanks For Reading :)"
5,"It's a genuine g sync compatible monitor. The monitor itself is 25"" and has 0.5 response time ( basically trace free ) and has great refresh rate of 165 hz. The gsync compatible range is between 40- 165 hz and gsync has to be applied v sync adaptive / fast to achieve that feat. It's a 1080p tn panel so ofc it lacks clarity and color saturation behind va and ips panel yet it is has one the best color accuracy among tn panel gaming monitors.

4,"The monitor itself is one of the best panels that I've ever tested. It's extremely responsive and it's motion performance is better than other 240-280hz IPS monitors out there. The colors are amazing out of the box and you can use this monitor for competitive fps games. Ergonomics are really good. You get tilt, swivel, height and rotation adjustments. The stand has a small footprint and doesn't occupy much space on the desk.But but but, my product was defective. It had too much IPS bleed and I found a defective pixel. It was stuck in blue colour indefinitely. Sadly, I couldn't get a replacement. I really didn't want to let it go but Amazon's only other option was refund. Sad. Nvm. Appario Limited, you should consider selling this monitor.-1 star coz seller couldn't give me a replacement and that I got a faulty piece."
5,"By far the best piece of tech I have owned. The monitor is so good. Lots of options for settings and brightness.Blue light filter is such a blessing.If you can match your fps to 165hz, probably the best gaming experience you will ever have.The Stand is of a very good quality with no wobble on the screen and base feels super strong.You can set the monitor at any angle possible from landscape to portrait and it won't feel like you are ripping the screen off, super smooth operation.Basically everything feels very solid."
5,"Quality - fine.Thickness - not so slim. not think either. Just regular.The stand is pretty sturdy and has the vertical adjust-ability, so that's great.I saw reviews saying 144+ hz will help see more frames in fast paced game, hence they wont improve your skill but will help you to be more accurate. However, I did not see or notice any kind of improvement in CS:GO. I have a 30-60 ping and running a i5 with gtx 1070 . So quality wise, its great. Its bright. The other monitors I use are 24 inch Benq G2480 (IPS) and a 27 inch curved Samung (VA).If I go by feeling, I am most happy with the 27 inch Samsung, however the size and the curve also plays a role in the overall comfort of the monitor so I wont hold that against the Asus.Finally, this Asus is crisp, bright, good built quality with height adjust and I am satisfied with it as a 24 inch 165 hz  G-Sync monitor. However, I wont place it in the Value for money range, because for no significant gain over the Benq, the 2.5 times price is simply not justified."
5,"As this was my first monitor buy, I don't have any threshold to compare but after using it for a week, the monitor seems to be perfect in every mentioned aspect.Though you can get a maximum of 120Hz only via HDMI, using the DP cable can get you 144Hz(both the HDMI and DP cables were included in the box).I did quite a research before buying the monitor, and yes it may seem a bit pricy at 25K, but for the things that it offers, which are ""144Hz Refresh rate + IPS display + 1ms response time + 400nits of brightness + adjustments(pivot, vertical and tilt)"" its worth it."
5,"Firstly I bought this bcuz I was looking for a officially gsync monitor and it is,other higher refresh rate monitors had some issues n didn‚Äôt find a gsync 240hz one.It gives 165 Hz stutter free gaming in most games n 175 in overwatch -I dunno why,color gamut is really gud for a TN panel .also d base is heavy n height adjustable option is really gud ,decent height to really low,overall gud experience."
5,"With this price range there are no other monitor in indian market 0.5 ms response time even if its tn panel but looks beautiful person playing csgo pubg pc, apex would love this monitor"
5,"25/6/2020First things first - Let nobody tell you that 24 inches is small for gaming. If you are first time buyer this is a great gaming monitor and if you can really afford this one please go for this onePros--Amazing display quality. Its labelled as gaming monitor but it has very good color reproduction-Size is adequate for gaming-Movement and Adjusting capabilities are good everything is perfect-Several modes to choose from-Stand is quite sturdy, display rarely wigglesCons--None for now-My display had 1 stuck pixel, tried  several steps couldn't get it fixed. Placed a replacement order4/6/2020-monitor still works like charm-apart from that 1 dead pixel everything is fine-and I forgot to mention, but the cable quality are excellent, you get hdmi and dp cable"
1,"I ordered this monitor (VG259Q) from the seller Appario Retail Private Ltd on Amazon Republic Day sale. I got it in ‚Çπ19949.They sent me a used product(the frame of the monitor was like opened before and there were more signs telling that the monitor wasn't new, though they did a decent job to hide those). I checked the warrenty status by the Serial number on the asus official website and it showed that the warranty period has already been used for almost 2months. I still decided to keep it but when I started to use the monitor I noticed very noticeable amount of backlight bleeding in the corners. After all of these I decided to return it. Thanks to Amazon they arranged a pick up in the the very next day and got the refund.I just want to tell the seller that if u wanna sell a used product then sell it as a renewed item and don't think we customers are fool.Overall the monitor is good 144hz feels good, the design is attractive, G sync works fine(in some old games the screen tearing still appears with the G sync on). There is a blurry effect in the texts, the  picture quality is good but not that greart probably cuz I used to use a 4k monitor Asus PB287Q and I think the 4k one has better picture quality even with a TN Pannel, so if u never used a Full HD monitor or 144hz then go for it."
5,"This is AMAZING!This was my first high refresh rate monitor and it was totally worth it..I connected it to my laptop and it works perfectly. You get 120hz on HDMI but its definitely better than 60hz.. It works really good and all its features just make it worth the price. I did alot of research and also looked for the LG monitors but this just beats it. Its stand isnt really that bad and its very easy to attach and move in terms of height, tilt etc.The thin bezels give it a bigger look than it is. Its crystal clear and dont forget to change the refresh rate from windows settings to actually use it to its full capacity. It comes with and HDMI, Display cable along with an aux cable and a power cable for EU, India and US. This is definitely worth the price and i recommend this monitor 100%. Well done Asus."
5,"so I bought this monitor in the recent sale and I got a good deal around 19k so it was worth it, I have used a 60hz before, and jumping from 60hz to 165hz was a huge jump for me it was like my whole gaming feel changed and I am very much satisfied by this monitor, colors are good very accurate for a TN panel would say one of the best if not the best, for gaming its the best deal but for overall use id give this monitor a solid 4.5 stars"
3,Everything is good except that there is a little backlight bleed. I used DP cable. This is SDR 8-bit colour depth not HDR.My old lg e2041 didn't have this issue which was 60hz and hd with max resolution 1600x900.
4,"This is amazing monitor, i tested few games with my gtx 1060 and windows instantly detected it as gsync compatible monitor, Sadly i got defective unit and requested for for replacement, 25.5inch may be big for some people and TN panel will take some time to adjust."
5,This is a great monitor..Just close your eyes and buy it.Pros-1. The TN panel is better than those cheap VA panels given by Lg and Aopen.. Don't know how?2 G-Sync3 165hz4 0 motion blur ...No corona and gamma5 awesome colour reproduction6. Adjustable in all angles7. 0.5 ms true response timeCons-1. A little overpriced2 The bottom bezel gets a little hot
5,My first impression with this Asus tuf gaming VG259Q Monitor is so awesome..in my case i have always wanted this 144hz refresh rate smoothness and clarity when gaming. Asus monitor fulfilled my needs [5 out of 5] but i didn't use Variable refresh rate means gsync or freesync because my graphic card always gives above 144 framerates in fps games low quality.
5,"Everything is awesome about this monitorMy only concern is PACKAGING PACKAGING PACKAGING..... I WOULD GIVE - NEGATIVE STAR RATING.Box was Wet ... Yes Wet... No any type of proper box .. no protection for the 20,000 rs display . Thats it i wont be ordering expensive stuff from Amazon anymore"
4,"What could you possibly want in 29k or what could they offer. I came down from an 55inch 4k Oled panel, so it took time to adjust to a 1080p tn or va panel i guess. So buy it for 165hz . Response time felt really good. And yeup that's it."
4,"The monitor itself is amazing mind you that have got it for about a week only, however, the delivery was so so poor considering this is a decently expensive product, hence, giving a 4 star.The outside packing box was a very poor quality cardboard box in a poorer condition, it was open from one side and had the amazon packaging tape over the monitor box which while ripping caused the monitor box to get damaged and also with no bubble wrap. Was nervous while unboxing but thankfully the monitor was fine and works well till now."
1,Worse seller ever don't buy any products from them I ordered monitor but it is not starting at all is the box was opened and was not working
5,"In this budget that is best gaming monitor.I bought this in Rs. 19,499 on sale. There are many monitors around this budget but this one have many features which are not in other monitor at this budget like Nvidia G sync, 400 nits brightness, 165Hz Refresh Rate, o.5 ms Response time, minimum input lag etc.Thanks."
3,The monitor is great but seriously overpriced by Asus.  After buying the monitor and using it for a month i can say that you dont need Gsync really. Just but 144Hz monitor and dont pay premium for Gsync. its not really that great
5,"0.5 Response Time ,165Hz And G-SYNC Support Make It Beast And The Picture Quality Is So Clear And You Can Adjust The Monitor! If You Want To Be Pro Or Going E-sports Make Sure To TRY This Gaming Mouse!"
1,The monitor arrived with some damage on the box....an the monitor is too dim i cant even see a thing....i cant even shutdown my pc!!
4,"I've connected my Asus ROG Strix with it via HDMI, and even though it's mentioned 240hz on HDMI , I'm unable to get past 85hz. ( The option is not present in Windows Display Settings ).Maybe I'll be able to get the full refresh rate using display port. ( Will update once I try it )."
5,Its a good monitor for gaming @165hz. even if you dont reach 165 fps you can set the refresh rate in any game to 165hz just for the smoother feel. Color output is also good and bright. ELMB feature is useful in few scenarios as you wont be using it most of the time.
4,"Awesome quality and consistent performance, reviewing after using it for around 2 months but my screen glitches all the time when i switch to lower resolution's 240 hz mode, idk if its issue with my peice, will look into this matter later."
5,"Setup was easy, comes with DP/HDMI Cables. Performance is very impressive, my son who likes gaming is very impressed. Personally I think speaker performance is not good enough. I am not getting sound output one would expect from 2w speaker, which should be close to 100 decibels."
5,"Asus is good in Gaming monitor, so you can buy this monitor. Amazon sale is best sale. I would like to say that this monitor will work very well in the present and future."
5,"This product is great, Perfect 165hz(upto 167hz) maximumIt works smoothly and quality is awesome,just price is bit high overall best Gsync monitor"
5,"this monitor was such a upgrade from my previous acer 144 hz moniter it is much more brighter , more clean image and its bigger also its super adjustable"
5,Excellent investment in an gaming monitor. It is afterall the best gaming monitor for 2020.
3,It worked flawless for 1.5 years and now I am facing white horizontal line issues.
5,Best of the best monitori loved it.Best experience with asus Rtx 2060 super best for all games with display port....but some problems with sound quality but for gaming it is best budget monitor....ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©
1,Only this was the box was damaged. Other than that everything seemed to be good. The product didn't had any damages.
5,Finally recieved the product.. works great
1,Monitor quality is ok however power card did not fit properly and even a small touch in monitor or wire results power off.  Called Philips Customer Care and they had asked to purchase new cable although it is their fault. They redirected to one nearby service center without lodging complaint.  When approached the service center they first asked the complaint number and I said it was not registered by them. They also justified it is not product fault and power cable had to be purchased and not covered under warranty. The service center guy also did not handle the customer properly though there is fault in the product.
5,Good LCD display with Inbuilt speaker. Having both HDMI and standard port.
5,- Nice product in this range- HDMI & VGI cables are also present in the packet. No need to buy those separatly. [Which i did :(]- Monitor is good and it comes with a built in speaker.
5,Nice monitor.Good picture quality.Speaker is ok.Edge to edge display really nice.Delivered earlier.
5,Very happy with the product.I experimented with lot of other bands but this is best for long hours of working.
1,Desktop stand is not inside
5,Superb quality.Didn't test for gaming
4,after lot's of research i found 129% srgb gamut morning at cheap price. but when its comes to on my desk i am bit disappoint- build material good- colors look good (not as i aspect 129% itd image prosser give you more saturation not real srgb) its looking normal ips monitor color- clear sharp display-comes with display port and hdmi cable
1,"Worst delivery ever, just opened the box to find the damaged monitor. Very disappointed with the delivery"
2,"Received the package, there is no remote in the packing"
5,"Thats a first because usually there would be a power cord and not the HDMI, DVI, VGA, Audio and a PC power cord with a power brick..It only has a single joystick button on the back to control and manipulate everything including powering off so it takes getting used to. You can blank the screen and it goes into power saving mode which is not the same as full off but for normal use it works.. I am replacing a 24 philips TV which I got because I could not get a 24 monitor at the time. They had 21 and 22 but I already had a 22 monitor and wanted bigger but seems it was not in fashion. But a TV has over scan mode so text wont be clear until you run a monitor calibration program which sets it to the proper mode is pixel to pixel instead of the TV translation.  For some reason would flicker when ever anyone turned on their tube lights in the neighbourhoods..  But this seems to have been fixed now.Says max resolution is FHD at 75Hz.. I set it at 50Hz to conserve bandwidth with a 10 meter long cable. I also had to reduce brightness from 100 to like 25 because it was too bright.. Same with contrast.. On my Philips TV that was set to 40 and 35 instead of the 25 and 20 on this. And since the power supply is external you have the power brick to carry around which usually is built into the TV set itself. Its a 19V 2A supply kind of like the ones you get with external hard drives...Many people seems to have trouble with tearing.. Which I have never seen.. But I know for fast action games it happens.. But for watching movies and such, you dont see it. But I have noticed that some companies try to fix this and the fix seems to be the cause of lagging and tearing.  Even on this I caught it a few times when I moved the windows around but it happens very rarely. Everything is smooth during normal use. Also it says normal power requirements is 10W which is slightly lower than my old one.. And highest is like 20W at full brightness which would be clear in direct sunlight..  There is no bleeding or curving and such either.. I was going buy the AOC which is on sale for 10% lower than this but many complained about lagging so I got this. The blue light filter just seems to make everything yellowish and much brighter so I turned that off.. You can also set the tinge to the proper K value you want from like 2500 to 8000.. 2600K would be too blue but seems much easier on the eyes even with the fear of UV rays.. While 7500K would be like yellow..For around 8000 this is definitely worth the price.. Although I seen TV with FHD for under 5000 now.. Philips is not worry free but its not worrying like buying chinese clones.. All previous monitors I had were samsung which lasted decades.. Even cheap LG lasts but its not as robust as the samsung which are like tanks but those were a while ago..  This one seems fragile since its so small and light and will have to see how long it lasts..  The problem is there are bugs which eat the screen in tropical climates just like they eat DVD's..  I had an AOC which developed this problem of missing the background and leaving a big hole in the center.. Any LCD screen seems to attract bugs which eat this.. Only way to prevent it is to place air tight covers on which is not always possible. Pretty hard to replace this background screen as well..So over all this one was a much better buy than many others I looked at even though I won't ever use the DVI port. The text is pretty clear and color calibration would be a night mare on this. But its close enough for most people. Use a monitor blanking program to set it to power saving mode since actually powering off is difficult as the button is on the back."
5,STYLISH LOOKING MONITOR
4,"Pros:1. Excellent build quality2. Super thin3. Good connectivity optionsCons:1. The original product description said ""Origin of Switzerland"". However, the product that I received is ""Made in China""2. No button to turn off the screen3. No height adjustment"
5,"Very good, all features supported as specified in spec."
3,"My moniter display is like this how n where to complain , Plz replace it"
1,Screeb got damaged in 1 month. Purchased this in the month of December.It's stil in the warranty period. Can i get replacement?
5,"Amazing screen, and fab viewing angles and usefull for both gaming and work,...Just they should've provided a USB socket... to the monitor at this price point...Go for it..!"
5,I will give 5 start...solid and very premium built quality with great HDR..colors r very vibrent and aslo produce very sharp images with super resolution features..no any other brand will give this package in this price. Extra 4000/- is worth for HDR when compare with GW2780. Size is perfect for gamers. And yes its sounds Is good like small Bluetooth speakers.earlier i was concerned about brightness bcoz it have 250 nits but in person its great and more than enough...fully setesfied with the purchase.
1,"Received while on tour. When back, unpacked and noticed that the screen was cracked. As the packaging and the housing showed no dent, this must have been packed and shipped with fraudulent intent.And it worked out, as the brief return window had just closed the day before my return.Joys of online shopping.Otherwise good product, purchased already multiple."
5,"Its really a good monitor at this price with HDR and other features. It has good amount of brightness and contrast perfectly suited for watching videos and movies as well. Its built in speaker is small but produces a good amount of sound, however dont expect the outcome like from a TV. It has headphone port which could be connected to external monitors.It has 3 HDMI ports so that multiple devices can be connected to it at same time, however no other type of ports like DVI, VGA or Display ports. However you can use converter cables from these type of ports to HDMI.Regarding the color reproduction, its really awesome and accurate. It has several eyecare features and settings, however i like the reading mode which makes the entire screen grayscale.Nice product for this price."
1,"Nice budget monitor, edge bleeding issue. overall ok. also i would not recommend this one for gaming.Speaker quality is decent.Update 1: I had to replace it as the edge bleeding was getting worse & distracting day by day. Strangely the replacement product I got from Amazon is even WORSE than my previous one!! & It seems like it's not a fresh produce either it's a renewed one or used .So I contacted Amazon & they can't exchange it again so they will return it & refund my money!So something I learnt from this & it might help you-* Try to avoid buying stuff in this kind of festival offers or anykind of major offers. As thare is a higher chances to get defective or old products in less price.(For example I bought this monitor in 15,204. Which is a good deal , but as it's defective & they refunded my money , I can't buy that product in same price! The price is higher now!)* If you get a defective product , don't replace it, just return it, thare is a higher chance to get even more defective product in the replacement!* when you get your product delivered, Try to capture a unboxing video of the product for your own defence & proof.Update 2:Refund received today, got my refund within 24 hrs, thanks to Amazon for that.But I will try to stay away from this brand (Benq) & it's products!!"
5,"This is my first impressions/weeks take on the BenQ EW2780 monitor.I am currently using a Dell S2240L that I purchased in 2013.The Dell monitor has given me stellar service and I have zero complaints...except that it's a 22"" monitor, which over the years was getting a little cramped.My Dell monitor has a glossy screen, so picture/color reproduction is absolutely top notch.(way better than some other matte screen monitors that I have seen.)So the main reason for the upgrade was to get more screen area to use.Upgrading from a 22"" to a 24"" monitor seemed like a minor incremental upgrade at best, while upgrading to a 27"" monitor is a major upgrade (in terms of usable area).The only issue with a 27"" monitor ""seemed"" to be the drop in pixel density from 103(for a 22"") to 82(for a 27""), and the resulting loss in clarity/sharpness on texts and pictures.I did physically check out a few 27"" monitors in showrooms (big ones like Croma or other big shops will not have any 27"" monitors on display, so I checked out some smaller ones in my neighborhood.)At least for me, I hardly saw any major degradation in the clarity/sharpness on texts and pictures from around 2 feet distance, so I knew that going in for a 27"" made sense.I use monitor for general purpose.....word,excel,web surfing,movies and games.I don't care for high refresh rates and faster response times as I play SP games, so 60 hz was more than enough for me.(the EW2780 tops out at 75 Hz.)So I needed a 27"" 1080p (60hz) monitor.(Was looking for a glossy monitor but couldn't get any. I think no one makes glossy monitors now a days.)Initially I did look at a few monitors from Dell,HP,Philips and BenQ.HP 27f/27fw/27er are very sleek but are also a good 3k more than comparable Dell and BenQ.The Philips 276E9QJAB is around 3k cheaper but looked a bit cheap in build quality...and has very few reviews on the net.Dell SE2719HR also seemed good (though the panel quality of the SE series is a tad lower than the regular S series from Dell), but its the same price as the BenQ EW2780 which has the additional HDRi feature.The BenQ GW2780 is a good 3k cheaper than the EW2780 but also doesn't have the HDRi feature.Other reviews for the BenQ EW2780 on the net seemed good so I decided to order this one.First impressions after assembly were very good. The monitor looks minimalist and very premium with a solid well designed metal base.It's almost bezel less and looks beautiful. (but this is the norm now for all monitors.)I did compare it's picture/text quality against the Dell, and am very pleased with the results.The picture quality matches and even surpasses in quite a few instances.Even the text is crisp and clear. (For people with a very good eyesight, maybe this might be an issue, but it certainly wasn't for me.)For me personally the HDRi (simulated HDR) was a hit and miss, as I was able to see a good amount of contrast in certain games with it switched on, while it was a bit too dark in others.I tested Metro Exodus, Dishonored 2, Styx for HDR, as these games have a lot of dark and lit areas next to each other.The HDR works fairly well in Exodus and Dishonored 2, as the dark areas were suitably darkened without going overboard and the overall experience was very good.For Styx, the HDR made things a bit too dark for my taste and I preferred to keep it on Cinema HDRi or just switch it off.I tested Ori & the Will of the Wisps for color pop and vibrancy, which was on point and everything looked absolutely beautiful.Generally speaking, Cinema HDRi makes the scenes more vibrant, while HDR darkens the dark areas and provides a deeper contrast.The OSD controls are fairly comprehensive.Didn't test the inbuilt speakers as I have separate ones.There seems to be minor back light bleed on the left corner but its not too distracting.Imo the upgrade was totally worth it.The large screen fills your vision and I cant believe why I didn't think of moving to 27"" earlier.The 27"" 1080p screens give a very pleasant experience (for both pictures and text), as long as you are not into professional graphics designing and editing, and are at least around 1.5/2 feet away from the monitor.For regular day to day office use, net surfing, movies and SP gaming, it suits my needs perfectly."
5,"Picture quality is crisp and amazing given its ips an panel. The in built speakers does a great job and it's very clean. Do not expect anything beyond sound of a  decent phone speakers. Perfect for work from home setups and for ppl looking for a daily use, binge watching, and gaming."
3,"EXPECTIONS vs. REALLITYEXPECTATIONS: I wanted a decent monitor for WFH programming job.So I looked around on the internet, there were lot of options some were too expensive and some were cheap too. I ain't a gamer at all so my specific demand was a full HD IPS panel with good colours and built in speakers. I found this model and did a huge R&D about it, like blogs, YouTube videos etc... The specs on paper looked really promising to me. Finally made up my mind despite of having a bit overpriced (17k), I bought it.REALITY1. The packaging was ridiculously done..2. Felt like it was opened before. As if someone returned it or replaced it already.3. Picture quality was good I would say, just like I saw in the YouTube videos.4. Speakers were decent but within two weeks, they started to distort badly. Really pissed off on this one...CONCLUSIONDisplay quality is a plus point. Blacks are really blacks and yes I do feel comfortable using it all day for work since it has some eye filters. Overall is a bit overpriced for the specs. Speakers are worst part about this monitor. If you are getting this monitor for less than15k then go for it otherwise I would say go for it's lower model which is worth 13k.THIS IS NOT FOR GAMERS"
2,Pixelated image and text on 27 inch FHD. Better go with 24 inch or Qhd monitor. PPI is less than 90 which in general is quite bad. Purchased it due to positive reviews but I can't return it now. This monitor may be good to watch movies and little bit of gaming. For programming a big NO!
1,"I noticed a air bubble within days of its purchase but didn't pay an attention. However that air bubble turned into big black spot at right side of the monitor on 12th day of its purchase. Since I already crossed 10 days replacement timelines, I can't replace it on Amazon and BenQ customer care is claiming it as physical damage. There's absolutely no outside physical damage but BenQ customer care isn't sending a technician to verify my claim. They're asking to pay 90% of total monitor cost to repair it. This monitor was fun until it lasted only 2 weeks. Understandably I'm totally disappointed after burning my pocket by 17000/- for 2 weeks fun."
5,I would like to say it is the best monitor in this budget. Few things that I would highlight:Excellent displayNo grey spotsI am not a gamer so wont comment on that.My use is mostly for office work.You can read the documents very easily without any eye strain.Though it is a 27 inch screen but no blurring effect.Amazon delivery is just too good.
5,"Before buying this monitor for my home office, I had to do a full research on what would best suit my needs. I‚Äôm not a gamer, so I needed a monitor that‚Äôs good for web surfing, working and occasionally watching YouTube/Netflix.This is a 27 inch 1080p HDRi monitor. The highest recommended size for 1080p would be 24 inch monitors but as I occasionally watch movies, I had to push it by a bit. It‚Äôs a fair trade off for me because 2k/4K monitors are substantially more expensive than this one.Now coming to review of this product, initially I received a faulty product which was replaced by amazon within a day. Apart from that, the monitor has some really nice features that are hard to find like ambient light sensor that works really well, low blue light filter. Both these features really help me reduce eye fatigue post sunset. Apart from that there‚Äôs a hot key for changing the mode from low blue light to HDRi and suddenly everything is vibrant and good for watching YouTube/Netflix.The monitor also has timer which pops up nicely in the bottom left corner reminding us to take breaks in the intervals that we choose from the available options.While this monitor also comes with inbuilt speakers, I haven‚Äôt used them much as I have external 5.1 speakers. One thing that I noticed is the inbuilt speakers are louder and sound better than my work laptop.Apart from this, the panel is matte finish and doesn‚Äôt have any reflections, and the monitor height is also decent provided you are an average height person. For someone that‚Äôs taller than 6 feet, they might need a VESA stand to adjust the height of the monitor to avoid strain on neck."
4,"I won't give a technical review, you can find that in couple of other review posts. I will be posting what I did not find in other posts or something of value in my own experience of purchase.1. Audio quality is good not great because of the limited volume. Given you are going to use it as an extended monitor or nearby PlayStation experience the volume should suffice. For a rich music experience, you might need to plug into a set of external speakers.2. The monitor mount is metallic and very sturdy. Nice and sleek.3. I had to raise an exchange due to the issue of light bleeding and the exchange turned out to be fine. Although, I am pretty sure the seller tried to ship me a defective unit for the first time. For the first time, the seal tape by BenQ visible in the attached image was missing. The seller in my case was Appario Retail Private Ltd.4. I started from a sub 10k budget and pushed to this monitor for 16.5K on a strong recommendation by a friend and I am glad I did it.The sweetest deal for this price."
4,Monitor is good for movie watching. It has good sound. Lot of colors.But if you are planning to work/code with it. then I would suggest to go for other monitor and not this one.
5,"I have been using this monitor for a month now for my home office. This i must say is an awesome monitor and does the job perfectly. 27 inch size is pretty good for your work. I found monitors from other company with almost same functions at much higher price. I am happy to have this one. 36 months warranty is good enough, though competitors are also giving the same warranty. Although monitor is not meant for audio but i found audio quality decent enough. I can attend my meetings without headset using monitor's audio. Overall a good deal, if someone is planning to buy a monitor go for it without second thought."
5,"I didn't need 4k or 144hz refresh rate. I wanted a simple monitor with good colour and 1080p. And I found this. This has HDRi as well. It is perfect. Has 3 hdmi inputs..if I want to shift from windows to my mac, its hassle-free. ...even I can quickly shift to my gaming console. The screen is tiltable and can be easily adjusted to the viewing angle. Overall very good product. Very very easy to set it up in the provided stand. And looks very modern."
4,"Overall it's a nice product in this price range, the build quality is clean and finish is good, the placement of buttons and cable ports are neat, though it has speakers, I prefer my 2.1 Bose, so don't want to comment on the sound. Font readability is crips and good, image reproduction is good, only I will suggest that the Color reproduction is good but that great when compared to my Dell UltraSharp, hence I am using this Monitor as secondary, as I deal mostly with colors."
1,"It has a very dim display panel, not suitable to be used in a well lit room, irrespective of day or night. Colour reproduction is awry, whites appear grey, no colour calibration of any kind. I am very disappointed with this EW2780 monitor. It is waste of money, not reconnended at all.  This monitor does not even compete with significantly lower priced monitor e.g. Lenovo, ones wich cost around 10K which I am using in our office.Since, there is no straight option to return it, I tried to rectify these issues by all possible settings i.e. from montior and PC software/driver.  But it could not come close to even my laptop screen display reproduction, which is by the way a TFT screen and not an IPS.I previously had an LG 27"" FHD monitor which worked great but it did not age well. After 5 years of usage, the brightness got dim and it developed a vertical line in the middle which intermittently appeared at times. Still, it had a good run and i was happy with the purchase. Personally, I am okay to compromise on such con than living every day with very bad colour reproduction, significantly low brightness and really bad colour calibration out of the box.I would recommend to choose LG monitors instead of Benq. Even though the IPS glow is more evedent in LG monitors than the Benq one, but this con is nothing compared to what issues we get with Benq EW2780.I went through a lot of trouble but got my Benq monitor return approved. After this, I purchased an LG monitor with which I am very happy. One more suggestion I could give is to go for panel brightness no less than 350 nits and if budget permits go for QHD monitor."
5,Very Good monitor with great picture quality and speaker output is also decent better than My LG 24 inch
5,"After 1 month of usage, I can surely say this is the best budget monitor you can get in this range.The colors are mesmerising, HDR doesn't wash the image up if it is supported by the stream. Brightness and Contrast can be a little too high for low brightness users like me. Rec.709 mode is the best color mode to get perfect blacks and minimal backlight bleed.Does suffer from backlight bleed (so does a 1L+ alienware) but is not visible in a dimply or brightly lit room. You can only notice it if you are looking at a pitch black screen in a dark room and searching for it. IPS glow is minimal and not prevalent in games or a lit room.Refresh rate is 60HZ so not recommended for FPS gaming especially if your system can give more than 60 HZ. I play Cyberpunk2077 and GTA V on it and I can say that you will get that zowie (Benq's gaming range) feel with the right settings.Does support upto 75HZ as exposed by some tweaking softwares but would not recommend overclocking as it would void the warranty.For development purposes, the standard stand hight is efficient for viewing colors at the correct angles and swivelling is also less sensitive so you can swivel it down a bit if you are getting too much glow.For watching movies, well if you want immersive images, Cinema HDRi will bring that cinema feel to you and it doesn't hurt the eye as well. Otherwise rec.709 is recommended for dark and horror movies.From a Gamer and a developer's point of view, just go for it."
1,"Please do dead pixel test after getting this monitor. I observed after the return date. I raised a request with Benq India for EW2780 dead pixel issue - R200800739. They said as ""As per BenQ Pixel policy it will not support under warranty"".I don't know now what to do. If anyone faced same kind of issue and resolved the problem, please share details."
3,Best qualities:brightness intelligence - helps to set reminder for eye protection and automatically adjusts the brightness according to the room light.Ease of use - multi-picture mode. You can set mode according to the usage that would give you appropriate brightness and blue light managementThings which are not good:Sound quality is not so great. highest volume is 50% that u can hear it feebly only around 50mts when  your atmosphere is quiet. otherwise volume is very low. If you are looking for some monitor which has good sound quality then you should consider other products. Otherwise this is great to office work usage.
3,"Resolution is not quite good. Better go for 24 inch model, as the Resolution is much better with the same 1080p.Also the movie watching experience is not quite good as the frames are not smooth.The 16 plug for power is ridiculous.Only positive thing is the HDR, provided the source is good."
5,"power cords of benq are very big 3pin and It usually won't fit Normal 3 pin socket that we have in Indian houses. Buy a connector from ur local electrical shop and you're good to go.Cona 3 pin Universal connector will cost u around 150bucks.Refer the pic..And you're welcome..Monitor is good. I used it for coding, photo editing and video editing.. all in one with hdr features.Advantages. :SlimNo edge screenIn built speakersmultiple HDMI portHdr-iDisadvantages :Cannot be rotated 180¬∞No webcam."
5,Loved it!!!!Stunning looks and display
5,"Bought this for WFH use, I'm a developer using Macbook Pro 16, with this display as my primary display. Coming from mac display this is definetly a downgrade but can't expect much from 1080p monitor. I got it for 16k, which gave me 27inch display with good colors. HDR mode is kinda useful sometimes. The major selling point for me is the auto-brightness feature using light sensor at the bottom of the display. Since I'm always infront of it, I wanted something that would have less harm on my eyes. This works nice. Speakers are also good..not great but good"
1,The screen looks like patchy ! It looks like there is cloth behindThis monitor HDR is nothing but oversaturationThey can't claim it as HDR !It's not even HDR1027 inches screen with 1080 p resolution is like over scaling ! Also heavy backlight as it's an LCD screen
4,This is an amazing monitor with amazing low price. Got this during amazon sale. The monitor has got 4 HDMI ports (but it do lack USB port) along with one Aux and other connector. I would recommend this monitor for those who work and also do a gaming. I personally do both. The color saturation is amazing and contrast too at this price point. Colors are bright with amazing blacks too and it has got lot of options for the type of screen one wants. All in all an amazing product. Go for it.
4,"I was horrified seeing it did not switch on even on powering the monitor, after multiple checks found that the power plug is loose. After pushing in a little more, it worked but everytime the cable moves a bit the monitor looses power, So I had to make sure the power cable is fixed in a place and doesn't move while I work.. Let me know if some one has a solution for it.Except for this issue, it is a great monitor to work on!"
5,I recently switched from samsung 22inch to Benq 27inch and the change is noticeable. Brilliant color reproduction and sharpness. If you want to step up from samsung or LG then this will be the right choice. This screen may not satisfy a pro gamer but it definitely provide a good gaming experience for gamers like me. I mostly do the designing and video editing work and for that this screen is absolutely perfect.
5,I loved the screen. Bought it for WFH and also for my daughter's online class. reduces strain on eyes after long working hours. Only one element that I felt could have been better was the stand height. The stand is sleek and good. It may work for others though.
2,Build quality is good. Picture quality is not so good. It‚Äôs good for watching movies. If you are a coder then you will see pixels in the texts.I dint find any good use of HDRi technology in this.
5,"Its really a good monitor at this price with HDRi and other features. It has good amount of brightness and contrast perfectly suited for watching videos and movies as well. Its built in speaker is small but produces a good amount of sound, however don't expect the outcome like from a TV. It has headphone port which could be connected to external monitors."
3,"Do not expect good sound quality from the inbuilt speakers, its average and not very loudPicture quality is ok, again not that crisp. Since I am used to Mac screen, this looks pretty average."
5,"The monitor with a bezel-less design, clear picture quality, crisp speaker, and budget-friendly.  I am satisfied with this premium monitor from Benq. As defined in their description, this monitor fulfills all the commitments it has made in the paper."
4,Great picture quality..... Soothing to the eye..... Irritation to the eyes are significantly less than other screens for someone who has 6 to 7 hours of office work. Only the sound quality is a little drawback.... Could've given a better quality speaket but can be made up with a normal audio device. Price for what you will get is a little on the premium side given this is a newer product. Overall satisfied with my purchase.
3,"Nice monitor for general purpose. The unit delivered to me had dead pixel, even the replacement had the same issue. Didn't purchase eventually."
5,"Perfect for Engineers üë©‚Äçüíª Especially I love the eye care feature, sensor works perfect !! Apart from this picture quality is very good, refresh rate is good , so overall happy with the product."
5,"Go blindly for BenQ products due to their sheer durability. 21.5"" monitor lasted 5 years and 2 laptops. This is a thin monitor with extremely sharp picture quality and focus. Multiple inbuilt viewing modes give a pleasurable viewing experience. I have both the benq 27"" models - with HDR (this one) and without HDR(GW model). I would suggest go for this one for a superior experience."
5,The best in budget monitor with eye care technology and HDRI color output. Best for gaming and watching movies. Very Sharp image output for digital documents. Thin bezzels on screen makes it beautiful and eye catching. Not good for editing . Must buy for gaming and intertainment.
4,picture quality and everything is amazing but the left speaker has got distortion and its so bad that I stopped using the built in speakers.
