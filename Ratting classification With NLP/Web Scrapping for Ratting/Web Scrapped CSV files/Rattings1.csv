Rattings,Review
4,"Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).Clarifications/issue points:1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium.2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.Pros:1. Configuration is best at this price level.2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.6. Display is average and gets the job done.7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.I’ll update this review after one month of usage."
1,"Different charger was sent in the box by Amazon and they were not ready to provide a replacement as I had open the laptop box.Later after several calls and struggle I was able to get the replacement and now, camera is not working for the laptop.Laptop's over-all performance is nice. Buy it from a HP showroom directly instead buying it from Amazon."
5,"Amazing laptop.. I ordered this laptop on its released date i.e. 24th feb seeing it's wonderful configuration.. I must say the decision was right..Thank u HP for this superfast laptop. And after so much of research, I think in HP this is the only laptop with high configuration (11th gen, 16gb ram, 512 SSD, 14 inch screen, light weight, finger sensor & Alexa inbuilt) under this budget."
4,"As soon as I found 11gen Gen i5 at ~62K I got stuck at it & after reading some initial reviews placed an order. Got it at promised time. Here's my review after 3 days.Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance. 1.4 Kg is not too light & noticeable. People complaining about placement of Power Key button beside delete button but believe me it'll hardly ever come your way. The plastic feels like metal. The screen doesn't lift keyboard. Typing is a pleasure.Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Finger print unlock is superfast. Apps opens in no time. Gestures works perfectly. All thanks to 11th Gen i5, 16GB Ram & 512 NvMe SSD.Features: Comes with ""Office Home & Student 2019"" (didn't checked is it lifelong). Dropbox 25GB for 1 year also available. Comes with some HP apps & Express VPN as well. HP quick drop helps you transfer files from your phone easily. It has Type C charging point but not sure if it is delivery charging or receiving charging point. Keyboard is backlit with two setting (full & med bright).Display: Didn't checked in daylight but at home it is very bright. Watching videos in FHD IPS display is a pleasure.Camera is 720p Camera is OK. Pictures & Videos are grainy. I won't be using it much so I'm fine with that.Speakers is unbelievably very loud & clear. At 67 its was reaching all across my apartment. Speakers are on the two sides below keyboard.Only drawback I noticed was charging pin is too tight to push & pull out.I will be posting more updates on performance, battery etc & also my overall experience as I keep using more & more.Update after 2 weeks:After lot of research & by doing practical I found that this Laptop can be charged by a Type-C charger. Believe me this is an exclusive piece of information, not many people knows this. HP call center didn't knew this, HP Showroom people don't know this, even when I asked question here someone provided wrong answer. This is an important information they should have mentioned in product detail that this Laptop supports Type C charging. I'm using HP original 65 W Type C power adapter to charge it. Attaching a photo. I did some research myself & found its USB Type C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. After reading this I ordered the Type C power adapter & it worked."
5,"I bought this a few days ago, and I am glad I decided to make this purchase. This laptop is probably the only laptop in its segment that boasts such a spec heavy configuration without breaking the bank. The HP pavilion is such a compelling buy and boy does it deliver a premium experience throughout.Having used a Pavilion 15 before, I gravitated towards the Pavilion series predominantly because of the typing experience and the speakers tuned by Bang and Olufsen! They sound mighty impressive for the price! It’s the same experience this time around. The audio is loud and crisp, and typing experience with 2 stage backlit chiclet keys is fantastic! They key travel and feedback is great. This probably is nitpicking, but the only gripe I have is the Power key is placed next to the Delete key. Although, accidentally pressing the power key won't turn off the device or put it to sleep. The 250 Nits IPS panel is crisp and bright for day to day indoor use. The viewing angles are great too with HDR playback support. Although, I would have loved atleast 300 nits plus panel given the price of the device. The chassis seems rigid and built to last! The top cover and the keyboard deck is metal, stays cool to touch as compared to the bottom cover which is plastic. The trackpad is quite large and supports windows gestures. The fingerprint reader is fast and accurate. The laptop remained silent during my entire sessions of document editing and reviewing. However, the fan kicked in during a windows update, and it was loud. The 43Wh cell helps this laptop with a good battery life. The 65-watt barrel pin charger helps in charging the device quickly, and the device can also be charged via PD enabled chargers via the Type-C port. One nifty addition is the HP Quickdrop. It lets users to transfer files back and forth with a companion mobile app. It’s a great addition for me as I can edit photos on Lightroom and quickly share them to my phone to be shared on social media! The i5 11 gen is a beast of a processor and it barely breaks a sweat during photo editing sessions. It can do some light title gaming with the Intel Iris Xe graphics.Some closing thoughts:The HP Pavilion with 16Gb RAM and 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 can be ideal machine for folks wanting a portable yet powerful machine without a hefty sticker price. It is like using a trimmed down version of HP ENVY without compromising on processing power. It has been a fantastic purchase so far!"
1,"Don't buy this lap  ... Don't be fool .I spent around 70,000 for the lap, when I open laptop it's screen off and on happening automatically.You can see the video above attached.I request to replacement for the laptop, but not yet got any update.. already completed 15 days."
1,It's too strange to see a brand new HP  pavilion laptop got hung in the very second use. None of the keys working....can't even shut down......totally helpless....disappointment at its peak .....The packaging too was no way near the required....Frustration....disappointment....too bad experience.....
5,Nice product. USB type C can be used for charging but didn't work with 30W Oneplus 7T charger. May be work with 65 watt smartphone charger. Backlight Keyboard has only 2 dimming light settings. Apart from these everything is excellent.
4,Laptop is good and Fast but the GHZ mentioned is not correct they say 4.2 ghz but what we receive is only 2.4 Ghz. I cannot put my earphone in this laptop since it is liitle bit small. earphone from jbl and working fine in mobile. overall laptop is good in this price range
5,11 Gen Laptop with 16GB RAM is a dream combination as of now. Good deal
1,"As soon as the warranty period got over, laptop got defected .I complaind to hp care then it came to notice that amazone has not mentioned s.no in the bill for rectification of this error amazone took approx 18 days to correct the bill and for replacement of defective item Amazon is still making fool that your case is under escalation team and continuously giving new target date but not  giving resolution. I am totally feeling mentally harrashed"
2,"Claiming 4.2 GHz processor, but Delivered item with 2.4 GHz."
4,"I was searching for a laptop from Feb and bought this in Mar and am the first one to buy this from Amazon. The laptop has value for money, fast, long battery life etc. Sometimes it hangs for no reason. I believe it could be hardware issue and not related to Windows. When the laptop is kept on on a bed, the battery area heats up very quickly and hangs. There were no multiple drives. It would have been better if there were two drives ; one for OS and other for storing personal data.One interesting factor I observed with Amazon is the moment I bought on march1, there was one review appeared with all 5 star though I have not rated the product. Amazon is giving fake ratings to many products like this. Unless there is a photo of video of the product I would recommend the users not to believe the review.Pros:Fast bootupMore RAMSSDLong battery lifeFast fingerprint readingLight weightCons:Hangs sometimes for no reasonLess volumeKey board layout is not user friendlyNo RJ45Only one drive"
1,"The battery is gone in a month's time it was delivered on 5-Apr-201, hardware diagnosis says battery needs to be replaced. Have already faced issues where the keys just froze and had to contact support team."
5,"Awesome features in this laptopScreen is delight, back lit keyboard is awesome, finger print recognition is really good. I cannot imagine I could get all these features at this price. Super fast drive, free office what else you need.... 16 gb ramBeen using this for more than 2 weeks.. I am really really happy. On top of it awesome customer care service on what's app"
4,"I just see one month trial version of microsoft 365, it doesn't show me option to setup ms office. can some one help me on this?"
2,"If you are a College student or a professional who depends heavily on laptop for pretty much everyday then  this laptop is not for you. It hangs more often than it runs. Cannot install essential computer science software such as Eclipse or android studio because then this laptop just dies.I took this laptop thinking that it will have good performance based on its configuration.But if you are someone who wants to attend online classes or just browse, then you may go for this laptop."
4,Quality of the laptop seems to be more premium and the lightweight of the laptop fits to our hand. I am not a gamer for normal usage it seems best in class. HP had worked very well in this series with good quality speakers and keyboards are nice power. On and off in lightening speed with the ssd  but the only disadvantage is the internal webcam which makes me very disappointed . its just a hd camera. For this price range HP should work on the camera section. overall nice product.
4,"This laptop from HP has an excellent hardware configuration. A brand new laptop was delivered to me within 1 day of placing the order. The set-up was pretty fast. You can configure the Office 365 1-month trial version (comes with the laptop) or install your own MS-Office copy. Does not come with a carry-bag or any other accessory. Start-up is extremely smooth and fast with Windows Hello Fingerprint Scan and no problems encountered in the last more than 15 days of daily usage. The fingerprint scanner can however only be used for Windows Hello, it cannot be used for entering your password on websites using HP Security Manager App (as confirmed by HP Support Specialist). Other than this, no problems with the hardware configuration."
5,"This is an excellent product. Appearance looks great. Start and shutdown in a blink due to NVMe SSD. All the configurations including RAM, processor, ports are well tested and optimized. Very light waight and portable for frequent travellers."
5,"Like:Booting time is very less.Light weightSuper fastFinger touch unlock is super fastDislike:180 hinges are missingOpening lid is not designed properly, bit difficult to open the lid"
3,"Pros:It is light weight, good graphics and configuration.Cons:But not worth of the cost. The touch pad is pathetic and very unconfortable to use.Battery life ok not great. Camera quality not good.Over all this was my first HP buy!. Earlier I had Dell laptop and comparatuvely HP has very delicate and no fun Hardware. I regreting the deciaion to opt HP!!"
5,"An Amazing product from HP. Laptop was delivered today as promised by Amazon.A 16GB RAM, Intel i5-11th Gen processor, with 512 GB SSD with IRIS integrated graphics , FHD display, backlit keyboard...what else we need in a laptop which costs less than 65k cost?Looks premium.I searched all the ecommerce portals and even visited the stores, couldn't find a 16GB RAM laptop with in 65k budget.5stars for HP pavilion 14 laptop and 5 stars for Amazon :)"
4,This is my first laptop and i love it !... It turn on within in fraction of seconds..Pros :1) 16 gigs of RAM & i 5 11 gen processor gives the butter smooth experience.2) Excellent battery lifeCons:Touch pad should be more precise
4,"Very good laptop, very light weight so can easily care and operate with single hand.Battery life is okay as of now.Brightness is also okay not so bright.Sound disappointed as it’s not that great it’s hardly manageable at this price point.Overall good laptop.And yes, type-c port supports charging also so this is something cool 😊"
5,"So far, so good.Things that could've improved:Screen quality and brightnessCameraKeyboard tactile feedbackFingerprint reader"
4,Writing review after a week of using my beautiful slim light weight laptop.No need to describe much as I found no cons in this laptop functioning nice no issues till now price might be a bit high but overall I found very nice and handy laptop for all students and study purpose and using software applications running smooth.
4,"I am using it for two months, mainly for work from home and for browsing purpose.  I have viewed movies also. finger reader is very fast.  battery normal.  4-5 hours capacity. sound is loud though I prefer bluetooth speaker for watching movies on laptop.  Overall it fulfills my expectations."
5,"Before ordering the Laptop, I prayed to god to send me the perfect laptop without needing to contact the seller or the HP. and Yes, my prayed were answered. The Laptop works as expected - audio, camera, speed (as it has 16 GB RAM). Thanks HP and Amazon."
1,"First, Notebook is Over HeatingSecond,  Notebook is not openingI am fully unsatisfied"
5,"As of now, it's working fast and fingerprint scanner is also quick."
3,The system heats up a lot during normal usage or even when kept idle. Rest all seems ok as of now. Boots fast and good at multitask. Expected a privacy shutter for web cam at this price. Privacy concerned people pls buy one from amazon.
5,Very good product in this price range . Smooth and light weight. Easy to carry. If any one has the budget he should buy it .
5,"Amazing product, it's slim and build quality is also good!! Just has little heating issues usual than normalOverall loved itSound quality and heating is a draw back"
3,The only thing that i dont like is the heating it produces under the laptop and sometimes it gets heated from top as well i.e area around keyboard.Other then this i like this laptop. Battery life is around 4-5 hrs minimum  if you are continuously working. Design is lit. Its thin and looks cool!
5,"Product is real good in terms of processing speed. Also,  I would say it's light weight and sleek. Flawless fingerprint scanner."
4,Awesome laptop along with perfect configuration at this price. However due to its metallic build there might be chances of heating at the right side bottom part so better use laptop stand to stave off heating. Rest all good so go and grab if interested
5,"All good for the budget. The laptop built material is not that good. The upper body is shaking when you work in front cooler, of course not a major issue but shows the quality of material. Laptop is super fast but at times it hangs for a second, say one in 25 times. Absolute peach for students."
5,Performance is really fastBattery lasts 6 to 7 hoursDisplay quality excellentI just loved backlit keyboardLight weightPremium lookBlindly go for it
4,Perfect Pack.  Go for it.-Charging through type-c only when powered off.-currently B&O doesn't support headphone
5,Super awesome laptop....runs smoothly ...valorant runs on it like fluid...just amazing
4,"I'm using this for past 1 week without any issues. Overall product is good with smooth performance, good resolution, pre-installed MS products etc. Could have been better with backlit keyboard, finger sensor & camera cover option which is available in 15"" inch variant."
5,"Light weight,smooth to work , processing is better"
1,It says Full HD screen and they delivered with a HD Ready screen.My mistake is that I didn't search for the model no and check on hp website.
1,"Truly disappointed with HP . Its a corei5 11th gen laptop, which heats up like old amd laptops. I urge everyone not to go for this one. HP need to think and change this model. Thanks to Amazon for accepting the return"
1,Worst ever product i got it... They mentioned processer is 4.2GHz in specification and when it came it was 2.42GHz ....and when replaced that same product came with 4.2GHz.And now when i am calling to return it no one is receiving call..... Even with app also i am not able to place return order it says to contact us and which again does not get connected... Really frustrated with such service
4,Awesome laptopGood for engineering students.we bought it for my brother's 18th birthday. He is going to go into it so a really good hit. light weight. smooth like butter.*army refrence* go for it
5,"Very good product. After switching on it gets ready to use in less than 10 seconds and gets switch off in less than 5 seconds. Using multiple tabs at a time does not make anything slow. Heavy word, excel and PowerPoint usage is also smooth. Product is recent launch in 2021 and very useful in working from home or for online tasks. Best value for money. I exchanged by Dell laptop which was i3 and 4gb ram and was very slow. For any decent use the minimum requirement is i5 with 8gb ram and in this product the SSD, turbo boost and graphics card makes it much faster. Full HD resolution gives super picture quality."
3,"There has been an incorrect description of this product.  The display quality of the is really bad and strain to eyes, one can not use for a longer time.  Please be watchful before buying it.  We did not have the IPS version and opted for the Full HD version but it is nowhere near that.  If you are going to use a Laptop screen for primary display purposes, this laptop is not ideal.  The description should be fixed ASAP."
5,The product is truly awesome. One cons that i observed is during the video calls the laptop heats up higher than usual.
5,"First of all this is a very very good looking laptop. The size is absolutely perfect and the screen is amazing, not anti glare though. The processor does its job without any hiccups and battery gives back-up for 5-5.30 hours. SSD with NVMe interface is very fast and I did not experience any heating issue as such. It comes with MS Windows 10 Home and MS Office with lifetime validity. Overall this will be a good choice for anyone who is looking for a lightweight and compact laptop with amazing performance for work or study purpose."
4,"Bought this laptop for my kids to attend online classes. Fast booting in 10 secs and smooth operation. Compared other brand models in the same range, less features.  No fingerprint reader ord keyboard back-light. Sturdy look, Good display."
1,"Received this laptop on Friday, n on next day Saturday it didn't boot up, hard disk error. Had to call HP service center, now I'm waiting for the technician to come n seal the device n get some letter before I could approach Amazon for replacement.."
1,I am very disappointed with this laptop because. I got the replaced product. But it is very very worst product ever. Please don't buy this laptop. Heating Issues + charger Heating Issue + laptop hang issue. This laptop battery is working only upto 3 hrs. Worst class Laptop😡😡
1,I was already requested for return.1. Laptop is overwhelming issue.2. As mentioned in specification processor speed is not matching with delivered item.
1,Battery life extremely poor. Keys are depressed at left and right side. Heats up quickky. Have bought laptops from amazon before but this has been a bad experience.
5,It’s been 3days device is quite fast and it’s a great experience till now let’s see how it goes further.Recommended from my side if someone is confused don’t be go for it.👍🏻
5,Good quality lappy for students as well as for gamers. I5 processor brings in the speed which makes it a worth buy.
2,"Performance is good, lightweight and fast, but even if there is no program is running, it starts to overheat. Battery backup is very less (3-4 hours only) about half the time boasted on the website. I do not recommend this"
5,"Light weight, easy to carry, anti glare screen, and intel iris xe graphics, overall  very good product. Worth of money."
5,"HP laptops are always awesome, go for it without any hesitation. 👍👍"
2,Poor battery performance
4,"This is a very good laptop,it's light weight,doesn't hang in betwee like our older laptop,it's good for gaming and fortnite works just fine on it.I would highly recommend this laptop,and its value for money."
5,Products is awesome. All the things of this laptop is good. Nice battery backup around 7hrs.
4,Good product. Only drawback I learnt is it can't be extended for Warranty which is disappointing.Seller shud be more clear while selling. As customers we expect transparency.
3,Got the laptop with a  clearly visible dent on its bodyNot so satisfied with that
5,Good
1,"Laptop is not upto the mark as expected, heating problem and charging is getting over easily, camera is not good..don't buy."

4,Good with light weight
4,Everything is fine..but camera quality is not good
5,Like
4,"Very slim ,light weight easily carry in traveling.Good battery time.....Min 5hrsFor office use best one."
5,"I bought this exchanging my Acer Aspire V5 intel i3 laptop since Pentium Gold processor is almost same, except for lesser L3 cache memory (3 MB to 2 MB).There is absolutely no heating or any other issues due to SSD. This fits my requirement of day to day browsing, reading, videos etc.  Very good laptop for this price.Good price for old laptop & card discount from ICICI due to Diwali sale."
5,"initial impression is excellent...light weight,thin,travel friendly.Super fast booting,due to ssd. hop this laptop last long.lets see what happen due to corse of time."
4,"I am a Computer Technician, and i have purchased and configured 5 of these. 2 were purchased from Amazon.Key Points.1) Initial Setup takes around 40 minutes but after that2) LAPTOP BOOTS IN LESS THAN 10 SECONDS (5 seconds frankly)Yes this laptop is Super FAST, because of its m.2 ssd.3) Clients with 3rd and 4th generation Core i5 laptops with 8 GB Rams couldnt spot the Difference in speeds. You are basically comparing a 45000rs - 65000rs year 2015 Laptops with a 2020, 30000rs. Which is just 2 core 2mb cache. Still is fast.. Thank you m.24) Recomended for people who want a Blazing fast laptop for Surfing, working on Excel, word.This laptop has1) License Lifetime Original Windows2) License for 1 year Microsoft Office student edition (word excel one note)3) has a 250 GB m.2 SSD Storage. (BLAZING FAST)4) Single Slot 4 GB Ram (If you want to upgrade to 16 GB.. its going to be a Difficult Turn)Word of Advice.1) IF you work simultaeously on Multiple Softwares. like 6 -  10 Excel sheets or heavy programmes like Adobe, then you may consider skipping this laptop as the RAM is just 4 gb2) Only Intel graphics but Old adobe and basic 3d softwares below 2018 works.Its a Value for Money. I am waiting for Competition like DELL and LENOVO to launch their varients so prices will drop. in 2 years."
1,"Worst service from Amazon and the seller. After buying this laptop I found that it's not suitable for running Android studio and I wanted to return it to get a higher configuration laptop but to my surprise I can't return it, the very next day. I was in the impression that we can return any item on Amazon but that was my biggest mistake and I lost 25k. This laptop is useless for me. Not happy at all."
5,"I am writing this review after using the laptop for one month.1) The MS office 2019 is original , just activate when you recieve it by login into your microsoft account. If you don't have a microsoft account create it.2) The laptop boots in just 3 to 4 second. It is very fast on SSD.3) The shutdown also takes just 3 second, thus you save your valuable time.4) The processing is also very reasonable and good at this price.5) It work for about 7 hour in one charge.6) Autocad 2017 is working fine on it.7) Overall the performance of the laptop is very good.One can buy it without any doubts."
5,"It's Amazing! I have never ever thought the SSD can be so fast that the Windows will boot In just 5 seconds!I Really Loved the HP Laptop with Windows 10 Home + Office 2019 Students already included lifetime.The only reason for choosing this Laptop over the One with Ryzen A9 APU available on other ecommerce site, & choosing the Pentium 4417U is that, it's faster than the Ryzen.I really love this lightweight laptop & it's compactness makes it worth.This laptop is really great if you want windows office and a powerful processor with SSD in this segment of upto ₹28,000 /-"
1,This is very bad product from Amazon there is no bill and window is local . it hangs full time I want a complete solution regarding this
1,Sound problem
5,"Purchased this laptop on 29th October 2019.Writing a review after almost 1 year of usage. To start with this laptop is very quick to start when powered on, hardly takes 5 seconds to start up.Great for those with basic requirements like daily surfing, Watching movies, MS office, Excel, Powerpoint and basic editing tasks. Due to SSD it works like charm.Pros- SSD makes it pretty fast with 5-7 seconds boot and start time. (I checked higher end models in shops but could not find one that starts as quickly this)- Light weight, this is pretty light and easy to carry, my earlier samsung laptop used to weigh almost 2 kgs and this slim trim piece comes as a delight to me in terms of weight.- Great battery life, haven't found any problems with battery life till now. It works 6-8 hours on a single charge easily. For me it is on almost for the entire day and it still works great.- Great volume, I am yet to see a laptop with so crystal clear sound. Most laptops have very low volume.- Got windows 10 and MS office students version license with it which is great add-on at this price point. (many higher priced laptops also don't provide this).Cons- Well almost none for me considering my requirements but you can find difficulties with viewing angles and screen resolution while watching movies, but I have no complains for it at this price point.ConclusionA great value for money laptop at this price point, After one year I can say that I am pretty happy with the purchase."
1,One of the worst company and laptop available on Amazon...laptop is not working after 6 month use..and worst part is hp customer support they will first waste ur 4-5 days by just doing similar troubleshooting then send some moron technician again this cycle will go on but the problem of laptop will never be resolved...so never buy this laptop
1,Microsoft not working properly. Is it a defective piece
5,Writing this review after 6 months use. Got it for my daughters online classes. No problem till now. Start and shut down in 2 sec.. pretty fast.Pls go for it if you want basic laptop for regular use and browsing.Preinstalled Microsoft Office is a plus.Only con is Camera is very bad but its ok for me coz i don't use it.
1,Price wise it is a good buy. Major drawback is outer body build quality as the body is not metallic and feels more like card board type. Also battery cannot be removed from outside. It is made in China.
5,Delivered one day earlier. Windows 10 and MS office Home & Student activated easily.USB ports are very tightly fitting. Speakers quality just good. Battery approx 5 hours.Reviewed after one day of use.
1,This is a very bad laptop. Do not take it. It hangs and stops running. I have been compelled on amazon many times but they have taken it so far
1,This  is very very low class product. not working perfectly. hanging in the middle of the programme.  customer care is not responding. i made big mistake for buying this product.
1,Don't buy this product.. Return policy is not available.
1,Its slow as hell and also only after using for 10 days the alphabet markings are rubbing off and disappearing from the keys on keyboard. A very sub standard product.
5,"The processor is so fast , it's really good for office work and watching movies go for it..."
1,"Cant believe it's a HP Laptop. I don't think people should consider buying Laptop from Amazon.Amazon team don't take any accountability post the Product is sold. They sell through Partners and possibly fake products. The HP laptop INR >25K didnot last even for 3 months.Few pointers,- The Laptop didnot have a Serial Number (there is NO sticker label pasted on the body of the Laptop).- Thereafter I called up Amazon and raised this issue ... at first they did not acknowledge the problem. Finally, they accepted. However, NO resolution was provided.- Performance of the Laptop - the less you talk about it , the better it's. Its pathetically slow and HDD has already crashed. In terms of Config, it's 4GB/1TB HDD however the performance is worse than my 4 early old Laptop.It was a terrible experience for me. People should reconsider before buying from Amazon."
5,"Its a good student laptop and you can go for it.Not for gaming or running too much of multi-tasking. Support mentions it can be upgraded to 8GB RAM , still need to check it out. RAM slot support mentions is 1 but shows 2 on the system properties.Overall a good laptop for this price and its light weight too."
5,"Excellent laptop. Beats macbook air in every department other than battery life, which is about 7 hours. Reviewed after six months usage"
3,"Really a good but not wonderful product, backup is great, charging very fast, windows 10 is licensed and free forever, MS Office is not free. It boots not very fast, we can attent phone calls, sms of phone, photos on phone very easily, need not go and take your phone to attend or make calls or sms. It is not for gaming or movies, though good enough for YouTube etc. Need patience to wait for opening apps like skype, trello, hunter, even note pad opens very slow."
5,Just few days but in love with the product ... its light and i like the large fonts on the keypad ... pre installed windows 10 and its easy to set up .. I m Loving IT ;)
2,"I bought this laptop 4 days ago and I found laptop is not worthy for use, even you can not  run properly word, excel  and othe file ,very very slow it will take time each and every single time, you can't play games, if you install game in laptop it will start hanging immediately unless you have to uninstall the game, you can not add extra ram because they don't have provided extra ram slot, even there is not extra slot to add SDD,  there is no fan in laptop for cooling and once you buy this laptop you can not refund your money only replacement with same piece even if you want to return and add extra money to but another you can't. Please I suggest if anybody is willing to buy this laptop plz don't buy you regret it 100% so please don't buy."
4,"If you are looking for a laptop for work from home or office use you should go for it without a second thought. Because of its great battery backup and speed due to SSD. Also it's lightweight and good looking too.But if you are looking for a laptop which should be both good for Work and Gaming you should consider buying another one, because of its low processor and graphics card. It's not good for gaming. You will get good average gaming laptops with more specifications under 40 - 50K if you are lucky."
1,"I don’t know where to start. I have never expected a laptop manufactured during the last decade to be this slow.Looking at the spec, I recommended this laptop to my friend as he just wanted a smooth functioning laptop for very basic usage. We got the delivery on time with a good packaging however the very first time we turned on the machine it took forever. I told him since it’s the first boot it might have taken time but updating the windows updates would fix it.It’s been more than a month now, no sign of any improvement. My 11 year old MacBook works like a charm in comparison with this Pathetic laptop.(I know this very absurd comparison)We already lost the return window and have no idea how to go about with it.The worse purchase I’ve ever made on Amazon.I urge people to go through reviews properly before making a decision which you’d regret."
1,Reveiw after 10 days :Worst Don't buy these kind of productsBattery life 1hrHanging for every 1 secBooting time 10 mntsHeating = You can cook anythingFinally Worst.. Worst... Worst...This reveiw is from IT employee (ME) in INFOSYS BPM LMT Banglore..If you still want to buy... Sure you can...
4,"Pros:-  It is really very light weight  Its very fast alsoIf you don't require much space go with this  it prodiess awesome speed ,Boot ups in 5 sec ,Cons:-  You have to  compromise with storageBut a external hard drive would work goodNo fingerprint of face id ,Lower processor, But overall value for money, and its quality is also good ,(Review after one day of usage)"
1,"Worse laptop ever ,sound n video quality is good for zoom class ,but the system always keeping on hanging jad to call sopport ,have no proper response as well ,not able to open 2 windows as it's always been gating hanged so frustrating this laptop is ,please go for dell I have brought a dell 5 years back still working amazingly, unfortunately I had left that at home brought this hp product to do my work .worse experience ever ."
5,"It is very fast and light weight laptop. I recommend this, because of value of money. It is really faster than i3 laptops. Good to go..."
1,This laptop has stopped working just after using it for two weeks. I do not know if this is a fake product.
1,"The product is slow like a turtle. Shame on the professor. Only good for browsing, that too takes long because of entered words to appear, or to open chrome🙆‍♂️ I can't believe I just lost 25K for this"
5,"The Laptop is quite light and very fast, especially when starting the OS. The only con is the storage space when compared to the traditional drives, which again is a part of the specification. Overall a good buy!"
4,Small product and on the laptop body there designing gripAnd it's SSD drive is awesome it takes max 3-4 second for startup and max 2 second for shutdownThis is happening coz of ssd drive I suggest u to if u have basic use then go for it
2,"Not saying it's completely waste, i trust hp for laptops from years, as i have 2 already at home. But particularly this model performance is below par considering the specifications, should've gone for Intel processor rather than amd. *lags too much, high end softwares like autocad, sketch, coral draw, photoshop isn't compatible or recommended for this variant, it sucks!*The only solution for lagging on this model is, you've to insert atleast 240GB SSD for smooth experience which cost around 3500/-"
1,Got this laptop yesterday and used for 1 day. Its total waste of money. Its cpu is so low such that even if you open a chrome its showing 100% usage. Bought it for my kids online class but google meet is hanging completely if you open video. You need to power off the laptop to get out of meeting.  Its too low only fit for MS word or note pad activity.I called every customer care to check whether its possible to upgrade but none helping.Total waste of money never buy it.
2,this product didnot work properly according to my desires
3,"Don't get carried away by price . Not suitable for graphic designers, anyone into photoshop of visual mediums through computer..graphics are terrible, colors are muddled and dark.I should have.done better research.What I do like about it is it's very light weight and airy !"
1,"इसे खरीदकर मैं खुद को ठगा सा महसूस कर रहा हूँ। 27500 रुपये का पूरा नुकसान हुआ। कंपनी ने हमें बेवकूफ बनाया। अगर सच कहूं तो कोई मुफ्त में भी दे तो भी ये लैपटॉप लेने लायक नहीं है। बिल्कुल बेकार प्रोडक्ट, ऐसी कोई समस्या नहीं जो इस लैपटॉप में नहीं है, इसे खरीदने से बेहतर है कि उस पैसे को कहीं दान कर दिया जाय।"
1,Don't buy these product as it is total cheap qualityWaste of money
5,Does not have a built in wireless router. Got fooled by their marketing pitch. Pathetic. Need to buy separately. Disappointed. They are selling laptops without router. Real desperate sellers indeed. Imagine selling a laptop without internet connectivity. Laptop is Intermet readybut no internet connectivity so actually no Internet what soever
1,I bought the laptop but its not charging by its charger at all..Brand new item having charger fault.And replacement by amazon not done in more than 10 days. Even  I am a prime user
1,"Totally wrost product. Don’t buy this product otherwise you’ll feel you have wasted your money on this product. I’m going to sell this product, if anyone interested contact me please."
1,Laptop 15 Intel pentium Gold 6405u has pathetic processor is very slow one's you upload the windows 95% space is captured and system is getting slow.Customer service of HP Laptop is not promisable. I have ruined my 3 consecutive days to had whatsapp conversations and calls they not provided any solution.My time and money completely wasteSuggest to not buy HP Laptops with such bad service.
3,"For whatever the price quoted it seems the performance seems to be ok. But, the display is not acceptable. Seems kind of cheap display and brightness controlling is very bad. It is too bright and it you try to adjust you can't see the content.Disappointed with screen."
2,"1) Though processor is not premium, I wasn't expecting it to be too slow. Slowness is one problem.2) Wifi issue, I am not sure what contributes to this problem but it is there. I was able to connect to wifi initially and later after restart it was not getting connected. Very annoying. All the other devices at home are connected to wifi bar this annoying  laptop.3) What can you do with laptop without internet??4) I tried to leave review earlier but then amazon has removed this product from list."
5,"I exchaged this with my 3rd generation i5 laptop. And belive me it's faster.Petium gold is as same as 10th generation i3 processor.10th genration ,good screen,1tb ,4gb RAM, descent battery life, big brand value.You're getting these features under 26K.On of the Best laptop under the range of 35k."
1,"It was written that this laptop comes with preloaded window 10 with Lifetime validity. However this is not true as, after few days of usage mgs from Microsoft stated appearing to buy Microsoft word and our word, excel and PowerPoint has stop functioning. Even the HP support team told me that HP does not sell laptops with window for lifetime validity. Feel like being cheated."
1,"After using 7 days posting the review, worst performance too much of hang, battery life is not good, even camera not working."
1,"इसे खरीदकर मैं खुद को ठगा सा महसूस कर रहा हूँ। 27500 रुपये का पूरा नुकसान हुआ। कंपनी ने हमें बेवकूफ बनाया। अगर सच कहूं तो कोई मुफ्त में भी दे तो भी ये लैपटॉप लेने लायक नहीं है। बिल्कुल बेकार प्रोडक्ट, ऐसी कोई समस्या नहीं जो इस लैपटॉप में नहीं है, इसे खरीदने से बेहतर है कि उस पैसे को कहीं दान कर दिया जाय।"
5,If you are a noob with the lap and you are into studies this thing is enough. Its a Pentium gold and sometimes it runs on space time and won't sync with Earth time.Need some time for heat up and then it's like -I'm speed.didn't tried gaming on it.Worth for what we pay comparing to market.we can't get i3 for this price and no Full HD display. So no choice. That's ur that's the my review on this.
1,"The laptop is extremely slow maybe due to processor speed or Ram memory or both.I would have given it zero rating if possible. My money went down the drain.I should have spent a bit higher and gone for a better laptop. Now I am left with a useless piece worth Rs 30,000."
4,Good laptops but i don't suggest you to buy it if you are going to spend approx 26500/-. The laptop is slow .I'll suggest to buy i3 laptops (as you are going to spend 26500) or  buy Pentium Gold under 22000.
3,Hardware wise it's a perfect laptop. But after a week of use I'm disappointed that it's slow. Actually it's very slow.
1,The laptop is very slow. The body is not appear sturdy. the laptop plastic body go in when held from the sides. There is glue oozing out of the edges of the monitor screen.
5,Best performance quality hp productThis product best for students purpose& good battery performance
5,Good!
4,It's a good product.The battery life is to be extended and no issues about the material.
2,It's hanging and taking more time to access. .. Windows 10 consume more RAM. So 4 GB ram is not enough ..I purchased in the month of February 1 at week...2 Nd week Onwards problem started.. Very disappointed
4,It's really a nice product on Amazon
1,"Seller sent me a used laptop ,from touchpad any body can see the mark of using , build quality is very poor , I think it's a refurbished item , but company tells it's a new product. Very bad experience ."
3,Battery back up is not good at all.Price is okay.
3,Not satisfied with battery life
4,"All things are good special battery and speakers, but performance is little bit slow,But no worries because you can add SSD in this device if you required speedy performance."
1,"Please call me ASAP, the laptop is really in bad condition, it keeps on hanging and there is literally nothing in it right now. It's a new laptop. It's refresh rate is also too slow."
3,Product for childrenSpeed is slow
5,Nce product

3,Except RAM it is ok..speed is very very slow

1,Ordered for daughters school hardly used for a week. Not switching on. Need a replavementVery bad . 1st bad experience from Amazon
1,"bahut hi kharab product,Amzon ki traf se koi resposble person madad nahi kar raha hai product wapsi ke liye,2 june se continew resudule picup ho raha hai......"
1,Was not expecting this kind of performance from an intel processor. It take nearly 5 min for the laptop to boot. Worst decision to buy this laptop
4,"I have bought it a month ago. It's amazing. No problem at all, enjoying my online classes. Smooth working and stylish. Budget laptop."
3,Accessories not available in box
5,Nice products awesome 😍 nice performance battery life 👍🏻 all other nice
5,"Awesome Product in affordable price.fullfills all daily requirements ,I am attending online training ,browsing n editing documents in same time.thanks Amazon"
1,Its only been 9 days since I got this product and the screen goes entirely dark once the Lenovo logo disappears. There is no direct way to reach the seller or support helpline as well. The school starts in 5 days and due to this there is a genuine concern that my daughter might miss lessons. Someone needs to support and help asap
2,Laptop bag missing
1,"This laptop comes without basic, m.s. office, which ends up giving every year cost of addtional 5000 plus to use this laptop"
4,this laptop is good no problem so far i can use this for work but i can't use it to play games it stutters a bit but no problem with old games :) and no problem while doing work for the price i gave you guys i think its not bad! good work 😀
4,"The performance is very good and it is fast. All features are good and as per the cost price, it is value for money, can't expect more for this price. However, the webcam resolution is a bit weak not giving a sharper picture but all in all, can't complain. I suggest going for it."
1,Ear jack is not working while inserting the ear plugs. Can it be justifiable.
3,"Package is almost open and deboy not coprate, and company also play game with me, regarding window 10 ,here no any app window, exale and note pad work.. Company  promise to give window 10 but not pre  installallation mother given any hard copy and soft  copy link.. Why cheat with client. It's not good... It's is a dabba without window 10...."
3,"It just a replacement for Tab and Mobile. If you are looking this laptop for Kids school purpose or office purpose then its processor is not so upto the mark. You cant keep multiple big file, multiple application  open and do video chat. Yes but its good if you want to have limited use like web surfing or need key board who are not comfortable using tabs."
5,I bough this for my wife for online classes. This is a budget buy and the product looks superb. She is very excited and using it since then without any issues.Its boots faster as it has ssd and the laptop has a censor. So when ever you opens the laptop it boots immediately without any lagging.Thank you amazon for providing such a beautiful piece of craft.
1,"Third class item, gets hanged every now and then, even only with MS Package"
5,Bought for my 3 year old online class. It works perfectly for that purpose and I don't use for any other purposes  just zoom meetings for daughter and little bit browsing. It's broad for my kid to view the camera. Speaker sound quality is average only. Light weight and suits my purpose
3,"This laptop Only basic usage.Display View angle are wrost,Sound is Good.Battery backup Nice."
4,For moderate coding you can use this laptop.I will not recommend it for gaming.For daily home use it is fab.Ssd storage(only 237 gb) makes its operation fast.
5,Don't think about other reviews I also thinked about and I had confused but it forcely ordered it it is very good product and so many reviews has a issue that there is no sound quality . For this issue u want to change the Dolby audio settings it is good for gaming .value of money don't think about another reviews just buy it picture is suprb it is very light weight (slim3)
3,Slim n thin laptop for badic daily use.. battery is average drains fast
4,All are good but Adapter slot is not a fully insertable one. Only 1/3 part of adapter can be interested that is why almost part of memory adapter is seen outside.
2,Not like
5,Its a laptop with all required feature to get started and just value for money go for it and you will like it.. Thanks fforFree for such amazing deal
4,Good screen size and good internet connection. Moves bewteen tge tabs easily.  The keypad is swift. Good for attending online classroom
4,For the price of the laptop it is very good.
5,Awesome product

3,Worst display and poor audio and heating issues more .I never recommend this lapi to anyone
4,"After initial hiccups on Warranty and ADP, able to use the laptop for few days and it has excellent performance and elegant look. Really good quality in this price for a such configuration. Liked it!!"
1,"Do not buy this laptop from here. They are trying to get rid of their faulty stock. Read in another review that the person got faulty machine and he got a replacement. Thought it might be a one off. I was also sent a faulty laptop when I ordered...pixels were not lighting up properly in a spot. I was able  to apply for a replacement but they messed up the details of the laptop they were picking up from me. I spent about an hour with the delivery person trying to resolve it, with him on his phone talking to his Amazon contacts and me on my phone with Amazon customer care but they were not able to fix it. So be prepared for the replacement to be delayed as well, when you get the faulty laptop. Also, if you paid extra for one/same day delivery, it is not refunded in case you have to return the laptop. So you pay extra money and still can't use the laptop as soon as you expected it to.The replacement they gave me was also faulty...one of the letters in the logo on the back of the screen was missing(the glue came off or wasn't stuck there properly during manufacturing). So again talked to customer care about this. They said they can refund my money but not fix the machine or replace it(replacement limit is one).So you will have to buy the laptop again if you get a faulty machine as replacement and no guarantee that second time you order, you won't get a faulty machine. This is because they might send you someone else's rejected machine or one from their faulty stock where they have not even done basic quality checks like looking for visible exterior damage or screen issues. This is something they definitely check for, if you are exchanging your old phone/laptop/other electronics.I am going to try to use the Lenovo warranty to get the issue fixed and hoping some other issues don't pop up."
1,"My office 2019 is not installed, and neither lenovo is helping me to do this nor the seller, to solve the problem."
2,"Product seriously heating up at least the one I got ! Even if I do nothing, laptop's Fan is still working and the heat comes only from 1 of the 2 grills !Other than that I literally don't have any complaints."
4,Lenovo really nailed it. First charge may heat your laptop more. After subsequent uses it reduces heat up issue and also improves battery life. Battery life>11hr i tested it. it is increasing day by day. initially it gave me <8hr backup but now it is giving me almost 12hrs backup.Only once concern- i can not switch off touch pen.
1,Worst please don't buy
4,"I brought this laptop, but it was having a manufacturing defect, its sound speakers were blown and. But overall product was in good quality.I rated this as 4 star just becoz. The AMAZON replaced this laptop for new one and i am very much satisfied to their service.The replacement was done within 5 days. And the new product is working good for now."
5,"It is powerful yet sophisticated...Firstly, the fabric cover does gives it an unique look. It also provides a good grip while carrying it in hand. The Ryzen 7 4000 series along with the ram is pretty fast. In terms of display quality, battery life, audio intensity, touch and stylus: the experience is amazing. The keyboard has a great travel, touchpad is quite smooth and the fingerprint sensor makes switching on to the system effortless. And I could just go on with the features... also I've been using it for around 2 weeks now... and I haven't confronted any such cons to be mentioned...Overall it's a really good laptop and worth it's price, in my opinion."
5,"Look wise it's so good. Performance is as expected but heating problem is there. Even for one hour usage, producing more heat and not able to keep on my lap."
5,So far it is a super fast laptop. I have installed several softwares for doing software development work. Laptop doesn’t lag at all.
5,Perfectly meets my requirements
1,Amazon shipped defective product and now i am struggling for refund.
4,"I ordered this laptop from the lenovo website during its pre-booking. Got a wireless mouse and backpack for Rs.1/- each and the laptop for Rs.77,000/- after applying some bank offer. Now coming to the laptop itself, this is how I'd score it:Build Quality:  4.0/5Screen:  4.5/5Keyboard:  4.2/5Sound:  4.0/5Battery Backup:  5/5Performance:  4.8/5Pros:- An awesome processor (Ryzen 7 4700U 8 cores and 8 threads) runs everything smoothly. Be it multiple chrome tabs or adobe softwares like photoshop and illustrator. It's not a gaming laptop but you can do casual gaming on it.- The fabric cover on the lid gives it a unique look. Overall a premium looking device.- Decent keyboard to type on and the sound from speakers is above average.- Hinge is good and sturdy. Better than the one on HP Envy x360.- Type C charging.- Great battery backup. I was comfortably getting more than 9 hrs. by doing normal usage (browsing web, running YouTube, watching movies).- Privacy shutter on the webcam is a nice feature. I think more laptop manufacturers should implement this.Cons:- The keyboard deck flexes a lot. The top is aluminum but bottom is PC + ABS plastic. It is a good quality soft-touch plastic though. Would've loved to see an all metal body at this price.- Ports selection is limited. No SD/microSD card slot.- Webcam quality is just like any other laptop. Will get your work done (Google meet/zoom/team meetings).- No Windows hello facial recognition (Only fingerprint scanner which works fast & precisely, no complaints there).P.S. This laptop comes with a lenovo pen which runs on a single AAAA battery (not rechargeable obviously). It has pretty low latency and supports pressure sensitivity."
1,"I’ve purchased this laptop from UK. It’s touch screen stopped working within 6months of purchase. It’s battery is not upto the mark as well, it didn’t last over 3hrs."
5,"I have not seen a laptop like this before. It comes with a blue fabric finish on the top which looks really unique. Its really awesome. You have to see it to believe it. The laptop is super fast with the Ryzen 7 CPU with 8 cores and 16 threads. Overall, I am in love with the laptop and would recommend it to any one who wants to purchase a lifestyle product. Definitely worth the money."
5,Bought it from Lenovo. Got 3 years ADP for 1499 only. No issues what so ever. Speaker volume is a bit on the lower side however it does not matter to me as I use it for work. For few who watch Netflix it may be considered low. I did read few reviews people mentioned it over heats however I am not sure why they need to burn there laps. Keep it on table man. Moreover if the guys are talking about the fan remember its AMD. My other machine is i7 and it makes noise too. Go for it guys.
1,"Never buy a lenovo product ,They don't have any after sale support ,They just want to sell the cheap quality product and then there is no support if there is any problem"
4,Very slow and not good 8gb ram  according speed very slow and hang bad laptop plz don't money west
1,Really hate the product. Its wastage of money. Its taking too long to start and its making a wierd noice in the background its too heavy and large and is not handy at ol.worst part is that they are not even ready to refund nor replace. Really pissed off
5,The Product Worth it
1,Please don't buy this laptop. The screen keeps freezing. I bought this laptop for my daughters online classes but every 15-20mins whether using zoom or Microsoft teams it keeps freezing. Processor is too slow.  Was coming back to HP brand after a gap of 10 years but this has reminded me that why I stayed away all these years. Please do not waste your hard earned money on this.
2,This is  a review after more than 6 months of usage.I had an azuz laptop. But since I had many problems while operating it I ordered this one. At first it was good But now it keeps switching off at times. At first had 9 hR battery now only 3-4 hrs. Not happy with the purchase.
4,"I purchased GR0011AU (1TB HDD no SSD, Ryzen 3 3250). Economical Laptop with decent performance. Battery backup around 5.5 to 6 hrs on streaming video via wifi and general browsing.  I avoided purchasing extended warranty online. Instead buy from the HP helpline (number attached in photo).  Registration and setup of MS Office Home and Student 2019 is tricky as the laptop has Office 365 installed as default. This (365) has to be uninstalled and the Office H&S 2019 image (3.5GB) has to be downloaded and set up. I am doing it all through the HP helpline and they are helpful.. Overall  decent/good laptop for my basic requirements and very good customer support, atleast during setup."
4,"After using it from last 40 days, I have observed all it's aspects deeply.At this prize laptop looks premium. Amazing Design, I got latop with in 3 days  today. It has Magnificent Processor... Amazing Display.. Easy to use.  Battery is also Good. Smooth Touch pad. Overall a genniune Product for Educational and Business Purpose. Go for It.If you want to get more advanced product just add some SDD....Minnor Issue:- It's making some noise while running over internet."
4,"Firstly for the correct information of all potential buyers - I have had a good experience of HP laptops. Secondly i had budget constraints (below 35k)... so I had to go for one with only HDD, not SSD. I would have loved hybrid types as those work excellent.Thus I opted for this laptop with no SSD, only 1TB HDD, however i preferred 8GB RAM...it has been 3 days and we have been using it for Zoom long meetings..and general surfing (no multimedia use yet). So far there are no visible issues. The fan sometimes gives out a slight burning smell and I assume it is because the circuitry is new... I shall monitor for more days and give another review on this.The laptop's nice feature is the CORTANA support by which windows got configured smoothly, with little intervention. it did take lot of time to boot initially, but now boots up fine....Havent faced any sound or heat issues yet.Screen output quality could have been better..... to get the optimum brightness you have to raise the brightness to almost the limit.Sound output is not that great.....so far so good. will post again after a month of use."
3,"Pros:Display quality.Light weight.Decent sound.Good performance as per it's hardware.Cons:One main thing is it's GPU is shared memory not dedicated. Almost  2GB ram will allocated for Graphics. Felt like 4gb even it's 5.9gb usable.Design flaws are there, rough edges like unfinished .Heat vent is placed at bottom, so we have to keep alway on flat surface.Very thin bezel around display."
1,laptop is hanging if we install more products
4,Looks good 🙂😊
1,A used product that was damaged was delivered. Absolutely appalled by this service & I can't believe a new product paid for in full was delivered in this condition
4,Products is good....i am satisfied.....but not very first...it takes time to open a exel file.... Battery brkup good.....other facility also satisfying.
5,"After seeing the reviews I was confused. But I decided to go for this and it got delivered within 1 day. I really liked this product. Looks premium, built quality is also good and also fast. It's a good laptop under 36k. As of now, this is my review and if there will be any issue, will let you know."
5,"I bought recently and was not disappointed with the product at all. However if you are looking for a product that supports accounting software, etc, please buy a bit higher range. Laptop is more or less fast with good screen quality. Video conferencing is easy on this laptop. Graphic card is high so gaming is good too. Overall satisfied and good for students👍🏻😊"
1,Too slow and takes time to get start. If you are working on more than 2 virtual box machine then you will have worst experience ever. Machine gets hanged and restart several time.Not worth it & it seems mentioned configuration is not up to the mark with respect to its performance...Not Happy at all
5,I purchased this machine for my college assignments and allIf you also need it for not so heavy tasks you must go for it
5,"I bought this laptop with 8GB of ram and 1TB HDD, and AMD ryzen 3 3250U with integrated graphics.This laptop is good for taking online classes and web surfing.Most of them are afraid of buying AMD processor's but you would not find any heating issues, infact AMD gives more performance with low temperature.If you are a person who is for taking online classes and conference, then you can definately go for it.If need for more performance, then add some 250GB SSD.I will update my review after 6 months."
1,Looks goodBut processing is very slow from day 1st.8gb ram and AMD processor with ryzon 3 is not compatible with this product. Itna to samsung bhi nahi hang karta. Agar ese hi laptop aane lage to ...apple ke alawa koi or laptop lega hi nahi koi...not recommend at all. Buy now and cry all the time after owing it.
1,Don't buy it seriously telling  you very bad laptop  you all regret after buying it not mentioned specs given hang everytime  . Don't buy it
4,"Packing, look wise, is fine. It's been 3 days I am using this device. No additional application installed. But what we are gonna do with the look, performance wise it questions me is this device holds 8GB RAM or 2GB. For name sake they have said 8GB, but the time it takes to refresh n open n response its lagging... Those 4 stars is only for look n packing n build quality."
2,"I bought this laptop only for basic office functions like word editing and simple excel works. I kept my expectations low while buying it. But still this laptop didn't even reach those basic expectations. Its taking 4 mins to boot :( and work on updates forever whenever you try to shutdown or restart. I bought this relying on HP brand name and regretting now. Don't know the problem is due to processor or OS or hardware config, but whatever it is, the final result is worst."
2,Very poor performance speed . It will take more time for booting too. While click on browser or any apps it's respond very slowly.
4,I installed gta 5 on it and it runs on 45-50 FPS and 1080p gameplay best in this budget just go for itFor office work♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️And specially for gaming five star rating from my side just go for it it’s an amazing laptop in this budget and like you have already seen that I run GTA5 on it and I have edited videos on 4K and it is like very good so just go for it
1,Product is low quality.within 3 days use the monitor gone blank. Also when use with internet it makes a lot of noise.Booting is pathetic and takes minimum 4 to 5 minutes.After paying so much amount and getting such quality is really bad.Would never recommend any of my friends or relatives to buy this anymore.Now waiting for hp to provide resolution.It is 4 th day but till date no update from HP.Amazon pls do not sell such low quality product at your site. People will ignore Amazone in future.Not sure if I get some call back or any replacement.
1,"laptop is not great. very low speed, it's hangs frequently and freezes..."
1,Very slow don't go with this model
3,"Likes:1) Display2) Looks3) Brand value and reliability and number of service centersDislikes:1) Poor battery quality (2hrs for charging and 1.5 hrs for discharging2) Slow processor (it takes 5-10 mins to start, however after it gets started, overall performance is OK for this price, not fast as i3, not laggy as Celerion or Athlon"
2,"I have ordered this laptop for an online class ( Std V), basically to use Microsoft Teams. Team app is getting hanged frequently even after OS upgrade. I also called HP technical support team multiple times but they also not able to solve this issue. Finally, they suggested to upgrade RAM from 8 GB to 16 GB or check with Microsoft."
2,Outlook not working your preloaded ms office...
5,Nice and met my expectations
1,Total waste of Money
5,Worth money.I have been using this from 2 days its fantastic.I mainly used this for online classes and gaming. Good performance.Only one disadvantage: overheating
4,"Excellent product for Students. It has it all built in. Be it Windows 10, MS office life time, HD camera, High resolution display, 8 Gb ram, 1Tb HDD, High quality stereo speakers with good volume.Not tried yet for heavy games like PUBG, CS, ASPHALT etc.."
1,This laptop is very slow and takes very long to turn on it does not work well
4,The GST amount which he is crying is genuine.But again the GST has 2 components
1,"Hanging, for starting more than 8 min taking, also Restart Also taking 8-10 min..... Horrible Heating...."
1,The battery life in working condition as per Amazon site will be 8hrs. But sad part is after full charge 25% battery drained within 30 mnts of using mail only .Pathetic experience and complete wastage of money as the laptop I only 4 days old
2,"Very slow and hangs every now and then. The issue persisted even after the replacement. So, it's a problem with the product. Please go for SSD laptop and stay away from HDD if possible! Very slow and often hangs even while using very basic applications."
1,"This is my second day and the Laptop already is laggy and choppy. I have not filled the storage and neither have I installed any games and yet it already Lags. Even A lower Specs variant will perform better than this, Bad Choice"
2,"When I tried to register on Lenovo website it said the product is already registered and I have just 8 months of warranty remaining, basically it's a used product, used for at least 4 months.Pros:1. Good battery life, 6-8 hours2. Full laptop experience in small size3. The internal GPU, Intel UHD 600, is good enough to decode 4k@60fps, but somehow the browsers don't use it properly (may be windows issues or the drivers), downloaded files play smoothly in VLC, but browser can't handle 4k (there are frame drops)4. You get keyboard and active pen in the boxCons:1. Not anti glare screen2. It's 1280x800 screen, not FHD3. Without keyboard attached you can't use USB, as both USBs are in the keyboard4. Even without keyboard it feels heavy5. Huge bezels6. No ethernet port7. No HDMI port8. The screen is a fingerprint magnet, you'll need a screen protectorOkayish cameras.It will take sometime to be used to the keyboard, it's small with low key travel.You can access the boot menu by pressing fn+f12.It is possible to run Linux but issues with screen orientation and touchscreen will give you hard time. I tried installing linux (Ubuntu and Manjaro) it booted and installed successfully, by default they boot in portrait mode, you can rotate the screen from settings, but it doesn't rotate the touch, Manjaro sometimes caused black screen during screen rotation. Overall, you can install linux but you'll have hard time using the touchscreen.Buy if you want to do basic things like editing office files, browsing, watching videos. It's not made for gaming, video editing, programming etc.Update to windows 10 20H2 and use debloat scripts after that performance will be better."
5,"Smallest laptop I have ever seen. But, Thanks to the Tablet mode & Touch Screen.Battery Life 5 stars. Almost 12 - 13 hours.Sound 4 starsScreen 4 starsPerformance 4 starsStylus Pen - 5 starsKeyboard - 3 stars ( can be better)Camera 2 stars ( 2MP & 5MP Are outdated now)Charger - 3.5 stars (USB C type)Windows 10 - 4.5 stars (Genuine windows)MS Office - 1 star , one month trial (should be free)Storage - out of 128 GB , only 84 GB is usableRam - 4 GB is good."
5,I bought it on 29th march 2021. But warranty start date is showing from  Nov 2020 and only 7 months are remaining now.Please rectify this issue.No issues with laptop. Really love it. Worth for the price.
1,"Faulty product. Keyboard and touchpad was not working. Even after request for return, nobody came to pickup laptop and refund is not initiated."
4,"Very nice for children for attending classes and learning. It comes with a lenovo active pen also. I have hooked it up with hdmi to tv. Great thing is it has bluetooth and 5ghz channel , works flawlessly for my needs."
1,Don't buy. System is dam slow
4,Liked compact size.Traveling makes it easier.
1,Sensor is not working properly
1,The product should have warranty of one year from purchase why it is showing only 9 months warranty
5,Cute & excellent product. Really liked it !
1,One key switch as found unassembled..
1,Very slow.
1,Bad product
2,Too small
4,The bezel of the screen is quite large that minimise the display. But the display is quite good with a 24bit. And the touch responsive is also good. I am disappointed with this as i cannot run Adobe Indesign with it. But the ms office responsive is very good. The battery life is also great. The keypad though needs time to adebt to our huge fingers. Over-all this product is a great replacement to the ms surface-pro.
4,"Disappointed with the exchange offer as they didn't accept the laptop which I had planned to return, exchange policy was not clear and paid the full amount atlast and received the delivery.  Please mention the exchange policy clearly so that at least others will not suffer like me in future"
2,"Price is pretty high, may be we can get this features with other laptops with suitable RAM and SSD features"
4,"Hi,You can use the usb ports on keyboard as long as it is connected to the screen. There are two ways to it and you can see in the image I've attached."
1,Damaged and unsealed product was delivered
5,"Fully satisfied with performance of the device. Using for last 1 year and no complaints about the device, based on the price level."
1,Wastage of money .....plz don't purchase.You can't even install any other os like Linux distros.I'm unsatisfied!!!FKL buddy
5,It's very goodDon't give a second thought just purchase it go for it. Best budget laptop under 30000 is this one.
1,The tab was accidentally broken after a month usage... the display was not available with lenovo india also....no spare parts available in lenovo service center also.Don't think of it.... it is useless for me now
5,One of the best product at this price....
4,Very good ....
5,Super quality and display is awesome
5,"Best laptop under 40k. 1TB HDD, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM, Ryzen 3.No matter how much dig in you wont find these specifications in any other brand at this price."
5,"This is a good multipurpose laptop at its price. My requirement is to buy a laptop for my daughter for her studies. She entered 8th class and with the current requirements to attend classes from home, this is going to be the right laptop for her.On the features:* Ryzen 3-3250 is equivalent to Core i3 10th gen but with less cost. It is good for general work like attending classes, internet browsing, working with applications like Word, Excel, PPT, browser, video streaming, etc without reduction in speed.* 256 GB SSD makes the system 10 times faster than a laptop with HDD.* 1 TB HDD helps you move your files from SSD to HDD when you are no longer working with them.* 8 GB RAM is sufficient for medium multitasking.* 15 inches is a good screen size for multitasking and viewing multiple applications side by side.* Supports dual-band 2 and 5 GHz WiFi.* Has front camera for video calls.* Comes with Windows 10 and MS Office 2019.Activating MS Office 2019 (Thought this will be helpful to write):* Do this after completing Windows Setup.* Launch word or excel. Go to Account. Under Product information, log in with the same id which you gave for Window activation. It will then download MS Office 2019 and it will be activated.Note: Though I purchased this for my daughter, this laptop is also good for teachers, students pursuing MCA for learning programming. You can install Visual Studio, Android Studio, etc, and learn programming.Have fun and happy learning."
5,"This laptop is perfect for home and student use. Don't get blindsided by the negative reviews. The item arrives in sturdy packaging which prevents it from damage during transit. I myself use this laptop for university online meetings. This laptop is not meant for high graphics gaming, low-resolution games are compatible. Rest assured is fine.Benefits:- Heat: No heating issue. While charging only the charging adapter gets warm which is quite normal.- Charging time: Gets charged in 2hr 30mn (0-100). Playback time (normal usage)- 4 hrs.- Boot time: 10 secs switch-on & switch-off.- Writing speed: USB 3.0 (output to input) gives 80-120 Mbps writing speed.- Display: FHD display, Antiglare display lets you stream Netflix, Youtube & many more from any angle of the laptop.- Sound: Based on a laptop system, the sound is quite good. I hear music at volume 20/100.- Touchpad: smooth.- Pre-activated Office 2019.Note:- Purchase a Saco silicon keyboard cover (black) as the visibility of the default key prints in daylight are not so efficiently visible.- As shown in picture, the laptop must be kept above any plain hard surface so that the air circulation keeps running and does not gets heated.- In many reviews, you will find that the laptop is getting heated, the worst laptop and all. But one must know properly how to use it.- At first, I was thinking of purchasing the same model only with Ryzen 3 4300U processor. But I changed my decision and stuck to this only. Because as compared to 4300U, in this laptop 3250U one gets 15.6 Screen, RJ-45 Port, 1TB HDD, calculator keyboard.- Don't confuse yourself with the processors, someone will say quad-core is better than dual-core, and don't purchase this laptop as it is dual-core. But trust me for home and student basic usage, this laptop is more than enough.- If one plays a game or performs multi-high tasking software, then the laptop runs at high speed which is a bit noisy. But don't worry its normal only.- DDR4 2400 mghz is sufficient for a student and basic office meetings use.- Do check the warranty on HP's official website by entering the serial number which is present at the laptop base or product box.At last, update your warranty to the latest date. Because the laptop warranty automatically starts from the day it got manufactured. You need not panic, just contact HP by email and provide your amazon bill & amazon warranty slip, they will update the same within 48 working hours."
5,Best laptop..Display in awesome...Build quality is also decent... I don't play games..only bought for office use...of your budget is 40k go for it or maybe spend 2-3k extra and buy hp15s eq0024au ...i wanted to buy that but was out of stock for long time
4,Anti-glare quality is good although there is slight bit lack in screen brightness .....nd off course u can play games except if played in higher setting it get heatup nd fan sound high.....Overall it is worth buying in this price ....
1,"This laptop is overall a really good package, but there is something fishy. It is not Thin and neither is it light enough. The Ryzen processor and Radeon Graphics work seamlessly, but are not for games. Im still not sure if this graphics card is a Vega 6 or Vega 8, due to the serial number. Buy it only if the price falls under 40k or else go for something better!"
5,"Very good product in 40k range , if u want to buy for study and office purpose just go for it.Better build quality , and most important in 40k range no other companies provides IPS pannel display so, its awsome"
2,Repeatedly this Hangs. Processor is very bad. I dont have much applications installed yet it hangs.Not at all value for money..waste of moneyPosting after a month of use
5,"I was satisfied with the overall performance and speed of the laptop.  It works well with the WiFI at home and has all the requisite software needed for online classes.  The sound is especially clear with headphones.  The webcam is quite good and is sufficient for attending meetings and online classes.However, if you need to know in advance, the laptop does not have a BACKLIT keyboard.  It does not appear to be suited for serious gaming purposes.Thank You Amazon for the superb quality of packaging and prompt delivery."
4,"Hi,Got my product yesterday. So I'll share the initial impressions now.The laptop is bit heavy than expected. The fit and finish is good. The screen is very good. The camera quality is just OK, but I think that is sufficient for a meeting.Can't comment on the performance now. I'll update this review after sometime.Overall I would say if you are looking for a laptop in the 40K range, this is a good choice."
1,I would suggest not to buy this laptop it has 8gb ram but not at all worth. I had installed applications and laptop started hanging I really don’t believe this is hp product. 0 recommendations and honest review
1,Defective peice wifi not working properly
5,"The product is really good for its price.Pros:1. IPS display + anti-glare, great for media consumption!2. Ssd + Hdd, enough storage!3. Free Ms. Office for lifetime4. Ryzen 3 is good enough for studying and office work.5. Type C port6. Looks extremely elegant.Cons:1. No backlit keyboard.2. The performance would be better if it had Ryzen 5. (But its quite fast because of the ssd)3. Built Quality could be better. Also, the laptop being 15.6"", is quite heavy compared to 14"" laptops.4. Laptop cameras and speakers are never great but they get the job done.The laptop is working as expected. Not a gaming laptop but extremely good for study purpose- online classes, reading books, web browsing. It's amazing for watching movies and web series! The Ssd makes the laptop fast. I am extremely happy with the purchase. :)"
1,"Always Online Products are having issues, after spending huge money for laptop we are not getting perfect item ,  this laptop mic is not working properly ,even creating disturbance to others while online calls ,  it is hampering online classes and meetings . My Voice not Audible to others ."
3,"USB ports complaint. Both the slots Not compatible with C type chargers, one of them compatible with B type. Return window closed! It was just for 5 days.Amazon options to download invoice, warranty card shows pdf cannot be opened!"
5,Price was little bet higher
4,"It is a good laptop, but setimes it got stuck for about 2-3 mins bit that's not a major thing. If you'll disable low power mode. It will work fine because in low power mode it extends the battery and reduces the performance, So, if you do multitasking . First charge it to about 80-90% then disable low power mode, and then use it. Rest, It's a excellent laptop many good features, and the booting is blazing fast."
1,"Doesn't reach expectionsGo for i3 Processor only. Hangs a lot, Sound quality is worst & you can not return it, body material plastic, usb Ports is very Cheap quality,Honest reviewPlease don't Buy It..."
2,"I got this laptop for my kid's remote schooing. The laptop hangs with Microsoft Teams video calling. Everytime it hangs need to reboot the system. For all the AMD processor and the bells & whistles of speed, it could not handle a simple Teams video call.Additionally i found a slight dent on one side."
4,Good laptop for normal useCamera average
5,"Value for money, good in look, light weight .Fast charging, anti glare screen.Keyboard is stylish just need backlit which is missing its beauty.Amd ryzen 3 processor.Thanks to Amazon deliver on next day .Well packing.Full satisfy and Good for more buying experience."
2,"Teams was hanging a lot on this laptop.I updated all the drivers, BIOS, and Windows, but still the problem remained.Amazon scheduled a technician visit, but still the issue persisted.The problem was, this product didn't have a return policy, it had only replacement policy. So please make sure what kind of policy is Amazon offering before purchasing the item."
5,Excellent product..best performance. Display quality is good.Its comes with 256Gb ssd so less time required to access. You can play games also in low setting... There is no lag. Best laptop in this budget.
5,"Value for money and good for work from home and for study purpose. It takes very less time to boot, I use it for work from home and my daughter use it for online classes. It's serving the purpose, it's more then the expectations. HP should continue making this product."
5,"This is my first laptop and I am pretty happy with my purchase. Under 40k budget this is a great option, it's only drawback is it's battery.. It lasts about 3-4 hrs( for continuous use) and take 2hrs to get fully charged..Other than that itsLight weight✅Anti glare✅Thin ✅Budget laptop ✅HDD+SSD ✅Windows+MS Office ✅15"" numeric keyboard✅All important ports✅Webcam ✅Good Battery backup ❌Screen touch ❌Fingerprint ❌Foldable ❌Overall it's value for money"
5,Excellent laptop under 40k with well known HP brand.Everything is good in this laptop for me.Thanks Amazon and Hp.😊
3,"Heavy excel file stucks. To boot it takes 3-4 seconds. While connected to network - the battery drains fast. 1 hour or 1.5 hours max without network 3hours to 4 hours. In zoom, sometimes camera not found."
1,"I bought this laptop for remote schooling of kids. Observed that 10 mins into microsoft teams, the video freezes. The audio continues. But at this time, the entire laptop is in hung state. There is no option other than hard reboot. Had a call with HP Support. They asked me to update OS, BIOS, which was done promptly. Still the same issue.  Do not buy this laptop.Camera is also extremely poor"
4,Nice product for the price any way u dnt get both sdd and hdd for the price.
5,"Happy to buy this product.Every thing cool for your daily use. Browse, watching movies, business purpose, document preparation etc.."
3,The product works fine but the physical memory of 8gb is not completely available as hardware reserve more than 2 gb which cannot be freed. ( Tried using msconfig to remove the memory allocation but looks like no option in BIOS to remove the reservation). So overall memory is just around 6gb. Very disappointed as was expecting 8gb system for the apps I am using. Looks like by design for AMD processor.
1,you can not watch a single movie on full charge battry is very vad
1,I purchased this 2 weeks back to use it for online schooling purpose. MS Teams and zoom frequently freezes laptop during meetings. I had to force the shut down to use it again .HP technicians unable to fix the problem. I am looking to return this.
5,Product is awesome... super speed in this range..love the product
5,Really happy with my purchaseWonderful product i must say
2,I bought this laptop for my kids' online courses. The school uses Microsoft Teams. Was surprised to find that the laptop hangs so frequently that it practically renders it useless. They have been using a tablet worth 10k for more than a year and never had any issue. Don't waste your money on this.
4,It's a very good option under 40K  Some times fan making extra noise. TouchPad switches are not so good .
4,The laptop is found in good working condition. The product is properly serviced before selling.was sceptical initially but it worked well for me. Budget friendly for those whose who is looking for something to fit in their pocket.I  is looking for a good laptop at a decent cost and this turned out to one. The screen was in perfect condition and it was well packaged. The battery life is also decent. The body of the laptop is well polished that makes it look. The product is wellade for students who wants to have their hands started on a computer and probably dnt want to invest more in the first go.
4,Screen quality is good but battery backup is very poor.
4,"Liked ,good laptop to buy..."
1,Very poor
5,Velue for money and good performance
5,Best Machine
5,Very Good product at this price. The webcam could have been better.
5,Value for money
5,Good product. We are satisfied
4,Very slow and not good 8gb ram  according speed very slow and hang bad laptop plz don't money west
1,Really hate the product. Its wastage of money. Its taking too long to start and its making a wierd noice in the background its too heavy and large and is not handy at ol.worst part is that they are not even ready to refund nor replace. Really pissed off
5,The Product Worth it
1,Please don't buy this laptop. The screen keeps freezing. I bought this laptop for my daughters online classes but every 15-20mins whether using zoom or Microsoft teams it keeps freezing. Processor is too slow.  Was coming back to HP brand after a gap of 10 years but this has reminded me that why I stayed away all these years. Please do not waste your hard earned money on this.
2,This is  a review after more than 6 months of usage.I had an azuz laptop. But since I had many problems while operating it I ordered this one. At first it was good But now it keeps switching off at times. At first had 9 hR battery now only 3-4 hrs. Not happy with the purchase.
4,"I purchased GR0011AU (1TB HDD no SSD, Ryzen 3 3250). Economical Laptop with decent performance. Battery backup around 5.5 to 6 hrs on streaming video via wifi and general browsing.  I avoided purchasing extended warranty online. Instead buy from the HP helpline (number attached in photo).  Registration and setup of MS Office Home and Student 2019 is tricky as the laptop has Office 365 installed as default. This (365) has to be uninstalled and the Office H&S 2019 image (3.5GB) has to be downloaded and set up. I am doing it all through the HP helpline and they are helpful.. Overall  decent/good laptop for my basic requirements and very good customer support, atleast during setup."
4,"After using it from last 40 days, I have observed all it's aspects deeply.At this prize laptop looks premium. Amazing Design, I got latop with in 3 days  today. It has Magnificent Processor... Amazing Display.. Easy to use.  Battery is also Good. Smooth Touch pad. Overall a genniune Product for Educational and Business Purpose. Go for It.If you want to get more advanced product just add some SDD....Minnor Issue:- It's making some noise while running over internet."
4,"Firstly for the correct information of all potential buyers - I have had a good experience of HP laptops. Secondly i had budget constraints (below 35k)... so I had to go for one with only HDD, not SSD. I would have loved hybrid types as those work excellent.Thus I opted for this laptop with no SSD, only 1TB HDD, however i preferred 8GB RAM...it has been 3 days and we have been using it for Zoom long meetings..and general surfing (no multimedia use yet). So far there are no visible issues. The fan sometimes gives out a slight burning smell and I assume it is because the circuitry is new... I shall monitor for more days and give another review on this.The laptop's nice feature is the CORTANA support by which windows got configured smoothly, with little intervention. it did take lot of time to boot initially, but now boots up fine....Havent faced any sound or heat issues yet.Screen output quality could have been better..... to get the optimum brightness you have to raise the brightness to almost the limit.Sound output is not that great.....so far so good. will post again after a month of use."
3,"Pros:Display quality.Light weight.Decent sound.Good performance as per it's hardware.Cons:One main thing is it's GPU is shared memory not dedicated. Almost  2GB ram will allocated for Graphics. Felt like 4gb even it's 5.9gb usable.Design flaws are there, rough edges like unfinished .Heat vent is placed at bottom, so we have to keep alway on flat surface.Very thin bezel around display."
1,laptop is hanging if we install more products
4,Looks good 🙂😊
1,A used product that was damaged was delivered. Absolutely appalled by this service & I can't believe a new product paid for in full was delivered in this condition
4,Products is good....i am satisfied.....but not very first...it takes time to open a exel file.... Battery brkup good.....other facility also satisfying.
5,"After seeing the reviews I was confused. But I decided to go for this and it got delivered within 1 day. I really liked this product. Looks premium, built quality is also good and also fast. It's a good laptop under 36k. As of now, this is my review and if there will be any issue, will let you know."
5,"I bought recently and was not disappointed with the product at all. However if you are looking for a product that supports accounting software, etc, please buy a bit higher range. Laptop is more or less fast with good screen quality. Video conferencing is easy on this laptop. Graphic card is high so gaming is good too. Overall satisfied and good for students👍🏻😊"
1,Too slow and takes time to get start. If you are working on more than 2 virtual box machine then you will have worst experience ever. Machine gets hanged and restart several time.Not worth it & it seems mentioned configuration is not up to the mark with respect to its performance...Not Happy at all
5,I purchased this machine for my college assignments and allIf you also need it for not so heavy tasks you must go for it
5,"I bought this laptop with 8GB of ram and 1TB HDD, and AMD ryzen 3 3250U with integrated graphics.This laptop is good for taking online classes and web surfing.Most of them are afraid of buying AMD processor's but you would not find any heating issues, infact AMD gives more performance with low temperature.If you are a person who is for taking online classes and conference, then you can definately go for it.If need for more performance, then add some 250GB SSD.I will update my review after 6 months."
1,Looks goodBut processing is very slow from day 1st.8gb ram and AMD processor with ryzon 3 is not compatible with this product. Itna to samsung bhi nahi hang karta. Agar ese hi laptop aane lage to ...apple ke alawa koi or laptop lega hi nahi koi...not recommend at all. Buy now and cry all the time after owing it.
1,Don't buy it seriously telling  you very bad laptop  you all regret after buying it not mentioned specs given hang everytime  . Don't buy it
4,"Packing, look wise, is fine. It's been 3 days I am using this device. No additional application installed. But what we are gonna do with the look, performance wise it questions me is this device holds 8GB RAM or 2GB. For name sake they have said 8GB, but the time it takes to refresh n open n response its lagging... Those 4 stars is only for look n packing n build quality."
2,"I bought this laptop only for basic office functions like word editing and simple excel works. I kept my expectations low while buying it. But still this laptop didn't even reach those basic expectations. Its taking 4 mins to boot :( and work on updates forever whenever you try to shutdown or restart. I bought this relying on HP brand name and regretting now. Don't know the problem is due to processor or OS or hardware config, but whatever it is, the final result is worst."
2,Very poor performance speed . It will take more time for booting too. While click on browser or any apps it's respond very slowly.
4,I installed gta 5 on it and it runs on 45-50 FPS and 1080p gameplay best in this budget just go for itFor office work♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️And specially for gaming five star rating from my side just go for it it’s an amazing laptop in this budget and like you have already seen that I run GTA5 on it and I have edited videos on 4K and it is like very good so just go for it
1,Product is low quality.within 3 days use the monitor gone blank. Also when use with internet it makes a lot of noise.Booting is pathetic and takes minimum 4 to 5 minutes.After paying so much amount and getting such quality is really bad.Would never recommend any of my friends or relatives to buy this anymore.Now waiting for hp to provide resolution.It is 4 th day but till date no update from HP.Amazon pls do not sell such low quality product at your site. People will ignore Amazone in future.Not sure if I get some call back or any replacement.
1,"laptop is not great. very low speed, it's hangs frequently and freezes..."
1,Very slow don't go with this model
3,"Likes:1) Display2) Looks3) Brand value and reliability and number of service centersDislikes:1) Poor battery quality (2hrs for charging and 1.5 hrs for discharging2) Slow processor (it takes 5-10 mins to start, however after it gets started, overall performance is OK for this price, not fast as i3, not laggy as Celerion or Athlon"
2,"I have ordered this laptop for an online class ( Std V), basically to use Microsoft Teams. Team app is getting hanged frequently even after OS upgrade. I also called HP technical support team multiple times but they also not able to solve this issue. Finally, they suggested to upgrade RAM from 8 GB to 16 GB or check with Microsoft."
2,Outlook not working your preloaded ms office...
5,Nice and met my expectations
1,Total waste of Money
5,Worth money.I have been using this from 2 days its fantastic.I mainly used this for online classes and gaming. Good performance.Only one disadvantage: overheating
4,"Excellent product for Students. It has it all built in. Be it Windows 10, MS office life time, HD camera, High resolution display, 8 Gb ram, 1Tb HDD, High quality stereo speakers with good volume.Not tried yet for heavy games like PUBG, CS, ASPHALT etc.."
1,This laptop is very slow and takes very long to turn on it does not work well
4,The GST amount which he is crying is genuine.But again the GST has 2 components
1,"Hanging, for starting more than 8 min taking, also Restart Also taking 8-10 min..... Horrible Heating...."
1,The battery life in working condition as per Amazon site will be 8hrs. But sad part is after full charge 25% battery drained within 30 mnts of using mail only .Pathetic experience and complete wastage of money as the laptop I only 4 days old
2,"Very slow and hangs every now and then. The issue persisted even after the replacement. So, it's a problem with the product. Please go for SSD laptop and stay away from HDD if possible! Very slow and often hangs even while using very basic applications."
1,"This is my second day and the Laptop already is laggy and choppy. I have not filled the storage and neither have I installed any games and yet it already Lags. Even A lower Specs variant will perform better than this, Bad Choice"
3,Pros :1. Latest 11th Gen i5 Intel Processor for smooth processing3. Backlight Keyboard4. Smooth Touch ScreenCons :1. HP Pen and bag is not provide with laptop2. Slightly Heavier as compared to other Laptops in 14 inch category3.Screen quality is bad
4,I started checking this product for couple of days. All the features are good except its battery backup. It comes for 3 hrs only after complete charge compared to what they claim. It confirms me that HP laptops battery backups are usually not good compared to other product vendors. :(
5,"Have been using the laptop for two weeks now. Performs really well and is faster than 10th generation laptops (compared start/shut and tab openings). Users might face nominal installation issues, better to have a good data plan ready on the day of initialization as a lot of drivers along with windows 10 components are updated."
4,Could have done better with the battery backup.....charging is fast though....
4,"I'm using it for almost a month now, mostly for business use. It gives great performance advantage and portability. Best part is it boots up pretty fast, thanks to the SSD.Touch screen is good.Finger print scanner sometimes doesn't work, but it was expected.I haven't tried any games on it. But have done some image processing, which provided good response and performance.Speakers are very standard. Better usage is with headsetsI have an issue with the white board. Sometimes during meetings, it hangs up and the entire screen goes frozen. Background processing, or even the call doesn't stop but the screen become inactive. This happened a couple of times.Camera is a joke.. Still can't believe why they aren't providing a better spec camera in mid range models. It's too basic and performance is pathetic especially in low light situations.Altogether, it's a pretty nice machine for daily/ business usage with my experience till now."
2,"I have bought the laptop one month before  and I now I am facing the problem of overheating just of 1 to 2 hours use. Due to overheating, none of the browsers are opening and laptop is hanging. I have one year warranty on the laptop so I want to resolve my issue."
5,"Wow! Just amazing to have an HP for digitalized e-world. It's light weight with trendy looks and does the job very fast due to the graphics and processor speed. Night mode keypad glow is impressive and battery backup is not so bad. Size is smaller than regular gigantic lappy's. Haven't faced any issue so far with heating effect. All in all a good buy for multipurpose use be it coding, multimedia and gaming. Thank you Amazon for bringing this to me."
5,Love this Product.I have great display and great performanceFew cons it have a bit dim display and heavy laptopBut all round a good laptop for student and workspace
3,"This is 2 days old laptop, just using the browser application to join online school classes and it is heating up quite fast, base becomes hot, too much of hot air blow from the vents and fan sound goes high frequently right from the day1 of the usage. Yet to decide what needs to be done (keep or return)."
3,"The processor is listed as 4.2 Ghz however actual processor is 2.4 Ghz. Also it states Graphics card size as 4GB, however there's no graphics card."
1,Major heating issue within a matter of minutes.  Poor battery life. Extremely disappointed. Won't recommend anyone to buy. Specs look good only on papers.
4,"Due to heavy display, if you tilt to a higher angle the laptop's base starts to wobble.  Keyboard backlit at level 1 is useless.  Otherwise a very fine machine.  I like the finger print scanner.  The machine wakes up like a mobile phone instantly."

5,"Quality is great, as expected from hp."
5,Awesome product
3,"Laptop is ok for me as the purpose was online education for my Kids. However, I am disappointed with the camera. With all meetings and classes online, laptops should consider a better quality camera. With this heavy Windows 10, 4GB RAM is crying with just a couple of browser windows and Teams application in the background. Overall, the performance is just ok. With correct expectation, the engine should please you. Good luck !!"
4,"The processing speed is slow,Screen resolution, camera, build quality everything is great except the processor,battery is life about 3-4hours, it can capable of running lot of apps, you can buy it for light work and gaming"
2,Camera quality is not good. Doesn't help you in these work from home situations where most of your meetings are through zoom or Google
1,This system inside there is no hard disc it sims
4,HP laptops are good. with windows 10 and msoffice. overall good for student and general office work.

5,Thank you
3,"The package i has received was well protected and no damage occured. After I uncovering the package and started the laptop, it was so slow compared to my old vaio (sony i7). I was disappointed when it started to process slowly. But after signing and using it, there was no problem and it was running smoothly till now. (No backlighting, no bag, no headphones and mouse) only a laptop, a charger and a manual paper."
1,Laptop getting hang very much and very much slow start.This is happening within 2 days of purchase
3,It looks the screen size is small . Its not look 15.6 inch. Can some one help me
3,"How to install a new SSD? The SSD does not show up on the boot menu. It shows ""Toshiba"" as the first boot device even after physically removing the preinstalled Toshiba hard disk and connecting a new SSD."
1,"HiThis is a true feedback, requesting you to now buy this laptop from here, I ordered this product and on the very next day it is getting hanged,  unable to run the apps properly. Very slow processer. Worst quality. And the worst part is customer services are not even helping they are just asking to contact hp and hp is asking to contact Amazon. I asked to return but nothing has happened. Please please do not buy this product."
5,Hp laptop with intel less than 40k.At starting too much slow.After update working fine.Hints:No keyboard backlit.No NumLock indicator.Screen is good.
4,"I'm satisfied with the product but it's little slow while booting up. Really,  useful to attend College and School Online classes for  my children. It's storage space is good enough."
5,A really good laptop for online classes as well as for gaming.Worth money. Screen length and height is perfect! Just one problem that it doesn't have port for wired earphones. It has Bluetooth ones.
5,Runs smoothly after OS update....very light weight and compact...hp assistant very useful and simple........
4,Value for money laptop from an branded manufacturer.
4,"I got this laptop on 10th of May(reviewing after 25 days).At this price range, this laptop is best as you are getting 11th gen, very good display, good speakers sound, expandable ram, nvem ssd slot.___If you want to buy this laptop for App development or heavy programming then I would suggest you to buy ssd(replace the hdd with ssd or there is another slot for nvem ssd) and upgrade RAM(upto 16gb).There is one 1TB HDD you get but you can also add Nvem Ssd which is amazing. Also the ram is expandable upto 16GB.If you add ssd and upgrade RAM then this laptop is a beast, trust me. I got this laptop @28k after exchanging my old laptop.If you don't do coding or heavy tasking then I would still say atleast add ssd because boot time and performance is average which may annoy you so  it's better to add ssd.Also this laptop is not very heavy gaming like Pubg PC, Apex Legends etc. You may play light game like pub mobile, cod mobile.Cons:1. The Quality of the body is not that good.2. Battery backup is not good."
5,"Although it is too early to provide a feedback with only two days of use however I am providing this feedback because the experience is too good till now. Few additional features can add more user friendly experience like it doesn't contains keyboard background light. Also, the first time when you open the laptop, it started taking update from Microsoft. So connect with a good LAN or Wi-Fi and be patient to install the update."
3,Suggesting to go for SSD instead of hdr as it tooks a solid 40 seconds for booting which is very annoying.
5,"Good laptop under budget with all specifiction required.Little slow while starting, rest behaving good while working.Plastic quality of laptop disappointed this could be better."
2,"Lookwise & bodywise ok. But it is too slow and hangs a lot, dont buy it..."
4,Good product .Have decent speed for daily use .The keypad buttons are big enough and feels good .The storage space is more than sufficient .The genuine windows 10 and ms office package come with it .It's light weight and easy to carry.However on flop side the key board is made of plastic whivh could have been better.do not come with licensed anti virus device.The ram speed could have been better and the I3 processor could have been upgraded. Over all it'd decent product for its purchase cost.
4,"Product is good . But the processor use little bit lagging. When I power on, after that it will take a time to open a app.Also I don't like the cover skin.*Products is light weighted* display is awesome cool.*Charging time is less*Sound quality is good"
2,After two month of use I am writing this review.please dont Buy is laptop as it is very very slow. It takes too much time to start also. As I am not using any antivirus software than also speed is very poor.
5,"Was worried about speed issues that many had complained in the reviews. But still went ahead with the purchase. After powering on there is quite a few updates that will happen. At that time i found it to be slow(background downloads and installations will happen) Go to updates and ensure that there are no pending updates. Once all the updates are applied, the laptop is perfectly fine. My kid is using for schools and other assignment. If you are using a browser + MS office applications +zoom(or other vide chat apps), there is absolutely no problem with this laptop. it is absolutely fine. Not sure about gaming though"
4,Go for it when you are looking for a HP laptop having reasonable configuration.
5,Always before HP always keep its standard.Its very nice to use and light weight.HD screen is too good and sound clarity also very nice.Delivery from Amazon prime also very speed.I got the product on the 3rd day from I ordered.Thanks for Amazon and HP
2,"Don't waste your hard earned money in this waste product. Not worth buying. For the first time i am writing review. Takes too long to start, has a plastic body which makes it look so cheap."
4,I likeProcessor speed display all connectivity fast charging battery backup upto 5 hours lightweight slim design overall good packageDislikePlastic type body design matte finish colour feel like low quality material and last the power button not feeling so good
2,"I had bought on 7th May and within a month product...performance is very slow and it's asking system updating in weak, while I using last weak it was suddenly blank the screen for 20 minutes and Fan sound is coming very bad just like hard disk will be blast, I had contact with hp support and they solved the issue if I get again I will send it back for replaceI think this product weight is more than 2kg"
5,"After ordering hp laptop, Amazon will take only one day to fulfill my order. It is a genuine product, three days gone, till I am satisfied."
3,"Construction quality is not good... Intial start take linger after that ok. Hinges are not smooth and rigid, battery life is not impressive. For students ok.. Or first laptop users not find differences."
4,This is a Good for students. Entire laptop good. battery backup 3 to 4 hours that is only negative. Remaining good
1,Vary vary poor quality....plz gyus don't buy this laptop 🙄🙄
1,Laptop was defective always
1,The display was defective. Also the fonts/resolution is bad. Amazon is however not allowing to return the product. They say only replacement is allowed. Not worth buying such high expensive products from Amazon. Expected the product to be returned and get a refund considering the product to be expensive. Disappointed.
5,"Looking for a good performance laptop at this range , go for it. Got this at very good exchange discount too. The whole process of delivery and exchange was very smooth"
4,"Overall a very good package. Battery life couldhave been improved. It sometimes gets unresponsive for a second or so, but that's about it. But 1TB storage (although non SSD), FHD Display, 11th Gen i3 processor and 15.6 in display at this price point (for me it was 38k) is an amzing deal"
2,The biggest problem is that the processor is very slow. Even if you are working on just basic MS office apps the laptop is slow and takes ages. Suggest to go for i5. Can I change the laptop?
1,"Highly disappointed with the laptop. Battrey life is very low. Even after full change it's not being able to make it for 3 hours, with average use.  I want to return the material but there is no option."
4,"Good laptop, speed is nice but could have been even better as compared to price. Camera is fine for online classes, supports virtual background too. Looks bit delicate as it has plastic body.Overall good performance as of now. I am reviewing after a use of 5 days."
3,Not good. Even with 8gb ram it's too slow.worst experience stopped working within 45days.
2,"Cheap plastic; doesnt feel like 11th gen i3 processor; my old dual core pc with 4gb ram is faster than this; screen and battery is good; didnt have much expectation from it as it is budget laptop, still it doesnot meet it."
4,Over all it is a good laptop. I bought it for my daughter's online class. I think price should be within 34K. Another issue I am facing is slow booting. A new laptop shouldn't be so slow that too with almost empty hard disk.
4,Niceproduct
3,"The laptop is average buy, hangs a little and average looking, not backlit which was mentioned on the description. I bought it because I was in urgent need of laptop and shops are not opened in my locality due to covid curfew else I would prefer buying it from shop."
4,"Decent computer for normal internet browsing , document related work office work , general Video /Audio watch.It doesnt come with integrated camera but that was clearly communicated before we purchased. Last 2 weeks it has been working for the purpose.You can take this computer for home purpose as additional device for family to work on day to day stuff like kids for browsing , watching videos, read the assignment.  For online classes I am using this device along with Phone for connecting to Zoom/Google meet but home work etc can be done on the computer."
5,Very good product.. Excelent speed.. A camera would have been there to complete the gadget.
4,"I bought this as a backup laptop for work, 90% of which is related to spreadsheets and DBMS. It's perfect for work. The specs are too low for playing games, but that wasn't a consideration in my case. If you want a laptop for browsing and document/spreadsheet related tasks, this gets the job done.I'm docking a point because the charger provided had bent pins. I happened to have a spare adapter, so this wasn't an issue, but if you are buying a laptop from this seller, please make sure the adapter is of high quality."
4,"Its Japanese built laptop, keyboard has been modified with stickers to use US key board layout(could have avoided),Build quality is good. Seller could have avoided their advertisement stickers pasted on the laptop. This is not for gaming(provided we add ssd and more ram), no webcam. Apart from these its a very good value for money laptop for day-today use.Note: No inbuilt bluetooth support."
5,"Amazing Laptop for day to day use and for the price..I wanted a laptop for daily use in my village.. I have a good PC at home, so this laptop is just to keep my continuity in my productivity when I travel.Laptop feels solid, There is no build-in Camera/Mic, but I knew before I purchased it.Speakers could be better, but laptop speakers are normally bad, use an external speaker.What this Laptop is meant to do:Good Screen, 900p... Watch moviesWord, Excel, General browsingWatch movies, thanks to the big screen.Amazing Battery, so no need to think about charging oftenWhat this Laptop is NOT meant to do:Video/Audio production renderingGaming"
5,Office
5,I like very much
5,Writing after a week of usage :- Excellent in build quality.- Excellent in performance.- Above average in display.- Battery backup is amazing .- Good audio quality.
5,it is worth the price  value for money  but HDD 390 GB is setback
5,My son is using it for his online coaching. This is a made in Japan durable product. It has 15.6 inch screen. The laptop has numerical key pad .The screen is good.Very good for students online coaching.
5,This item was replaced with a superior laptop for an additional amount. New laptop received on time. It was a HP Litebook i7 5th Gen/ 8GB RAM / 256 SSD. Loaded with Win 10 Pro and was activated. Basic Screen. Good for my office use and meets my requirement. 512 GB SSD could have been better. Don't know if it can be changed.
1,"Received with a lots of stains on it, there is no camera, package was really bad. Request all NOT TO BUY."
5,Product is ok. I5 processor. No webcam. Service is good. Overall good experience with the seller.
4,"High energy consumption,low volume, 1 hours battery backup."
1,"Defective  item delivered by Amazon, and now facing problem to return it."
4,In low price Windows 10 and I5 processor .gd for gaming .
4,Keyboard key labels mismatched with key function... only 2 pin plug... no camera... no disk partition.... Windows OS installed and working...
4,"Worth for 20k as i used for mostly coding and YouTube videos and prince of persia game, works fine with 2 applications at time, if we want more then need tk purchase additional storage for 3k as told by owner."
5,"Machine is good, there are some scratches but that’s expected for a second hand laptop. Only disappointment is the battery back up. But that was taken well care by the supplier by replacing the battery."
5,"Fantastic Laptop. Even though it is renewed, the condition was extremely well. Powerful specs at the price it is being offered. Good after sales support from the seller. This is a value for money purchase for sure."
4,Very good
5,Super
5,"A great and affordable computer. It works very well for day-to-day tasks. It has windows 10 and the screen resolution is actually 1600 X 900, which is better than 1366 X 768."
5,An extremely value for money product. Customer friendly services and the laptop is of good quality. Happy with product and services.

4,For office work it's good
5,Good product
1,"Bought this laptop for online classes for my daughter’s online classes. Unfortunately the laptop is too slow to do anything, even Google meet is very slow. I know this is a budget laptop but nothing except for very casual browsing is possible with this. Screen and camera are also very very outdated. I would advise anyone looking at this laptop to add some extra money and get something i3 plus at least. Buy something future proof, this laptop feels like something from 20 years back."
5,Super quality loved it
4,Good product good speed i bought at 25600

Uninstalled anti virus to make system fasterAdditional issues1. Camera is very badOverall verdictYou cannot operate this laptop for any purpose. It is a complete waste of money"
5,"So I've used it for 2 days . According to me it's a good choice in this price , well i bought it from this seller itself at 26990 , now the price is shown 31000 .still it's great choice because in the Shop's in my town it's priced 35000 .so now performance , it does what it says , lag free smooth operation i tried 4k video which were stuttering in the i3 desktop in my friends house , it worked in the lap like we used to play 720p in my friends i3 desktop , i skipped many times quickly but never shown a bit of lag etc.. it was smooth and responsive . The build quality was also nice and lightweight . The dolby audio was clear as said . The camera was 0.3mp only . Well can do video call but not a clear hd video call. Screen was also very good after the updating of the graphics software (from windows update) . because when we get the settings are tuned in for power , it Last for around 6 hours with movies , software etc.. effortlessly . But i updated the graphics software and tuned to for maximum visual appearance , still it Lasted 4 hours with all sorts of usage including video editing apps , 4k video playback etc... The screen is mat Which is very nice , but in outdoors at noon etc the brightness may feel a bit not enough , but in indoors etc it's clear . It comes preloaded with windows 10 home latest version so windows update won't use much data , it's activated lifetime . It also has office 360 trial ! . and McAfee antivirus trial ! .i already had a key of office 2016 so i installed it amd activated it works smooth . also i had subscription of Kaspersky so switched to it . It has 1tb hdd ,two 3.2 usb port and one 2.0 usb port .one slot for sdcard , slot to add a ssd and a extra ram ,a HDMI port . The package contained laptop ,and charger ,and guarantee slip .the user manual must be downloaded from internet a qr code is provided to download it .i bought the ryzen 3 version . so that's my review in quick glance.i'll update as i remember. If i missed anything ."
2,Laptop looks fine. Delivery etc all well. But the edges are so very rough that they have bruised my hand after an hour of usage.Oddly amazon doesn’t recognise this as a defect and refuses to return/replace.
4,"4 GB ram is not enough to do all task smoothly ,i had losts of low  processing issue ,but when i upgraded the ram with 8GB it worked very well no problem at all after upgrading my ram to 8GB.So i suggest dont buy 4 Gb RAM  varient .BUY 8GB or 12 GB"
3,Very poor quality plastic. Locks broke when back was opened the first time. Screws sheared out of surface when I tried to fit them back. All USB ports at one side make it uncomfortable to use sometimes.
5,"I bought it for my wife's father, she paid. :)This product is perfect for the purpose it was bought. He is a tutor and during the pandemic he couldn't teach properly as he didn't have sufficient devices. This solved a lot of issues for him. Very happy to see him continuing his classes through online platforms again.One small thing happened is that within 2-3 months the audio port stopped working yesterday, where one puts in the headphones jack."
3,"This is a VFM laptop. Plastic body and screen vobbles due to plastic hinges much like Avita Pura laptop does.Windows 10 pre-installed but Office does not come alongsideAbsence of SSD drive makes it bit slow, you can upgrade SSD though by spending bit more.Updating after 2 days of usage:Speaker volume is very low. Speakers not good enough for hearing out clearly in online classes. You will need to attach external speakers to it."
4,Good Budget laptop below 35000.For basic use look and sound is also good.
1,"Don't purchase this. Now it is not working. Software is corrpted. While switching on nothing is showing in the display. One year warranty is there, now not completed  1 year."
1,"Not good,Too much lagging issues. Please don't buyWaste of moneyBetter go for I3"
1,Its Taking Too long time to Start almost 5 to 7 min to start after entering PIN... Then I Got Used laptop because another. persons name is showing while Login In...Worst experience ever.. Camera Quality Is wosrt tahn 10 years ago phones.. Terrible Performence.. Plz Go For I3 process or and Another laptop.. Overall build quality is good but screen is shaking under Fans Wind.. Dont Ho For it.. Increase ur budget and Go For Higher one 4 GB RAM is Not at all Suffeicient..
5,"It's a budget laptop, processor has great capacity for multitasking but its performance is restricted by HDD hard disk and 4 gb of Ram. If you can upgrade both then overall experience will be smooth.  I'll upgrade the both very soon.Go for it and be realistic about price to performance expectations."
5,"Lenova looks R one number, very light weight, true speed, easy installation, no hassles, thanks lenevo and Amazon u both worked good"
1,Please don't waste your money on this. It has been only a week and the laptop is even slow than a snail it take more than 2 minute to boot up and most of the time it shows system not responding even my laptop do not have any large software please avoid this as it is very difficult to replace and imposible to replace this.Even for online classes the camera is worst
2,"Waste of money. Please think 1000 times before you any product because you won't be able to return it. Performance is very low. Poor sound quality, poor camera. I have hp Celeron which is way better."
4,"Overall it's a good laptop considering the price if it's available around 26k else go with HP , battery backup is around 4 hours no ms office provided and McAfee is for 1 month only. Laptop is not heating much and whole laptop is made of plastic. Only upper part feels like metal but it's not metal."
1,"Got product on 13th May 2021, but only 10 months warranty remaining as shown in system as well as on Lenovo's warranty site.Systems hanging right from day one."
1,"Bullock cartIt is a time machine, which carry me in 1995 computer world.D  O  N  O  T  B  U  YN E  V  E  R  E  V  E  R"
1,The product has been absolutely useless. It is super slow. Called lenovo atleast 7 times.They admitted that it is slow but cant find fault with the hardware.The only solution they suggested was upgrade the memory.Only running windows and office.
1,Bhai sach sach bta rha hu koi mat kharidna bahut hi bekar or ower slow laptop h
3,"Very slow lappy, I uploaded my lappy after 6 years..now old laptop working fast than this one"
2,It is very very slow!!! Every appliaction takes ages to open.
1,Laptop is working very very slow..camera is worst..plz don't buy this one...when open any app in laptop...it will take 2-5 mins.

5,It's a awsm laptop with premium looks and great performance.
1,"Speaker is buzzing, new laptop, out of the boxEdit: The replacement laptop speaker is the same. You won't hear the buzzing while listening to a song or video however while increasing or decreasing system volume, the chimes crack, also for Windows pop ups, the chime sound cracks at more than 50% volume. Really weird issue."
1,"In specification, mentioned  4 1 Ghz processes but I received 3.0 GHz processor. It is a cheating. Seller take money for high configuration and provide low configuration 😥"
2,"It was good just for 7 days post delivery. I am not sure if i made a mistake buying it online. Laptop stopped working on 8th day and i had no option to place a request for replacement. I called customer service of HP they said within 48 hrs technician should visit and it's been more than 48 hrs and i have not even received any call. I spent Rs 42k and as i have to do work from home, my work is hampering also. Cpu turns on but no display. Did all troubleshooting but no improvement for this NEW GEN HP LAPTOP.On 27th HP sent an engineer and they are ready to help howver my case is pending  as of 16th April, as Amazon did not mention the serial num on invoice and p-slip. HP needs invoice with Serial number. I am very much disappointed as i am stuck between two big brands...it is good if machine works fine if you are unlucky then may gonna pissed off after sale. Let's see how long do i have to wait to obtain the correct invoice from HP.Note- accept invoice with sr number mentioned on it then only HP can entertain easily."
1,"Hi,I am totally disappointed with this purchase. I have spend the heavy amount but still i couldn't use the product. My request for replacement also not happened due to some irrelevant reason. I bought this laptop for son's study purpose. Due to this bad sales service my son's study also got impacted. Now this defective item is with me last 10 days. If my problem is not resolved in another two days. I will take this issue in next very seriously.Request your immediation action to resolve the issue.Thanks and Regards,Kajamydeen T"
1,"Horrible experience! First there was flinch in the screen ao i had to talk to the customer service for 2 hours before they declared it fit to be replaced. After I got a replaced laptop within 5 days the speakers went off, they started producing the most obnoxious voices. But till i realised i had to return it again it the 8th day and amazon couldn't replace. So I contacted hp they helped me but everyday i had to sit for hours talking to them explaining them their person came home checked it labelled it suitable to be replaced boxed it seqled it saying amazon will pick up. But nothing! Nor from Amazons side nor from hp its been 1 month now my laptop is sealed and kept. I'm calling everyday mailing everyday but no response. Its like my 50,000₹ have gone down the drain! Horrible services from both sides!"
1,I bought HP15s fr 2006tu it was delivered on 27/03/2021.When I was doing simple work but its laptop charger and laptop also getting heating problem so kindly see that and resolve the issue
5,Pros1.Display2.Very fast operation3.battery life4.light weight5 Msoffice 2019 student life timeConsBody is plastic looks delicateKeypad looks cheapNo backlight in keypad
1,Print on the keyboard keys is thin(font size and color) . Keyboard body color is silver. This makes it problematic to read keyboard keys. Especially at night when it shines due to room lights. This is bad design. It should be either in contrast color(black keyboard with white font) or it should come with back-lit keyboard. I even did not like display quality.
4,"I am working with i5 & i7 laptops and this is my first laptop i3 haven't notice big difference because of SSD and 11th generation version without hard drive. Setup took very less time , very fast processing. Sound quality good and Picture quality satisfactory. Within this cost I must say it's fabulous, must buy and enjoy working. I will not suggest for gaming purpose. Silver colour body makes executive looks, slim and very handy. Light weight and elegant design. I must give five star but somewhere I don't know I am rating four star.....may be something missing like sound card. Overall it's good laptop. Let's see in coming days how it performs and battery life....good luck."
1,"The laptop worked OK for 1 day. The other day itself after starting laptop, screen was frozen. Screen got completely wanky, broken and still. Running laptop hangs up & shuts down automatically. This was happening frequently. Just see the pics.I requested for return but the process of return itself was such a cumbersome process. Wasn't guided properly by customer care also. I ordered laptop in such an urgent situation that I needed laptop within 2 days. But it took me 2 long weeks for returning the laptop that too after continuous follow up, requests, arguments etc. Worst experience. Trust broken. I very DISAPPOINTED & SAD with the DEFECTIVE LAPTOP received from AMAZON."
4,"I made this review after using this laptop for 3 months as a good laptop to buy under 42K.I used it for last two months and I only faced the problem regarding battery life.  Battery consumed very quickly and also there was a issue of  heating. Although heating problem was normal in laptops. Otherwise it was vey fast, response quickly and no lag.  The camera was not so good. It was weighing light and thin and also it has a gloomy metal like finish which makes it's look quite awesome. Overall it was good for normal uses . I got this product without any  fault and as it was depicted in the display."
4,If looking for performance this laptop has best config and price comb. Boot in 5-6 sec. No lag. You get windows and office. Packing was good. All seal were intact.It can easily compete with i 5 9gen.But butbut there are some issuesFirst. The plastic quality is not that good. When you type the whole keypad goes down as the plastic there is thin.Battery backup is only 3-3.5hours with averahe load.The mcafee subscription was over when i got the laptop which is weird. But windows defender overcomes the need of any third party anti virus.Overall for performance its the best bang for your buck. Go for it. Just buy a wireless mouse for better effciencyScreen is also good but could have been brighter
1,"As I buy this since day when I start using within 2 days 1-fan got faulty2- Hanging issue 3-poor service, I have raised issue with HP but they only checking  hard disc and saying everything is normal , I have already reinstalled the os but issue is not resolved....Dint buy HP and product from Amazon...."
3,"Bought it for 41999, so far haven't faced any issue.Not so good things to consider before you purchase it:1. build quality: very fragile, won't survive a drop.2. speaker: average.3. camera: below average.4. Missing RJ45 port.I will update my review if I face any issue."
1,Product is broken and damage on front side. Please replace the item with same configuration.
1,"It seems this laptop has an inbuilt problem... As somebody mentioned in the review, the laptop frequently hangs (lots of pixels appear on screen) and restarts after that... I don't recommend this laptop to anybody..."
5,"I purchased this device with the exchange offer, so it was even cheaper for me..Pros:1. SSD provides great booting time of 4-5 seconds2. Smartly placed vent doesn't make it uncomfortable if it heats up a bit...also, pretty quiet3. i3 11th gen tiger lake cpus are 😎.... Minecraft runs with full graphics settings at 60fps consistently, capable device for coding (not for graphic intensive purposes)4. Sound is pretty good in this speakers, loud, and crisp, but base could have been better, supports spatial audio(headphone output)5. Trackpad is smooth, responsive, supports all gestures6. Active Noise cancelling microphones.7. 5 hours of battery life (at least) for browsing and video streamingCons:1.Camera quality... pretty noisy,2. Lots of bloatware from HP3.an ethernet port and micro SD card slot would be appreciated4. Type c port only upto 4GBPS transfer speed5. Keyboard might feel soft for some (personal preference)"
1,"On 2nd day of use after unpacking the box, all of a sudden the CPU fan started making cranking sound and screen got frozen. This happened again on the 4th day. I am returning it now. Very disappointed."
5,"I am using from last few days. Every thing is doing well, amazing speed, no lags, speakers, mic is well. Installation is fast and easy. Even heavy softwares run smoothly. Till now I am fully satisfied. If I found something wrong in coming days I will inform."
1,"Received a faulty laptop, amazon sent an executive next day and confrmed the same. Thanks to Amazon for approving the refund, however pick up guy delayed the process of refund."
1,"The product quality is really bad. Laptop's plastic quality is so bad that while holding the laptop, you will feel the laptop can break any time. Not expected this kind of quality from HP.The keyboard is another big issue here, the characters on the keyboard are very light and are not visible even from 1 meter away. You need to bend down and type the letters.Lastly the amazon service support is also poor, as per the policy they would not replace the product if there are quality issues that I discussed above. They will only replace in case of defect."
4,"Product delivery took time, but was delivered without any issues.Laptop looks good with silver color.Speaker quality is good.Screen quality is good.Boot time is quick.Leight weight and build quality is good (plastic) for this price range.Performance seems good, need to wait and watch.Battery life need to check.Webcam average, still managable."
5,"Laptop was delivered on time and works very well. HP laptops have a good build quality and are sturdy. For anyone looking for a reliable laptop which can be used for routine computing, this laptop is definitely worth considering. Came with a long adaptor cable as well making it convenient to work with. Good pricing and excellent online support are additional benefits."
1,"Window operating system clash with one week, hp service center  denied to attend, as per discussion with them there is no any issue at hardware side so they do nothing.gave customer care number of software site of hp for on line support,"
1,This laptop closed many times. Screen always gets crashed if we are watching any video Or doing any work . And exchange date has also crossed. I m not satisfied with the laptop. Only 10 Or 12 days has crossed.. And arising lots of problem
5,"A value for money productPros -1. 11th gen iCore processor is very fast2. okayish camera3. Faster access to files (SSD present)4. Wide screen laptopCons -1. Battery life is not what was expected.2. Position of fan in the laptop is very weird (not in the sides, rather below the display screen)3. Extreme Heat up during high performance tasks which heats up the display screen (check point 2 in cons)"
5,Worth to buy.
4,"Fast processing, very easy to set up and start using. Only thing i felt that can be improved is the display. Otherwise perfectly great choice. Boot speed is really good. Best product to buy in this range."
5,"Delivered a day earlier.  The laptop is exactly what I expected.  The SSD makes a big difference in the speed of boot and usage.8GB RAM with the laptop is required as even without any applications,  Windows10, antivirus and other startup programs takes up more than 40% RAM. Alexa is a good add on. All in all a good buy."
1,Worst product..... after operating the laptop for 5 minutes the screen got invisible.
5,Really a wonderful product i love the way it was protected and delivered to me loved itThabks amazon for such a wonderful productThe boot up is really cool it takes just less than 5 sec to boot up cool
4,"Very nice product and value for money4-5 hrs battery life , fast chargingLight weight, speakers quality not so goodFast processing5-10s for rebootBuild quality very niceDisplay very brightLatest featuresIntel ssdUhd graphicsLife time ms officeOverall best for light usage"
5,Very good machine for home user.  Got 9500 discount for my old i3 laptop.  Thus verygood value for money
1,"This computer hanged on first day... I had to force restart it. Battery life is good but for having a SSD it took 1 hour for restart after even first update,"
4,Product is good and met my expectations. It is very good value for money. Would have however appreciated the inclusion of a mouse and a computer bag along with the product.
5,I am completely stunned how fast 512 gb ssd rendered my pc. This pc is fasinating not only by looks and display but also elegant when comes to smooth performence.  Completely satisfied by product.
1,Worst product screen flickering issue & restarting issue..waste of money
2,Decent laptop but gets quite hot. The activation of ms office is not intuitive and required a bit of searching for me.
5,One of the best ultrabook available to buy.You can go for this product blindly. I purchased this from a Hp store for 74k with 3 years additional warranty for ₹499.ProsBest ever display available in this price segment.U can play Gta 5 with 60+ frames and other moderate gaming.Looke very sturdy and build quality is A1.The sound is just wow.Hp pen comes with rechargeable battery along with a cable.Very light weight laptop.Touch performance is awesome and feels in hand is just wowww for this laptop.Battery Backup is around 8+ hoursRyzen 5 4500 U processor is much better than I5-10th gen in terms of all the things. We can compare this cpu with intel i7 processor.Bye bye intel.Ryzen is the new era.Cons.No cons as of now.I Am fully satisfied with the product .You will never regret buying this product. Much better than macbook air in terms of all the things.
5,"I had always wanted to get myself a high processing and high utility laptop, and this was my first big purchase ever.I am an average 23 year old and I was desperately looking for a laptop which met the following criteria -1. Light enough to read books for long hours2. Touch screen for illustrating on Adobe3. Good computing power with processor specifics that could compile huge code chunks effortlessly4. A good display and speakers for entertainmentAfter months of research, I crossed my fingers and went ahead with the ryzen 5 processor (this was a first too, I was an Intel user), and it's been two months since this cutie has been with me and I am not disappointed. This is what I got :1. Laptop starts within 3 seconds.2. Brilliant keyboard design - the letters are so big and clear, and backlit, I like how they have removed the unnecessary shift key we don't use with the fingerprint sensor.3. I absolutely love the x360 feature which helps me illustrate and read with great ease.4. This also comes with the HP pen, for free, yes! I liked using it given how it easy it made illustrating on Adobe Fresco. But don't take my word, do your research on styluses, if you are a professional.5. It comes with a camera shutter on/off button, which I really appreciate and I didn't have to tape up the camera like I did for my other laptops.6. The display is oh so great, it was way beyond my expectations! It's perfect even in 0% brightness, it might be a little uncomfortable for those who use the laptop in dark in the beginning, but you will realise that it's so much better for your eyes.7. Oh, and did I say - you can also manage to pull off some moderate level of gaming too! I am not a gamer, and there are great gaming laptops out there, but you wouldn't want to settle down with this for core gaming.8. Multitasking at its best. Absolutely seemless, even in tablet mode.9. The speaker position is smart, which really makes sense when you flip the laptop in tablet mode. I also use an Elitebook, where the speakers are placed below the screen, and if I were to compare, I would say, Envy could have placed the speakers on top rather than below, but I don't think that's a major issue, because I feel Envy has a better sound surrounding system because it's placed on either side, unlike that of Elitebook.10. Very sleek and beautiful, I got the black one and it's incredibly light as promised.I do not regret even once for buying this over MacBook. I got this for 76k during the Great Indian Festival, and I think that's a steal given all its features and performance."
5,"This is d best laptop under 80000..I purchased it from HP store in Kolkata, it costs around 74000"
1,Hinge came out within 2 months - with just regular use and no impact one fine day one of the hinge broke apart ... looks like a premium laptop but build wise i have doubts not...Update: Hinge not covered under warranty. Please check HP forums you would see lots of similar complaints about this model...Update: Hinge replacement costs 23k..And would take 1.5 months for repair at HP center
4,"TL;DR -Build Quality - 9/10Performance - 9/10Display - 8/10Sound - 7/10Value for Money - 7/10Thermals - 8/10Tell me more!Build Quality -The laptop's shell is built out of aluminium and feels sturdy. The display is covered with glass all around, has narrow bezels with just a relatively thicker chin, but still looks premium. Overall dimensions of the laptop are diminutive, right there at the the top along with the leaders like the XPS 13, Spectre x360 in terms of compactness. It's very slim and quite light, fairly easy to carry around.Performance -The best thing about the laptop has to be the performance with its Ryzen 5 4500U processor. Good performance in day to day tasks, as well as in heavy tasks like Software Development. The NVME SSD (512 GB Samsung SSD) is plenty fast too, with sequential read/write speeds hovering around 3000/2500MB/s. The dual channel 8 GB RAM is non-upgradeable, so stay away if your workload needs loads of RAM. Coming to the thermals, it runs quiet and mostly cool. However, it gets pretty hot on the right side while charging using the supplied 65W adapter.Display -The display is sufficiently bright while producing good colours though not completely accurate. Reflection is noticeable in bright ambience due to the glossy display. The display does seem to be a little bit on the warmer side, but the colour temperature can be adjusted using the Radeon Settings. Also, at 13.3"", 1080p is fine for most purposes, if you're not accustomed to 4K displays or so. The 16:9 aspect ratio however hinders productivity tasks like Software Development where you might benefit from having a taller display like 16:10. On the flip side, it serves well for the multimedia needs.Convertible -Coming to the tablet part, the touch screen is fairly responsive, almost as good as a modern smartphone and it supports 10 finger multi-touch support. Being a 360 degree convertible, it can easily be folded all the way to work as a tablet or be set up in the tent mode for multimedia consumption. It also brings support for HP Pen 2.0 which is really good and feels pretty close to an actual Pen. The latency is acceptably low for a device of this class. The palm rejection however, was not always upto the mark and it would trigger zoom-in/zoom-out or similar actions while trying to draw/write in apps like Whiteboard and OneNote, though this may not be HP's fault.Speakers -The speakers on this convertible are not front facing, and the quality and loudness are above average for a Windows notebook but still far from MacBook territory.Keyboard & Touchpad -Keyboard and touchpad are decent and should do the job for most intents and purposes. As has been the case with most HP laptops, the keyboard has an extra column of keys containing Home, End Page up/down keys, which is a real bonus when working on Software Development/Coding/Writing.Network Performance -Wi-Fi performance was fine and nothing to write home about with the Realtek card only supporting Wi-Fi 5. Many laptops in this range now ship with Intel AX200/201 cards supporting Wi-Fi 6. Bluetooth connection also works as expected.Battery -Battery life on this convertible was not an issue and it easily delivered 6-7 hours on mixed workloads consisting of Web browsing, running C/C++ programs using VS Code, playing some YouTube music etc. on 60-70% brightness. Turning up the brightness would quickly start eating from the battery runtime as the display is quite bright at 400Nits.Extras -Most of the HP Laptops come with free Office, so that's a definite plus.Price -I got it at around 76k for my brother. It would have been a blockbuster had it been priced around 65-70k.Value for Money -Good value for money if you manage to get it around 70k."
5,"There's nothing to dislike about this laptop. Purchased it and instantly fell in love with this beautiful machine. It's fast, boot time takes 3 seconds to take you to windows hello screen and 2 seconds to your desktop. I use it for my office work and heavy spreadsheets run like silk. Also syncs seamlessly with my Samsung galaxy note and tablet completing the ecosystem. Screen is vibrant, blacks are as deep as an amoled screen although it's ips lcd panel. The laptop is very sleek and the finish is beautiful. Overall I am happy I chose it over macbook air."
5,"Best laptop for students and professionals as well . The HP Envy x360 13 is an excellent small two-in-one with a higher-end design than you'd typically get at this price -- assuming you can find one in stock. Factor in the solid AMD performance and battery life and it's an easy recommendation .and taking about processor (b/w ENVY and PAVILION)The Envy has a better processor, battery and a much better graphics card. However, the Pavilion comes at a lower price than the Envy..will Recommend  👍 (POSITIVE)Will update the review after a couple of weeks ."
5,"Laptop that does complete justice to every penny paid-Had done a lot of research before buying 13.3 Inch laptop and finally went with this laptop. Below is what I felt with 2 weeks of usage.- Was in two minds buying an AMD laptop but this laptop just cleared all my doubts on AMD Processor. There are no lags and performance is great. Have tried games like GTA 4 and it works without any issues. Only issue which i felt is that Laptop gets heated up around left side of the keyboard under heavy loads.- Battery backup time what I am getting is as promised by HP.- Speakers give ample output, felt sound below average in laptop mode mainly because of the position of the speaker.- Browsing speed is awesome haven't faced any connectivity issues so far.- Touch performance is great, pen also serves the purpose.- Webcam and microphone does the purpose well.- Keyboard keys feels premium and backlit keys also works well.- Windows Hello Finger Print Login works really fast.- Laptop came with Office 365 License as promised.Overall a great experience with HP Envy x360 !!!!!!"
5,"I am writing this after usage of around two months. So far I am a very satisfied customer. I was initially skeptical about AMD Ryzen but now I can say it is better than intel (on feel factor basis, have not done any tests). What do I use it for - browsing (with 10+ tabs and cloud based business Apps running in parallel), Video calls over Teams and Zoom (both video and sound quality is pretty good), office applications (multiple word, excel and power point documents remain in open state). key board and touch pad is very smooth and convenient (have pretty thick fingers). Get 8+ hours of battery backup though not tested the limits.The down side , left click of touch pad requires more precision and hard press. The pen and writing experience in comparison to the Apple iPad Pro stands no where close"
5,"Absolutely love this 2-in-1 laptop, though it cost me above ₹75kPros:- Lightweight- Design looks premium- Blazing fast, boots up under 10 secs and shuts down in fewer secs. Maybe it is so because of combination of 8GB RAM, SSD & Ryzen 5 processor.- All application loads up within secs. Haven't tried video editing or play heavy games yet, but it should be capable enough. But I suppose envy 360x isn't purposed for either.- Touch has very good response, though I rarely use it.- Keyboard is comfortable enough for the size.- Pen is a nice extra without any additional cost, though I will be rarely using it.- Display is fantastic.- Sound too is crisp & has enough loudness. I am not a audiophile.- Battery life gives me around 7 to 8 hrs of normal use. It charges up too very fast.- MS Office Home & Student 2019 has been included with lifetime license. Which is absolutely fantastic, for I will be spending most of my productive time with it.There are almost nothing that didn't meet my expectations, in fact ended buying another one for my boss on my recommendation. I had zeroed in on Spectre (which cost are maybe ₹40K more) & Envy, maybe I made the right choice.Cons:- Body & Screen are finger print magnet, but can live with it."
5,"PROs:Really Compact and well built. Dense Chassis.AMD Ryzen 4500U is a truly great processorGood touch screen for writingScreen is decently bright with good viewing anglesCONs:Gets hot under load, the fans ramp up to full on load and gets quite loudGaming is only fow very light games on lowest settingsTouch screen is not good for Drawings and Sketches, as there is jitters in the lines"
1,Guys be aware after receiving this  laptop when i checked warrenty online i was shocked because warrenty already started 6 month ago with someone else name so Be careful.Thanks to Amazon for considering this and returning the laptop.However laptop looks premium and nice. Sound is great and display is awesome. Pen is not that responsive.
4,"Everything is perfect when it comes to the product. Go for it blindly. But price keep fluctuating for this product. I paid around 80k, within days its about 77k. It could go down as low as 73k with bank discount offers during festive seasons. I feel cheated by the seller for this high price hence only four star. Buy only when you get good discount offers. Don't be impatient like me."
1,Purchased this expensive machine only to see that the screen died the very next day. Disappointed ... very disappointed as now I will have to go after all the HP service centre guys to see that it is repaired.
5,Sleek and beautiful. Got it for my wife. She's loving it. Envy is the perfect name because it's exactly how people who own MacBooks feel when they see it and hear the price.
5,It is a very much compact light weight solid built 2 in 1 laptop. Probably the best 2 in 1 available at this price point in the market. Display quality is superb.
4,"awesome laptop, power full, super display, nice touch response, good build and perfect for entertainment, with office work.con, in tablet mode after complete flip if screen gose off you can't turn it on unless you flip your laptop back to original,speaker volume is not that louder."
4,"Has a premium feel to it, it is compact and lightweight which helps. 3rd Gen Ryzen 5 processors are pretty good, rarely an application gets stuck. Serves well for general purpose laptop. Keypads are good, soft and easy to adapt. Found the speaker quality decent, has Bang & Olufsen speakers, quite decent for regular videos, don't expect anything fancy in this aspect.Touch can be better. Also, they do give you a free stylus, but the touch, sensitivity is very average. Has a pretty good battery life and didn't find any major heating issues. Given the laptop finish and color, it is easy to leave fingerprints, that can be a bit annoying.But overall, an awesome laptop."
4,"I have purchased this model - ay0045au from another big online store. Since no one is mentioning this and people would want to know, this model has 400 nits brightness. It is written on the product box and also if you download any hardware information tool (like Aida64) you can know the panel used, it is a 400nits panel.This is a great laptop but two cons I feel are worth mentioning -So why 4 star and not 5? - Because of the price, I got this for 71k after all the discounts. It would have been 5 star below 70k.Yes, we get the latest hp zenvo pen with type-c charging and two extra tips, but remember hp pen tips are not sold separately anywhere (at least till now, may change in the future), this was a big letdown which I found after buying. So, if all your tips are gone, you'll have to buy a new pen... (therefore will not recommend this laptop to a person buying to do professional drawing, otherwise, your pen tips will get used up pretty fast, instead go buy iPad pro).Update - I had to now include pics since someone claimed this is 300nits brightness. See the attached pics, it really is 400 nits, this is written on the product box image."
4,"I've been using this laptop for the past 3 months. Actually, I was looking for a 13-inch windows laptop So I bought this, and to be honest this is a crazy laptop with good built quality and performance is bonkers. I've binge-watched series in this with external speakers and even used it for my online classes, photo editing, the battery is very sufficient, lasts around 13-14 hours solid. But in mine hinges, one side is slightly uneven than the other but they work absolutely fine. No issues so far. Best laptop. If you're looking for a cute, powerful, handy, and efficient laptop, go for the HP Envy x360 13 ay0045au."
5,"Great product. Positives: sturdy, sleek, elegant, backlit keyboard, touchscreen (with/without stylus), 360 degree rotation, great battery life, strategic positions of speakers. Negatives: definitely overpriced considering the small screen size and AMD processor"
5,"A dream laptop for most of the people. Has all the specifications and an unmatched performance.Initially thought of buying Lenovo Flex 5 which has the same configuration but Lenovo Flex 5 has poor build quality, made full of plastic and even it's keyboard makes crackling sound while typing.This HP Envy 13 is build of Aluminium, has excellent touch response, sturdy hinges and a great stylus. Hence an ideal laptop.Note :- There is a price gap of 8,000 between Lenovo Flex 5 and Hp Envy 13.Lenovo Flex 5 = ₹64,000HP Envy 14 = ₹72,000Only difference is of the build quality."
4,The stylus is not working fake stylus
5,I  liked this product very much. It features are very attractive and useful.  the multi- functional. uses  like tablet and laptop is very nice.  The light weight and easily handle with touch screen is beautiful.the large screen is easy and clear pictures are add advantage.
5,"Like: light laptop for everyday use. Good features intended for creativity with spectacular display. No issues with programming as well; I've used it for coding and image analysis.Dislike: while using the pen, taskbar is active which pops up other applications every now and then!"
4,"Overall, laptop is best in term of performance, specification, and user-friendly. The only problem, in table mode if laptop goes to sleep there is no way to wake up the laptop without flipping back to laptop. Although, there is an option with the help of digital pen to stick in the lower hing but didn't works everytime. Other than this, it's perfect."
5,There is an issue with the Speaker volume - it's inconsistent - probably because of a driver and Windows 10 update conflict. No solution found till now.
5,"Posting the review after using the laptop for 2 months. I am a light user, so the battery life is great (~8 hours). The touch screen works amazing. The look and feel of the laptop is elegant. Overall, a great purchase for me."
4,Laptop is excellent and compact.Touch screen is good and Ryzen processor is much faster than Intel in my view.The network is not picking up sometimes rarely  & system needs a restart.Need to be fixed by HP .otherwise a good Laptop to buy
2,I think purchasing these product is bettee in offline.i received a damaged product by default ie a dead pixel on the screen and a broken key on the keyboard. Didn't expect to get a too low quality laptop from a brand like hp and sold by Amazon
5,Great light convertible. Thin and easy to use. Big illuminated keys. Fast and easy on the eyes with adjusted brightness. Enjoying the experience
5,I have used it for a month now. The laptop is a gem. Its fast. Value for money. Touch is good. Great for people requiring two in one laptops. Overall experience is awesome. The only thing that is very average about this laptop is the HP pen and its built quality. Very mediocre built quality considering the price you pay for it.
5,I was looking for a light weight laptop with small touch screen so that I can use it like a tab this is the only laptop matching my requirements under my budget (<80k).I brought it for 75k.
5,"Components and premium , laptop and lightweight and compact.You should buy HP laptop because of their strong customer support. Recently I had a booting issue and HP resolved it promptly via online support"
2,Wireless adapter keep missing. Tried to update driver but no use. Only solution is to restartSpeed is good and fast enough fir most use cases
5,"This is one good purchase, provides decent speed, touch screen is smooth, bit disappointed with battery, with full on usage it at max goes good for 4 hours"
5,Everything is good except the ram.. there should have been an extra upgradable ram slot
3,I think there is issue with speakers at some point it plays loud and automatically decreases to low I didn't understand where the problem is with speakers or software apart from this issue everything is good
5,Amazing buy. Performance is beyond expectations. Boots up in 3/4 seconds and works without lag. This is expected from pc of this cost but this is beyond expectations.Performance plus looksMore than 5 star for this product
5,"A laptop which is handy, versatile, fast and cute looking!"
1,"I bought  this  laptop  due  to its  was written  in specification 7 hours  battery  life  but  very  disappointed, because  battery  runs  only  2 hours  with  normal  use, after  full  recharge. Company  making  fool  to show  7 hours  battery  life."
5,Good value for money productHP always best...It feels upmarket.. people will jealous on you..Good sound qualityGood lookingNice designLight weightGood battery backupAnd ofcourse fast performance..
2,Look and feel: GreatKeyboard: GoodBoot time: Really fastDisplay : GoodWeight: Light.Performance: Under medium use ( Browsing and watching youtube for about an hour) the laptop heated up. The component that heats up is the SSD which goes upto 90 degree celcius.I wouldn't recommend this laptop.
5,"I was looking and doing research for a laptop since 15 20 days.And my requirement was - Fast processing speed. Primary use is usual Home and Office use, You Tube, Netflix, some heavy Coding on Python, light graphic work, and occasional gaming. My idea was to buy a laptop which would last for next 5 years.Here is My Journey to buy a Laptop:My basic must have search criteria:Budget 40k to 60k15.6 inch screenMinimum 8Gb RAM (Expandable upto 16 Gb)Free lifetime Windows and OfficeBacklit keyboard (Optional)SSD DiskLight weightBattery Life min 2-3 hours, & fast chargerNVIDIA GraphicsNo cost EMISearch results were Lappies with mostly Intel i3, AMD Ryzen & Intel i5.I discarded AMD because of my pathetic and sorry experience with AMD Ryzen laptop (HP Probook 445R G6 AMD Ryzen, with AMD Radeon integrated graphics, 8 GB RAM.Discarded Lenovo models because(1) RAM expandable only 12 GB - This may not be sufficient in longer run.(2) Intel UHD/Iris Graphics - This chews up existing RAM. If you have 8 GB RAM you will get usable space of only 6 Gb or less, as a result may not get enough RAM space and applications may Lag.(3) Prefer SSD over HDD, SSD is super fast.Then i did further research and found Intel i5 is robust and more faster as compared to Intel i3because of 4 cores.Shortlisted belowAcer Aspire 5 AS15-56HP 3500TXHP 3047TXThen selected HP 3047TX because of 1TB additional space for a little more money.Result after 20 days of usage:1) Fast start up - 5 to 10 second max2) Fast shut down - 5 to 10 seconds max3) Restart in 20 - 21 seconds4) Battery life is 3 to 4 hours on single charge and moderate usage.5) Superb graphics, thanks to NVIDIA MX3506) Free office and windows for life time7) Free software utilities from Intel8) Immersive experience esp in 8K videos9) Backlit keyboard is lovely10) Looks and Feel of a premium laptopAnd at the End of the day i get a Lag free experience in my day to day work on Apps, Python coding, Graphics.- Only think for improvement is on Speakers, and Audio quality. I wish HP should put at-least put Dolby with Harman/JBL/AKG.Overall great laptop, and i wish this lasts for 5 years atleast."
1,fake advertisement .7 hour battery  back up.it discharge only one hour.requested every one don't purchase electric article online.

1,"Review after use of 15 days.All button and screen start to freeze. Task bar is frozen from last 4 days.Very bad product, don't go with this. Fully it is a waste of money 😟😟😟"
4,S I am very eager to write the review. 1st of all I was frightened to buy it online. But now I am satisfied. I am using it since a week and 12-14 hrs a day. I observed that no heating issues till now. And battery backup is cool with 5-6hrs with medium usage. No far no issues but still I observe some struck when I refresh.
1,The task bar & Microsoft store is not functioning. When contacted HP team after lot of follow up they asked to reset the laptop . The issue got resolved but only for one day . Next day again the same issue happened. In last one week I had to reset the laptop 3 times to resolve the issue. This is really frustrating. Not getting any permanent solution fro HP. Want to throw away this Laptop.
1,Within just 2 days laptop is not working properly
4,"Seems good laptop. The only disadvantage is arrow keys. The up and down arrow keys are small in size. For developer, the up and down keys are like could be frequently used."
1,"Poor battery life ,worst product ,don't buy it at all ,buy asus laptops better than every company ,don't waste u r 65k on this blody cheap product"

2,"Amazon & HP Seller - Packing std very bad, can't devide drive more than two drives, according to product price is to much high, over heating, only it's looking nice. It's only show piece. Performance only good not better, but sound is best."
4,"All good except battery 🔋 standby time.Promised battery 🔋 standby is 7 hrs, but in reality it is 3 hrs."
3,Battery life very less.in2hours it drains out.very bad battery
2,The laptop is very nice. But the battery life is not up to the mark. It works for only 2.5 hours with very light use . I bought this product because it was written avg batteryife is upto seven hours but I am highly dissatisfied. But charging rate is fast. Otherwise it's fine. You can other products for the same price whose battery is muach better.
1,The lap top is not working. Raised this issue and still the issue not yet resolved. Spending so much money resulting this kind of issue is painful.

3,Good product.  But very high heating.
4,"Good sound quality, battery back up is so so."
3,Only battery issue
1,"I purchased this laptop offline in HP showroom at 65K, buying experience was good. It was just launched and since it is 11th generation laptop and that too from HP, I purchased it without doing much research. After using continuously (daily 6-8 hrs) for a month, Following are my observations. Since this laptop suffers from major issue, I will highlight first its CONS and later its PROS.Major Drawback:1. Major drawback of this laptop is its battery life and I must say,  it is worst. I don’t know how and at what conditions HP tested it (may be in sleep mode) and claims 7 hrs battery life. For very normal usage (just browsing email, some documentation), battery last for TWO and Half Hours. Not at all it goes beyond 3 hours. This is condition for newly purchased laptop, now you can imagine after two or three years of usage, how much battery life. (one advice here for those who have already purchased, just TURN OFF all background APPS and use it on aeroplane mode, it will give extra battery life of 15 min. Since now we are forced to use this laptop so some relief)2. Second major issue is its Fan noise. If you open multiple applications, processor fan runs very fast and it makes so much noise which is very much irritating. It remains there for 10 minutes then after some time it smoothens and again starts suddenly. This cycle repeats.3. Another issue is HP online service (online WhatsApp chat). For above two issue, I contacted customer care to get issue resolved. Believe me these people are horrible. They are very polite but are robots. First thing, they will ask to do some settings and will take more than hour to do so many things (update this, that, ….and what not.). We keep doing all these things with hope that something will get resolved but at the end they will give a stupid solutions and will tell, “Sorry we are unable to isolate the issue, so please visit nearest service center”. Can you imagine to visit HP store and stay there in Que for newly purchased laptop to get repaired after paying 65K.4. I have not yet tried for heavy applications; I don’t know whether this noisy fan will be able to cool the processor for heavy programming or not. It heats up lot for regular usage also.PROS:1. Boot very fast, within 10 sec, it will start. Display is excellent, wide screen and pleasant2. Keypad is very smooth. You will love typing. Voice mode typing is available. Also Backlit is there which is good feature.3. Overall look is impressive and it is lightweight, Fingerprint sensor is there. I found it most useful and very quick.5. Touchpad is also good. You can do zoom in-out and similar thing by using two finger just like touchscreen6. Comes with Windows 10 life time license which is great. Also MS Office 2019. Very useful and advanced.7. Battery charging is fast, within 1 hour it will be charged 100% (but will drain in 2Hr..ha ha..ha)8. It will come with ALEXA (oops is it PROS or CONS, since it is damm dim)So final verdict is , DON’T BUY. I will not recommend to buy this faulty product. Either go for other brand with same specification or different model from HP.  Be careful, all HP models are not good."
5,Good and coming to performance it was too fast and it  is reasonable price to buy this laptop and it is over all excellent
5,Booting very speed and battery on working mode 4.5 hrs. Value for money. Graphics 2 gb memory it's ok. Dual hdd
1,"Not at all worth buying it. I had to return this laptop within a week. I faced lot of issues with bitlocker encryption. I had to followup with Hp and microsoft customer care for their support. The boot up time was almost 5 mins or even more. Which was slow compared to the configuration that they are specifying. At last, ina few days, the hard disks of my laptop were not being detected. Just the SSD were detected. I would definitely not recommend this laptop for anybody"
4,"I used this laptop a weekFirst off all I will say the battery back up is only max up for 2 hrs... I only do net surfing and seen some vedio and the battery get low.I didn't understand why it is given 7 hrsNext thing if I talk about qualities every thing is nice I like the keyboard, touchpad,finger print sensor,ssd storage etcBut if you are looking for long battery performance battery laptop then don't buy it.."
5,"I received this laptop on 21st April 2021 and i am writing this review after a week's usage.I will break this down into 3 parts which are:1) Specifications2) Real World Performance!3) For whom is it?=>Specifications: How it looks on paper?AMD Ryzen5 5500U built on 7nm technology is a beast and can run through anything you throw at it.It has 6 cores and 12 threads and they are decently clocked. GPU present is AMD Radeon integrated graphics.It comes with 8GB (Micron Technology 3200MHz) SODIMM RAM and out of that 512MB is allocated to VRAM. You can increase the RAM up to 16GB in future with both RAM’s working in dual channel mode.It has PCI Express 4.0 and 512 GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD.For other hardware info: https://support.hp.com/in-en/document/c07119618Now if you look at these specs it is definitely a steal deal. No other laptop company is giving you these specs at this cost in India. [₹50,990]=>Real World Use: What things matter in day to day usage?1) Boot time: Try to spell the laptop name along with the model number and it will be up and running. For me it was always less than 20 seconds.2) Battery Life: Normal usage – 6 hours, Intensive usage – 3 hours (These generally vary on what you have installed on your laptop and background processes)3) Multitasking: It can handle your tasks easily and most of the times it will be a cruising experience.4) Display: Here it depends on an individual’s priority. It has a BrightView (glossy) display with 250 nits brightness which is decent for indoor use but it will struggle under sunlight. So, you can either use an anti-glare screen guard for your purpose or make a compromise because of the price.5) Gaming: It can handle casual gaming very well. I played FIFA 19 for a while at low settings and never once it suffered a frame loss. Will update it with more games and cofigurations.6) Portability: It weighs around 1.4 kilograms and is easy to carry around.7) Build Quality: I would say since its lightweight+14inch so a little compromise on build quality should not be a concern. It looks like it’s made of hard plastic but maybe here and there HP might have used some aluminium (or any other alloy). Sometimes when you lift the laptop with a single hand it produces a faint creaking sound. Feels like it’s due to hard plastic but can’t ask more at this price point.8) Ease of Use: It comes with Microsoft office Home and Student 2019, HP Support Assistant, HP PC Hardware Diagnostics & Alexa for romance(lol). So, this gives you a very good platform to work on without any hiccups and still if it’s there (Same old Linux vs Windows thing) then you have enough tools to deal with it.9) HP Hinge: No one talks about it so I brought this up. Most of the HP laptops faced this issue 3-4 years back but now I think its alright. I regularly use HP Zbook as my office laptop and I think this laptop uses the same type of hinge (quality difference is definitely there but Zbook is expensive too). Hinge is not too tight but Ok’ish tight.10) Speakers: They are not adequately loud but produce clear sound with a decent base. If you are using it casually to watch movies/videos in a not so loud room then it will be fine. Dedicated Bluetooth speakers are definitely going to outperform the budget segment laptop speakers. Personal suggestion is to buy one if you are willing to use this laptop to watch movies/videos in a group.11) Heating: Whatever work I have done in last 7 days I did not face any overheating issues (AMD processors are doing a good job here). Fan is silent most of the times. Only when you are running intensive tasks you can hear them gushing air out of the laptop’s fan vent.12) Keyboard: It has a laptop sized backlit chiclet keyboard with two levels of brightness control for the light. Again, I would say it depends on one’s preference and budget.13) Connectivity: It has Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 4.2. For day to day use its Ok but not seamless. I faced some speed drop while being connected to both. When I disconnected the Bluetooth, it was back to normal. I still need to confirm it with other users.14) Zoom/Teams/Skype calls: Haven’t tested the video on live calls which very much depends on how good your internet connectivity is but it has a good camera setup. It is missing physical camera shutter but that’s fine with me.15) Trackpad is not that great but it gets the work done. It would have been better if it had two click buttons. It supports multi touch and gestures.16) After Sales Service: HP has one of the best after sales service so it has to be mentioned. It’s always a plus point.Overall, it is a great laptop and is performing better than what I expected. I tried to keep all relevant points and these points may be updated in future after a long-term use. Do let me know if I missed anything.P.S.: No unboxing video was made by me 😜Just a neutral review with no promotions for either party.=>Is this laptop for you?This is a very subjective question and its answer depends on how you are going to use the laptop.In short here are my views:1) College Students: Considering the fact they need to run various simulation/modelling software along with an added benefit of portability it’s a good option for them. This laptop would be able to handle all of that.2) Business Professionals: Its portability will attract you but if you are looking for durability too, I would suggest you to wait a little and see if there are alternatives. Its not a laptop like ThinkPad which can also be used to play cricket.3) Content Creators: Your first choice would be Apple’s M1 powered devices but if you are on a budget then there is no other laptop near 50K who can compete with them on paper. It has 6 cores and 7nm tech whereas M1 has 8 cores and 5nm tech but the price difference is huge. I know it’s a wrong comparison but still it shows the power of this processor. I would encourage you to get one more 8GB RAM stick at the time of purchase only.4) SDE’s/ML Engineers/Data Scientists:  It’s a good laptop for you too. It has expandable RAM capacity and a good processor. It would be able to handle data manipulation, cleaning, etc. well and can run popular software with ease. For those doing intensive tasks like deep learning where high end GPUs are suited, they should definitely give this a rethink. But for that too we have alternatives by using cloud-based processing/computing power. Beginners can manage with 8GB RAM but later on you would need to increase it to 16GB.5) Others: If you don’t need much computation power then go for cheaper laptops, they would also be able to manage your day to day tasks. HP 14s fq1029au is an excellent choice for you.So ending this with just one conclusion….you will not get a better laptop under 51K at this time."
1,I don’t have a review about the product. It’s about the seller. On the backside of the laptop one screw is tampered. It’s like someone struggled and opened it. I didn’t notice it first. I opened the laptop and checked the warranty. Warranty started on April and I bought the laptop on May. I doubt that someone opened the lap and replaced something. Saddest part is that this delivery was fulfilled by Amazon. The retailer was VTM_SLP. I think the laptop is good but never buy it from this retailer. And if Amazon.in or hp cares about their reputation; blacklist this seller.
5,"Bought it for Rs. 50,990.Pros:1. Excellent sound. Loud clear with decent bass. Did not expect this.2. Really good display. Decent peak brightness. Excellent viewing angles.3. Decent webcam. Better than expected.4. No heating issues. At full power option, kept only warm.5. Good battery. I guess on normal workload (word, excel, youtube, browsing), you can expect around 7 hours easily.6. Good feedback on the keyboard. Good travel distance.7. Has backlit keyboard.8. Speedy ssd drive and powerful processor.9. MS office 2019 bundled for free.10. Trackpad does the job. Has multigesture support.Cons:1. Looks and colour (subjective). Doesn't feel premium and silver isn't really a good choice.2. Heavier than i expected. Not sleek.Haven't stress tested the laptop yet. Didn't test graphics.Overall verdict - unless you want to wait for Zen 3 ryzen processors (remember 5500u is 5000 series but is based on Zen2, not Zen3), choose this without hesitation."
5,"Great product with AMD Ryzen 5 5500u. 8gb ram with one empty slot and dual channel support. 512 gb NVMe M.2 ssd upgradeable upto 2 tb. 2 stage Backlit keyboard, glossy screen, great 65w charger, good variety of ports, good for programming and browsing and multitasking. Comes with pre lodaed win 10 and office 365 with life time lisence. Overall best for programming and day to day working. Because I bought it only for programming. At these price range one can blindly buy it."

3,"Packaging is very good and safe and Only good thing in this laptop is Processor is latest and efficientI observed some cons in this laptop are:Not anti glare displaySpeaker Sound feels low sometimesBattery charging takes nearly 2 hours for full charge inspite of having 65 watts fast charger.Battery life is around 4-5 hours on normal usage.Pros:Efficient processor 5500u fast processingBack lit keyboardVery easy to handle ,light weight and portableMain points to consider while buying this laptop are:They installed Hynix 512GB SSD Which is of average quality when compare with Samsung and some other brands.8 gb Ram is of micron company"

5,"First like to appreciate seller vtm slp... Very helpful and faster replies.. Helped in replacement too.Laptop is great. Slightly looks bulky but around 1.5kg.No heating issues, v fast.

5,"Writing this review after 7 days of use.Love this product ❤️ it has a good battery life,and because of the SSD it is very fast🔥I used it on the minimum brightness and with the keyboard backlight off then it gave me around 7-8 hours battery life .I used premier pro and when it was loading there was a little flicker but then it worked smoothly!Overall good product , I'm satisfied ❤️Also no problem with the seller - appairo ltd.It's good deal, go for it👍"
3,"Today it got delivered to me, this is just initial impressionLaptop looks cheap build quality is cheapEven the edges between( from area around the keyboard and side )is not evenly assembledFor anyone looks of the laptop matter plz avoid it"
4,"Where do I start, 6core 12 thread 5500u handles everything you throw at it.Light weight,has 65 watt charger arguably the most value for money laptop with 5500u processor.I would recommend a ram upgrade if you want to utilize full potential of this laptop.The only time fan noise was audible is during bios update Battery 4/5Display 4/5Keyboard 4.5/5Will update later on"
1,"Although The Laptop is State of the Art and all the things mentioned in previous reviews, please be aware that MS office has to be bought to be activated in this laptop(minimum of 4899 per year for single use) . This will include word and exce.lOutlook Express has to be bought seperately."
5,"I usually don’t write reviews but this is such a steal for 51k, just go for it. Obviously try if you can get it offline first but if not, Amazon is great. Although YouTube reviews said the Bluetooth and wifi are older versions, they work absolutely fine with my new gen devices too. Boot time initially is 6 seconds then after some changes and app installation 8-9 secs.•Ryzen 5 at this price is just wow•Body + looks are amazing and sleek•You get MS office•SSD is great and fast overall•The speakers omg amazingIt’s amazing 💜 I’m happy with the purchaseDo get a wireless mouse for a better experience"
3,"Nice range laptop under 51000k.Some cons : 1)laptop panel is little loose due to which side panels keeps moving while u sit under full fan # like Avita laptops2) Adaptor gets more heat while charging due to which laptop gets heated3) keeping laptop on bed or cushion/pillow gets heated from backside -dont know why !4) now a days hp support are too slow , raise a complain for change of adaptor more than 5 days over still no calls.5)Rest is all okay, small things matters alot while buying.Antiglare :2/5Brightness:4/5Battery: 4.5/5Processor:4.5/5Heating : 1/5Adaptor heating :1/5Value for money: 3/5"
5,"*First read all points after pressing the buy now tab.1. Many users are telling in reviews that ""This product is broken, damaged ,opened, software issues, warranty started one month before , Invoice , (Serial no.) not given in invoice etc.Ans. First of all , after buying any product from Amazon or any online platform .SEARCH first for verified sellers of any brand product on their product Website . ie. Ihave searched Hp website after buying this laptop where i found that the only seller (Appario retail pvt.ltd) is showing as a verified , because 1000 of fraud sellers are Roaming in all online platforms.*Imp>1. If you got some other SSD in place of SAMSUNG then you are ripped. Because in this model (14s fq1030au and 14s 1029au ) hp company is providing samsung ssd.2. if you haven't got any invoice or poduct serial no. in Invoice , then you are buyed from unverified seller. (they can replace anything in product because HP company dosen't sells them product directly and they won't take their service as their responsibility.3. IN MY BUYING EXPERIENCE >*product is well packed, no any damage.* Proper invoice with serial no. is given.*Display is IPS and glossy (not anti-glare).*tiny screen bleeding in left bottom screen (as normal to all laptops).*sound is not loud but very clear voice that makes feel premium.*Use all laptops on table or at solid surface instead of using on bed etc ,For better ventilation.*I'VE brought it from appario retail pvt.ltd.*Very good and sleemless performance.*Body is made up of plastic but of premium quality.** Brought it for 50990/-* If your budget is 50-52k last then buy it without any hesitation .***THANKS ALL**"
5,"Good screen, clear and loud sound. Best is we get a backlit keyboard which is not mentioned in the description. Best laptop in this price."
5,"Firstly, Amazon service is great. My Laptop got delivered within 24 hrs. You will get amazed by the look.After one week of usage, I must say that, this laptop is worth to buy.Processor Ryzen 5 is superfast. NVME SSD makes it even more faster.Display is awesome.Backlit keyboard is also looks cool.It is lighter in weight. So, you can carry it anywhere.Camera can be better but still it is good.Battery gets fully charged within 2 hours (If you have 15% before charging). Also, it lasts for a complete day. So, nothing to worry.As I am not a gamer. So, this review is based on my experience as a programmer who works in IT industry."
5,"Bought  this for Personal  Coding  using  Visual Studio, VS Code and SSMS all works smoothly. The review  after 2 days.The laptop  looks very attractive  than the sample pictures  shown here.Pros*Slim*Best Display*light  weight*boot time*small bezelsCons*Build Quality Week*FragileThere is a small crack near audio jack for tge item that I received.Overall Value for Money."
4,battery last 6 - 7 hrs on battery save mode with half brightness. But only last 1-2hrs on performance mode.Ryzen 5 5500u is best at this this price pointif you mant more processing power go for ryzen 7 5700u.diplay is goodbuild quality is not that good. there are some small panel gaps. i was going to buy lenovo thinkpad e14 gen 2 amd but its has poor screen quality so i bought this.ms office life time validity and i also got 100gb of dropbox for 12 months.very portable and lightwieght.overall rating 4/5
4,"Laptop's specs are good. Configuration wise this laptop is amazing. However, the build quality of this laptop is not upto the mark. The quality could have been better.Trackpad is just average doesn't funtion well. It's better to use external mouse. Display is good but doesn't come with anti-glare display.Keyboard does seems like made of cheap plastic and you could see the flex in keyboard as well.Although laptop's performance will not disappoint you."
5,"Cheapest, efficient and reliable laptop to have. It has really beaten IdeaPad and best configuration in this range. Couldn't have asked for better. Battery is doing well 4-5 hours on medium brightness. Ryzen 5500 U is delivering really great results in multi-core performance. Really handy and light weighted. Go for it. Cheers"
1,It's very slow in its processing.
5,"I use this product for coding.It's light and fast, only thing I am concerned about regarding this product is durability, although it has a aluminium body its not strong and it should he handled with care.Screen is good its an led displaySpeaker system is also good.You can definitely go for this product if you want to code or do some office workIt's definitely not for gaming purposes."
4,It's a good device to work on...but at some point of time it's giving too much heatThe overall performance for the budget is good
5,Laptop is good. But the seller Appario Retailer sent an old laptop and hence returning it.
5,In this prize range it is best laptop. All features is good but in this laptop display is not anti glare which is disapointed me. Battery performance is good .processor is excellent.i think this is best laptop and y should go with.....
5,"Very good choice if you are open to Ryzen. Small, cute silver looks and light weight. Performance is as indicated in the configuration. No complaints till now, overall."
4,The laptop has many features and I laki the laptop it have backlit keyboard and dual ram channel but only one thing that they have mentioned antiglare screen but is is glossy other wise every thing is correct
3,Keyboard lights not working.
5,I am using it from 1 month. Everything is good only screen is not anti glare but it is not a big issue. But bluetooth and Wi-Fi is old version. It is little bit issue. And price is also adjustable.
5,This laptop come with very stylish look and light weight and come with backlit. Keyboard
5,Just go for it 🔥Under 50k ac to me this is the best option for all purpose !!
4,"Everything fine except I am not getting sharpness in videos. No matter how high resolution f playing video is, picture lacks crispness."
5,The display is not anti reflective but it is too good.Light weight.Speaker is awesome.Trackpad and keyboard is good.Cons:Only 512mb of vram and the bios is locked.It would have been a perfect machine if it had atleast 2gb Vram.
5,It is a great laptop. Performance is awesome. Battery life is good. Backlit keyboard is also very good. Thanks to the seller VTM _SLP also. The laptop got delivered to me in 2 days. Overall a great laptop for students. You can even do light gaming.
1,In product description it is mentioned anti-glare display. But the product screen is super reflective. Didnt expect this from amazon.
5,Best hp laptop under 51k. Just go ahead. I got damaged shipping box but the laptop was in good condition.
5,Delicate fully loaded machine. Handle with extra care. Excellent specifications for this price point. Not Anti Glare but the IPS panel does the job. Overall satisfied with this purchase. Thank you Amazon.
5,Excellent product..Superfast..Good for programmers too..For gaming I am not sure but otherwise best laptop in this price range..It's worth every penny..
1,1. windows not getting updated2. Screen display randomly switching on/off3. Needed to reinstall windows on day1 as the laptop lost its password file for no reason
3,The processor speed mentioned in amazon listing shows is 4.2 GHz whereas actual speed received is 2.4 GhxThat is why I have not given 5 stars. Pls someone explain me how this happened.
4,This was a great upgrade from my i3. I7 is a much better and faster processor. Laptop starts on a few seconds. 1 tb ssd snd 16 GB ram is a great combination.It looks beautiful and premium very thin and relatively lightweight.Good combination at this price
5,The best laptop I ever seen. Brightness is very greater than I expected. it gives battery life of 5 hours with is good. It is very very light weight. The best thing is in performance it give smooth experience while running heavy softwares also. At this price 79499 rs this is the best value for money laptop
5,"My first choice was to take Microsoft Surface. Instead, I have got the highest configured 14-inch laptop for the same price that Microsoft Surface Laptop doesn't. Comparatively, HP provides a high quality, light weighted laptop for a reasonable price. Worth grabbing it."
5,"Hello allFirstly I'll like to tell that this is one of best product from hp that's out there. I went with 2gb graphic card one. Activating office is little tricky, else everything works on getgoIf you don't want graphic card then you can go for ryzen 5 version which is around 20k cheaper than this one.Best laptop in 14 inch category, period!"
1,Battery Life is not up to the mark. Won't even last for 2 hours on normal browsing.
3,"This is the review after 2 days of useIt's lightweight and looks robust.Installed a few resource hungry softwares (DaVinci resolve) and no issues noticed till now.In day light, don't forget to switch-off the keypad back lights, else you won't recognize the keys! Also, after using touch screens for quite some time, working without touch support cause confusion at times.. but considering the price and other features, I guess it's fine.This will be good for programmers or mid kevel video editing works (if you got an additional monitor). The only problem I faced, tried connecting a 2nd led screen with HDMI and not detecting it as a second screen. Voice also not working while connected to second screen."
5,"Pros: Fast, Adequate battery, Display clarity, light weight ( Subjective to individuals), Sound is awesome, NVIDIA boosts it's capabilities.Cons: No Touch screen, SSD could have been been better with 1TB."
5,Best as i have expected.I only trust Hp for laptopsPros1. Light weight2. Amazing display3. Smooth experience4. Keyboard5. Easy to carry6. Superb performance for business purposes or designing purposeCons1. Battery not that much satisfactory2. Safe old charger3. Plastic body but still look metal finish4. If you don't have this laptop at this moment its your loss.5. MOST FRUSTRATING IS HEATING ISSUEI am satisfied with the quality and durability.
5,"This laptop is good for Programmers and it is running like mac pro, smooth multitasking and battery life is good.Not for people who don't like 14 inch screen."
4,"It’s light weight, i7 11th gen laptop. The battery life is good till now. The processor speed is 2.8Ghz.Below are few of my dislikes- It’s only 14 inch- There is no CD room- The graphics card is Intel Iris- The processor speed is 2.8Ghz not 4.7 mentioned."
5,"Very light weight, value for money."
5,"The laptop seems to be very good for a regular usage. The battery lasts long for a normal use and it charges quickly. The screen is wonderful and the keyboard is soothing. Overall, best laptop in this range."
5,"Battery life is about 2.5 to 4 hours of moderate use inluding web browsing, watching film, online class etc. With digital drawing tablet and wired mouse attached"
5,vert good product
5,"Love the look of this laptop. Very compact, lightweight with great processing power. Have faced a few issues with network connectivity but those seem to have resolved. A month of use so far and loving it."

5,Best quality low price goods products any hp  battery life I'd goods and long body is semi metals good product
4,"The only notebook brand in the market offering the latest specs for under 90k. I bought the Core i5 + 512 GB SSD model in April 2021 for about 61k from a recognised HP showroom instead of Amazon. After one and a half months of usage, I can say it's one of the good ones.Although the webcam this model has is the worst. It is not 720p HD, it's worse than a low-level VGA webcam. The video and photos are extremely grainy and tinted. I approached HP Care thinking there was an issue with this unit. Turns out it's a universal problem and they wouldn't change the unit because the hardware was fine.Sound is pretty good, finish looks premium metal, but is plastic... hopefully durable. It's on the quiet side with respect to fans, which only make noise if you're processing something heavy like updating the BIOS or converting a rather heavy raw video file to MP4. The chiclet keyboard is good, not too creaky and the backlight feature has a dimmer setting too.There's a handy-dandy fingerprint scanner, which is smooth and fast with tactile recognition. The display is reasonably good, but not so powerful outside. If you work outdoors a lot, you'd have to put it on full brightness. You probably won't get optimum results even then.A little disappointed in HP Care and the declining webcam quality. Given this day and age, there is a need for at least standard quality webcams. However, considering the price and the specs, the notebook is still worth it.Pros:- Latest Core i5 processor- 16 GB DDR4 Dual Channel RAM- Lightweight and smooth design- Reasonably good display- Backlit keyboard- Decent battery life ( I got 5-6 hours of heavy useon battery, but that might be different based on what applications you're using)- Good audio- Intel Iris Xe graphics are really good. You don't need an extra graphic card unless you're into hardcore video editing, 3D modelling or design orheavy gaming.- Expandable SSD storage- Fingerprint readerCons:- Terrible webcam quality- Plastic build- Screen hinges aren't the most flexible- Number of ports - 2 USB, 1 HDMI, 1 USB Type C, 1 MicroSD reader slot (as opposed to a full or mini SD slot, which makes it a bit difficult for DSLR users)- Only 512 GB of SSD storage- Colour - only Natural Silver, surface prone to scratches.Will update if I notice anything else. Hope this helps!"
1,"I have received a faulty product. From outside, it was perfect, no scratch, no damage. It switch ON well in first time.However, it stop responding the very second day.Have processed for return"
1,"Camera quality is very bed, battery life 1.30-2.00hrs only, manufacturing quality also poor.Don't buy it ."
5,Great laptop don't hesitate to buy you can confidently go with it don't think of brands this is a great option quality product with best price.
1,"I was looking for a cheap laptop for my 9 year old son. So, went for it.It worked well for a month. But then screen started flickering.After another 15 days, screen not working at all. Now where to find its service center? Even if the laptop gets serviced, who will take all those pain for going there and depositing the laptop?I fell for its cheap price,. I suggest you guys please don't fall for it. 🙁😒"
5,"Pros:received a damaged product initially and was replaced in two days hasslefree.display panel was broken.Laptop with i3 & SSD +1TB is actually good for the price.boots in lessthan 20 secs.working greatfull hd display is good.average sound qualitywindows10 activatedmsoffice trial versionCons:battery is not so good,can only hold between 3-3.5 hrs with minimal usage.build quality is average & delicate regarding quality of plastic,design is good.heating issue on usagea key is misbehaving as shown in video,@ is available in place of "" not at 2.so far so good...."
5,"I Purchased 15days back, excellent performance, Battery  backup is 2  hours only for heavy usage and 3-4 hrs for normal usage like videos n music.. Now price increased 5,500/- awesome product.. Quality for Display, music, speed is very good..Remarks: Charger heating too much within 15 Minutes."
5,This product is very nice and cheepestSo very very thankyu
5,Good product at this price dont hesitate to buy. I was not comfortable to buy. But it is totally satisfied. I have more than one month of usage. It is fast. Charging also fast. Battery give good backup. Laptops are made for emergency use without electricity. You don't expect full day works on battery. It give approximately 4to 5 hours. Which is best. My suggestion is go for it. Belive me.

5,"1. Display -102. Sound - 93. Trackpad - 84. Battery backup - 9 (initial impressions regarding battery is good)5. Looks - 106. Webcam - 7 ( awkward position )7. Build - 8 ( I don't feel it is that bad good quality plastic is used ( at least it feels so) need to check in the long run.8. Multitasking - 7 ( considering the price bracket it comes in it is justifiable.9. Heating issue - not faced till now but without fan it would be difficult to control the temperature.10. Value for money - 9Overall considering the price  of rs15000 and for my case it was rs 7200 (exchanged 10 yr old i3 processor laptop) this laptop does the light job like surfing net and making some ppts and watching video as the laptop has great screen - full hd with anti glare display is something that is unavailable in this price bracket before.Who should consider this laptop ?Anyone who has very light usage microsoft word, office , excel or those who wants a laptop for entertainment purpose, or for online classes, online test series, for attending meetings etcAnyone who wants to run any moderate to heavy apps should stay away from buying it."
4,"Recieved today.1. First impression is good.Does the job for the Price. Don't expect much from this by spending 13.5 k money.Expecting gaming and editing etc. from this low priced entry level machine is a foolish thing. Expect, upto what u spent on the product.(only disappointing factor who actually disappointed by their purchase)2. MS office is trail version only lasts for one week after setting it up.3. But, I don't know the reliability of this machine.4.I think it can be used for adequate period of time, if we handle it smoothly and carefully.5. Best under budget laptop with good built quality, sound and display6. A good replacement for tablet. Used for online classes for kids and documentation works and entertainment purposes...."
1,"On 6 day its display automatically got off. we request for replace the delevery boy came & didnt took our laptop. He told that its display is not working we cannot take , Display is not working thats why we are replacing, otherwise we would have use it .  So he told to apply for refund so we did it but same reason they were giving. We have request more than than 10 times for refund. The customer care guys says that it will be refund but noone comes to take it. Customer Care of AMAZON is up to the level of worst. Its been a month the laptop is with me with no working condition. DONT BUY THIS LAPTOP. FALTU PRODUCT"
5,"This laptop is designed for following basic task-1-Office work(MS word, excel, PowerPoint etc)2- Basic net surfing (Fb, Youtube, Online form filling etc)3-Watching movie4- Good batteryBelieve me this laptop handles all above mentioned tasks like a boss in a speedy way. All of this due to 128GB m.2 ssd installed in it.Pros-1- IPS Display 9/102- SSD 9/103- 4-5hr battery backup 7/104- Design 8/105- Build quality 7/10Cons-1- 3.5hr of Charging time2- Charger Quality3- Sometimes mouse trackpad & keys are a bit unresponsive.Verdict- This laptop @13.5-15k price is 100% value for money.Although this laptop equipped with celeron processor but believe me it does what it is meant for. You can't expect a scooter to carry the loads of a Truck. Same goes here. This laptop is made for basic tasks and it does flawlessly. Hence it is a perfect budget choice for students, online classes, office works etc.If you are in Gaming & video editing work..then please don't buy this laptop. This laptop is not made for such tasks.Thanks."

5,"So, I ordered this after reading the reviews of my predecessors. I can say I was not at all disappointed. I got this machine today and I am writing the review from this. Well, as I started to setup this up, I realized that it was too slow. I gave it the benefit of doubt and shut it down for later use. when I setup it up, the battery was around 70%. At the end of the setup it as 60. Fine, I give it an hour and resume exploring it. I set the mode to battery saver and cleansed all the unnecessary apps, and downloaded chrome and acrobat. I want to use this laptop for light browsing, creating word documents, reading pdfs and watching movies in spare time. Thus far, it has now disappointed. The display is amazing  and one can feel the SSD in action- crisp and sharp. I have used macbook air and this doesnt disappoint. Also, the design is very catchy, inspired from Macbook and Yoga 360. The price was also decent. Well, I started a 60% battery, remember- it is 34 now. The battery sis the only concern I see. but otherwise this is awesome. Zyada ungli mat karo- chup chap laptop kholo, normal use karo rakhdo. Zyada kalakari karne ki avashyakta nahi hai. If you expect that you can hack Iran's nuclear plant with this , then All the Best. Do not use it for heavy coding and games. Also the frame is decent ,not aluminum but plastic but I find it sturdy and ultra light. I will update this as I move with this machine."
1,I was charge battery 95% and within 10 munit my laptop was shutdown because of low battery I was charged it atleast 3 hoursThen after only 10 munit it work
4,"The product was super awsome but what I got was a defective one, which had a dead pixel on the same. As the replacement was not available what I got was refund. But Would reorder the same for sure. The issue was with the display that it had a dead pixel in the center of the screenHave used for a 2 hours only for diagnosing and all. But performed in its best way with all the specs it had such as the speed for instalation and the scrolls and all were super awsomeFor Dispaly its crystal clear that its a 14"" inch display powered by IPS and Full HD. I hope you can understand the depth of view it provides.Will Definitly recomened to anyone. Have reordered the same. Waiting for the product to receive."
5,great Laptop at this prce point..1) great display2)good processor not for gaming those who wants gaming not this laptop buy 30000 or highe price laptop but asphalt 8 runs smooth3)ram also ddr44)128gb ssd apps load fast and boot time 10 second5)so light waight ..battery backup 3 hours  on 100 percent charge..At this price point no other brand offer such a value for money laptop.........
4,"Review after using for 4 days.Pro's -1) Performance - It can easily handle basic tasks such as browsing, MS office, watching movies & online class.2) Storge - Even though we juz get 128gb ssd storage(out of which 94gb is available to use), we can expand Storage using memory card slot. One thing i liked in this laptop is we can easily insert memory card without card reader juz like we do in mobile phone. I brought 128gb sd card & inserted in it. I am storing all my files in the sd card. Don't store any files in system storge (128gb ssd slot). It will slowdown the Performance of system.3) Display & Sound - Top class 👍4) 🔋- OkayishCons -1) Charger pin is very loose. I m worried about its durability2) Hinge - I am really worried about hinge. It's very loose. Hope it won't fall down. Avita should focus on this4) Keyboard & mouse pad are hard.3) Build quality - Actually i don't say this as con for the price i paid(13600rs). I am satisfied with plastic built quality for this price. We need to be careful & make sure that laptop won't fall down from height.Finally if you are looking for basic laptop for online classes, Watching movies, MS office, browsing & if you can handle laptop carefully. Then go for it."
4,"Game changer is 128GB SSD, boots windows in 15-20 seconds.Browsing websites, watching videos, working on online worksheets is faster.Even 10 different browsing windows works fine. More than that slows down the Laptop.Not much heating initially but after 2-3 hours of continuous usage bottom gets heated.Very thin and lightweight and medium sturdy, so not for heavy rough and tough usage.Keyboard is good. Touchpad position is awkward and size big, so people with bigger palms will accidently touch mouse touchpad when typing.Overall after a month of usage, found not much issues for general usage of browsing/meetings/videos watching. Not tried any games and any external apps as Windows is in S mode. But with browser all apps usable, like spreadsheet, document editing, youtube, etc."
2,"Recent review- (earlier review can be found after recent)Since past couple or weeks I had observed mouse touch-pad issue. The movement of mouse is not as expected, it’s slow. I made all possible changes in settings but no use.It’s a bugger when I use MSPaint tool. While working in mspaint the mouse pointer suddenly jumps anywhere on the screen.(Attached video)I had registered complaint to Avita customer care about this and they attended in 2 days and the technician replaced entire touch pad along with keyboard. But still the problem was not resolved.I have again registered the complaint and will see what they do about it.Will keep you updated.....——————————-Below was the review I posted in first 4 days-——————————-A suggestion to laptop buyers is that before purchasing it, know what your own requirement is.I purchased this laptop for my son’s school activities like Online classes, video conferencing etc.Basic activities like MS Teams, MS Office, Browsing etc. can be done without any problems.As it comes with Windows 10 in S Mode, you have an option to disable it but I preferred not to, because its Secured mode and it helps to keep laptop safe from any Malware and saving you additional Antivirus cost.This laptop gives me battery backup of AT LEAST 4hrs with uninterrupted online class.Standby time would be definitely beyond that.Build quality is good according to its price. It costed me around 17k. I searched Amazon, Flipkart for budget laptops and this was the only one that deemed fit in my requirements.SSD really makes difference than conventional HDD. Its super fast, loads windows in seconds(depending on config).All ports are working fine. Please Note- This laptop DOES NOT have a Lan Port as it supports Bluetooth and Wifi only. As most of us are working on Wifi only, Lan port should not be an issue.Overall- I am satisfied with the laptop. I may change my review after couple of month’s usage if I see any difference in performance."
3,Build is OK for better other other avita model I m not expecting this goodEverything 5in display very goodKeyboard connectivity battery back up also goodBut I return this laptop due to speakers not working and also no fan in this model temperature always 60 to 75 degreeNot good for game not even high quality video playback.

5,Very good laptop for 15000 I bought it for 5700 under exchange.For browsing and simple official work only and email check best laptop the screen resolution 1240x1920 good one for you tube and movies
1,Only for very basic purpose of 90's. Dont expect much from laptop but laptop expects user to have lots of patience even for basic operation.

1,"I didn't checked before buying that it comes with window s mode, s mode is not allowing any other web browser to install. but there is option which showing purchase other browser.Laptop is very slow, wrost working experience. although i purchased it only for internet surfing but it is useless for me because its not allowing other web browser than microsoft edge.Also in it having window 10, three days i have used, window 10 is auto consuming my internet in internal updates, and 2 gb internet consumed in less than 10 minutes, what a rubbing product how i can use internet in this system.I try to uninstall window 10 and install 8.1 or lower version but it not allowing to install other windows version too.finally when i use microsoft edge browser with broadband so that i have unlimited internet, but when you open multi tab it always goes slow or hang or other pages stop working . what a rubbish product it is. my fault is i didn't used it within 7 days of purchase, i thought  it is looking good from body, it should be good, but believe me it is horrible, I wish to give it 0 star. now i want to return it to seller, i am not getting how to do.complete money waste!!!!"
5,"i just gotta fan of the display. Display is just awesome. Looking is too good , light wieght.Not for high processes. Very good for productive use. Like browsing , entertainment and basic applications will run smooth. SSD inbuilt, too responsible. More than i expected.Only thing is speakers are too bad, and little build quality is compromised. Rest, Worth more than money."
1,"Bought it for online classes and the worst thing is the camera is not working. Tried contacting the customer care through mail,phone, WhatsApp, Facebook and LinkedIn but no response whatsoever. Tried troubleshooting myself and found that there's no driver for the camera and the worst of them all is you can't even find the camera driver in their webpage itself. PATHETIC BRAND.. PATHETIC SERIVR.. PLS DON'T BUY THIS EVER..!!"
5,"1-Excellent display and viewing angle, less bezels, can play 4k videos on YouTube without lag2-Sound quality is decent3-Battery backup Normal 3 hrs plus4-Built quality is also good as per the price5-Software performance is more than enough with ssd faster boot6-Very light product 👌Overall very good product at this price range, i got it in 13.5k, less than an average mobile price."
5,"I was very apprehensive of buying this computer but I did not have the budget to go for i3 or i5 so I bought this. Oh man ! this is one heck of a laptop. You will be delighted to lay your hands on this laptop. The screen is top quality, similar in quality to that found on many top-end models.  It is not shiney but matte which you can use for long periods of time without problem. The keyboard is decent and comfortable. The touchpad may have been better, it does not have the finesse of higher end models. The body is made of plastic but looks stunningly good. Hope it does not start showing signs of wear for some time.  The size of the laptop is just perfect, light-weight and very comfortable to work on. Speakers are ok, acceptable at this price point, sound is loud enough. It has a front camera which is Ok in quality but it is placed in a very odd position (near the screen and keyboard joint) which makes it not suitable for most face to face chats.The speed of the laptop is very good. It boots in 10 s and shuts down in the same time. All applications such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Office run smoothly. It does not show any lag even when I open a lot of programs together. Battery life is decent, about 3-4 hours on a single charge.All ports are located on the back side, not on the sides as in other laptops but this is not much of inconvenience and I am hardly inconvenienced because of this.The nest this about this laptop is the top quality screen. The worst thing is the placement of camera and probably a little less than perfect track pad (but not too bad)."
5,"Since I have ps4 console, I bought this laptop only for office work, browsing and watching online stream videos.. If u need for basic use, go for it. This is not a gaming laptop.. I had Asus laptop previously and it sucks in performance and cost around 25k however i bought this laptop as exchange for 9k and the speed is awesome. Battery backup comes around 3hrs 30min if we watch videos. Normal use comes around 5hrs. Its very slim one weighing around 1.3kg only. Easy to carry not like my old asus(heavy one) and my office dell laptop(weighing around 2kg) Overall a good budget laptop Worth 9k for basic level. I will again update you guys after three month use."
1,"If you ever plan on using Microsoft Excel, stay away from this laptop and brand. Doesn't have the ability to lock Fn (function) key nor is there any option to do so in the BIOS.The manufacturer is helpless in software support and customer support only says sorry, they can't do anything about it.It's a pain since the keyboard isn't even good quality and it's a pain to press Fn key each time you need to press F2. Horrible product and I'd not recommend this brand to any Excel user, AutoCAD user or any person who needs to using Function keys regularly."
5,"Below are my verdicts compared to the price I bought it (₹17,150)# Well built, nice looking, slim and light weight# Windows 10 built in, though in S mode, but S mode can be disabled with latest Windows updates# Decent performance for few light weight multi tasking, such as web surfing, playing songs via media player, documents editing, connecting to remote desktops. Dont expect any gaming performance from this humble device.# Keypad is nice, no backlit though# 2 USB ports, 1 HDMI# Screen display is really nice, nice resolution# Battery back up is fine. Depending on usage. I am getting in between 5 hours to 7 hours for very light weight use with battery saving mode enabled.# Camera quality is not upto the mark, could have been better# Mouse trackpad is nice, wide, intuitive# 4 Gig RAM serves the purpose# 120 GB SSD delivers good performance# Bottleneck is created by 2 vCPU Intel Celeron processors. But overall manages to deliver basic performance, CPU clocks upto 2.5 GHz when demand is High. L1 and L2 cache are on lower side, no L3 cache.# Speaker is loud enough, lacks the fineness / Quality, but does the job, you can watch YouTube, Movies, listen to songs..Overall, a nice well built laptop at this price with decent performance for basic activities, don't load it up with too many apps running in parallel, it will serve you well.Also, wait for offer price. It is a value for money product when bought at price around 17K, Not at its normal price which 19K"
1,"Bad choice, screen is not effective, hangs , machinery and system over all is ineffective, keys don't press properlyI am bound to keep this since Amazon refused to take return or do replacement, all that money on this laptop is a waste now as this laptop is a show pieceNot at all recommendedThis feedback is a comparative feedback from other machines I have"
5,"I didn't expect such a fabulous product for such a low price. Its a fully functional laptop with all basic features, looks elegant & Cute. faster booting time, nice keys, super display. Speakers are bit inferior, but still good for the value. The batter charge stands well and charging is fairly quick. This is the first day impression. Well and safely packed. Didi the online registration for the warranty using the serial no on the back of the laptop."
5,"Decent as it is mentioned, not meant for gaming at all, suitable for office work and media consumption.. Had to use external mouse since mouse touch pad is very irritating.. In conclusion it's an extremely basic laptop."
3,"Its an good looking laptop , which does its job.Initially when i got the package had its warranty seal open and the trackpad stopped working another day got replacement other day and that unit also had issue ( top hinch plastic was coming out while opening the lid) so i decided to put a drop of quick fix . Than another day the windows suddenly showed blue screen and had to fix the same with BIOS boot order change. I cancelled the return of the unit as its working fine now after windows reset .This laptop is good but i have serious doubts that if the quality checks are done or not after manufacturing ."
4,"Battery backup is really osm and display is fabulous...iam facing heating issue during YouTube at 4kAnd build quality is not superb ,only okay productThe main quality of the laptop is storageVery suitable for lite document works and watching photos and mvies"
4,This laptop is budget kingKeep in mind this laptop is not made for gaming so 😕 no gamingKing for daily work and online class 💪Don't use it hardly because material is no do goodBattery backup is too goodScreen quality is high and FHD so no issues thereKeyboard is also good 👌Compact size  😉Thanks for reading my review 😊Go for it
1,Bingo!!!! The product is awful as battery gets drain quickly and Kudos to Amazon and Seller for brining pocket friendly product at this tight budget situations.
4,Bought for my wife to work on google sheet. Simply awesome to work on small software.Please do not expect wonders out of it.Display is absolutely stunning. Full hd . Anti glare. soothing to eye.Good quality plastic.I was sceptical with celeron as long bak i had experience with old celeron version which was damn slow. But good improvement in this one . No lag watsoever.Keypad is crisp and gives nice feedback.Booting takes 10 to 13 secs.Recommended.
5,"Writing this review after 10 days of delivery of the laptop- Yes it is the best cheapest laptop- I did buy the laptop @17K- No heating issue till now(as laptop is new)- Battery works for straight 5 hours(pretty good till now)- speakers are loud and awesome- SSD is a great add on to speed as the laptop contain ceremon processor.- Screen quality and camera quality is too good.About S mode- I removed the S mode on the very first day as I need to install local softwares- I did install billing software(GST) which works smoothly- I did install printer drivers, zoom meeting software.- Till now laptops is very fast and smooth (Don't install heavy softwares)"
2,"Light weight, stylish laptop good for basic office or house use, my daughter is happy to do her online classes and basic of coding. But one major issue is even though on the selling page it's written windows 365. And the buyer will assume that it's already installed like any other laptop, but this doesn't come with windows. And then one has to pay additional 5k per year. In that case it's total price will come closer to other branded laptop. One more thing which put me down is about there call center. If you have any issues or enquiries try to call God to help because the chances of getting a reply from God is more likely than Avita call center."
5,"Cute and LovelyI bought this mainly for its SSD hard discHighest resolution which you can't get from anyother laptop of this price and this screen sizeIt's a great idea that they've provided all the USB port, charge port, audio port behind the laptop.Works excellently with my favorite ubuntu OS( I removed windows)I don't use laptops for gaming"
5,"At this price the product is a bargain. I bought it for my wife for simple office work in Word Excel, surfing net, viewing videos et al. Booting is fast and screen quality is good. It came with a jacket and a hard paper board cover for safe keeping after work. She has been using the product for over a month without any issue.  She didn't go for game or anything that require using camera."
1,"Within 4 days of use, the right hand side of the screen turned blank, see attached photo. This is a sub standard product that is being attempted to be sold on Amazon and will tarnish your reputation. I need this to be returned and my payment refunded."
5,"I was sceptical about the celeron processor but was pleasantly surprised to see the clock speed it can maintain (around 2.6 GHz) without a fan!SSD makes the performance even better, arguably the best in the price segment.Added plus is windows 10 home bundled! Display brightness is average but quality is good and bezels are thin. Webcam position is awkward and makes you look like you're rolling your eyes as you look at the screen during a video call.Build quality is questionable, but there are bound to be tradeoffs."
5,"Perfect for everyday tasks ( considering the price point)Display 10/10Processing 8/10Keyboard 9/10Wireless connectivity 10/10Multitasking 7/10Webcam 7/10Boot 8/10Speaker 8/10Warranty 10/10But I have received this product today , This is my first impression.I can say that it is an upgraded version of Avita essential.( Processor, Bluetooth, Operating system)"
5,"Every thing looks good like fast, clarity and brightness . power back up. Only one problem is camera is in  bottom and small kids  like below 7th if they are using for online class they have to sit very near to laptop ... Or their face video will not visible."
3,neither good nor bad . average
4,"Pros : great display, best to use for daily purpose.Cons : 4 GB Ram not extendable.."
5,The best budget laptop in the market
4,good laptop for normal user
4,"Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).Clarifications/issue points:1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium.2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.Pros:1. Configuration is best at this price level.2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.6. Display is average and gets the job done.7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.I’ll update this review after one month of usage."
1,"Different charger was sent in the box by Amazon and they were not ready to provide a replacement as I had open the laptop box.Later after several calls and struggle I was able to get the replacement and now, camera is not working for the laptop.Laptop's over-all performance is nice. Buy it from a HP showroom directly instead buying it from Amazon."
5,"Amazing laptop.. I ordered this laptop on its released date i.e. 24th feb seeing it's wonderful configuration.. I must say the decision was right..Thank u HP for this superfast laptop. And after so much of research, I think in HP this is the only laptop with high configuration (11th gen, 16gb ram, 512 SSD, 14 inch screen, light weight, finger sensor & Alexa inbuilt) under this budget."
4,"As soon as I found 11gen Gen i5 at ~62K I got stuck at it & after reading some initial reviews placed an order. Got it at promised time. Here's my review after 3 days.Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance. 1.4 Kg is not too light & noticeable. People complaining about placement of Power Key button beside delete button but believe me it'll hardly ever come your way. The plastic feels like metal. The screen doesn't lift keyboard. Typing is a pleasure.Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Finger print unlock is superfast. Apps opens in no time. Gestures works perfectly. All thanks to 11th Gen i5, 16GB Ram & 512 NvMe SSD.Features: Comes with ""Office Home & Student 2019"" (didn't checked is it lifelong). Dropbox 25GB for 1 year also available. Comes with some HP apps & Express VPN as well. HP quick drop helps you transfer files from your phone easily. It has Type C charging point but not sure if it is delivery charging or receiving charging point. Keyboard is backlit with two setting (full & med bright).Display: Didn't checked in daylight but at home it is very bright. Watching videos in FHD IPS display is a pleasure.Camera is 720p Camera is OK. Pictures & Videos are grainy. I won't be using it much so I'm fine with that.Speakers is unbelievably very loud & clear. At 67 its was reaching all across my apartment. Speakers are on the two sides below keyboard.Only drawback I noticed was charging pin is too tight to push & pull out.I will be posting more updates on performance, battery etc & also my overall experience as I keep using more & more.Update after 2 weeks:After lot of research & by doing practical I found that this Laptop can be charged by a Type-C charger. Believe me this is an exclusive piece of information, not many people knows this. HP call center didn't knew this, HP Showroom people don't know this, even when I asked question here someone provided wrong answer. This is an important information they should have mentioned in product detail that this Laptop supports Type C charging. I'm using HP original 65 W Type C power adapter to charge it. Attaching a photo. I did some research myself & found its USB Type C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. After reading this I ordered the Type C power adapter & it worked."
5,"I bought this a few days ago, and I am glad I decided to make this purchase. This laptop is probably the only laptop in its segment that boasts such a spec heavy configuration without breaking the bank. The HP pavilion is such a compelling buy and boy does it deliver a premium experience throughout.Having used a Pavilion 15 before, I gravitated towards the Pavilion series predominantly because of the typing experience and the speakers tuned by Bang and Olufsen! They sound mighty impressive for the price! It’s the same experience this time around. The audio is loud and crisp, and typing experience with 2 stage backlit chiclet keys is fantastic! They key travel and feedback is great. This probably is nitpicking, but the only gripe I have is the Power key is placed next to the Delete key. Although, accidentally pressing the power key won't turn off the device or put it to sleep. The 250 Nits IPS panel is crisp and bright for day to day indoor use. The viewing angles are great too with HDR playback support. Although, I would have loved atleast 300 nits plus panel given the price of the device. The chassis seems rigid and built to last! The top cover and the keyboard deck is metal, stays cool to touch as compared to the bottom cover which is plastic. The trackpad is quite large and supports windows gestures. The fingerprint reader is fast and accurate. The laptop remained silent during my entire sessions of document editing and reviewing. However, the fan kicked in during a windows update, and it was loud. The 43Wh cell helps this laptop with a good battery life. The 65-watt barrel pin charger helps in charging the device quickly, and the device can also be charged via PD enabled chargers via the Type-C port. One nifty addition is the HP Quickdrop. It lets users to transfer files back and forth with a companion mobile app. It’s a great addition for me as I can edit photos on Lightroom and quickly share them to my phone to be shared on social media! The i5 11 gen is a beast of a processor and it barely breaks a sweat during photo editing sessions. It can do some light title gaming with the Intel Iris Xe graphics.Some closing thoughts:The HP Pavilion with 16Gb RAM and 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 can be ideal machine for folks wanting a portable yet powerful machine without a hefty sticker price. It is like using a trimmed down version of HP ENVY without compromising on processing power. It has been a fantastic purchase so far!"
1,"Don't buy this lap  ... Don't be fool .I spent around 70,000 for the lap, when I open laptop it's screen off and on happening automatically.You can see the video above attached.I request to replacement for the laptop, but not yet got any update.. already completed 15 days."
1,It's too strange to see a brand new HP  pavilion laptop got hung in the very second use. None of the keys working....can't even shut down......totally helpless....disappointment at its peak .....The packaging too was no way near the required....Frustration....disappointment....too bad experience.....
5,Nice product. USB type C can be used for charging but didn't work with 30W Oneplus 7T charger. May be work with 65 watt smartphone charger. Backlight Keyboard has only 2 dimming light settings. Apart from these everything is excellent.
4,Laptop is good and Fast but the GHZ mentioned is not correct they say 4.2 ghz but what we receive is only 2.4 Ghz. I cannot put my earphone in this laptop since it is liitle bit small. earphone from jbl and working fine in mobile. overall laptop is good in this price range
5,11 Gen Laptop with 16GB RAM is a dream combination as of now. Good deal
1,"As soon as the warranty period got over, laptop got defected .I complaind to hp care then it came to notice that amazone has not mentioned s.no in the bill for rectification of this error amazone took approx 18 days to correct the bill and for replacement of defective item Amazon is still making fool that your case is under escalation team and continuously giving new target date but not  giving resolution. I am totally feeling mentally harrashed"
2,"Claiming 4.2 GHz processor, but Delivered item with 2.4 GHz."
4,"I was searching for a laptop from Feb and bought this in Mar and am the first one to buy this from Amazon. The laptop has value for money, fast, long battery life etc. Sometimes it hangs for no reason. I believe it could be hardware issue and not related to Windows. When the laptop is kept on on a bed, the battery area heats up very quickly and hangs. There were no multiple drives. It would have been better if there were two drives ; one for OS and other for storing personal data.One interesting factor I observed with Amazon is the moment I bought on march1, there was one review appeared with all 5 star though I have not rated the product. Amazon is giving fake ratings to many products like this. Unless there is a photo of video of the product I would recommend the users not to believe the review.Pros:Fast bootupMore RAMSSDLong battery lifeFast fingerprint readingLight weightCons:Hangs sometimes for no reasonLess volumeKey board layout is not user friendlyNo RJ45Only one drive"
1,"The battery is gone in a month's time it was delivered on 5-Apr-201, hardware diagnosis says battery needs to be replaced. Have already faced issues where the keys just froze and had to contact support team."
5,"Awesome features in this laptopScreen is delight, back lit keyboard is awesome, finger print recognition is really good. I cannot imagine I could get all these features at this price. Super fast drive, free office what else you need.... 16 gb ramBeen using this for more than 2 weeks.. I am really really happy. On top of it awesome customer care service on what's app"
4,"I just see one month trial version of microsoft 365, it doesn't show me option to setup ms office. can some one help me on this?"
2,"If you are a College student or a professional who depends heavily on laptop for pretty much everyday then  this laptop is not for you. It hangs more often than it runs. Cannot install essential computer science software such as Eclipse or android studio because then this laptop just dies.I took this laptop thinking that it will have good performance based on its configuration.But if you are someone who wants to attend online classes or just browse, then you may go for this laptop."
4,Quality of the laptop seems to be more premium and the lightweight of the laptop fits to our hand. I am not a gamer for normal usage it seems best in class. HP had worked very well in this series with good quality speakers and keyboards are nice power. On and off in lightening speed with the ssd  but the only disadvantage is the internal webcam which makes me very disappointed . its just a hd camera. For this price range HP should work on the camera section. overall nice product.
4,"This laptop from HP has an excellent hardware configuration. A brand new laptop was delivered to me within 1 day of placing the order. The set-up was pretty fast. You can configure the Office 365 1-month trial version (comes with the laptop) or install your own MS-Office copy. Does not come with a carry-bag or any other accessory. Start-up is extremely smooth and fast with Windows Hello Fingerprint Scan and no problems encountered in the last more than 15 days of daily usage. The fingerprint scanner can however only be used for Windows Hello, it cannot be used for entering your password on websites using HP Security Manager App (as confirmed by HP Support Specialist). Other than this, no problems with the hardware configuration."
5,"This is an excellent product. Appearance looks great. Start and shutdown in a blink due to NVMe SSD. All the configurations including RAM, processor, ports are well tested and optimized. Very light waight and portable for frequent travellers."
5,"Like:Booting time is very less.Light weightSuper fastFinger touch unlock is super fastDislike:180 hinges are missingOpening lid is not designed properly, bit difficult to open the lid"
3,"Pros:It is light weight, good graphics and configuration.Cons:But not worth of the cost. The touch pad is pathetic and very unconfortable to use.Battery life ok not great. Camera quality not good.Over all this was my first HP buy!. Earlier I had Dell laptop and comparatuvely HP has very delicate and no fun Hardware. I regreting the deciaion to opt HP!!"
5,"An Amazing product from HP. Laptop was delivered today as promised by Amazon.A 16GB RAM, Intel i5-11th Gen processor, with 512 GB SSD with IRIS integrated graphics , FHD display, backlit keyboard...what else we need in a laptop which costs less than 65k cost?Looks premium.I searched all the ecommerce portals and even visited the stores, couldn't find a 16GB RAM laptop with in 65k budget.5stars for HP pavilion 14 laptop and 5 stars for Amazon :)"
4,This is my first laptop and i love it !... It turn on within in fraction of seconds..Pros :1) 16 gigs of RAM & i 5 11 gen processor gives the butter smooth experience.2) Excellent battery lifeCons:Touch pad should be more precise
4,"Very good laptop, very light weight so can easily care and operate with single hand.Battery life is okay as of now.Brightness is also okay not so bright.Sound disappointed as it’s not that great it’s hardly manageable at this price point.Overall good laptop.And yes, type-c port supports charging also so this is something cool 😊"
5,"So far, so good.Things that could've improved:Screen quality and brightnessCameraKeyboard tactile feedbackFingerprint reader"
4,Writing review after a week of using my beautiful slim light weight laptop.No need to describe much as I found no cons in this laptop functioning nice no issues till now price might be a bit high but overall I found very nice and handy laptop for all students and study purpose and using software applications running smooth.
4,"I am using it for two months, mainly for work from home and for browsing purpose.  I have viewed movies also. finger reader is very fast.  battery normal.  4-5 hours capacity. sound is loud though I prefer bluetooth speaker for watching movies on laptop.  Overall it fulfills my expectations."
5,"Before ordering the Laptop, I prayed to god to send me the perfect laptop without needing to contact the seller or the HP. and Yes, my prayed were answered. The Laptop works as expected - audio, camera, speed (as it has 16 GB RAM). Thanks HP and Amazon."
1,"First, Notebook is Over HeatingSecond,  Notebook is not openingI am fully unsatisfied"
5,"As of now, it's working fast and fingerprint scanner is also quick."
3,The system heats up a lot during normal usage or even when kept idle. Rest all seems ok as of now. Boots fast and good at multitask. Expected a privacy shutter for web cam at this price. Privacy concerned people pls buy one from amazon.
5,Very good product in this price range . Smooth and light weight. Easy to carry. If any one has the budget he should buy it .
5,"Amazing product, it's slim and build quality is also good!! Just has little heating issues usual than normalOverall loved itSound quality and heating is a draw back"
3,The only thing that i dont like is the heating it produces under the laptop and sometimes it gets heated from top as well i.e area around keyboard.Other then this i like this laptop. Battery life is around 4-5 hrs minimum  if you are continuously working. Design is lit. Its thin and looks cool!
5,"Product is real good in terms of processing speed. Also,  I would say it's light weight and sleek. Flawless fingerprint scanner."
4,Awesome laptop along with perfect configuration at this price. However due to its metallic build there might be chances of heating at the right side bottom part so better use laptop stand to stave off heating. Rest all good so go and grab if interested
5,"All good for the budget. The laptop built material is not that good. The upper body is shaking when you work in front cooler, of course not a major issue but shows the quality of material. Laptop is super fast but at times it hangs for a second, say one in 25 times. Absolute peach for students."
5,Performance is really fastBattery lasts 6 to 7 hoursDisplay quality excellentI just loved backlit keyboardLight weightPremium lookBlindly go for it
4,Perfect Pack.  Go for it.-Charging through type-c only when powered off.-currently B&O doesn't support headphone
1,"The laptop is extremely slow even for very basic tasks like browsing the internet. It take 5 minutes for Google Chrome to open and each time you open a new tab, the whole screen freezes for a few minutes"
1,"Worst laptop ,worst battery  backup ,too slow , worst camara and hang sometimesAs per my point of view it worst so look other laptop . Worst package . Its not full HD only HD worst display don't buy my suggestion"
5,"Product : Laptop having Intel Core i3-1005G1 10th Gen with 4GB RAM and 256GB SSD DriveIt's a good buy for normal office work for instance multitasking with accounting software along with 3-4 excel spreadsheet, 3-4 pdfs, email in outlook logged-in, and couple of web browsing tab open. For students mostly it will be the same scenario plus HD videos and not too heavy / minor graphic games,It's best to perform Initial set-up / boot-up fresh from out-of-box offline (as almost all windows version/ edition has telemetry which is data & system resource hungry) and disable all privacy options, remove / uninstall the bloatware (one may use cc-cleaner if find it difficult to remove), disable background apps other than security software, also disable unnecessary ASUS services (here again one may use cc-cleaner). With such initial setting, and when connected to internet, system resource utilization out burst to the peek and later-on works absolutely fine having RAM utilization stands at 25-35 %, Disk Read activity is also low.Few things could have been better placed1. Power Button is adjacent to Delete button, and if pressed accidently turn-off the laptop (sleep mode). Although it can be fixed in power option by selecting ""Do Nothing"". It should have been placed somewhere else2. Would have been best if comes with RJ-45 port i.e. ethernet port3. Keyboard could have backlight4. VGA Camera is actually neither here nor there, but HD camera should have been better"
1,"Laptop speed is very slow, hanging issue."
4,"The machine is well built, has a premium look and feel. I went for the 256 gb SSD version with i3. Its lightning fast, boots instantly. There is no lag or waiting period. It has 4 gb RAM which is more than sufficient. This has made me very convinced that the real difference between speed of machines comes from HDD Versus SSD, not processors or RAM. I have struggled recently with HP laptop having i3 processor and 4 gb ram, BUT HDD. It took more than 10 minutes to boot! This ASUS laptop is real value for money. Its slightly heavy, but then look at the price point! I would say, for most people its perfect."
3,I zeroed in on this product after extensive research. I needed a fast laptop with decent specifications and good sound & camera for the purpose of my son attending his online classes. I expected a quality product in the price range it commanded but it's not so. What I got is an average product with bad sound and camera. Speed is Ok only with fiber connection but buffering & freezing while using Broadband (which is not so even in our old generation desktop). Will have to buy external speakers and webcam.
1,There is no NVEDIA Graphics Card
1,It very bad product. It does not work properly. It takes too much time to get start and shut down. Apps not works. It takes 10-30 mints to start any app or system. I felt myself cheated with this product. I called the customer care but they did not give any solution for return or refund. I want to return product. But amazon does take any action. All depends on the technician they said.
5,"Pros:Nice laptop with SSD(236 GB is usable included with OS ), it has fast finger print sensor, and light weight model, superb screen quality(HD), Activated win 10 OS (Digital license) with MS office 19(have to activate),SSD is 10 X faster than HDD. Shutdown speed is less than 5 seconds....good sound quality. Fast charging...  HDD cabin accessory has given in future we can add HDD manually. MAC AFEE Antivirus free for one-year.Cons:Very worst camera less than 1mb, or VGA cameraMade up with plastic ...Charger is OK..."
1,"A i3 core processor,  is so slow cannot do anything. I am so sad to have purchased this idiotic Asus.  My other HP laptops which are old but much better.  Worst purchase, no back-lit keypad.  Never knew this."
3,"The laptop is sleek, with decent screen quality. The only thing is that the laptop is really slow, not good for gaming. It takes really long to start. It is decent for light usage and as a secondary laptop"
5,Asus is offering a good deal for low budget customers also. I like the product . I would like to ask amazon to offer more flexible emi duration because I would have bought 45000 rs worth laptop if the emi duration was 9 months from bajaj emi. Because of shortage of my income I only could buy this laptop.
1,As soon as u unplug power cable its freezing. Won’t work on battery. Worked fine for few weeks. Don’t go with this just by looking at its configuration. Also warranty is not that easy to claim.
4,"The laptop is slow..upgrade it to 120 gb ssd and reinstall windows in the ssd, u wll feel massive upgrade in performance."
2,At this we expect better camera so that meeting can be attended flawlessly.Day 1 review- banki sab to ok ok haiLekin....kya bakwas camera diye ho be Pura paisa Mera mitti main milaye diyoWill share review again after a week

5,Good product with best service by Amazon.
1,Very slow and poor quality  No service assistance in configuration of the laptop
3,"Using it for two weeks for personal use, with no gaming. MS Office only for 1 month. Good to use but do not expect more with the configuration, feel a bit expensive after use."
1,"Very poor performance and very slow one , pathetic purchase"
5,"This is a very fast laptop overall all laptops. Its fingerprint senser is too fast but one day my keyboard and trackpad not works. But now, my pc is too good now."
5,Good look & nice due to SSD
1,The worst product I have ever bought. Its very slow even while browsing. Takes 3. 4 min to load chrome and sometime it get hang at the very early stage.
1,My wife is a teacher and she use this laptop for only online classes for her students and this is the 9th day and the battery doesn't even last for an hour... Pathetic battery..
4,The laptop obtained to me was not a working one.  When I inform the seller they replaced it with a new one within 4 days.  I appreciate them for the speedy action.
4,Pretty good... .if u r a coder the go for i5That will be better and sufficientI3 will struggle at times
5,Screen quality is excellent anti glare..But no backlit keyboard..
2,Very very slow..
1,It's cheap product i  purchased by yesterday and it's not working properly facing too much latancy and running too slow
3,Very slow processor. Figure sensor not work properly.
4,The extended warranty of ASUS is pretty bad as we need to pay in USD. NO ONE RESPONDS FOR THE MAILS SENT TO ASUS
1,Don't buy this product.issue with screen and look like second hand product
5,I like this product and also used asus laptop previously .. overall this is the best one..
2,"Not recommended, very lazy laptop"
4,Starting the laptop take too much of time
5,Good product
5,Quality is good.
4,Very good performance but ssd is to low
3,"The package i has received was well protected and no damage occured. After I uncovering the package and started the laptop, it was so slow compared to my old vaio (sony i7). I was disappointed when it started to process slowly. But after signing and using it, there was no problem and it was running smoothly till now. (No backlighting, no bag, no headphones and mouse) only a laptop, a charger and a manual paper."
1,Laptop getting hang very much and very much slow start.This is happening within 2 days of purchase
3,It looks the screen size is small . Its not look 15.6 inch. Can some one help me
3,"How to install a new SSD? The SSD does not show up on the boot menu. It shows ""Toshiba"" as the first boot device even after physically removing the preinstalled Toshiba hard disk and connecting a new SSD."
1,"HiThis is a true feedback, requesting you to now buy this laptop from here, I ordered this product and on the very next day it is getting hanged,  unable to run the apps properly. Very slow processer. Worst quality. And the worst part is customer services are not even helping they are just asking to contact hp and hp is asking to contact Amazon. I asked to return but nothing has happened. Please please do not buy this product."
5,Hp laptop with intel less than 40k.At starting too much slow.After update working fine.Hints:No keyboard backlit.No NumLock indicator.Screen is good.
4,"I'm satisfied with the product but it's little slow while booting up. Really,  useful to attend College and School Online classes for  my children. It's storage space is good enough."
5,A really good laptop for online classes as well as for gaming.Worth money. Screen length and height is perfect! Just one problem that it doesn't have port for wired earphones. It has Bluetooth ones.
5,Runs smoothly after OS update....very light weight and compact...hp assistant very useful and simple........
4,Value for money laptop from an branded manufacturer.
4,"I got this laptop on 10th of May(reviewing after 25 days).At this price range, this laptop is best as you are getting 11th gen, very good display, good speakers sound, expandable ram, nvem ssd slot.___If you want to buy this laptop for App development or heavy programming then I would suggest you to buy ssd(replace the hdd with ssd or there is another slot for nvem ssd) and upgrade RAM(upto 16gb).There is one 1TB HDD you get but you can also add Nvem Ssd which is amazing. Also the ram is expandable upto 16GB.If you add ssd and upgrade RAM then this laptop is a beast, trust me. I got this laptop @28k after exchanging my old laptop.If you don't do coding or heavy tasking then I would still say atleast add ssd because boot time and performance is average which may annoy you so  it's better to add ssd.Also this laptop is not very heavy gaming like Pubg PC, Apex Legends etc. You may play light game like pub mobile, cod mobile.Cons:1. The Quality of the body is not that good.2. Battery backup is not good."
5,"Although it is too early to provide a feedback with only two days of use however I am providing this feedback because the experience is too good till now. Few additional features can add more user friendly experience like it doesn't contains keyboard background light. Also, the first time when you open the laptop, it started taking update from Microsoft. So connect with a good LAN or Wi-Fi and be patient to install the update."
3,Suggesting to go for SSD instead of hdr as it tooks a solid 40 seconds for booting which is very annoying.
5,"Good laptop under budget with all specifiction required.Little slow while starting, rest behaving good while working.Plastic quality of laptop disappointed this could be better."
2,"Lookwise & bodywise ok. But it is too slow and hangs a lot, dont buy it..."
4,Good product .Have decent speed for daily use .The keypad buttons are big enough and feels good .The storage space is more than sufficient .The genuine windows 10 and ms office package come with it .It's light weight and easy to carry.However on flop side the key board is made of plastic whivh could have been better.do not come with licensed anti virus device.The ram speed could have been better and the I3 processor could have been upgraded. Over all it'd decent product for its purchase cost.
4,"Product is good . But the processor use little bit lagging. When I power on, after that it will take a time to open a app.Also I don't like the cover skin.*Products is light weighted* display is awesome cool.*Charging time is less*Sound quality is good"
2,After two month of use I am writing this review.please dont Buy is laptop as it is very very slow. It takes too much time to start also. As I am not using any antivirus software than also speed is very poor.
5,"Was worried about speed issues that many had complained in the reviews. But still went ahead with the purchase. After powering on there is quite a few updates that will happen. At that time i found it to be slow(background downloads and installations will happen) Go to updates and ensure that there are no pending updates. Once all the updates are applied, the laptop is perfectly fine. My kid is using for schools and other assignment. If you are using a browser + MS office applications +zoom(or other vide chat apps), there is absolutely no problem with this laptop. it is absolutely fine. Not sure about gaming though"
4,Go for it when you are looking for a HP laptop having reasonable configuration.
5,Always before HP always keep its standard.Its very nice to use and light weight.HD screen is too good and sound clarity also very nice.Delivery from Amazon prime also very speed.I got the product on the 3rd day from I ordered.Thanks for Amazon and HP
2,"Don't waste your hard earned money in this waste product. Not worth buying. For the first time i am writing review. Takes too long to start, has a plastic body which makes it look so cheap."
4,I likeProcessor speed display all connectivity fast charging battery backup upto 5 hours lightweight slim design overall good packageDislikePlastic type body design matte finish colour feel like low quality material and last the power button not feeling so good
2,"I had bought on 7th May and within a month product...performance is very slow and it's asking system updating in weak, while I using last weak it was suddenly blank the screen for 20 minutes and Fan sound is coming very bad just like hard disk will be blast, I had contact with hp support and they solved the issue if I get again I will send it back for replaceI think this product weight is more than 2kg"
5,"After ordering hp laptop, Amazon will take only one day to fulfill my order. It is a genuine product, three days gone, till I am satisfied."
3,"Construction quality is not good... Intial start take linger after that ok. Hinges are not smooth and rigid, battery life is not impressive. For students ok.. Or first laptop users not find differences."
4,This is a Good for students. Entire laptop good. battery backup 3 to 4 hours that is only negative. Remaining good
1,Vary vary poor quality....plz gyus don't buy this laptop 🙄🙄
1,Laptop was defective always
1,The display was defective. Also the fonts/resolution is bad. Amazon is however not allowing to return the product. They say only replacement is allowed. Not worth buying such high expensive products from Amazon. Expected the product to be returned and get a refund considering the product to be expensive. Disappointed.
5,"Looking for a good performance laptop at this range , go for it. Got this at very good exchange discount too. The whole process of delivery and exchange was very smooth"
4,"Overall a very good package. Battery life couldhave been improved. It sometimes gets unresponsive for a second or so, but that's about it. But 1TB storage (although non SSD), FHD Display, 11th Gen i3 processor and 15.6 in display at this price point (for me it was 38k) is an amzing deal"
2,The biggest problem is that the processor is very slow. Even if you are working on just basic MS office apps the laptop is slow and takes ages. Suggest to go for i5. Can I change the laptop?
1,"Highly disappointed with the laptop. Battrey life is very low. Even after full change it's not being able to make it for 3 hours, with average use.  I want to return the material but there is no option."
4,"Good laptop, speed is nice but could have been even better as compared to price. Camera is fine for online classes, supports virtual background too. Looks bit delicate as it has plastic body.Overall good performance as of now. I am reviewing after a use of 5 days."
3,Not good. Even with 8gb ram it's too slow.worst experience stopped working within 45days.
2,"Cheap plastic; doesnt feel like 11th gen i3 processor; my old dual core pc with 4gb ram is faster than this; screen and battery is good; didnt have much expectation from it as it is budget laptop, still it doesnot meet it."
4,Over all it is a good laptop. I bought it for my daughter's online class. I think price should be within 34K. Another issue I am facing is slow booting. A new laptop shouldn't be so slow that too with almost empty hard disk.
4,Niceproduct
3,"The laptop is average buy, hangs a little and average looking, not backlit which was mentioned on the description. I bought it because I was in urgent need of laptop and shops are not opened in my locality due to covid curfew else I would prefer buying it from shop."
3,"PROS1. Its touch screen2. it doesn't have any fans, so doesn't make a sound.3. model is very stylish4. best for studentsCONS1. it's not 360 convertible2. it doesn't have a screensaver option3. it has a storage space of 49 gb instead of 64 gb, but works fine.4. connectivity to bluetooth is slow5. camera quality is really bad6. doesn't support all android apps7. keys are dysfunctional but you can work around it."
3,"Pros1. Boots within 5 seconds (I bet u might have never seen anything like this before)2. “Ok Google” assistant like Siri3. Easy access like an android mobile phone4. Don’t be fooled this is not a tab, can access all android apps. Some inbuilt paid apps available for free.5. Gives Macbook like feel, fast charging and superb battery.6. Best for business travelers, presentation speakers, online teaching, learning, browsing.Cons1. Less storage capacity (usable is around 45GB only) but online cloud storage is available2. Meant only for document typing and browsing purpose, nothing much you can expect other watching movies.3. Its all Google and Google only.4. Beginners will find it a bit difficult to use this. Needs a bit of practice.5. No LAN port available. Only wifi."
1,"Screen is not upto the mark at this price point! Bad viewing angles, can see only yellowish tinge from any other angle other than the front!"
5,The product was delivered earlier than expected and in good condition the touch screen feature is hard to find in laptops are this price but seriously in love with the smooth texture and display quality. Not meant for gaming but otherwise it's very good
4,"The device is great when it comes to built quality, performance, trackpad, etc. I specially love speakers and mainly the keyboard which has good travel and it's just a joy to type on. I also like the Chrome OS which is better than Windows when you are going for budget laptops as they work faster.But the real problem is the display, it's 720p which is good for the price, but it has colour shifting problem like an TN display. The white balance is out of this world and there is no option to change it on the chromebook. So you need to live with it. There are even times I need to bend and watch as I can't even see anything while siting in the normal position. This isn't just my device fault, this model's display is designed like that. So I am really really warning you to check the reviews on the web before buying, mainly about the display."
5,"It has been a week since this laptop was delivered to me and it has been performing well. However, if you are planning to use this laptop as your primary one I'd suggest to go for a windows laptop. Chromebooks are designed only for basic tasks and this is true for this chromebook too. Don't expect great performance while editing or gaming. If you are a person who's daily work involves only light browsing, video conferences and streaming videos, this laptop is just perfect for you.P.s. The touchscreen works nicely too."
5,"14a model chromebook is Touch screen and user friendly, no lagging observed. Supports all android apps. Camera is very good, have been using it for school zoom sessions.Cons:Keyboard is not backlit18gb occupied out of 64gb memory. So one need to use the memory card for extending to 256gb."
5,"This Chromebook is perfect if you are looking for normal browsing,streaming. OS is very simple and very quick. Does the job very well. Touch screen is added advantage. Cloud storage is unlimited. so no issues."
4,The laptop arrived in a good condition and it was packed well. But it didn't have any receipt or warranty card inside even though a one year warranty is mentioned on Amazon. Please get back to me.
1,"1. Build quality is bad in general, plasticky. There are MIL tested variants out there for same price. Screen is wobbly and the machine is not built for a drop.2. Speakers begin to screech at high volumes.3. Other NA series models had back-lit keyboards. I bought this without verifying. My bad. But for a non-back lit keyboard, the design is bad and the letters are not visible. Im going to need to find stickers.4. Track pad works great.5. Screen is mediocre.6. Battery lasts all day as the processor has low power consumption. Overall performance is as predicted."
3,Device is good looking and decent.The keyboard is plastic and flimsy and letters are not visible.Screen flickering on video calls or youtube and distortedNot all android apps are supported which is supported in android phone.
1,"Do not fall into the trap of buying this product, this is HP’s conspiracy to dump an inferior product in the name of a chromebook. Ideally windows laptop are supposed to be expensive because of the payout for the OS & hence Chromebooks are supposed to be cheaper. In spite of this arrangement this laptop feels cheaper than a 25k windows laptop with probably a bigger screen. My mistake of trusting a brand like HP blindfoldedly. Not to mention the pain of dealing with a defective product on top of it."
5,"I wasn't planning to write a review but when I saw multiple hate reviews, I just had to do itThe battery life is better than any windows laptop you'll come across. I saw many windows fangirls crying about how you can't install windows here. the thing is, you don't need windows, It's a bloated mess until they actually fix it.This OS is the best for laptops in this price range because it runs flawlessly on relatively inferior hardware.Another this I read was 'It can't run zoom'. It can, they just have no idea how to, you can just install it from chrome web store.I received a defected laptop with a dot on the screen initially but they readily replaced it and now I'm having a good time with chrome OS.If this product lies within your budget, don't listen to anyone else JUST BUT IT!!One might say that we can't game on it, which is true. but in this day and age, you can just buy a subscription of Google Stadia and play triple A titles with better quality than the laptops which cost 70k+"
1,The product is of very cheap quality and it does not support the commonly used Zoom app which is very much required in today’s Pandey situation.Poor
1,Display is not working during whatsapp video call.Display is blur and fedded during video calling.
2,"Pros-1.Fast and light2.Touchscreen is good3.Battery lasts long(10+ hours)and charging from 0 to 100 takes only a hour and few mins.4.Sound quality is good. Cons-1. Less storage2. Camera quality is extremely bad.3. Not all apps from play store is supported.4. Texts and display quality is poor and it's glitch a bit except from chrome browser. (Not suitable for reading :( )5. No backlit keyboard6. Chrome browser runs automatically when start.6. Screen brightness is always default (need to change it lower everytime when start) 😬😪7. Chrome browser setting like (on start up, continue where you left off)is not available. Need to minimize chrome browser again and again. :(8. Display turn off automatically after 15 mins and it can't be changed.:("
5,I am writing this review after using 1week.Nice product my daughter loved it and very easy to use for kidsAdvantages1 slim and thin2 less wait and easy to carry3 os is fast4 download all android apps which supports to chrome os5 Battery backup superDisadvantagesLess storageCannot add widgetsLess usb ports
3,"The Legendary chrome book,  that performs like a 2gb ram, (it's 4gb ram model ), I had to return the first one and since there's no option for refund,  had it replaced by another one,  thanks anyways,  second one same model is working fine but not the 4gb models performance,  updated it to latest version of chrome,  using it as daily driver,  since it's upgrade of my 2gb Acer chrome book which is still doing good,  this one's not up to the mark,  sorry Hp, I wasted 25k on this honestly,  buyers looking for Hp chrome book, Avoid all together!!"
4,"overall the product is good ..thickness is very good......light weight ...and touch screen good....pubg gaming and cod gaming is not that good unless u add some graphic card or etc......the only problem is the display , but for this price range it is the best laptop for a collage students .........basic gaming is very good no lags ....and another problem is miscroft apps are paid apps , u need to buy them to use them......portable laptop......"
5,"Its a mind blowing purchase , At the very little cost you are getting a great quality product performance is mind blowing looks are mind blowing and if we compare it with the MacBook air it is giving a tough competition to it and chrome OS is mind blowing no lags know and complexity it is very easy to use and you have to think beyond Windows because windows constantly having problem like viruses lags crashing and all less battery back up but it has a battery backup of 12 hours, Believe in my words you would never regret if you have basic expectation With a mobile phone or laptop this is a wonderful device I recommend all an Amazon is wonderful and very helpful"
1,Laptop is good with touch screen. But it is chrome os and can't install windows os so I wasted money buying this. They are not taking returning this product also 😔😔
5,"Good for students and employees who need laptop for office use like excel, ppt, etc. Not at all recommend for one  who are expertise especially in graphic design, animation, high end games etcc.ProExcellent touchscreenLight weightAttractiveFast100 gb Google cloud for 1 year.Mobile Google to laptop Google synchronisationDis advEMC hardisk that only 64 gbNot for high end users,.Not all android app are working in laptop"
3,"Firstly Product description is misleading . It only has an eMMC  but title says SSDDevice is light weight & fine for light productivity use , school work etc . But struggles with heavy mid- heavy workloads . CPU is the limiting factor understandably .OS  is snappy & frequently updated 👍🏼. Screen is average ,not that good  for movies & photo viewing  . Lacks contrast & colour depth .  Wifi stability could be better .Make sure you check the warranty details for computer purchases .I got a device with warranty start date 10 days before purchase . Both Amazon customer care & HP were hesitant to change it to actual delivered date . EXPECTED AMAZON CC TO PITCH IN PROACTIVELY,  INSTEAD OF AN ""IT CAN'T BE DONE"" KIND OF RESPONSE ."
5,"Overall good product to buy at this price range. Very much happy and easy to carry. It is good those who looking for normal usage of browsing, YouTube videos, small games with battery 🔋 backup of more than 12 hours if it is charged full battery.Pros:1. Good design and light weight. Easy to carry.2. Booting Speed less than 5 seconds.3. YouTube ads are default blocked by chrome OS and more convenient to watch YouTube videos like Premium without any charges per month.4. Very Good Battery 🔋 backup more than 12 hours.5. Browsing and touch screen is nice.6. Fast charging support.7. Price is less 25k budget Chromebook Laptop.Cons:1. Finding difficulty to type and save word document (Ex.,) Resume typing, etc., able to do only using online Google Docs and finds difficulty in Text alignment and copy to local harddrive, but feels not much convenient like Windows OS.2. If I connect my Samsung Galaxy A70 with Type C port, files are showing very slow, and not able to copy to harddrive. Instead of copy via Type C cable, I have copied via ""InShare Android App -> Web Sharing when connected to same WiFi"".3. Bluetooth Connection is failed frequently when we disconnected, we may needs to Reboot Chromebook again for restore connection, feeling very bad for this issue. Since, I am always use Bluetooth Speaker 🔊 for audio / playback.4. Not all Android apps are supported like mobile phones.5. Only low memory games supported otherwise, you will endup with Screen hanged up while loading the game."
5,Best laptop under this price range .
5,This laptop is a perfect chromebook.1. Its battery life is amazing2. Cheap affordable touch screen laptop3. Can easily replace your windows laptop4. Runs almost same like your android phone5. More user-friendly than a windows laptop
5,"The product is excellent for office use. 7 hours battery life with light music in the background while working on docs. The battery life is a huge win.Keyboard is excellent! I do a lot of drafting and found the keyboard accurate and comfortable. The touchscreen is a huge plus, I've stopped carrying/using a mouse with me.You can install linux based apps on the chromebook as well. Thereby, the overall value for money is just top notch."
5,"All is going well except  the google office software. Without registering any office software, it is difficult to work in excel, word documents. The manufacturer should note this and bring a free office software having all the features like windows version for the users.The bootup time is extremely fast. All the features of Android now are in laptop form."
1,"No. Don't waste money by taking this labtop, unless it will allow Windows operating system to install. It's just large version of mobile with bigger screen. There is no difference between this labtop & mobile. Unfortunately, I have wasted money by taking this labtop. Even company not provide microsoft office for free."
5,"This chromebook is awesome.Pros: 1. It is lightweight and super fast (boots up and shuts down within 5 seconds)2. Battery lasts for 12- 15 hours for continuous tasks, it takes about 2 hours to charge fully.3. Screen sensitivity is up to mark.(Touchscreen sensitivity)4.Does all the basic job . I would recommend this to those buyers who want a laptop for daily light to medium based work like streaming, browsing, online classes ,watching movies ,listening to music,  a little editing and programming. At this price range you will not get such laptop with such a high quality.5. No lag at all. For buyers this is based on chrome os and not windows, so first time chrome os users may find it a bit difficult to use.6. Better than any windows operated laptop (within 30-35k)Cons: 1. The webcam quality is not so good but does the job.2. It is strictly not for gaming purpose or heavy editing or programming like java or C++.3. It does not run all the applications available on playstore.4. Storage capacity is low (49 gb only) , so I would suggest you to buy an external micro sd card for increasing storage capacity. So , this chromebook is basically made for students. Students can definitely but it without any hesitation(better than any other laptop within 30-35k). But for gamers and heavy editors , I would suggest you not to buy it. Thank you."
5,"Sleek and light. Works better than any other Windows laptop in this price segment since Chrome OS is very much optimised. Browsing, surfing and streaming are fun on the go. Definitely, this one is not an option for seekers of intense computing but would be best for your daily work such as attending meetings and online classes (got a great camera quality). It supports most of the Android apps making it easy to get through things. The Intel Celeron N4020 & 4 gigs of RAM does it all. As far as memory is concerned. 64 GBs of SSD space is provided as well as 100 GBs of cloud storage for all which I find a little less. However, it's expandable to 256 GBs through micro SD cards.Overall, it's a great deal!"
2,"Purchased this nearly three months ago, as a replacement for another HP Chromebook (which had it's own set of issues, but that's a whole other story).For starters, the screen is terrible. Speakers are tinny, and on the quiet side, never mind the B & o branding.The track-pad on my unit has developed an issue where it gets stuck, when pressed.Would not recommend."
5,Best product for that cost . Not at all lagging camera is a bit low quality but that's okay. And starts really fast and everything is excellent .
5,Chromebook is better than windows my children loved it but they should give laptop bag also overall very nice
4,"Pros - Good touch screen, kids can use it comfortably, light weight, not much learning curve for kids from Android, good sound, good mic quality.Cons - No HDMI if you want to use external monitor, only USB-C. No caps lock.Improvement - Mic on off button like audio on off would have been good for kids use.if you look for a kids online class no doubt can go ahead."
1,They are asking for than what this chromebook deserve it should be dil around ₹ 24k  because in USA its price was $ 279 which is around ₹ 22k. So dear seller please reduce price to atleast ₹ 25k. Who ever buying this for ₹28.9k or near is total stupid. Take my advice buy it for 24k its a good product but not worth paying 29k. Thanks!
5,"Wrong commitment not able to redeem 100 gb drive,showing wrong codeBag not available with chromebook"
1,"I regret buying this, can't install important windows based applications and chrome OS is just useless."
1,Cheating. There is no hard disc. I had to put hard disc that cost me Rs 5000 extra. Even the software is not at all user friendly. Had to replace the software. Request Amazon to remove this from their site so that no one else is cheated. Disgusting. Am a regular Amazon user. First time such cheating & fraud happened to me. Also overpriced as per information.
4,Its been 2days since the purchase. It has Super clarity vedios but audio is not upto the mark (unless you are using headset)It hanged a little bit in the 2nd day itself (maybe because i was using it for long hours) otherwise its a best choice for study purpose & light use.
5,Really good product for office purpose use & home purpose both. good video quality. light weight & slim laptop. good battery with use of office work. worth to buy 30k.
2,As per details Student MS Office is free. But it is not
4,"Recieved on7.6.21(today14th).Working well so far from 1 week. Got hung up a few times(so had to restart).

5,Really worth buying and good for daily use.Not recommended for gamers.Very handy and light weighted 😍
3,"This laptop is good and fast. The only problem in this is it suddenly stops in the mid and does not responds,gives this error.I suggest if you're buying this pls perform high processes on this and check for this error or check if it is getting stuck suddenly. Use teams or use many tabs in edge...."
5,"Perfect laptop for office use, smoothly working, ssd make it more fast to start and shut down. A"
4,It's ok. Its took few minutes for initialization. My package was opened below when I recieved. And was taped again. I asked why it is open. During travel it happened they said. But the inner one pack seal was intact. No problem.
5,Value for moneyDelivery in one dayRunning very smoothGreat packingEasy setup ..completed in 15 minMore than enough for startup business
5,"I bought this laptop with 8gb of ram and 256GB SSD, and intel core i3 11th gen with integrated graphics.This laptop is super fast as their is a SSD, you can add a HDD if you run out of storage.This laptop is good for taking online classes and web surfing. This laptop is not for coding and programming.The only thing that I did not like is 14' inch, which cannot be used for all the works. For example, for bussiness work you need to have a bigger display.The laptop heats up enormously, I am suprised for the hesting issues, though it has a intel i3 11th gen.I will update my review after 6 months, after a close monitoring.Thank you."
4,"I have received my product today, product seems to be fine so far, only issue is it’s showing 11 months warranty , where it should be 12 months."
5,Compact and powerful laptop
5,The product was  in near New condition. Was surprised to see that the laptop was performing  as expected a day battery life was 4+ hours which is excellent for a renewed laptop.
3,"PROS1. Its touch screen2. it doesn't have any fans, so doesn't make a sound.3. model is very stylish4. best for studentsCONS1. it's not 360 convertible2. it doesn't have a screensaver option3. it has a storage space of 49 gb instead of 64 gb, but works fine.4. connectivity to bluetooth is slow5. camera quality is really bad6. doesn't support all android apps7. keys are dysfunctional but you can work around it."
3,"Pros1. Boots within 5 seconds (I bet u might have never seen anything like this before)2. “Ok Google” assistant like Siri3. Easy access like an android mobile phone4. Don’t be fooled this is not a tab, can access all android apps. Some inbuilt paid apps available for free.5. Gives Macbook like feel, fast charging and superb battery.6. Best for business travelers, presentation speakers, online teaching, learning, browsing.Cons1. Less storage capacity (usable is around 45GB only) but online cloud storage is available2. Meant only for document typing and browsing purpose, nothing much you can expect other watching movies.3. Its all Google and Google only.4. Beginners will find it a bit difficult to use this. Needs a bit of practice.5. No LAN port available. Only wifi."
1,"Screen is not upto the mark at this price point! Bad viewing angles, can see only yellowish tinge from any other angle other than the front!"
5,The product was delivered earlier than expected and in good condition the touch screen feature is hard to find in laptops are this price but seriously in love with the smooth texture and display quality. Not meant for gaming but otherwise it's very good
4,"The device is great when it comes to built quality, performance, trackpad, etc. I specially love speakers and mainly the keyboard which has good travel and it's just a joy to type on. I also like the Chrome OS which is better than Windows when you are going for budget laptops as they work faster.But the real problem is the display, it's 720p which is good for the price, but it has colour shifting problem like an TN display. The white balance is out of this world and there is no option to change it on the chromebook. So you need to live with it. There are even times I need to bend and watch as I can't even see anything while siting in the normal position. This isn't just my device fault, this model's display is designed like that. So I am really really warning you to check the reviews on the web before buying, mainly about the display."
5,"It has been a week since this laptop was delivered to me and it has been performing well. However, if you are planning to use this laptop as your primary one I'd suggest to go for a windows laptop. Chromebooks are designed only for basic tasks and this is true for this chromebook too. Don't expect great performance while editing or gaming. If you are a person who's daily work involves only light browsing, video conferences and streaming videos, this laptop is just perfect for you.P.s. The touchscreen works nicely too."
5,"14a model chromebook is Touch screen and user friendly, no lagging observed. Supports all android apps. Camera is very good, have been using it for school zoom sessions.Cons:Keyboard is not backlit18gb occupied out of 64gb memory. So one need to use the memory card for extending to 256gb."
5,"This Chromebook is perfect if you are looking for normal browsing,streaming. OS is very simple and very quick. Does the job very well. Touch screen is added advantage. Cloud storage is unlimited. so no issues."
4,The laptop arrived in a good condition and it was packed well. But it didn't have any receipt or warranty card inside even though a one year warranty is mentioned on Amazon. Please get back to me.
1,"1. Build quality is bad in general, plasticky. There are MIL tested variants out there for same price. Screen is wobbly and the machine is not built for a drop.2. Speakers begin to screech at high volumes.3. Other NA series models had back-lit keyboards. I bought this without verifying. My bad. But for a non-back lit keyboard, the design is bad and the letters are not visible. Im going to need to find stickers.4. Track pad works great.5. Screen is mediocre.6. Battery lasts all day as the processor has low power consumption. Overall performance is as predicted."
3,Device is good looking and decent.The keyboard is plastic and flimsy and letters are not visible.Screen flickering on video calls or youtube and distortedNot all android apps are supported which is supported in android phone.
1,"Do not fall into the trap of buying this product, this is HP’s conspiracy to dump an inferior product in the name of a chromebook. Ideally windows laptop are supposed to be expensive because of the payout for the OS & hence Chromebooks are supposed to be cheaper. In spite of this arrangement this laptop feels cheaper than a 25k windows laptop with probably a bigger screen. My mistake of trusting a brand like HP blindfoldedly. Not to mention the pain of dealing with a defective product on top of it."
5,"I wasn't planning to write a review but when I saw multiple hate reviews, I just had to do itThe battery life is better than any windows laptop you'll come across. I saw many windows fangirls crying about how you can't install windows here. the thing is, you don't need windows, It's a bloated mess until they actually fix it.This OS is the best for laptops in this price range because it runs flawlessly on relatively inferior hardware.Another this I read was 'It can't run zoom'. It can, they just have no idea how to, you can just install it from chrome web store.I received a defected laptop with a dot on the screen initially but they readily replaced it and now I'm having a good time with chrome OS.If this product lies within your budget, don't listen to anyone else JUST BUT IT!!One might say that we can't game on it, which is true. but in this day and age, you can just buy a subscription of Google Stadia and play triple A titles with better quality than the laptops which cost 70k+"
1,The product is of very cheap quality and it does not support the commonly used Zoom app which is very much required in today’s Pandey situation.Poor
1,Display is not working during whatsapp video call.Display is blur and fedded during video calling.
2,"Pros-1.Fast and light2.Touchscreen is good3.Battery lasts long(10+ hours)and charging from 0 to 100 takes only a hour and few mins.4.Sound quality is good. Cons-1. Less storage2. Camera quality is extremely bad.3. Not all apps from play store is supported.4. Texts and display quality is poor and it's glitch a bit except from chrome browser. (Not suitable for reading :( )5. No backlit keyboard6. Chrome browser runs automatically when start.6. Screen brightness is always default (need to change it lower everytime when start) 😬😪7. Chrome browser setting like (on start up, continue where you left off)is not available. Need to minimize chrome browser again and again. :(8. Display turn off automatically after 15 mins and it can't be changed.:("
5,I am writing this review after using 1week.Nice product my daughter loved it and very easy to use for kidsAdvantages1 slim and thin2 less wait and easy to carry3 os is fast4 download all android apps which supports to chrome os5 Battery backup superDisadvantagesLess storageCannot add widgetsLess usb ports
3,"The Legendary chrome book,  that performs like a 2gb ram, (it's 4gb ram model ), I had to return the first one and since there's no option for refund,  had it replaced by another one,  thanks anyways,  second one same model is working fine but not the 4gb models performance,  updated it to latest version of chrome,  using it as daily driver,  since it's upgrade of my 2gb Acer chrome book which is still doing good,  this one's not up to the mark,  sorry Hp, I wasted 25k on this honestly,  buyers looking for Hp chrome book, Avoid all together!!"
4,"overall the product is good ..thickness is very good......light weight ...and touch screen good....pubg gaming and cod gaming is not that good unless u add some graphic card or etc......the only problem is the display , but for this price range it is the best laptop for a collage students .........basic gaming is very good no lags ....and another problem is miscroft apps are paid apps , u need to buy them to use them......portable laptop......"
5,"Its a mind blowing purchase , At the very little cost you are getting a great quality product performance is mind blowing looks are mind blowing and if we compare it with the MacBook air it is giving a tough competition to it and chrome OS is mind blowing no lags know and complexity it is very easy to use and you have to think beyond Windows because windows constantly having problem like viruses lags crashing and all less battery back up but it has a battery backup of 12 hours, Believe in my words you would never regret if you have basic expectation With a mobile phone or laptop this is a wonderful device I recommend all an Amazon is wonderful and very helpful"
1,Laptop is good with touch screen. But it is chrome os and can't install windows os so I wasted money buying this. They are not taking returning this product also 😔😔
5,"Good for students and employees who need laptop for office use like excel, ppt, etc. Not at all recommend for one  who are expertise especially in graphic design, animation, high end games etcc.ProExcellent touchscreenLight weightAttractiveFast100 gb Google cloud for 1 year.Mobile Google to laptop Google synchronisationDis advEMC hardisk that only 64 gbNot for high end users,.Not all android app are working in laptop"
3,"Firstly Product description is misleading . It only has an eMMC  but title says SSDDevice is light weight & fine for light productivity use , school work etc . But struggles with heavy mid- heavy workloads . CPU is the limiting factor understandably .OS  is snappy & frequently updated 👍🏼. Screen is average ,not that good  for movies & photo viewing  . Lacks contrast & colour depth .  Wifi stability could be better .Make sure you check the warranty details for computer purchases .I got a device with warranty start date 10 days before purchase . Both Amazon customer care & HP were hesitant to change it to actual delivered date . EXPECTED AMAZON CC TO PITCH IN PROACTIVELY,  INSTEAD OF AN ""IT CAN'T BE DONE"" KIND OF RESPONSE ."
5,"Overall good product to buy at this price range. Very much happy and easy to carry. It is good those who looking for normal usage of browsing, YouTube videos, small games with battery 🔋 backup of more than 12 hours if it is charged full battery.Pros:1. Good design and light weight. Easy to carry.2. Booting Speed less than 5 seconds.3. YouTube ads are default blocked by chrome OS and more convenient to watch YouTube videos like Premium without any charges per month.4. Very Good Battery 🔋 backup more than 12 hours.5. Browsing and touch screen is nice.6. Fast charging support.7. Price is less 25k budget Chromebook Laptop.Cons:1. Finding difficulty to type and save word document (Ex.,) Resume typing, etc., able to do only using online Google Docs and finds difficulty in Text alignment and copy to local harddrive, but feels not much convenient like Windows OS.2. If I connect my Samsung Galaxy A70 with Type C port, files are showing very slow, and not able to copy to harddrive. Instead of copy via Type C cable, I have copied via ""InShare Android App -> Web Sharing when connected to same WiFi"".3. Bluetooth Connection is failed frequently when we disconnected, we may needs to Reboot Chromebook again for restore connection, feeling very bad for this issue. Since, I am always use Bluetooth Speaker 🔊 for audio / playback.4. Not all Android apps are supported like mobile phones.5. Only low memory games supported otherwise, you will endup with Screen hanged up while loading the game."
5,Best laptop under this price range .
5,This laptop is a perfect chromebook.1. Its battery life is amazing2. Cheap affordable touch screen laptop3. Can easily replace your windows laptop4. Runs almost same like your android phone5. More user-friendly than a windows laptop
5,"The product is excellent for office use. 7 hours battery life with light music in the background while working on docs. The battery life is a huge win.Keyboard is excellent! I do a lot of drafting and found the keyboard accurate and comfortable. The touchscreen is a huge plus, I've stopped carrying/using a mouse with me.You can install linux based apps on the chromebook as well. Thereby, the overall value for money is just top notch."
5,"All is going well except  the google office software. Without registering any office software, it is difficult to work in excel, word documents. The manufacturer should note this and bring a free office software having all the features like windows version for the users.The bootup time is extremely fast. All the features of Android now are in laptop form."
1,"No. Don't waste money by taking this labtop, unless it will allow Windows operating system to install. It's just large version of mobile with bigger screen. There is no difference between this labtop & mobile. Unfortunately, I have wasted money by taking this labtop. Even company not provide microsoft office for free."
5,"This chromebook is awesome.Pros: 1. It is lightweight and super fast (boots up and shuts down within 5 seconds)2. Battery lasts for 12- 15 hours for continuous tasks, it takes about 2 hours to charge fully.3. Screen sensitivity is up to mark.(Touchscreen sensitivity)4.Does all the basic job . I would recommend this to those buyers who want a laptop for daily light to medium based work like streaming, browsing, online classes ,watching movies ,listening to music,  a little editing and programming. At this price range you will not get such laptop with such a high quality.5. No lag at all. For buyers this is based on chrome os and not windows, so first time chrome os users may find it a bit difficult to use.6. Better than any windows operated laptop (within 30-35k)Cons: 1. The webcam quality is not so good but does the job.2. It is strictly not for gaming purpose or heavy editing or programming like java or C++.3. It does not run all the applications available on playstore.4. Storage capacity is low (49 gb only) , so I would suggest you to buy an external micro sd card for increasing storage capacity. So , this chromebook is basically made for students. Students can definitely but it without any hesitation(better than any other laptop within 30-35k). But for gamers and heavy editors , I would suggest you not to buy it. Thank you."
5,"Sleek and light. Works better than any other Windows laptop in this price segment since Chrome OS is very much optimised. Browsing, surfing and streaming are fun on the go. Definitely, this one is not an option for seekers of intense computing but would be best for your daily work such as attending meetings and online classes (got a great camera quality). It supports most of the Android apps making it easy to get through things. The Intel Celeron N4020 & 4 gigs of RAM does it all. As far as memory is concerned. 64 GBs of SSD space is provided as well as 100 GBs of cloud storage for all which I find a little less. However, it's expandable to 256 GBs through micro SD cards.Overall, it's a great deal!"
2,"Purchased this nearly three months ago, as a replacement for another HP Chromebook (which had it's own set of issues, but that's a whole other story).For starters, the screen is terrible. Speakers are tinny, and on the quiet side, never mind the B & o branding.The track-pad on my unit has developed an issue where it gets stuck, when pressed.Would not recommend."
5,Best product for that cost . Not at all lagging camera is a bit low quality but that's okay. And starts really fast and everything is excellent .
5,Chromebook is better than windows my children loved it but they should give laptop bag also overall very nice
4,"Pros - Good touch screen, kids can use it comfortably, light weight, not much learning curve for kids from Android, good sound, good mic quality.Cons - No HDMI if you want to use external monitor, only USB-C. No caps lock.Improvement - Mic on off button like audio on off would have been good for kids use.if you look for a kids online class no doubt can go ahead."
1,They are asking for than what this chromebook deserve it should be dil around ₹ 24k  because in USA its price was $ 279 which is around ₹ 22k. So dear seller please reduce price to atleast ₹ 25k. Who ever buying this for ₹28.9k or near is total stupid. Take my advice buy it for 24k its a good product but not worth paying 29k. Thanks!
5,"Wrong commitment not able to redeem 100 gb drive,showing wrong codeBag not available with chromebook"
1,"I regret buying this, can't install important windows based applications and chrome OS is just useless."
1,Cheating. There is no hard disc. I had to put hard disc that cost me Rs 5000 extra. Even the software is not at all user friendly. Had to replace the software. Request Amazon to remove this from their site so that no one else is cheated. Disgusting. Am a regular Amazon user. First time such cheating & fraud happened to me. Also overpriced as per information.
4,Its been 2days since the purchase. It has Super clarity vedios but audio is not upto the mark (unless you are using headset)It hanged a little bit in the 2nd day itself (maybe because i was using it for long hours) otherwise its a best choice for study purpose & light use.
5,"Tge speed it rocket, good item in given price, you will have to install window, the drives wont show, it has to be done by texh, overall great product"
1,touch sensor will not work till you add windows or we can't add windows every time it seems there is no patition folder for. Ssd is not working so I have returned this.
5,This is a great laptop at this price. Would highly recommend it.Athlon CPU is based on the Ryzen Architecture and is much faster than the Intel counterparts.RAM 4GB is soldered on-board. You can easily upgrade upto 20GB total. Would highly recommend upgrading to 8GB or 12GB.M.2 Slot is also present. Will highly recommend to add a 256GB NVME SSD.Laptop does not come with OS. This is a great laptop for those who want to run Linux. AMDGPU Open Source drivers work out of the box in most distros.
1,Very slow pc os not there again we need to purchase separately  its expansiveB r r t y y
5,"Brilliant productMost of the configurations available in this price range (less than 40k) were either 4 GB RAM or 1 TB HDDMy base requirement was 8 GB RAM as Win 10 just doesn't work with 4 GB and going for aftermarket RAM on a new laptop did not make senseSecond requirement was SSD. I needed anything at or beyond 256 GBThird requirement was latest generation of processor, 10th Gen in this caseFourth requirement that kind of became mandatory after I was doing the diligence was MS Office preinstalled. Again, why go for aftermarket installation. Note: lot of people complain that this is only for 30 days. That's not the case. I activated just by signing in and updating Office.The only other competition to this is Lenovo in similar price bracket, but it has a poor camera. With all the online classes and office, you can't look like crap just because you have a camera dating back to 2000s. All else are either expensive, do not have SSD, do not have 8 GB RAM or MS Office.The screen could have been better, but I have a 29 inch LG screen so no complaints.I missed checking if the swivel opens 180 degrees and this laptop doesn't open 180 degrees, so if you do use dual monitor then you have to place  adjacent to additional monitorVery satisfied till now. Boot time with SSD is awesome, the system boots in under 10 seconds.Although it says 1.47 kg it feels a tad heavier.  I have been using Mac but that's twice the price.I wish there were more USB ports, it has 2 USB and 1 C typeThis is default choice in the specs/ requirements so best buy"
3,"I've been using it for 3-4 days now. Experience wise it's great. It gets your work done.I'm not a gamer so can't comment on its gaming performance.Pros:8GB RAM helps windows 10 experience a lot.Light Weight.I don't consume storage space on my laptop so 256GB SSD is more than enough.Boots in less than 10 secondsWindows 10 & Office Student lifetime Subscription is a huge plus tooCons:The looks are pathetic.The display is very very very BADPlastic Body, Heck Plastic Trackpad feels very cheap.If you are able to make compromises on the cons then It's an average buy. Okay to use for work & study.Gets things done. I think it's the only 8GB product under 40K.Let's see .. I will update this review in a few months if the product still exists till then."
1,First got the product delivered couple of days late. It worked fine for 1 week and then all of a sudden screen is gone ! Poor response from HP service centre ... they are saying screen must be physically damaged which is not the case at all and there after no update from last 3 days after constant follow ups ! So I cant use laptop anymore just 1 week after buying it! Poor Quality and worst service By Hp support !!!!!!!
1,"It's the worst product ever. First time when I ordered this, it stopped working after two days. Software crashed. (EROOR CODE 3FO)When amazon replaced this order, nothing worked in replace order. I couldn't access camera or internet. I mean it was horrible. One after I unboxed ans it was useless.Reading the other reviews, I see a trend in these laptop. They all are cranking a little while after use. Heavy software problem. HP should pull this profile r out of market and replace it with better models.I was lucky that I found the fault after two days ( in replacement, one hour). You might not be so lucky. What if these laptops stop working after 7 days days replacement policy overdue.You are stuck with a dummy for a laptop and you are 36k. Please make q proper decision and buy a better laptop. Just don't buy this one. I am telling you from my personal experience."
5,"Very good product in these range, under 40,000-i get it in 38,000 somethingIt saya 7hours battery life but it is near about 5hours , it's very good 👍.It take near 2 hours to charge fully.It has ssd , it starts in seconds.Good for light gaming 🎮 , light - average video editing.It take another hard drive for storage, after sometime.It's good in these price range, go for it. 👍😎It has 1 year warranty and you extend it by buying the extented warranty package for 14 15 series hp laptop."
4,My one week usage experience:Boot time:10-15 SecondsResponse time for a folder & apps opening:1-2 secHardware wiseKeyboard -Excellent ergonamically for constant usageDisplay- Color gamut and the resolution will be flawlessTrackpad- Average but for long usage one should rely on External mouseSpeaker: Does the job perfectly for a laptop both in call quality and infotainmentCharger: 65w adapter will charge 0-100 in 2 hours timeBattery Backup: with 100% Cpu usage can expect 4-5 hours anything with 50%-80% Cpu usage can expect 6-7 hours as mentioned in descriptionComclusion: For office / commercial user who require emails and Ms office online classes & infotainment mutitasking of 4 at a time can close your eyes to buy
1,"Worst product. Within one week boot volume crashed and one year HP support is awesome, I raised a complaint and after two weeks they said to contact nearest HP support center directly. It's been around one month I keep pushing the HP people but no one rectified my issue.It's not'HP customer care' it's'HP Customer DON'T care'."
1,It’s been 1 week only n laptop stuck on bios update loop.i m not able to see window screen. Bios update is never ending. I don’t know it’s laptop problem or sellers problem. This is my second laptop from same seller.
3,"Web Camera quality is average, ok for light conference calls. Speed is decent and best part is the original and activated Windows 10 and MS Office 2019 Home & Student software. It is perfect for home use. Some people have posted that it is not FHD panel, rather HD (1366x768). But for Student or for parents it is perfectly fineNote: Product Delivery experience was the worst ever. Be prepared to have delay in delivery for absolutely no reason at all."
5,Very light and thin.Best one within 40k.
5,"Super product by HP. Got this HP 14s cf3047tu at Rs 35990 on great indian sale. Awesome Performance! Writing this review after 1 week of usage... Here is the detailed review of the product..Battery backup is impressive. If you are not a heavy user it can last for a day. ( 9/10 )Performance wise it's a beast.. with 8GB of ram, i3 10th gen processor and SSD storage you will not face any problem related to speed and performance. Windows boots in just 6-7 seconds. The software or apps takes max of 3 seconds to load... I have not faced any lagging issue till now. ( just avoid high end softwares and games and your laptop will work like a charm ) (10/10 )Display is also good... I don't know why people are complaining about it. Also bezels are not too thick as in dell vostro and others. (8/10)Looks are also decent with patterned surface which feels amazing to fingers and also provides a good grip. (8/10)Sound is AWESOME! at 100% volume it feels like i am playing music over a Speaker... It is really loud. You'll have to keep volume at 40-50% for general use.You'll not get any other laptop with this sound quality at this price. Really! (10/10)Camera is Average or you can say good for video calling purposes... As you don't have to take selfies with it.So finally, This laptop is good in every feature. A power packed machine by HP. You will not get any other laptop with this type of performance, speed, sound and battery for this amazing price. Better than vivobook 14, vostro and ideapad series. Just Go For It!Overall rating 9/10.(you also get a lifetime version of MS Office 2019 home & student - powerpoint, word, excel & one note which comes preinstalled with it that is you just have to sign in with ms account in any of the application and you will unlock the office suit)Also a big thanks to Amazon. They delivered it within 2 days of ordering.- vivek 😊"
4,Good and affordable system from HP. The system come with loaded windows 10 and MS office. Slim and light weight the important things at low prices is the RAM which is 8 GB with i3 processor make the performance excellent. The battery back is more than 5 hours which is also food
1,"Its just around 10 days since we bought the laptop.  Today as we were working it showed ""HDD 3FO Error"" on bootup.On BIOS tool it says storage volume is not present!!!Have raised an issue with HP for technician visit.  Hope they could solve it!!!Not sure it is an one off problem or general issue with this model."
1,"This is the worst product ever. DO NOT BUY.I bought this laptop in Sep 2020 and the laptop stopped working within one month. Amazon is refusing to take return and replace this product.For the past 2 months I’m trying to get the laptop fixed through HP service. Most pathetic service. They close the tickets immediately without resolving the issue. Despite repeated requests, they are not sending technician to fix the issue.Getting no warranty support or technical support."
4,"Pros: The product is amazing as it has 8gb Nvme ram and 256gb SSD storageIt boots up within seconds and is very fast, It comes with pre installed MS Office and Student editon which is a boon for students.Cons: Not so good webcam  And marks on the laptop when  we touch it but it is manageable at such a good price range of approx 39k INROVERALL I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU THIS LAPTOP."
1,"Before buying this product please make sure you this. We have decided to buy this product the first ever problem was it was enabled to connect with router and second thing it get's hang frequently which only brought before a month. We have consulted the hp services they are were will be responsible of ntg as you brought it from Amazon. If we consult this Amazon these people are asking us to contact hp people. 35,000 matters it not 10 for our middle class people. Even if like have any exchange these would allow choose any options. Please before buying any electronic goods make sure that the company and also refund policy are good otherwise there would be lot of problems to be faced just like did"
5,"# 8gb Ram, 256gb nvme SSD at a decent price point is a great deal..# laptop is pretty thin and light, good for carrying around and regular usage.# Has good processing speed due to nvme ssd n 8gb Ram installed in it..# Lag free windows 10 experience# Comes bundled with student/home ms office, just need to activate it.# Looks and build quality are moderated but decent enough for the given price point.# Display quality as mentioned by some of the buyers isn't that bad either, i could hardly notice any problems in it..# Has got a good sound quality."
4,"This isn't review after 3 days of Use.Pros: Very thin and light.  Easy to carry  Battery backup is good 5-6hrs  Boots up in less than 10secs and b  shutdown in less than 3secs  8gb ram+256ssd makes the laptop super  smooth and fast.  Sound output is good.Cons: Camera is average. Not Very great.  No backlit keyboard.  Track pad could have been more smooth  but a mouse will do the work.Overall: Great Laptop for 35000 price range. Best for students, office use,  etc.Rating 8.5/10"
5,"Worth the investment.  Got this with an exchange offer and got it for 30k. Great for business and home use. Not recommended for games or heavy duty data processing works.1. Light weight2. Quick bootup thanks to SSD.3. Mat finish, keyboard quality is great4. MS office 2019 comes free5. Audio quality is above average6. Video streaming and display is quite good7. RAM can be upgradable up to 16gb but may have to let go 4k *2 rams  DIIMs8. Hard drive cannot be expandable, need to replace."
3,"Purchased this as replacement for my aged HP ProBook 440G1. Replaced an i7 with this i3 option for these reasons: Latest technology -11 Gen, 2021 model, SSD, 8GB RAM. Did not want to spend a lot as I have a Surface Pro. Got 12k in exchange for the 440G1. So this fit all the bills. First impression of product is good. Plastic feel was the only putoff, but you can't expect a metallic body at this price. Laptop doesn't feel very sturdy for the plastic body. Booting / Shutdown is very fast because of SSD. 8GB RAM is min required for decent Windows 10 performance. Screen resolution is good. Very lightweight so you will not mind it carrying around. Easy to activate both windows and MS Office with instructions given on product page in Amazon. Overall, a decent product that won't dent a hole in your pocket. Would have given 4 star had the body been metallic and sturdier."
4,"Amazing speed, at first I had issues with start menu response but later fixed by update. Only laptop in the range with 8Gb ram. Keyboard is perfect as the button's stiffness  is well manged. Very light and almost negligible bezels. Only problem is the display which is HD and not FHD, although resolution  doesn't  make much difference but the inaccurate colour reproduntion and lack of Antiglare coting makes it an average display. Battery life is 6hrs + once full, charging is fine alomost 2 hrs. Overall I cant find a better laptop in this range."
4,"Before you go for this product, also keep in mind that how much money you spend on this laptop.After exchange, I got it at 32k.At this price, it's more than I expected.Intel i3 processor is enough for my needs. I even run VMs with 2 core. I don't want to launch 3-4 VMs so that's reasonable for me.SSD and 8GB is very quick and smooth operations.Genuine Windows and Office is a plus. One less thing to worry about.Last, Amazon is very good that it got delivered same day..."
1,The product which we received was really bad. Problem was faced with WiFi connectivity. Initially it get connected with WiFi and then automatically get disconnected.
4,"Writing this review after 1 month of usage.Purchased for 36k and here are few observations:(I am not a tech guy, but who use laptop for regular day to day usage)- Installation can be done by self and not required to avail the Amazon service at additional cost.- Ideal for School/college students/ regular users with not much of technical work to do.- Not ideal for Gaming purposes.- Decent booting speed & No hanging issues encountered so far- Video streaming apps load decently, the streaming quality is Okayish.- No keypad light available."
1,"After 1 month of use,1. display is blinking2. and bios boot issue appeared.3. Power button doesn't work some times... You need to hold for seconds4. Only advantage of this laptop is thin and fast boot due to ssd.5. Least quality Graphics6. My final advice is... Go for different models.. This is built with least quality material. And motherboard  doesn't support even small applications... Dell inspiron models are seems best as I used it earlier."
4,"Its been a week , so far so good. Only disadvantages are the screen's viewing angle are terrible and back lit keyboard is a must for laptop which costs more than 35k.Apart from these issue it is one hell of a laptop in the price point and its super light and compact with a decent battery backup of 5hrs + for now although I guess it will fall to 3hrs in around 6 months time as per my experience with Hp( Finger Crossed ) ."
3,"Review is for the 10th gen i3 - 2 core model laptopProsCompact  size / weight to carry around.Windows 10 Home for life time.Office 10 (I guess that is only Word, PowerPoint and Excel) but for single user .Has Ethernet LAN connectivity (newer models do not have this).8 GB RAM (contrary to the 4 GB mentioned on HP site for this model)  which will give good performance .256 GB SSD storage, improves speed and handles shocks.ConsA little reflective screen.No DVD drive.Both  the legacy USB Connectors as well as Power Supply  connector are on Right hand side while 1 USB .Type C USB connector is on left hand side.Wifi speeds are only upto 150 Mbps,  though YouTube streaming experience was good without any lag."
1,"In less than a month, the laptop failed while in operation. The SSD hdd is not accessible although the diagnostics indicate the disk is fine. From the reviews, it appears the laptop model has inherent problem & hence should be called back by hp and replaced with functional/tested models. Other features like light weight & thickness are overridden due to these failures leading to data loss."
5,"Bought this laptop during about 3 weeks ago during the Navratri sale offer. Delivery was quite prompt, got it properly packaged the very next day.Usage wise quite satisfied. Battery backup is also good.Regarding display, am satisfied for regular googling / reading, even watching a movie is decent. Screen was not very clear during a Zoom call.So overall am quite happy with this laptop for regular use."
3,"Got it in a good price with exchange. Coming to the features it's a 2021 model with 11th gen i3, suitable for most day to day tasks. I use it mostly for logging to remote work machine. Can use it for light to medium level programming. Camera quality is fine for zoom calls. Speaker looses clarity at full volume. Battery gives around 2-2.5 hrs average backup when I used for video calls and its self discharging if laptop is not used for long. Keyboard and trackpad are the worst, always use a external mouse and keyboard combo. It has 2 USB 3.0, 1 hdmi, 1 USB type C, 3.5 mm ports. So need to judiciously use them or buy an external USB adapter. Overall good buy if you get a great deal on the price."
5,"Bought for my son, he didn't want it, I landed up using it. Exceeded expectation considering it is only a core i3. The included Windows 10 boots fast in about 10 to 12 secs. Standard application like Microsoft Words, excel, chrome, edge etc runs without any lag. installed MX Linux as a dual boot and it runs very very fast without any issue, in fact it boots to desktop in about 6 to 7 secs. The laptop is well suited for normal computing needs. Gaming haven't tried. At 34k price point it is a value for money product. Recommended."
5,"Look no further if your budget is 36K, close your eyes and buy it. 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD and I3 10th Gen with MS OFFICE-License configuration you won't get it anywhere else. It boots in just 5 Sec with super fast performance. Initial Setup is very easy and you can do it yourself. Also if you follow Video uploaded by seller, registering MS OFFICE License is also easy. Display and Camera is ok (not best). Speakers are loud and clear. Overall a great buy."
1,It's a pathetic product. Very bad build quality looks fragile. Never expected such kind of product from HP that is too through Amazon. The quality is highly detoriated and.when I am asking for the return through refund Amazon Customer Care people are giving absurd policy reference. I am contemplating on approaching the Consumer Court for the redressal of the issue.
5,Overall experience is good as expected. Performance is mind blowing I just bought this laptop for coding and personal works. This is only products with 10gen ssd and 8 gb ram within 40k range. I am using HP laptop for 8 years that's why I chose HP laptop only. Those who are looking for laptop for study and personal purposes can consider this product.Booting speed: 4.5/5Camera: 4/5display: 3.5/5lightweight: 5/5charging: 5/5battery backup: 4.5/5overall: 4.5/5
4,"Speed is fast. Very quick boot time.Build is average. But performance was very good after initial 3-4 days of usage.Need to have Microsoft account in order to activate the laptop first time. Also it's required to activate the MS office product which comes pre installed with laptop.If you have opted for old laptop in exchange then delivery might get delayed as in my case they could not arrange and it got delayed by 2 days.But overall experience with laptop is good. Battery back up satisfactory. At least for 4-5 hours. Camera quality is average. Sound is good. Since it's ssd, much faster than traditional hdd."
4,"It is better product for those who have the budget under 40000, its processing Power excellent. Startup 10to15 seconds. 8k videos are run comfortably. Battery backup upto 4-5hours. Mice good. Speakers excellent. Overall performance good. I suggest it for the students who require laptop. Only the problem is that there are only two USB ports , should have been three."
5,"I have been using this device for almost 3 months. For the price there aren't many laptops under 40K with offer 8GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, and Office as well. This laptop has some good compromises for the price. No backlight keyboard but a good, comfortable keyboard. No FHD display but a decent battery life. The SSD speeds are pretty fast as well. So a fast boot up. Speakers are also decent.Overall, I use it everyday for work and no problems till now."
4,This is an amazing product for liye coders. Who are noob in coding they can try this lappy.SSD- because of ssd the timing of loading am operation and opening the os is little faster.RAM 8GB- 8 GB ram is enough for specific coders. It is good for multitasking. But don't try this if you are a heavy gamer or heavy coder.KEYBOARD- keyboard is greally good. Easy for typing but there is no numpad.TOUCHPAD- a fine and smooth touchpad with mat finish which is appreciatable.Screen- Full hd and 14 inch. You may find it a little small but still it is very much clear.OS - windows 10 is preloaded in SSD. Therefore the machine is faster than others.MS OFFICE- ms office is also preloaded. You need not to buy or download it.HARD DISK- 1 TB hard disk is there.LAN PORT- LAN port is given.USB PORT- only 2 USB port at your right side.SD CARD PORT- available at left side.CHARGING POINT- at your right side.HEADPHONE POINT- at your right side.CAMERA- camera is quiet okay for normal video calling.KEYLIGHT- Keyboard light is not available.Battery- you can use it up to 6 hrs.All over you can buy this if you are a lite coder. But not recommended to heavy gamer or coder.
5,"After going around shopping at shops for a 8 GB Ram +SSD +i3 11 gen specs I met very high quotes and low spec config models from various popular brands.Finally this purchase met all my expectations and fit my tight 40k budget.Windows+office was a bonus, highly recommend."
4,I m writing this review after using for about nearly two months . So i bought hp i3 8th gen 8g 256gb ssd model . Im a college student casual user only for powerpoint and browsing only i decided to go for it .Basically i was using old model of hp laptop only with amd old processor which gave lot of problems i cannot able to use that for simple one. I searched compared with other laptop also .when i bought i purchased for 36k i dont know why price been increased while that time some of the model like asus laptop avita were good also they were not some thing to look like asus had 4gb ram and typically having hesitant to with amd ryzen processor.This laptop till now basically fine it will feel compact also microsoft office free version preinstalled that also major advantage there are some things to be look after like:- Only one time i faced lag or hang i dont know  why i had put my pen drive so due to that may be i faced other than that i didnt hang problem.-While update notification the laptop like flickering the screen blackish that i also faced twice after updating it will not come.-Also keyboard also it  good feel will not comfortable to type it will feel cheap feel quality but mousepad feels fine. it necessary to wireless keyboard .-while turning pressing power button for turning on the laptop i feel that i have to press 2 times for that i dont know why but boot time is like 3 seconds .These are all things that need to be considered although it is not a major con somehow have to check with that.Performance is decent normal use whilw i played wcc2 game that feels like hiccups happened anyhow it is a decent processor no heating problem or fan noise i didnt heard of till now.Another thing that everyone should after is that battery backup the battery capacity mentioned like 41 or 42whr so claiming less than 7hr majorily i also one of the reason i bought but decent battery backup only charging also take less than 2hrs last 5 percent takes time little battery backup at a stretch use u will less than 4 hrs only.Screen quality is hd only it is decent enough.FINAL VERDICT: Overall i suggest for buying this laptop mainly should be based on price only for 42k we can get better laptop also ig u get a price of 35 to 38k it will make much sense and value for money.Also mi laptop learing edition will be there still it is not that available there are not that much review i didnt go for it . other than it is only available above 40k better buy mi laptop with i5 gen or asus laptop mainly there will be i3 only it will be available Regard with amd processor in amd ryznen 3 or 5 are available in avita brand or some other company also but still not suggest only in case of heating or battery draining issue this with old experience of processor also review of other laptop only im saying.U can buy hp mi acer and asus with ssd option better value .Also thing this laptop im not sure about we cant add ram or expandable that thing need to check after in cas of mi laptop im sure that is not upragable.
4,"Build quality is amazing. Feels premium in hand. Looks premium as well. I sawsome reviews online and they all complained about the glossy screen.but the unit I got had matte screen. Talking of screen. It's very good.covers almost 100% srgb color gamut. Can be used for professional color related work. Battery lifegood. Especially paired with the lenovo vantage software whichis really useful. Keyboard is good. The face recognition is spot on. Works even in the dark. Haven't tried it in pitch black yet. Now let's talk about performance. The ryzen 7 4800u is a beqst of a mobile processor. But it's a Shame this usnit is shipped with only 8 gigabyte of ram. Basically making the overpowered cpu useless in some memory intensive tasks. You can edit videos on this as well. But that 8 gb ram really ruins the experience. Really wish it was upgradable. Or at least 16 gb. But anyways,the SSD is fast and reliable. And also i've heard that you can install a second ssd in ryzen version. Haven't checked myself whether this unit is upgradable or not but if running into storage problems you can always use external storage solutions. You won't feel the difference if you went with the ryzen 5 version of this laptop, which i guess isn't available on Amazon but it might be in the market. The price online of this unit is fine, not overpriced but i think if you buy offline you'll have more options to look for cuz this laptop has aome other versions as well. And if you are thinking of buying this you can it really has no major problems except that little 8gb ram. But you may also consider the hp envy x360. It has ryzen 5 with non upgradable 8 gb ram. Which i guess would be better for 8 gb. Cuz your 8gb ram will limit the performance in heavy tasks."
4,"Giving it a 4 star, as the CPU/APU and NVMe hardware is awesome for the price.Pros:1. Lightweight and Powerfull2. Decent battery life, the Ryzen 7 onboard has a low base clock with minimal battery draw when tasks are low3. Gaming performance is good4. Not heard the fans ramp up to max, no heating issues seen5. Premium Build qualityCons:1. Pretty bad web cam"
5,"Been using for almost a month as my work laptop.Pros1. The AMD Ryzen 7 4800U sips power. I am getting over 14 hours of screen on time doing web browsing and watching videos.2. The processor is very powerful. The performance of this machine in 'battery saving' mode is almost 1.5 times that of similarly priced Intel i7 11 Gen counterparts running on 'Extreme Performance' modes. And it limits CPU power to just 10 W in battery saving mode, which means that the fans never come on during daily usage like browsing the web or watching videos and runs cool.3. Windows Hello login using the IR camera makes logging in super easy and convenient. You can even set it up to lock itself, when you are not in front of the laptop for some time. The device can sense movements using the ToF camera and wakes itself up once you are around.4. USB C charging.5. Good Speakers. I have watched a couple of movies on the speakers. Did not feel the need to use my Bluetooth speakers as the inbuilt ones are loud enough.6. Display is color accurate, not that it matters for most people including me. It is a glossy panel, but I haven't had issues in the limited time I used it outdoors as the Ambient Light Sensor dials up brightness to max as soon as I step outdoors.7. Comes with 3 Year Warranty; most competing products even from Lenovo offer only a year. Be sure to check warranty time period once you get the laptop as mine came with 2 months less (34 months instead of 36 months) as Lenovo enters the date of purchase as the date of shipping by default.8. Superfast RAM. The soldered RAM is dual channel LPDDR4x running at a blazing fast 4266 Mhz.Cons1. Below average webcam quality; you will be better off with an external one.2. Intel 11th Gen laptops get Thunderbolt 4 ports that offer 40 Gbps speeds. But the ports selection here is not bad at all. The USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports offer 10 Gbps and the HDMI 2.0b can easily output to a 4k 60Hz monitor.3. Only 8 GB of RAM and not upgradable; but I have had no issues in a month's use.4. The trackpads are not as large as those found on Macbooks, but are a decent size, use Windows Precision drivers and are  accurate."
4,"Pros:Screen Quality is amazing (100% sRGB 300 Nits Matte display)Speakers are phenomenal (2 front firing Dolby Atmos speakers)The build Quality is superb (Full metal body with almost zero keyboard flex)More than adequate IO Ports (2 Type C, 2 Type A, Hdmi, Headphone Jack and Micro SD card reader)Very good typing experience (As I shifted from a 15.6 inch laptop getting accustomed to the new design and keyboard format took 2 days)Cons:Webcam is Average.No upgradable RAM (8GB model only atleast in India)Points to note:It does not have a thunderbolt port (As it is an AMD device)Windows hello face recognition is miles better than fingerprint unlock.The power button is on the side of the Laptop.It has one more SSD slot (2242 size SSD only)"
5,Best product and high performance.
4,"This is definitely a good laptop. I bought it after ages and ages of comparisons. To me out seems great value for moneyPros-1. It's light weight2. Battery life is amazing while being used for entertainment3. Picture quality is really really good4. Audio output is pretty great too.5. Super fast performance.6. Turns on when lid is opened (boots within 10 secs)7. Lid can be opened with one finger8. Typing experience is good. So is the track pad.9. Thin bezels. Has a great screen space while being significantly smaller than other laptops with same screen sizeCons -1. It does heat up a bit (not much)2. The webcam quality is pathetic (but I don't need it on this laptop since I have a separate work laptop)3. No privacy shutter (the bezels are too thin for the regular slider shutters that you can buy) This definitely bothers me4. Using it in bright daylight (imagine sitting next to a window even) is not that great.5. Brightness is low for day time6. For a yoga laptop isn't 360°, it only goes up to 180°"
1,"One of the best Ryzen ultrabook for the CPU but these companies know how to give garbage to indian customers. 8Gb RAM for the best ryzen 7 cpu? like seriously.. the target customers for this product is mostly business and productivity use and 8 gb ram these days are a base smartphone standard. On top of it, there is no upgradable ram option and you are committed to 8gb ram for life if you purchase this. Other countries has 16gb ram option for the same Slim 7 model and for a price way lesser than what they are selling here."
5,"Likes:Display qualitySound QualityBuilt QualityIt's fast bootingPremium lookingVery slimBattery backup is amazingType C fast chargingDislikes:No dedicated graphic cardSoldered RAMOverall it's the best in its price range..If you are looking for a heavy gaming laptop it  is not for you, overall I am very happy to buy it, you can extend it's SSD and make it unbeatable laptop..."
5,"Great machine for daily use. I use this for office purpose. It works good with all my usual applications (MS Office, Outlook, MSP, CAD, Coreldraw, Photoshop, Sketchup etc....)4800U processor is a beast, even when multiple apps are running, it doesn't care..I was a bit concerned about the 8GB RAM. thought it would affect while working with my heavy files. But so far I don't have any issues. all working fine without any lag. Maybe because of the superfast RAM. LPDDR4X-4266. But still, it would have been better if provided with 16GB RAM.Keyboard is impressive. smooth and sturdy.Battery lasts for a whole day use. Also charges quickly.TOF sensor and IR cam works perfectly. automatically locks if I am not there and unlocks without touch when I am back. (you can configure the timing and sensitivity in lenovo vantage). Facial recognition is as good as in iphone.Anti Glare display is good. great relief for eyes.Sleek and stylish design. Built quality is superb. I usually work in dusty places. Haven't taken this laptop there. Have to see how it survives there.Camera is not of high quality but serves purpose. (could have placed a better one).SSD in this machine is super fast.Most attractive thing is 3 year onsite warranty. This comes with a premium warranty package for 3 years. in effect I am getting 32 months warranty only as per the online confirmation. (as the warranty started from the date of manufacturing I assume.)Overall a great PC and value for money."
5,It's full fill my need; the only complaint is RAM is not upgradable.
5,"battery life is good almost 8 hrsr7 4800u is beastdue to full metallic body, it feels hot after long usage or while playing games but CPU temp is maintained,the display is just amazing not even a comparison"
5,The best laptop I've ever used. Feel is very pleasant - didn't get that even when working on a macbook.
5,"Liked the dimension and weight. I use for heavy programming, teaching and entertainment."
5,"I wanted a new laptop for myself. My requirements were that it is lightweight and fast performance. Bought this laptop after quite some research. The laptop is very light and can be carried around easily. It has a Ryzen 7 Lastest Gen processor which is super duper fast. Booting takes less than 10 secs and with the IR camera, you are on the home screen in next to no time. The laptop has a very classy feel with an all metallic body. The display is awesome with good brightness and great viewing angles. The laptop also has front facing speakers so it's great for entertainment. All in all, it's been a great buy and I am very happy with the purchase."
4,Amazing product. Always been a fan of the yoga brand and this model is the epitome of it. Fast and thin and light. Great build quality and the Ryzen 7 processor is lightning speed fast.
2,This Slim 7 with Ryzen 7 4800U - 8c/16T has been in other markets for so loong. Now when its finally available Lenovo puts just 8G basically making that i7 shaming 4800u basically useless.
4,Unbilivable product at unbilivable price. I got more powerful product with higher CPU and GPU at lower price. Go for it....
5,"This laptop is wow.It somewat feels like MacBook air, very light weight, and good built quality.Speaker is nice, camera is fine.I got good deal at local store in Dehradun.Overall, it's a wonderful laptop with good battery life of around 12 hrs.Camera is fine, but manageable.Speakers are good.Light weight and solid build quality.Performance is awesome (8 cores 16 logical processor, 8MB L3 cache)"
1,"Worst laptop from Lenovo- 1. The system heats up at 85C with hardly any usage. It becomes extremely uncomfortable to use the keypad after 10-15 mins2. The 8 GB ram is weak. You get only 2-2.5GB to use after lenovo s pre-installed softwares.3. The system drains a lot of battery.4. Customer service is pathetic and ineffective.I was fooled by the Brand name, good looks and reviews online. Choose any other laptop for this price range, this one is  not at all worth it."
5,Best product ever it has 16gb of ram very very nice | google chrome opens in 1 sec | battery backup is nice for browsing and gaming very very powerful | very bright keyboard backlight| Battery lasts longs for 8hrs in normal use | 5hrs in gaming and 7 hrs in online meetings |Touch is very powerfulProcessor is tooo much powerfulLaptop doesnot heatLaptop doesn't heat anywayCamera is too goodConclusion isVery very nice productWorth of money👍👍👍👍👍👍😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊💐💐💐💐💐🎂🎂🎂🎂
3,Worst display and poor audio and heating issues more .I never recommend this lapi to anyone
4,"After initial hiccups on Warranty and ADP, able to use the laptop for few days and it has excellent performance and elegant look. Really good quality in this price for a such configuration. Liked it!!"
1,"Do not buy this laptop from here. They are trying to get rid of their faulty stock. Read in another review that the person got faulty machine and he got a replacement. Thought it might be a one off. I was also sent a faulty laptop when I ordered...pixels were not lighting up properly in a spot. I was able  to apply for a replacement but they messed up the details of the laptop they were picking up from me. I spent about an hour with the delivery person trying to resolve it, with him on his phone talking to his Amazon contacts and me on my phone with Amazon customer care but they were not able to fix it. So be prepared for the replacement to be delayed as well, when you get the faulty laptop. Also, if you paid extra for one/same day delivery, it is not refunded in case you have to return the laptop. So you pay extra money and still can't use the laptop as soon as you expected it to.The replacement they gave me was also faulty...one of the letters in the logo on the back of the screen was missing(the glue came off or wasn't stuck there properly during manufacturing). So again talked to customer care about this. They said they can refund my money but not fix the machine or replace it(replacement limit is one).So you will have to buy the laptop again if you get a faulty machine as replacement and no guarantee that second time you order, you won't get a faulty machine. This is because they might send you someone else's rejected machine or one from their faulty stock where they have not even done basic quality checks like looking for visible exterior damage or screen issues. This is something they definitely check for, if you are exchanging your old phone/laptop/other electronics.I am going to try to use the Lenovo warranty to get the issue fixed and hoping some other issues don't pop up."
1,"My office 2019 is not installed, and neither lenovo is helping me to do this nor the seller, to solve the problem."
2,"Product seriously heating up at least the one I got ! Even if I do nothing, laptop's Fan is still working and the heat comes only from 1 of the 2 grills !Other than that I literally don't have any complaints."
4,Lenovo really nailed it. First charge may heat your laptop more. After subsequent uses it reduces heat up issue and also improves battery life. Battery life>11hr i tested it. it is increasing day by day. initially it gave me <8hr backup but now it is giving me almost 12hrs backup.Only once concern- i can not switch off touch pen.
1,Worst please don't buy
4,"I brought this laptop, but it was having a manufacturing defect, its sound speakers were blown and. But overall product was in good quality.I rated this as 4 star just becoz. The AMAZON replaced this laptop for new one and i am very much satisfied to their service.The replacement was done within 5 days. And the new product is working good for now."
5,"It is powerful yet sophisticated...Firstly, the fabric cover does gives it an unique look. It also provides a good grip while carrying it in hand. The Ryzen 7 4000 series along with the ram is pretty fast. In terms of display quality, battery life, audio intensity, touch and stylus: the experience is amazing. The keyboard has a great travel, touchpad is quite smooth and the fingerprint sensor makes switching on to the system effortless. And I could just go on with the features... also I've been using it for around 2 weeks now... and I haven't confronted any such cons to be mentioned...Overall it's a really good laptop and worth it's price, in my opinion."
5,"Look wise it's so good. Performance is as expected but heating problem is there. Even for one hour usage, producing more heat and not able to keep on my lap."
5,So far it is a super fast laptop. I have installed several softwares for doing software development work. Laptop doesn’t lag at all.
5,Perfectly meets my requirements
1,Amazon shipped defective product and now i am struggling for refund.
4,"I ordered this laptop from the lenovo website during its pre-booking. Got a wireless mouse and backpack for Rs.1/- each and the laptop for Rs.77,000/- after applying some bank offer. Now coming to the laptop itself, this is how I'd score it:Build Quality:  4.0/5Screen:  4.5/5Keyboard:  4.2/5Sound:  4.0/5Battery Backup:  5/5Performance:  4.8/5Pros:- An awesome processor (Ryzen 7 4700U 8 cores and 8 threads) runs everything smoothly. Be it multiple chrome tabs or adobe softwares like photoshop and illustrator. It's not a gaming laptop but you can do casual gaming on it.- The fabric cover on the lid gives it a unique look. Overall a premium looking device.- Decent keyboard to type on and the sound from speakers is above average.- Hinge is good and sturdy. Better than the one on HP Envy x360.- Type C charging.- Great battery backup. I was comfortably getting more than 9 hrs. by doing normal usage (browsing web, running YouTube, watching movies).- Privacy shutter on the webcam is a nice feature. I think more laptop manufacturers should implement this.Cons:- The keyboard deck flexes a lot. The top is aluminum but bottom is PC + ABS plastic. It is a good quality soft-touch plastic though. Would've loved to see an all metal body at this price.- Ports selection is limited. No SD/microSD card slot.- Webcam quality is just like any other laptop. Will get your work done (Google meet/zoom/team meetings).- No Windows hello facial recognition (Only fingerprint scanner which works fast & precisely, no complaints there).P.S. This laptop comes with a lenovo pen which runs on a single AAAA battery (not rechargeable obviously). It has pretty low latency and supports pressure sensitivity."
1,"I’ve purchased this laptop from UK. It’s touch screen stopped working within 6months of purchase. It’s battery is not upto the mark as well, it didn’t last over 3hrs."
5,"I have not seen a laptop like this before. It comes with a blue fabric finish on the top which looks really unique. Its really awesome. You have to see it to believe it. The laptop is super fast with the Ryzen 7 CPU with 8 cores and 16 threads. Overall, I am in love with the laptop and would recommend it to any one who wants to purchase a lifestyle product. Definitely worth the money."
5,Bought it from Lenovo. Got 3 years ADP for 1499 only. No issues what so ever. Speaker volume is a bit on the lower side however it does not matter to me as I use it for work. For few who watch Netflix it may be considered low. I did read few reviews people mentioned it over heats however I am not sure why they need to burn there laps. Keep it on table man. Moreover if the guys are talking about the fan remember its AMD. My other machine is i7 and it makes noise too. Go for it guys.
1,"Never buy a lenovo product ,They don't have any after sale support ,They just want to sell the cheap quality product and then there is no support if there is any problem"
5,"Nice Product - The large screen and decent processor is really helpful for online classes as it captures the board really well!! Initial impressions including styling, display quality and sound has been quite impressive."
1,Have been using it for the last 4 days. This is the worst ever. It is so slow that you could sleep in the night prompting it for shutting down and it could still be doing the same when you get up in the morning. Pathetic processor. Takes
1,Very poor performance. Too slow on every click. Don't buy this laptop. Don't get cheated.
1,"We had high hopes for the brand and hence bought it. However , the user experience was proved to be very bad. From the day one the Laptop was slow and finally since 01.02.2021 the laptop has stopped and is not able to start . We are requesting the seller to please replace the piece. Prompt help shall be appreciated."
2,It is 7th generation not 10th
1,It's too slow that before I type something my old  mobile already done...What I should do now?
5,Thanks for giving laptop for order of laptop.
2,"The screen and display are great. But the i3 processor is just not sufficient. It takes at least 5 minutes to complete the boot up process and logging on to Windows. I am unable to have multiple applications open. This might be a cost effective product, but will require an upgrade in RAM."
1,Bad product. The screen goes black intermittently for no reason. Display sucks.  Sound quality poor. It's a loot for 32k . Requested replacement.
1,It is very slow. I have just brought in previous month. Very less battery life. Totally wastage of money.
3,Laptop motherboard replaced within a month and very slow just updating everytime not recommend to anyone.
1,Very poor performance. Its just a week after purchase and its Very slow from day 1. Dont go with lenovo ever.
1,I bought only 1 month ago. The mic is not working. I bought only for online classes.
5,Best
3,A basic version laptop usuful for beginners  who uses only for fewer applications.
1,Worst product and is very slow.This is how Amazon cheats you
1,Too slow you'll get a only box in this prise
2,Works very slow. Need SD card for speed work
4,best product  Best Quality high speeds Internet.
2,Very slow
1,Very slow.
5,Nice
3,Average performance . It is slow and hanging.
1,It is getting hanged all the time
4,Good
1,Worst product don't buy
5,Good life
1,"Performance is very slow, Build quality is low and size of laptop is huge. I mean it, huge means huge. In addition of screen size there is large sides and margins left out which makes the laptop look huge and bad"
5,"One of the  good laptop for daily purpose like net-surfing, kids classes , daily meetings, programming with pre home msoffice version installed."
1,This is not a useful laptop at all never buy. I am writting ot after 1 year of use it takse 1 minute to start and it hangs almost 9 times in a day. I suggest not to invest money in this.
5,Though it has good picture quality but works slow..  it has i3 7th gen...but didn't expect this slowness. Overall nice laptop for low budget.
5,"It's a great general purpose laptop. I got it for 41.3k, and though its original configuration is fine too, I added 8gb additional RAM for 3.2k, so for 44.5k I've got a laptop that's blazingly fast for general use.I don't use it for gaming, only for office work and as a home computer, and for that it's fantastic. Boot up time is 5-7 sec, shutdown is 2 sec, Windows 10 and MS Office are pre-installed with lifetime validity.I have a similar HP 15 with the Ryzen 3 and though the specs on that are better on paper, the i3 version seems to be far better in real world performance.All in all, a great buy.Update: One month plus of regular use of around 10 hours a day and everything's still as great, no problems at all have come up in this duration."
4,"System works smooth with 256,GB SSD and 8gb RAM.Got Win 10 OEM and MS office Home & student active.Booting up within 20sec.Expected Graphic card of 8Gb AMD Radeon.As it was mentioned in details but came with inbuilt Intel UHD graphic 4gb .. which was a disappointment.Also expected 2 Usb port and 3.0 port but it has 2 usb 3.0 ports and 1 usb C port.Haven't used for more than 2 days will update later.Update after 2 weeks.. After all windows updates ,laptop performance  has improved.. Gives a battery ackup of more than 6hrs with heavy use. Full charge within 2hrs."
2,It does not have AMD Radeon graphics
4,"Great laptop in this price range..only disappointment., graphic card and ram  mentioned incorrectly..but came with inbuilt Intel UHD graphic 4gb .. which was a disappointment.. Else would hv given 5star.."
5,"It’s a great laptop for general office use..works smooth.. battery life of almost 6 hrs..The materials used are great,Matt finish looks great only think which I didn’t like is that finger prints are too visible on the materials ..I would definitely recommend for office guys and students"
5,best performance...very good speed (8 gb ram sufficient)256 gb ssd in special C drive...goodvery good model & thin model...
3,The laptop DOES NOT come with AMD Radeon Graphic Card (As mentioned in the description about the product).  It comes with Intel Graphics.
5,The product is very genuine and works very well. I would definitely recommend this everyone and I'm having such an amazing experience. Thank you Amazon for giving such wonderful experience. Now i can complete my office work without having any issues.
5,"It's a great product. Got it for 41k. You can work for almost 5-6 hrs once battery fully charged. I3 processor is good enough for your daily office work /Surffing Or online classes. With 256 GB ssd and 1TB HDD, pc boots really fast. Just go for it before the price of this product shoots."
5,Happy with the product
1,"Screen goes off suddenly while working, it's happening very frequently.bought it just a month back in May 2021.struggling to get the customer care as it's all automated BOT not getting proper response. Really hard after investing 40k.trusted HP but not satisfied."
5,For this price this model is very good and fast.
5,Work fine speed boot time less than 5 sec...I was expecting backlit keyboard and Intel uhd graphics it is little bit disappointed.
5,Good product
4,"Light weight, because of SSD startup speed is aussum. Not satisfied with Antivirus as come up with trial of 1 months"
5,Very good laptop with nice configuration at this price range. Fully satisfied till now.
4,"The Charging cable received along with the lap top was not working, intimated the complaint, but replacement not done till now."
4,Good one. Best config at 40k price range
5,Value for money anti glare and for gaming
5,Good
4,Good product 👍🏻
5,"Likes stoutness of product, screen quality is best..."
4,"Camera quality can be improved,"
5,"Value for money, best laptop in 40000 range"
5,Value for money
5,Amazing tnx bro.
4,"Super.Only only default the price is flucating. I brought for 42.5. However, now tge price is 1200 less, dissapointed with the price."
4,I didn't find anything in this laptop to pay such a huge amount like 43k. You can get it in 40k easily in your near stores..then why should you pay more
5,"Super I loved it .quality is good screen also super.,..... Amazon service is very good.best one lab top pls by all"
4,Awesome if u use it for professional use and booting is very fast than any other system I have witnessed till now
4,PROS:Best in its class.Boots in lightening 5-6 seconds. Fingerprint sensor working excellent.Comes with genuine Windows 10 lifetime and Office 365 (word/excel/note) lifetime pre-activation.SSD drive data transfer or application opening is fast and smooth.Excellent Battery backup. Will work for 8 hrs if kept on battery saver mode all times.Value for MoneyCONS: Poor web cam of just 0.3 MP. Not recommended for web call. Better attach USB cam giving HD video calling.Not supporting many of crack version softwares. Will not install or crash. So be ready to install genuine programs only.Verdict: Nice option in this budget. Ideal for WFH conditions. Can definitely give a try.
1,The product  promised a lot of features which made me buy it.. but on receiving i am really sad that it is not that high quality as they advertise. The keypad is defective. Doesn't type some letters . Since I have most of my work on Ms word and PowerPoint so it is quite annoying. Need to replace this and go for some good brand.
1,"I already have a Asus Vivibook bought two years ago and this was my second Asus laptop.The screen display has a dull yellow tinge, likely a feature provided by the My Asus enhancement. There is no way to turn this off or get the usual screen brightness.Once you Google, it is quite evident that the problem is quite common and none of the solutions provided work.If you are someone who doesn't like to have yellowish screen display, Stay away from this laptop.Asus Customer care is not really helpful. No option to return the laptop as it has only a replacement option."
1,The battery backup is not even 50% of what's mentioned in the description. #SuperBatterySound quality is also not so good. #SonicMaster.
5,Good laptop for day to day work .. i5 with 512gb ssd makes it smooth.. not recommended for gamers.(casual games only).. ms office 2019 is there (lifetime license)...  Can't say about its battery life... Don't go for this if you r buying for gaming or video editing.. go with some dedicated graphics card laptop...I got it for 47k... and it's good deal for me... let me use it for some days then I will post a review again
1,Its been 30 days I bought this. Dead slow process. Its taking 5 mins to open / close / switch to any app. If I have an option to return it now I'll do that. Highly Not recommended.
5,"Pros- good screen  Best configurations  Fingerprint  Lightweight  Decent camera  Office and windows 10 for life  Smooth experienceCons- Battery backup could have been  better  No Backlit keyboardBest laptop for the price range,You can also go for 1tb hdd+ 256gb ssd, with external graphic card.This is good for coding and office use + decent gaming."
3,No bubble or foam packing in order to check safety of the Laptop.
4,"The product is nice but the only thing annoying in this laptop was it's hard disk speed. I opened  task manger and saw the usage of the cpu, ram all were fine but the hard disk was showing 100% usage, whenever  we open something like mp3 files or movies it take time to load because the had disk speed is slow. It is a nice laptop but my opinion is when you buy this laptop you should install an ssd. This laptop has an ssd slot and that will make it perfect."
1,Bettery backup is low low standby
5,Likes:Best laptop under 50k budget.Light weight laptopPerformance wise its really goodDislike : no backlit keyboard
4,Asus bodybuilding quality is better 🖤
2,Just got it yesterday but aready i can see a little bit of slow process like browser gets delayed to open and even to open settings or to refresh the loading takes a while and not instant since i haven't even uploaded any files or anything. so iam guessing if i keep it for longer and have files then what would happen.
4,The laptop is quite nice and it is more than the worth of money you pay but the only problem there is no back-lit keyboard. And if there is it is very heard to find.
2,"It has a clockspeed of only 1GHz,so i would suggest don't take,its performance is not according to that which should've been equivalent to that of an i5 10 gen processor"
5,pros1. Intel i52. looks bazel3. configcons1. slow little bit2. drains battery
5,Super quality and battery
5,Good value for money laptop. Useful for web developers and office work.Battery lasts for three to four hrs not a concern. You can easily multitask and work.
3,"I gave rate  after 18 days it's performance is very bad, when I was install matlab take 1 hour to install the software , don't wast your money friends."
1,It's not for gaming and screen quality is also not good as compare to other niche brands and camera is really bad ...
1,Very slow
1,Very slow. Don't buy it
4,My warranty is not available in package
1,Don’t buy it it’s west of money i have facing so much lagging issues and slow boot speed
2,It hangs a lot
4,video and photo quality is not good
5,Good laptop
4,Awesome
3,Speaker volume is very low . The audio is not audible from a short distance even at full volume.Disappointed
1,"Not worth, system is 2 slow,better 2 buy a better laptop then this.Not worth for money,study review before buyingThe ports provided are also not working."
1,Dont buy thisIf u are looking for a good quality sound then don't for thisEven processor is very slow#hang##low sound
2,even no keypad light n camera i very very dull better go for other opening speed is not good but finger print is good
4,"Due to poor service offered by Amazon for installation, initially I could no decide anything about the laptop. I had to get the problems solved through my son who is in overseas online. All may not have such facilities. Amazon should have sent the proper person to install the system. The laptop is ok. Battery quality is not that good. I don't think Amazon will take any action on this feedback."
5,"I have purchased it for 77K. Specifications are good like 16 GB RAM,8GB graphics card, i7 11 generation laptop under this price is good. I will edit review after some time this is of first day use."
5,It is fast and works perfectly fine.Little bit heavy to my liking though.
5,"The best product on offer -The 16GB RAM & i7 11th Gen Processor deliver powerful and fast performance.Preloaded with OfficeAluminium covers, very thin and light laptop yet durableAll this under 80kRecommend everyone to buy!"
5,Great product.
4,"This is got to be best ultrabook which is priced less than 60K, I bought this at Rs.58990/-  from Appario Retail Private Ltd. SellerIts model name as per lenovo website is ideapad 5 14ARE05Various features are not mentioned in product description page and I was doubtful when I ordered whether it will have certain features like fingerprint reader, backlit keyboard, etc.Turns out it does have fingerprint reader, backlit keyboard, MS OFFICE(home and student) lifetime validity.Comes with a feature where laptop automatically boots up when the lid is openedBoot up time is less than 13 secondsKeyboard panel area( palm rest area) of laptop has got a matte finish, does not feel slippery, feels good to hold.Getting Battery Backup of more than 6 hours, just doing regular tasks, no gaming. ( it has different modes such as Intelligent cooling, extreme performance, battery saving mode, I have kept it on intelligent cooling mode, you might get more backup if you are using battery saving mode)My device came with Premium Care Warranty Pack (i.e. It has a base warranty as well as accidental damage protection for 1 year)Now there are  some negatives:You cannot completely bend the display to 180 degrees ( like few others Lenovo laptops)Audio Quality is Average(no bass)Camera is below average(its actually worse than you expect it to be)You may feel the base of the laptop warm although CPU temperature didn't cross 50 degrees Celsius mark. But still there is a bit of warmth at the base when you are using on your lap.Overall a very good purchase, you can go for it if you are looking for a 14-inch laptop in the 60000 price bracket.(excuse me for any typos)EDIT : RAM is NOT upgradable (Laptop was listed recently on lenovo india website and RAM is onboard, contacted the support number to confirm and the representative has confirmed that there is NO second slot for RAM)"
1,If graphic processor detail mentioned that should be great as international version have  vega 7 and india version detail is not mentioned
4,"Amazing spects under 60k but complete details must be mentioned like ssd type, Mhz of ram, graphics details, keyboard type, power adapter watt."
1,"Read the update at the end.My review:-Got it for ₹59k. It's a nice laptop with a hell of a processor, good display, fast read/write speeds, fast boot up, decent battery life, 65W fast charging, fast & accurate fingerprint sensor, backlit keyboard with 2 settings, lightweight, good for programming and stuff but it has its cons such as the Soldered RAM which is a huge bottleneck and it can be a deal breaker for some people. In the product specifications, it says that the Type C port supports Power Delivery, but it doesn't support that in reality. I tried to play GTA V but I could only play it on default settings @ 800*600 resolution and it worked very well as expected, although I couldn't increase the resolution to even 1280*720 due to the limited video memory. Although the speakers are front firing, it's not that loud, better to invest in some external speakers. Webcam, as expected is average/ below average.Update:Within 6 months of purchase, the touchpad started to freeze randomly which I thought was a bug, but in reality, it wasn't. Also, after 3 more months i.e., within 9 months of purchase, the display frame started to come out by itself and broke the hinge. Since, I got the Premium Care Support with ADP (Accidental Damage Protection) free at the time of purchase, I was able to get those parts replaced. I don't have very high hopes that it will last for 5-6 years. So, if you use your laptop for just 1-2 years, then go for it, otherwise don't."
5,"Worth Every Penny.This laptop is amazing.Display is alright, nothing special.Processor is 🔥🔥.Charges via type c but only with original lenovo type c 65w charger.Only thing limiting the laptop is 8gb ram.Also the exchange didn't work because my old laptop was chipped very slightly. That is BS. It works fine just because it is old I wanted to exchange it.Edit 1: The Laptop does support USB Type C Charging, you just need a compaitible Type C PD charger.I tried with my Samsung 25w pd charger which came with the M31s.I'll also upload a short video to show charging through both chargers.Also laptop DOES NOT charge with normal USB Type C chargers. I tried with both Warp Charge 30T ( Oneplus 7t pro) and SuperDart 65w ( Realme x50 pro) chargers."
1,"I purchased it for Ryzen 7 4700U, but realised apart from that each and every component in the laptop is cheap quality. Camera is as good as absent. Mic is not working. No proper support from Lenovo staff. Buttons are cheap quality. Its track pad is flimsy and started wobbling in a week. Dont Buy cheap chinese product. Go for Dell or HP or something. I did not pay heed to negative  reviews and suffering  now. Dont make my mistake."
5,I can confirm that this one has got a vega 7 igpu
4,Amazing laptop for this price tag. Because of the compact size. RAM is not upgradeable.Laptop is very light weight and boot up is really fast. They have mentioned ssd memory as 512 gb but shows 477 gb in properties. The charger is very compact.16 gb ram would have been perfect companion .
4,"So my usage is basically for work, i.e. emails, presentations, zoom calls, office programs, and casual internet surfing with some video consumption. This device does all of this with no load, neither on the fan nor on the ram.The boot up and shutdown is blazing fast at 3-4 and 2 seconds respectively. It charges 70-80% while working in 50-60 mins with fast charging mode on.Screen seems decent to me as I ain't no professional colour corrector and I can hardly notice any difference or negatives . The brightness is apt for indoor use but could have been better for outdoor use however it's anti glare will help you in outdoors.Build quality is good, top is of metal and rest everything is of plastic but it feels sturdy and premium. However it's a finger magnet for those with sweaty hands.Track pad and finger print scanner are amazing in this price range, they are very responsive and function as expected.Camera is a bummer, video call may seem lifeless as your image is very pixelated and too much Chromatic aberration are present.Keyboard feels sturdy and inspite of having good key travel it doesn't makes much noise, it has baklit as well which is whitish blue in color and has two levels but they are barely differentiable.Ports are enough for business use and the type C does supports power delivery to laptop, provided you have a 65 Watts charger.You will get barrel pin 65w charger in the box.Ram is not upgradable but is in dual channel configuration of 4×2 at 3200 Hz , it's more than enough for office use and just enough for entry level and mid range games.Radeon Vega 7 graphics are integrated which will use upto 520 mb from RAM but frequency is 1600 Hz .Audio output is okish, don't expect much from the speakers on board.Windows 10 home and Microsoft office student 19 are validated for lifetime . These are the only software this laptop comes with.Screen is sufficient for daily consumption of entertainment, casual gaming and video calls, but since the srgb ranges from 45-55 , it's better to look for better screen if you are a consumer of color manipulation softwares.Wifi and Bluetooth are version 6 and 5 respectively, and they work as expected.I bought this laptop for 58595 INR.There are a lot of negative reviews for Appario retail, but my product was neatly packed and arrived in factory condition.I would advise you to check whether your invoice contains the same serial no. as inscribed on your product or device, if it matches then you are sorted with warranty claims in future.This device comes with 365 days of onsite warranty but somehow my system shows its having 11 months left while checking on the day of unboxing ( don't matters much to me).Over all if your budget is 60k , this is the best offering and is a very powerful machine.I have not weighed this machine but to give you an idea it comes somewhat near to 1.5 kgs (roughly equal to a Collins full size dictionary)Cons- Camera is a mess ,RAM(8 GB soldered , non expandable), screen is a bummer only for professional colour correctors, integrated graphics ( for intensive gamers),speakers ( for people with no third party audio device to pair)."
5,"Best laptop under 60000. Ram is upgradable to 12 GB. 2 slots are used with 4 gb ram each of 3200 meha hertz and only the 1st slot is soldered to the motherboard. One can change the 2nd ram to 8 GB but you won't be needing that as 8GB ram with 4700U Ryzen 7 is enough for running blender and daz studio for animation and rendering together. Magic happens due to the 512GB NVME SSD and extremely slim form factor with no sound and trackpad is like a macbook one. Power button includes a fingerprint sensor and the power brick is a one wire setup which is better than those two wire setups. Fast charge with amazing battery life.One thing, do not change the 2nd ram to 8 GB as the compatibility of 2 4GB ram is better than a 4GB and a 8 GB ram.Never go for an i7 10th gen laptop as it fails drastically in comparison to this. Check the video of Geeky Ranjit on YouTube (comparison of i7 10th gen with ryzen 7 4700u).Everyone says that intel has better performance in single core but after seeing the results ryzen 7bis better in single core performance than i7 and also multi core performance is always better than intel."
5,"Great laptop for price, available in market"
1,I don't know...wtts the issue...is...bt within 10 dayz...it's heating like hell...In just 10 dayz...it's Boot time increased...it became slow....it ssd...read spreed...feel likes it's been forever......worst part is...now I cannot even replace it.....I'm stuck with it....
4,"I got this laptop, removed Windows & installed Ubuntu 20.04.2, as this was the only way I could get decent specs for a proper development machine. I've earlier used Apple Macs, Lenovo E series, Lenovo T series and other random HP & Dell machines.Build quality- Better than low range HP & Dells but slightly lower than the Lenovo Thinkpad series machines.- Touchpad is okay-ish, keyboard key-travel is nice but not as nice as older Thinkpad- Some people have claimed that hinge construction is poor and it overlaps with some components.OS compatibilityPros:- If you'd stick with Windows10, you wouldn't face any issues- Battery backup is great on Windows10 & nice on Ubuntu too.- Bluetooth & WiFi just works, range, speeds, everything are great on Kernel 5.8+- It takes 10seconds to show the login screen on Ubuntu, and maybe 5secs to shutdown, I've only installed a few popular Jetbrains IDEs and Docker. This is blazing fast and it sort of shadows the minor driver bugs which would likely get fixed in about a year.- This laptop comes with 1-year premium warranty & likely phone support(I don't need it).Cons:- As of March 2021 & Kernel 5.8 everything generally works most of the times, there are minor bugs which need to be fixed, AMD seems to be working on them and things are getting better but even they get fixed with a reboot- 2 out of 10 times there are some issues like video & audio playback stutter, blank screen after wakeup from sleep, brightness control issue can be fixed with minor hacks.- Battery does drain when the laptop is on sleep, it dropped like 20% in 3hours, maybe.- amdgpu drivers usually have crappy driver support & there are no proprietary drivers but things are getting better and very soon AMD will be the first choice for linux users.- My laptop warranty began on the day I purchased the product and not on the day I received it, it began a month ago, but Lenovo folks fixed it when I sent out an invoice :(Conclusion:- This is a decent development machine with 8core CPU & NVMe SSDs & 8 GB RAM.- This is an okay business laptop, the looks are nice, wouldn't recommend it for kids as they might drop it.- This configuration is not available on Lenovo India website, buy! buy! buy! This is a really awesome combination of hardware, software bugs will eventually get fixed, no worries on that front."
4,"Look and weight are impressive. I amcomfortable with the price tagged. I got the configuration which i expected. Rizen performance is so good. It was proved, gives more performance than i7 of Intel.RAM 8GB is Good which will meet my requirements but it was soldered and no scope for enhancementSSD 512 GB HD and its performance to so satisfactory. Weight is featherlite and comfortable to carry and move. Planning to expand the disk size to 1TB. Planning to add 512GB SSD.I hope Type C port for charging/data transfer would meet my expectation. I need to check it and confirm.Backlit key board will glow once only at bootup time not glow when KB is used.All other ports, USBs, HDMI, Memory Card Reader, Type C, power are working fine. NIC port should have been added.Keyboard is OK to handle but navigation keys are so close causing some inconvenience.Warranty is for one year from the date of Activation.Display Resolution is also good and satisfactory. Comfortable Brightness.Mic and Camera working fine but quality still to be improved. Camera shutter prevents untoward incidents.When connected to power Top lid gives gentle shock with mild vibration may be due to earthing issue. This would not hinder operations.Battery life is a highlight and more performensive than others in this category."
1,"Everything is fine & awesome for the price we pay. But if you rub the lid when the laptop is charging you can feel some current, it goes away if you unplug it. I returned the first laptop and the new replaced product has the same issue. I read some more reviews and came to know it is because of plastic ground pin in the charger.Very disappointed as this issue is definitely intolerable and I cannot return it now."
4,"I'm satisfied with the product ,Lenovo has done great job ,the build quality is good ,I have been using it since a month now ,it gives 7-8 hrs of battery life including my online classes and some research and just some YouTube.the speed is good and thats expected with the processor in it ,overall a good buy I would say."
5,"Excellent product, light weight, very fast, doesn't heat up, and long lasting battery. No problem is using it continuously for 6-7 hours to attend online classes."
4,"1. DesignI consider Lenovo’s ThinkPad series to be the absolute benchmark when it comes to productivity-oriented laptops. For the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15, Lenovo has tried to bring some of that robust and practical design to this meant-for-the-masses laptop. And safe to say, Lenovo makes this rather uninspiring laptop appeal in flesh. This has got a full metal body but with a luxurious “ThinkPad-esque” matte coat of paint for the deck.2.DisplayThe IdeaPad Slim 5i 15, as the name suggests, comes with a 15.6-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. There’s support for a 45 percent NTSC color gamut and it can go up to peak brightness levels of 300 nits. The refresh rate stays standard at 60Hz, which seems alright given that this isn’t a gaming PC.3.BatteryWith its 3-cell 57Wh battery, the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15 is rated to last up to 11 hours at a stretch. In the real world though, I found the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15 lasting on an average of 7-8 hours on a regular working day with my kinds of abovementioned workloads, i.e. 9-10 tabs on Chrome with a constant connection to Wi-Fi networks. The 65W adapter tops up the battery from 30 percent in under an hour. Additionally, I was also able to charge the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15 using a 65W OnePlus USB-C power adapter.4. PerformanceHappy to report that the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14-inch feels snappy and handles multitasking very well. Working with 10-15 tabs open in Chrome at the same times proves to be no issue, even when editing spreadsheets at the same time.The Ryzen 4000-series chip is behind this impressive performance, and in Cinebench the 4700U competes with the Intel Core i7-7700K. Even more impressive, GeekBench 5 gives us a single-core score of 1,092 which is on par with the Intel Core i5-9400F, and the multi-core score of 4,800 even beats the same chip with a noticeable margin."
1,"Misleading images...no usb c charger in the box , barrel pin charger given in the box. No barrel pin dc in port in the images but there's clearly one on the laptop...extremely annoying,  now I have to spend another 3.5k to get a 20v 3.25amp USB c charger."
1,"I bought this laptop. I was not statisfied with the product as it was small for my hours taking coding purpose. So when I asked them for refunding they told according to their policy you can't refund an electronic device. So after you buy, they don't care whether you are satisfied with the productYou will have eye strain if you want to use it for coding  for long hours due to its sizeIf you want it buy it from a store. The outer cover was torn when I got it from supplier. Pictures below.There is a heating issue even when typing in word"
5,"Superior product by Lenovo. excellent build quality considering its price point. NV Me SSD and AMD Ryzen 4700u processor is a deadly combination . Its lightning fast. It powers on so fast that it felt like unlocking a phone. Very lightweight and ultra portable, excellent backlit keyboard also. The key travel and clicking is satisfactory. Color accuracy is not good but you cant expect anything better at this price range . Overall go for it blindly."
5,The laptop is gives me good experience. nice keypad. track pad gestures are giving fast work experience. IPS Display giving crisp and clear screen. Colors are great. Speakers giving good sound quality.  Wifi 6 connectivity great connectivity. never feels like working in Wifi.Cons.Laptop comes with only two USB ports. that also in right side only.  No USB in left side.  No option to choose OS type while purchase. It comes with Windows 10 Home edition only.
4,"overall nice spec in this budget. Thanks amazon for delivering this product in same day that is just in 9 hrs.Prons: 1. Good processor 2. weight is ok in this price range which helps easy handling 3. display quality, keyboard, finger sensor, touchpad , speaker quality is good, all connectivity features/ ports are good.Cons: 1. non upgradable 8 gb ram, camera quality is below than average, UP-DOWN arrow keys are two small for operation"
5,The battery life is too good approx 6-7 hrs .on full charge.Camera is Ok for your regular vedio calls.Brightness is good.Over all a good laptop for business and daily use.A higher end laptop at cheap price.
4,"Amazing Product!Crazy boot speed, camera is average nothing great. Zoom and hangouts call are okay in terms of quality.Processing speed is out of the box fast, I run SQL servers, Python Jupyter and Excel all three, and there has been no drop in speed whatsoever."
5,Brightness is good enough matt finish works great.Camera is ok but it can be better.Processor is great.GPU is great but u may consider its really less storage if u go for high-end gaming or video editing.Battery life is good enough.NOTE:- Ram isn't upgradable.
5,"with 8gb Ram and 512 GB SSD paired with AMD ryzen 7, it can almost do anything you want.But some small things like, an absence of Ethernet port or ok quality camera are noticed.Besides this, this is a really good laptop ."
5,"This baby resembles Mac book. Glare free screen, smooth running of MATLAB, decent sound n camera quality. Perfect for students who multitask. Been a week. Loving it so far."
5,"Overall it's a good laptop for office and personal use. Easily handles 20+ tabs,multiple browsers, spotify, and microsoft office apps running in background. Sound quality and display are quite nice for the price."
1,Software not installed as committee. Not at all satisfied with the Amazon and Lenovo.
4,Writing this review after 20 days of purchaseCamera quality is normalBattery life around 4-5 hrsBooting is very fast less than 10 secIf you are ok with 8gb ram then go for it as ram can't be upgraded in future
5,"Just look at the specs, you can't get anything better than this for under 60K right now. Just wow."
5,"Excellent. Processor is very good, has 8 cores. Just go for it.Cons: none."
5,Value for money
1,Not good
4,Good but not best at this price. I brought at 59K
4,Overall it's perfect but I am having an issue with the yellowish tint on the screen. It is not too bad but there is some tint.
4,Good laptop. Sound is relatively bad. I have problem with charger heating.
4,Good battery life but it gets hot...i will recommend to buy a cooler with it...
5,just wow.
2,Very very slow. Design price weight all fine but performance is poorIf we open more than 1 Window it is getting stuck
4,"Firstly, you get what you pay for. At 25k, this laptop cannot be expected to support heavy gaming or software. That being said, it's a perfectly functional laptop for normal browsing, movies and ms-office/light other work.The laptop comes with a bunch of bloatware pre-installed (both windows 10 and lenovo). However once you remove them, performance drastically improves.Boot time: 5-7 seconds (give it a minute to wake up properly, grouchy until then)Battery: 5-7 hours normal use ( decreases based on type of usage)Build quality: glossy top, otherwise build quality is meh (again 25k)USB speed: very good.. 30 MB/sPrivacy shutter: little cost cutting here, but functionalKeyboard: good enough to use, num pad is useful for ExcelScreen quality: no pixel issues, good enough for regular use ( again 25k)Bulky: not so much actually, it's quite sleek and my sister is happy with itOverall verdict: totally worth the price. No regrets buying."
3,"Battery life is not much as written in specification (approx 3-4 hr).Performance is average, takes time to open apps and booting.Thing that is good in this laptop is its Audio and video quality."
1,Product is very disappointing and i have issues with speaker in the first 7 days of buying . Who'm to blame ? No replacement policy applicable and all i've now to do is get down to the Service center and waste my time fixing it . The system is very slow and I'd definitely not purchase Lenovo again . Thanks for your service!
1,Product sent without preloaded windows 10. Attached photo for reference and its taking much time to get return the money. Ordered another product which is working fine but return product refund taking much time.
1,The laptop is so slow that you can take a shower after clicking a command and then come back to see the result.
5,Osm product the laptop is good and it's by it 😁 I am so happy so buy a this laptop
1,Battery gets drained off very fast..... Laptop is very slow..... Sound quality very bad.
1,Laptops is not good  sell duplicate motherboard and other parts
1,Did not provide ms office as claimed.
3,Performance is average
1,Not satisfied with the product
1,Very slow like pentium 1.
5,You need to just install an nvme ssd and 8gb ram to make it really awesome value for money.4gb on any laptop is not enough on any laptop by today's standardsVery much satisfied. My Android studio starts under a minute.
1,Not good battery backupVery slow processorWifi connection failure oftenMouse pad is not user-friendlyOnly good thing is that the laptop is lightweight.
1,It was showing as 11th generation. Even in below questions dell is saying this is an 11th generation laptop.  Very disappointed
1,They fail to mention that Office is only a 30 day trial version.
5,Excellent product
5,Battery life is goodDoesn't cause much glareLight weight and sleekLooks goodWorks fastGood display
5,Laptop is good at this price...anyone who wants to buy can surely go for it without any hesitation
4,Laptop is good. Screen is good. Only drawback is it's screen/flap is a bit loose it should have been tighter. You can't keep screen down 30-40 degrees it will just fall down. That's why 4 stars or would have given 5 stars. Some people are writing ms office is trial version. It's full version only and is working properly.
3,"Good Display, but  starting system is very Slow. No backlight in Keyboard."
4,"Best deal found under 40,000 with 8 GB ram but as compared to SSD drive, it is little slow, but light weight, big screen smoth keyboard, one more thing related to keys, ""Home"" and ""End"" work with function key that irritate a lot. If you have lot of work on excel filw that make there little disappoint.Han battery life is good."
5,Screen quality is good and also anti glare. This is used for online classes
4,Good
5,Good
5,Screen resolution is very good
1,Battery backup very low
5,Good laptop for online classes
4,Don't find any issues till now. It's only been ten days.
1,As slow as this animal..🐢🐘
4,Awesome 😎👍
4,"Good product from Dell.It is very good laptop for student even for professions also i bought this product before 3 days its price approximately 39,000 and I am very happy with that because its price is worthy. Its is 10nth generation intel core i3 processor which make better performance."
1,Worst product. Very disappointed for me. Now I am using this product for more than 6 months. Hang issues are there on my new laptop.
5,"I'm a Technology Enthusiast and also a business owner, I'm already using One MacBook Pro but im in need of one more laptop because of increase work load.I Come across RDP brand thru Google, when i searched laptop under 25000, i heard RDP name for the first time, so i did a little research about the company and come across that it is an indian company based out of RDP, who design and manufacture IT Hardware - nice website and nice company profile.I was worried about their post sales service before the purchase being a new brand, so i just did a ghost call to their company number for a service request, then they promptly created support ticket asking for the device serial number that i could not give because i dont have one, so i said ill share later today and ended the call, to my surprise im getting reminder mails from them to share the serial number of the device to take my support request formward, out of my curiosity i called them again and said thanks for reminder mails and asked about their support system, then the person said we have strict SLA to every customer ticket so we do lot of followup with customers and asked me to download their SLA table from their website home page, i downloaded the SLA table and blown my mind that they have such a hard commitment towards post sales support.so with out further ado i just went ahead and purchased, great amazon delivery i got it before the promised time...The device packing is awesome, the device built is excellent, as it came with Windows 10 Pro Original with Windows sticker and Intel sticker on it assured me the quality standard..last 24 hours im using it, i strongly feel it is worth more than what i have paid, it has quad core processor, 4gb ram, i got 7+ hour battery backup, screen is superb, it has 64gb storage but it has microsd slot and HDD slot (so i can fix HDD/SDD any time if i require more space) now a days all my applications are cloud, so immediately i no need to think of additional storage.i give 5-star rating and strongly suggest to buy this product, if your usage applications are Internet Browsing (10-15 browsing tabs simulatenously), online meetings/classes, MS Office, youtube/netflix sound is very good inside the room, but not loud in public places, i started using zoho business applications and tally, it is super smooth because of quad-core processor and 4gb ram - i dont recommed this device if you want to use photoshop/3D studio or video editing or play high end games.it has suffient i/o ports as well (USB3, USB2 and even TypeC also), almost to the thickness of my macbook pro, very less weight too (they mentioned it as around 1.4kg)"
5,"The device received with very good & safe packing, I really loved the box design too, I studied all the features before buying the laptop and received laptop with exactly all the features mentioned, the specifications are1. Quadcore processor2. 4GB Ram3. 64GB Internal Storage (i have fixed additional 256GB SSD)4. 14"" HD screen5.

5,"@⁨Rajesh Uk⁩i have purchased this device for my kids online education, this laptop is perfectly working for online classes, the device is very thin and light weight, 6 hours of battery backup is really superb, original windows 10 pro operating system, very nice packing, i have bought this on my neighbour recommendation, he said after sales support is also very good from RDP, amazon delivery also very good.."
5,Using RDP since 4 years for myself and chose this time for my son's eLearning for JEE
5,"im using tally, ms-office, internet browsing, youtube video, few times zoom/google meet, all are working fine, i connected usb printer, and bar code scanner, iam happy with the device purchase, amazon delivery is super fast"
5,"This is an excellent product for SOHO use. It has enough of everything required for the normal business user, and would be useful for those looking to enable WFH for their employees at an affordable cost. It is quite certainly not very suitable for student / personal use, or where better computing speed and features are required. Gaming is almost out of the question.The set-up is optimal in terms of processor, RAM and in-built storage, and the stand-alone product may suffice in itself for many users. However, we have found that by adding a 2.5"" SATA or SSD and a mouse (both available in a variety of options on Amazon), the utility is perfect. The icing on the cake is that it comes with licenced Windows 10 Pro, which brings the cost of acquisition down further.The laptop itself is quite durable and build quality is good. It has a simple operating manual and comes with a small set of hardware for fixing a 2.5"" drive, which we found very practical and useful.We have purchased a number of these laptops for our colleagues, and are very happy with the performance so far. Two thumbs up!"
5,"Review basis 3 days of usage.Very good quality laptop. Indeed value for money.Bought it for my son's online classes, so expectation is reasonable but laptop has been really good. Screen quality is good. No lag at all. My son plays the Roblox game. Sound quality is also good.  Does the job. The disk space is low, but 64GB for student laptop is enough. Build quality is also pretty good. Webcam is good.Want to add one more line. It is a made in India laptop just incase anyone is looking for it."
5,"after laptop delivery, i had few doubts, i called their customer care, their response is prompt and very professional, my first impression on the laptop is very good, performance is more than what i expected, im planning to buy one more device and i also suggested 2 of my friends to buy because of amazon offer"
5,No issues ... battery 🔋 ok  6hr ...display 1080p....No lag....No hitting issue
5,Feel good product for the price paid and the purpose served. Absolutely sufficient for personal use and the time spent after company laptop and personal mobile. A Peaceful product can be used by kids  and parents too
1,Keyboard keys not working properly.
5,"""screen quality""""for gaming""""battery life"".Good 👌🌹👍🙏"
1,Bought for my daughter's online classes.Camera and sound quality pathetic.
1,"I was purchased , RDP thin book laptop , there lot of problems,Scree blinkingToo less disk c space ( nver possible to repair)Battery adaptor is low qualityInternal memory sometime disappearPlease don't buy this RDP laptop"
1,"A very bad qulaity outer fitting also using low quality battery, my laptop plastic break automatically just bcoz of swallowing of battery.....Will never purchase RDP laptop again also will not suggest to anyone to purchase it...Go for HP, Acer, Dell but not RDP.Thanks"
5,For the amount what i have spent its more than my expectations.I have asked my friends to consider this product for WFH and online class.RDP should also give laptop bags along with purchase.
4,"I was just looking for a decent laptop for my daughter to attend online classes, usually she prefers to join on mobile. My simple ask was battery life, easy on her eyes. I was not looking for high programming, games etc. This fits the purpose and wallet too. I vote for this, instead of mobile for kids classes, as prices of both are almost near."
1,"Thinking it is made in India bought last 1 year it has gone 2 times to RDP Ananthapur for repair, the laptop was not charging ... Anyway my advice if you are cutting your pocket and buying this just because it is cheap do not buy, if you have excess money try it. FYI it is more than 1 month I am yet to receive laptop after repair"
5,Hi - I have been using this for an year now and did not face any issue. Highly recommended for daily use or kids online classes. NOT for gaming.Very sturdy and reliable...Go for it if your need is not heavy gaming or programming.Best <20K laptop....have searched a lot and did not find anything equivalent in this price range.CheersRaj
4,The best products I have ever seen in this budget. Most affordable with best feature. Must Buy Products. Love this feature
1,"Has Charging Issue- Support team tells us to deliver via courier to Hydrabad location,Post Purchase very Poor Support- No Estimation price providedgo for Branded laptops which has service center near to your location.."
5,Good laptop for day to day work.Pros- good screenBest configurationsLightweightDecent cameraOffice and windows 10 ProSmooth experience
5,An awesome ThinBook laptop for budget range & I bought it for online classes.Good battery backup and good quality.
5,"Awesome Product in Affordable Price. Fullfill all daily requirements, I am attending online training and browsing and editing documents in same time. Thank Amazon.!!!!!"
4,"Bought this laptop at 46000 during festival sale.Pros:- Full HD Display- 8 GB DDR4 RAM- i5 10th gen- Built in NVME SSD with expandable options- Windows 10 with MS Office Pre installed- Thin and Light weight- Performance is good, boots in 5-10 sec, shutdowns in 3-5 secCons:- No backlight keyboard- Sound could be better- Built quality is not metal, it's plastic- Average battery backup for moderate users- 720p web cam not up to the mark- No fingerprint sensor for unlocking"
1,"Looks are very poor, it seems HP has made body from road side plastic. 14in screen look very wired.First time when Amazon delivered to me I felt burning smell so returned it, the replacement that I received was used I can see fingerprints on keypad etc so returned it.Don’t buy"
5,Nice product..
1,I am pretty surprised that Amazon has downgraded its service levels. The laptop which I ordered for my father was promised with pre-loaded MS Office Student 2019 (wonder why student when I went to “buy for parents” section of Amazon). There was no MS Office in the laptop and it’s asking my father for a product key which costs INR5000+. This is blatant lying on the face of the sale.
3,"I am using this laptop for 2 weeks.The basic functionality is good.This major drawback is the cheap plastic used for the body.There are wifi issues. The wifi signal receptions is low.If the wifi is disconnected and reconnects again, the laptop does not detect it again.This is a major flaw."
5,"I have been using the device for 3 weeks now. A decent system for programmers and more than great for students.Intel iCore5 10Gen with 8 GB RAM and 512 GB SSD, the system is having an high end configuration which is more than enough for day to day activities - be it general internet surfing, or for office utility or for programming.Being SSD device it is quite fast than HDD machines. Keyboard, Touchpad, Speakers are well built for regular usage.Comes with Windows 10 OS and MS Office Home & Student - a bonus for those who are heavily dependent on MS Office. It is really good product at a very low price."
5,battery work only 4.5 hour . Other good smooth running upto 27 days... of running.
3,Over all goodProsIntel i5 10 genGood cameraRuns very fastBattery you can expect 5 hour for browsingDisplay goodConsPoor build quality plasticNo backliteNo fingerprint I'm
5,"bought this for 59k.got this on 1st June n its 7th today.i bought 11th gen, So my experience is so far so good with the product.Batter Backup is 8 Hours while doing all the official work.in 11th gen, there are Bakligjt keypad And Intel Iris Xe Graphics instead UHD (as mentioned). Iris is updated one, so Thats Good.SSD literally boost up the machine like 3-4 soconds (i mean it) is the boot time.Damn!8GB DDR4 makes sure the multiple files run smoothly.i read reviews before i recieved the machine and i was worried about build qualityBUT keep in mind You are buying a Laptop and NOT a Hammer.body is of light Alluminium And not of Plastic (as read in multiple reviews)... You Need a Performing Laptop i.e. a Gadget; Not a Weapon.They say it heats up. Man, it IS a Machine it Will heat while running several files. What You Need to Take Care of is, Never Ever use Laptop On Bed, Sofa, Lap, or some other cloth or cusion under it.. It Need Vantilation to blow the heat..Always use it on a plane Table n Nothing under it... i Repeat NEVER ON BED OR SOFA.n if possible use it right under the fan or in front of cooler (not to mention AC as its understood).Take Care of your machine n it'll keep performing as New..!Great Performing Machine with the Trust of hp.Have Fun!"
3,"The laptop is probably good I have not started using it but quite disappointed to see that there is no fingerprint scanner on the device.I checked the model number on HP website and that does not show a fingerprint scanner, while Amazon shows it in description and images.If you are interested in having a fingerprint scanner do not go for this Amazon listing is wrong."
1,"Pre-installed Windows missing, not able to activate it ask to buy the license,,....,not recommended, better to buy from showroom...still in process to return the product...but struggling to reach the support team and portal not allowing to return as for normal products....struggling to even return the product....this product not recommended at all..."
5,I bought this week before . Arrived yesterday. Looks good laptop. Configuration matches with price. Ideal for development work and coding. Delivery was also smooth. This was my biggest purchase on Amazon in last 5 year. I am happy
5,"This HP Machine is a great Laptop. Was bored of my old Lenovo Twist I3 Machine  and therefore ordered this as replacement. Delivery was seamless and the guy who picked up the Old laptop was not at all fussy about the old one unlike the Flipkart Guy who always try not to pickup the exchanged one as if they wanted a new one for replacement. I must say Amazon is better here.Arrived within 48 Hrs!Setting up myself was quite easy!Light weight!Registration with Microsoft Account and HP account is far more easy !No need for the external paid service for Set up when you know the basics!Has all the necessary ports and you don't need a converter for anyone!Overall a five Star for the quick delivery, great stuff and easy configuration !"
3,1.  Cheapest laptop with reputed company.2. Specs are good in this price hence bought it .3. It's fast as expected with 8g ram and 512 ssd.4. Build quality is not the best. Could have been better . Finger print magnet. So had to order a skin for outside.5. Trackpad has a viable gap between buttons and tackpad. Hence order a trackpad cover as well so that dust should not enter inside to damage the board.6 . Charging is good . Backup is of 3-4 hours with cont. Usage.7. One single hing is good seems durable than the two clamps design .Order this laptop if u have budget constraint and spend some money to customise it and apply some protection on tracoad and outer skin.I will try to preserve it and resell it probably in a year or 2.  Hp laptop are not known for durability so remember that and donthe needful.
1,"bought the product, got delivered before time, but left side speakers are not working."
5,"First and foremost I am gonna tell about the build quality,before buying this device I read many reviews complaining about the bad built quality but to be honest I personally don't had any issue with the built quality it's not best quality but it's not bad either...Overall I would say built quality is average, there won't be any issues with day to day work..What I liked the most bout this lappy is the display it's very crisp and sharp display with good colour contrast..Pros:-1. Backlit keyboard-  Has backlit keyboard with brightness adjustment and I personally use laptop at night for programming and other college work so I wanted this feature.2. I bought model no. Hp 15s fq2535TU and in this model it was shown in specifications that it has UHD intel graphics which is wrong this model has Intel Xe graphics which is obviously better and newer than old UHD graphics.3. And yes before buying note that this model doesn't have fingerprint which I knew before ordering and I personally don't have any issue with it..( Shown that it has fingerprint in specifications which is wrong)4. Sound quality is also good and now coming to CONS...1. Battery backup is just OK It has like 3-4 hours of backup on heavy work like watching HD content and doing other heavy work (Not gaming), But with normal usage it will last around 5-6 hours maximum..Summing-up I would say Overall this is the best laptop for professional works, programming and other normal surfing stuffs Very good performance,everything is just up to the mark,very well done HP👍🏻,and yes this is not a gaming laptop and I personally don't play games so can't say anything about gaming..ThankuPeace Out✌️😁"
5,"HP15 Laptop (2021 model) - 11th Gen Core i5, 8 GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 15.6-inch FHD Screen, Windows 10, Office Home & Student 2019 (Got it for INR 56K)Pros:* Fast booting with 11 gen i5 with SSD (in about 5 to 10 seconds)* Sleek, light weight, good matte finish display* All-round performance is excellent. For normal home office work, watching youtube, movies, etc, this is excellent one.* Keyboard is good* Room for 2.5 inch HDD additionCons:* Build quality is just average. With pending plastic, it doesn't bring confidence. One needs to handle it carefully.* No Ethernet port* No finger print scanner (shown in Amazon pictures incorrectly)"
4,It is good laptop. I use it for ECAD simulation. Doing fine. I dont use it for gaming. Though you can play games with comfortable speed. The laptop hosts Intel Iris not UHD as mentioned.Pros:1. Speed(switch on time 3 sec amazing)2. Full backlit key board3. Screen quality4. Responsive5. Premium look6. Light weight7. 5 hour battery with video playingCons:1. Medium build quality2. Touch pad rough not matching my expectation  Over all I can say except build quality one can go for it.
2,Major issue is cheap plastic materail used for body... little perssure from the bakside of screen and you will be able to see bubble coming on the lcd display.... very sensitive to handle... not recommended....also amazon deny to return this item as they don't consider it as a defect.... poor service
3,No where it is mentioned that it does not support 802.11 acif you have  wifi with 5GHZ. do not buy as it does not support this I will again post a review after using it for a week
4,"Pros :-* Thin and light weight* Performance is good even while doing  multitasking also* Boots in 5sec* Camera quality is to good at this range* Battery backup around 4 hours* Built quality is pastic, But its goodCons :-* Sound could be better* complete charging it takes around 1 and  half hour."
3,"Screen resolution is not so great, you can see blur pictures from side. There is no USB C time port. This doesn't support 5Ghz Wifi. Add 3-5K more and get something better."
5,I am happy with the product. But i was expecting a carry case with the laptop. Previously i had purchased a laptop in showroom they gave me a carry bag and many other accessories for a lower budget laptop. But for this laptop I was not given a bag also. Very much disappointed. Better to purchase from a showroom so that atkeast we get a bag.
1,"I bought it on 8th December 2020. Now on 17th December 2020, during shutdown it asked for update which I allowed and then screen goes completely hang and black. I again reset, again during shutdown it starts for update and same problem of system hang  and black screen. Was going to return, but the return policy is only for 6 days. Is it a joke by Amazon, such expensive item listed laptop and the return policy of only 6 days. Was the reported review here are purchased from the customer to scale good to trap the customers to sale their defected product to them."
3,Disappointed with amazon. There's no finger print reader as described in the image. it is a complete fraud on the part of amazon
5,"The review is based on a weeks usage of the Gen 11th i5 variant. I would like to point out a few things that were not clearly provided in the product description.1. There is no finger print sensor in this model (unlike the picture shown in the product page).2. There is no LAN port on this laptop.3. There are only 2 USB ports and there is a USB-C port , a HDMI port and a SD card reader.4. Available space , out of the 512 GB, is 476 GB .5. Out of the 8GB RAM, 7.6 GB available for use. It comes with 2 X 4GB RAM sticks, and maximum possible upgrade is to 16GB7. Keyboard has LED backlight.8. Got a battery backup of about 6+ hours doing basic programming, with Wi-Fi on and Bluetooth off, screen brightness set to 30%9. It took about an hour to charge the battery completely.10. Microsoft Office - Home and Student 2019, with life long subscription, is pre-installed.11. Webcam is 720p with a very average image quality.Screen colors do appear a tad, not very vibrant, but definitely not washed out. One thing that I didn't like is the power button, just a minor thing that you could live with . There are some models from Acer and Lenovo of similar configuration and less pricey , but having used an Acer laptop prior to this I opted for HP.So basically this is a very good office laptop, with a great battery life and good ergonomics ."
5,"After 5 days of using,Battery backup 8 hrs per day.I am not facing any issues till now."
5,"Simply Superb, not tested everything abt this laptop but itsBoot time -4/5 secShut down in - 2 secScreeen quality is top notch is its IPS FHD Antiglagredisplay.Speakers are excellent.Backlight is also good.It have some Blacklight screen bleeding but very small which can't be noticed.Good option for office work, students, work from home.Good to buy 👍❣️"
4,"After using the laptop for over a week, I am in love with it. The processors are very fast, so booting up and starting any program is instantaneous. The camera quality is also not bad. The battery allows me to use it for 6 hours (watching youtube videos and light surfing the web parallelly). The backlit keyboard feature helps to navigate the keyboard in the dark. The screen gives awesome resolution and it's very refreshing to see HD quality videos/ movies. The laptop has a great look to it as well.The only con is the build quality.  The keyboard seems weak and needs to be handled with great care.But overall I would definitely recommend this laptop"
1,"I received a defective piece. Had to first run behind HP for a Dead on arrival letter to claim a return with Amazon. And now Amazon won't pick up the item even though it's eligible for a return since the past 20 days. Very disappointing experience buying electronics on Amazon.Apart form that the laptop is a good pick, only not via online medium. Highly recommended to purchase it offline instead."
4,"Fast and portable device for reasonable price. Very light weight, thickness is just 1 cm yet enough ports - 1 USB on left side and 2 on the right. Webcam just ok quality. Battery lasts about 3-4 hours.The preloaded Office apps must be accessed from the Start menu; if the Office 365 icon is pressed instead it will show only 1 month trial pack. For activation of the preloaded Office, best to open any app like Word from the Start menu, choose the Account option in the opened document and activate from there."
2,This laptop has Good specification but build quality is very poor. I am sure there will be cracks in body after a year of use. Laptop feels so fragile that i need to handle it like a glass. Not recommended
1,"During this pandemic, I bought this laptop on  May 6th (Delivery date) with lot of expectations for better ""Work from Home"". I bought two years of extended warranty also.Initially the laptop performance was good. But within 15 days (exactly on May 21st), the HDD is failed. It is showing that the laptop is not installed. I contacted the amazon support and HP support. Amazon support replied that the replacement window is closed on May 13th. HP support registered my complaint and they have forwarded the same to our local service centre. They have not even give a phone call till now. But they sent and email and told that due to the Covid 19 restrictions they will not able to take up the service soon. They will do the service only after the Government restrictions are over. I agreed, they may not be able to perform the service.I am totally disappointed !!!!!!"
1,Betrayal of customers trust in seller. There is no fingerprint reader on the laptop. Microsoft office not getting activated. Felt like using second hand piece. Bought two laptop from Amazon...one i3 n other i5...perforce had to return both due to faulty functioning and missing accessories. Amazon must take look at seller and blacklist such people. Totally disappointed.....
5,"Nice lightweight laptop with Full HD IPS display, back light keyboard and very fast reebooting with in 2 seconds.. camera quality is average and my kid did not like that otherwise everything else is fantastic.  It is 2021 model..battery life 4-5 hrs which is more than what I expected. Exchange price was also ok and did not change during pickup of old laptop."
3,"Ok, I bought this product when it was 56000 and I assure you this is a 50,000 product. So it's a great laptop but the prize should be much lower like 50k so please don't buy this if it is 56,000 or more bec you can get other great laptops for this prize range.And an another disadvantage is the vent where the air goes out Is placed between the screen which is the worst position it should be placed as it is congested. Because of that the computer heats quickly after 2 hrs of usage. The batter is ok. We can use for 3 hrs in battery saver.Don't get me wrong it's a great laptop, light weight, it's fast. But for the 56000 range we could get better."
4,"Good Configuration for Given Price ,The outer quality also good, its not business laptop so can not expect sturdy polycarbonate outer.But still decent material used and looks sturdy."
5,"I Got this for 48K during Sale.Very good product for those who wish to work for office work and normal and simple usePros-Light weightFast, very fastSimple, small, handyWorks best with Windows defender activatedHas Free Microsoft office alreadyCons-There are no as such,  but I wished to have smooth ans silky finish, this has a Matt finish, which leaves fingerprintsRegular cleaning and maintenance is the remedy for thisPros-Light weightFastGood storageAwesome buildCons-No as such because I got it for 47000 and it's very efficient"
3,The laptop is sleek and light but a big challenge I am facing is that within 2 weeks of usage the color of the frequently used keys have become very dull. Due to this the alphabets on the keys are not clearly visible.
5,Very good laptop in this price range. Very good speed in booting and any tasks. Only look wise not so stylish. But for a good spec for day to day use and budget friendly then this is the laptop. No use of wasting another 12 to 15000 just for look and additional features which is not required for daily use
1,MS office 2019 life time free not installed. Microsoft login but payment option open. Laptop not working. Bad item send seller. Replace/Return process not started by seller.
5,Excellent laptop at this price. I don't want to write a detailed review because every thing is good about this laptop..just go for it.
1,The display cracked inside after 2 months and Dell service centre says it’s accidental damage and that it cannot be replaced through warranty. Disgusting
5,screen quality is too goodbattery life  is normalif you are buying ssd version than its booting speed is too good boots in 7-8 secondsprocessing is fastcamera quality is averagealthough it is a better product and worth the moneybuid quality is good - plastic not metallic
4,It's a good quality at this price except sound output for music lovers.
3,"Loose keyboard, touchpad.. Heating issue"
5,Built quality and looks good
5,Very Good Product with SSD it works like a jet  value for mo ey
3,slow speed
5,Good Purchase. Very sleek and light weighted.
3,Right
1,It's not working properly and hang system all the time.and kebord monitor also not proper for use
5,Using from month and this is perfect for general purpose and office needs... Value for money
4,good laptop in this price range....
5,Not so fast. You'll probably need to add more RAM later that could cost you 1500 for another 4gb. Overall it's fine for the price. Design is good.
1,"I have installed windows 10 OS and installed all drivers related to mouse pad, internet but none of this is working..Really disappointed with the product"
1,"Hanging problem, waste of hard earned money"
1,"Useless system ever seen, don't buy it"
5,Good
1,Not interested
5,"At this price range this is the best laptop... One can do office work on this laptop... Play light games like NFS , GTA San Andreas and GTA Vice City... If some one is a Video Creator and uses softwares like Movavi Video Editor Plus or Cyberlink Power Director or Filmora than this laptop will run with ease... (Please make a note that this laptop is not a gaming laptop so one can't play high end games on it and Video Editing Softwares Like Adobe Premiere Pro will lag and not run smoothly as they are quiet heavy softwares)... Overall a wonderful laptop at this price range. I am totally satisfied with this product..."
5,Very Nice Laptop very speed it..Loved it..❤❤ this is budget laptop under 30k this is most loved it by me
5,"Super sleek, luxurious, beautiful and features enriched! I am quite happy with its performance and its a genuine product of LENOVO. You can register it online. It comes with Windows 10 Home edition which gets activated with simple steps. No need to get any initial setup service, as Cortana helps you there. The camera is upto the mark. I was expecting a little better there, but it’s satisfactory. Sound and Picture quality are superb (better than HP in this range). Packaging was sturdy and reliable."
4,"I purchased this laptop after a lot of research. Choose it over the Ryzen version as 16 GB ram was not available (I plan to use this laptop for a long time) and wanted thunderbolt support.The build quality is superb. No complaints. Light, sturdy and fully metallic build.The 10nm chip efficiency is poor compared to the 7 nm on the ryzen. This device runs about 7-8 hours of browsing and some video streaming (Intelligent cooling/Better battery mode). The ryzen model does drain battery at a much faster pace in processor intensive tasks due to the higher number of cores.Onboard Intel XeGraphics are much better than the ryzen version.The display is good. Comes with 100% sRGB support. Display is bright enough for outdoor use.Speakers are fine. The are on either side of the keyboard. Lenovo claims Dolby Atmos support.Overall a great device."
5,"Best laptop for everyday use. Speakers are not that good, however do the job. Has a fingerprint reader on the power button which was a surprise. Ssd is on pci gen 4-which is blazing fast. Battery life was around 6-7 hrs of web browsing, watching videos and using ms office. Office 19 came free with my unit."
1,"I had purchased laptop on 18th June 2020 first day of launch & received on 25th June 2020. After 2 days, OS was updated automatically & I faced Automatic Repair Issue.I asked for replacement & Amazon promptly replaced 3-4 days. But again after OS update... I am getting same issue."
1,"Day 1. Laptop showed Bluescreen within an hour of use and crashed. Not even able to perform automatic repair on Windows.Build quality is great and display is amazing, but what good is it if it doesn't work?Thanks to Amazon for accepting the return."
5,"One of the best laptop ever used, android studio, emulator,adobe premiere pro working on beast, no lag observed. Rendering time is also commendable."
2,"Speed not up to the mark,No backlit keyboard,No in built cam,Track oad is very cheap in build quality,No lifetime Microsoft office.High on specs but good for nothing.Mi has really disappointed."
5,Superb quality.. and value for money..  I think best laptop in this budget.. go for this 🔥🔥🔥🔥
3,"Value for money.Super fast booting, hardly takes 10-12 seconds.Easy to open with one finger, hinges are butter smooth.No complaints about webcam, perfect for video call & online classes for kids.Sleek & handy.Excellent pixel size. Though screen is 14 inches, it gives a large view.Sound quality is good.My rating 3.5 stars because of below cons:No backlit.Scroll pad quality is poor, while you click it gives different 'tik' sound.Battery doesn't last for 10 hrs as what they shown in promotion. Max 5-6 hrs.RAM & SSD can't be upgraded.Charger knob is hard. Very difficult to plug & unplug from laptop.Can't place it on the lap not more than 10 mins, getting hot & makes you uncomfortable."
4,"When I first saw the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition, I thought the laptop would be as expensive as the Dell XPS 13 or a MacBook Air. It’s got an aluminum build, an extremely comfortable keyboard, latest Intel processors, and a screen with the thinnest bezels in the market. All of those features, I just mentioned, are trademark of any high-end laptop these days. The Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition doesn’t cost as much as some of its rivals, but still offers excellent performance in a thin and light package.Pros:- 14-inch FHD Anti-glare display with minimal bezels- Intel Core i7 (10th generation)- 512GB NVMe SSD- Nvidia GeForce MX350- 1.35kg- Up to 10 hours of battery (practically lasts somewhere around 6-8 hours depending on your work)- Premium looks- Well priced (I won't call agressive pricing though)- Beautiful scissor-style keyboard with 1.3mm key travelCons:- No backlit keyboard in 2020 is a crime- Lack of a built-in webcam. Sure Xiaomi does provide a USB-enabled HD webcam in the box with the laptop but it's not the something one would like after paying this much- The notebook also lacks a physical fingerprint scanner as well which is again a bummer for the price and this time and age- The biggest downside of the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition is that there is no way to expand the notebook’s 8GB of 2666MHz DDR4 RAM as it's soldered to the board- The audio system on the notebook is weak. The stereo speakers don’t get loud. Plus, they lack bassThe laptop has a good design, better processing power and keyboard than every other Windows laptop in this price bracket. The Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition doesn’t cost as much as some of its rivals, but still offers excellent performance in a thin and light package. I'd certainly recommend this to anyone within this price bracket."
5,"I used it for 4 days, continuously for 7-8 hrs each day, does not heat much, was able to run Virtual Machine as well using VMware, Ram is not upgradable as its low powered module which is soldered on the board so this is China dumping low end models to India. I saw that in China, similar model with very high end specs in terms of Memory (16-32GB) and SSD capacity (1TB) are also available. Windows is Home version and not Pro which sucks if you like to use RDP on your laptop. There is no backlight in the keyboard which is a crime in 60k, keyboard is very small for people with big fingers, I would say if you have 60k for this, add 15-20k more and go for ASUS gaming model which comes with backlight keyboard and 16GB memory, has 15 inch IPS Screen. I would say this is a good ultrabook for office productivity, and low end games, but if you have to go for long term investment which can be upgraded in future, dont buy this model."
5,"Pros:1. Intel Core i72.10th Gen3.Light weight4. SSD5.Value for moneyAt this price the same config is not available in other brandsCons :1.Back lit keyboard,2. inbuilt web cam but the same is somewhat beneficial too.3.Lesser storage space,4.no ms office inbuilt (only one month trial version available)5.No logo.6.Small sized up down cursors."
5,One should purchase laptop what one should need. It may be not good for other but it is best deal for me. Before buying I went to apple store and local shops. Local shops were selling old asus zenbook. I needed light weight notebook.First of all I am touch typist so I don't need backlight keyboard. So backlight keyboard is not necessary for me. It has scissor mechanism keyboard. It is better than chiclet keyboard. It feels like heaven to type. May be that's the reason that they don't provided backlight. But they should provide backlight keyboard if they could but I am not sure whether scissor mechanism can provide backlight.It has two usb 3.1 gen 1 port which are 5 gbs. I wish they could be usb 3.2 gen 2 but I am not sure. Let purchase me external ssd of usb 3.2 gen 2.Battery life gave whole day. I didn't calculate. I am habitual of low brightness  so my battery time will be more.Most of the people are complaining about touchpad. It is flimsy. But they should read manuel. It is flimsy because it gives click sound when you tap it. For right click you have to touch with double finger. I think touchpad is good. It is different and unique from other.Lets talk about processor. The core i7 is beast. All work are superfast. I can't compare with ryzen processor which come with 7nm technology because I don't have one but this 14nm are good. But they do heat.GPU is very good. It's MX350.The best part is SSD . It has toshiba NVME gen 3 SSD which read write speed is 3500 MBps. That's amazing. Other provide SSD upto 1000 MBps.It has intel wireless 9560 card which provide wifi speed upto 1.7 gbps. Who need more speed than that. In India we are getting optical speed of 100-100 mbps.I downloaded games at 250mbps connection and laptop was getting warm. So who need wifi 6? Wifi 6 can support 2.4gbps. Moreover wifi6 it is not sure whether they have put good antenna. If antenna is not good on wifi than there is no use of wifi card.The thing that is missing is type c charging. But the charger supplies charges very fast and we don't have type c fast charger. It has mx 350 so we can play games so we can't charge with type c. Type c cable are short in length  due the reason they transmit data and the supplied charger have lot of length. If thunderbolt is needed than buy apple because it has graphic card and one who is buying this can't afford external graphic card or 5k tv. This is budget laptop. If you are complaining about 1.4b hdmi port than mx 350 can support only hdmi 1.4b. You are getting a lot in ₹ 60000. They have kept essential things and removed non essential items and targetted the needs of people of mind.I was skeptical to buy this due to anti Chinese movement but than thought and bought it and reasons I would not share here. I am not anti national to buy Chinese product. There were options like acer swift 5 but they increased the price by 5k and asus vivobook 14 they also increased by 5k. I thought a lot over it and my justification are only justified to me. I don't want to explain to anyone and I am not anti nationalist to buy Chinese product. I don't recommend this product as it is Chinese product but I have bought this product due to my personal reason. I will recommend only if you think about it and you have no issue in buying Chinese product.And the last thing is design. It design is more premium than apple macbook. Its like you are holding macbook. It is lightweight and metal built and carries 1.35 kg. It has 91% screen to body radio which seems so nice but it can't hold webcam. I don't use webcam and I have privacy issue so it is best for me. So the one who are buying for online classes please think before buying. Even I didn't opened the webcam cable.
1,Don't buy it.. company is misleading it's customer. Earthing problem is very often if working on a table u will feel many shocks in a single day.No protective grill inside laptop which don't prevent motherboard from dust.Graphic card is mx350 which is only for games which in terms don't support content creation like youtube videos on obs and other softwares.If u want to buy go for ryzen 7 8 core processor which takes half the time in tasks like video rendering even the ryzen 5 series perform better than this.Also processor is i7u u means it is designed to save energy if u want to go for i7 go for i7H and graphic card of rtx series but don't buy mx series because it don't support video recording otherwise you will regret later.
5,"Plenty of reviews already out there, but thought I should share my opinions on the device as well, since a few questions that I had in mind could not be resolved from the existing reviews, both on Amazon and Youtube etc.Disclaimer: I'm writing this review after about 25 days of extensive usage. I bought the base variant of the Notebook 14 Horizon during the Prime Day Sale, because it was running on an extra 2k discount and the 7k price difference to the next variant did not seem justified. I got it for 49.5ish thousand after factoring in amazon icici card cashback. Also, the 5 star rating is as per my expectations from the device, since I already knew what I was buying with this package.Pros:1. The display is IPS, or at least acts and feels like one. Though Mi website mentions that the laptop has 178 degree viewing angle, I could not find the mention of the display being an IPS one in any official listing. But I can confirm, the display has no viewing angle issues at all, is perfectly bright for the rare time you might need to use it outdoor, and the anti-glare aspect of it works like a charm.2. Performs really well. I consider myself a non-graphic hungry power user. Android Virtual Device runs butter smooth, more so on Ubuntu/Linux than on Windows.. Apps/software open real quick. Boot time is commendable.3. Lightweight helps make it super comfortable. If you use your laptop for 10-12 hours a day, you'd know how you end up placing it on your lap (or even tummy? or is that just me?). I was confused between going for a regular thick bodied laptop in the 60k price range that come with much better graphic processing capabilites. But time and again, I find myself feeling glad about my choice.4. If you think you'd like to play some games occasionally, and 120 Hz 120 fps at ultra settings isn't your requirement, you'd do alright with this one. I played Far Cry 5 and GTA V on this laptop, albeit with low graphic settings, but barely any stuttering, if at all, was felt.Cons (mostly nitpicking):1. The minimum brightness of the screen is still too bright. I use Dimmer to lower it further, mostly works except for the still-a-bit-too-bright mouse pointer. (Update: dims to a real low point natively on Ubuntu)2. I miss the dedicated Home End Page Up Page Down keys that were present on my previous 14 inch laptop.3. Speaker output is wayyy too low, in that even the voice of a person is barely audible in most youtube videos. I resolved this by opening the DTS Audio Processing app that comes pre-installed with the laptop, and amping up everything in the Graphic Equalizer to the max. Worked wonders to increase the maximum sound output, without causing any noticeable distortion in the sound output. I often find myself keeping the volume at the 70% mark now. (Update: On Ubuntu, install PulseEffects, enable auto gain, set Target to -17 and both Input and Output to 4, for a much louder yet clear sound output)No BSOD errors till date.Would update this review if I stumble upon something else. If you want to install Linux/Ubuntu, the option to disable secure boot will be editable once you set an administrator password in the BIOS settings. You can remove that password by entering a blank new password once you disable the secure boot.Conclusion: For the given price point, at the time of writing (September 2020), I wholeheartedly recommend this laptop, given you know what you are buying. It performs just how you think it would, given its specifications."
1,"Not reliable, purpose not solved, crashed"
3,Gud but battery backup is not gud only 3 hours instead of 12 hours
1,"Never ever buy this product, it has stopped working. Worst product service too"
3,The laptop is over all very good.:But few  points to note:1. The sound is not that much good. It will be difficult to listen properly in a conf call/meeting. Specially for our little kids who are doing online classes.We had to use another speaker or head set.2. The touch pad is little buggy. while moving the mouse pointer it sometime drags objects under it. This might create problem when you are in hurry.3. Camera was OK. But you have to remember to attach the camera.4. The battery back up is excellent. But if you are playing game then it drains 50% of battery in 30 minutes. It may be normal in comparison with other laptop but I'm not too sure.Other than these points still did not find any problem in last 14 days.
4,After using Laptop for one week below are my viewsPros:1:Light Weight2:No heating3:Premium Look4:Display also goodCons:1:Sound Quality could have been better2:Touch pad is not Goodoverall good value for the money
5,One of the best pc in this price range. Battery is enough not bad. It is something allrounder.
1,They won't provide you Web Cam when you buy the Product..It is mentioned that you will get web cam along with the laptop..but you won't receive it.. Amazon or Xiaomi should fix this problem
5,"I had purchased this laptop on first day launch.it is showing amazing performance i have no issues with this laptop, display quality is also good and no lag issues when gaming.i have satisfied with this laptop"
4,"This laptop is feeling awesome like Apple Macbook.I purchased i5 variant. I am not a Hardcore Gamer, not a professional, no any Graphical work. This Laptop satisfy my expectations. Before I used Acer laptop i3 variant which is plastic. But it is Metal which feels great like premium. What a bezel less screen ❤️.without thinking just go for it. No issues found in this laptop. But there are some Cons:-No backlit keyboard.8gb ram .Not upgradeable.512gb SSD which is not  enough but there ar no extra slot."
5,"After searching for one week , 4 hours each day I finally orders this laptop on next day of my 24th Bday for 60k 💥, here's the reviewActually I got admission in IIT Bombay Mtech and needed a laptop which can handle satellite images processing wellPros :--Screen is best , display is amazing, 91% screen to body ratio is killer in looks..-i7 processor is what made me fan of this laptop, as many renowned companies are providing i5 10th gen or below at this price and this is above standards in this price range and futuristic too..- 512 GB nvme SSD is good as most companies offer 256 GB only in this range .- Gforce mx350 graphics card is excellent for gaming and my image graphics work too , I personally have played very less games over it but I have seen people on YouTube playing gta5 , pubg smoothly over it ..- Battery life is good , but this will be too early to comment on this but atleast charging rate is fast- light weight and slim , also plain panel of screen is classic look (some may like llogo of apple , etc but I like this classic professional look )-Cons :-- NO BACKLIT KEYBOARD ,  this is absolutely disgusting about this laptop as I personally like keyboard lighting even at not so dark environment and in night it is miserable . So u need time to adjust with this machine and set it hands with keyboard then only u will be comfortable with it as I type after seeing keys and this becomes intolerable sometimes 😁-Internet runs somewhat slower on it , when I download from ms official site then download speed is better than my phone but from other not so popular sites it shows slower speed , idk why . But YouTube 4k video runs amazingly smooth ..,- HEATING is not a problem during regular use but as soon as u switch on the game the fans start at its full speed and laptop gets instantaneously hot at hinge part of screen this heat is expected I guess but 2 fans could have better dealt it- No ms office , free wps office need downloaded-TRACKPAD is not upto the mark for this price , u will need a mouse anyway- sound is low nearly equal to phone- Ram is not upgradable , presently I don't find it a problem but according to many youtubers this is not futuristic and will hamper the full utilisation of i7 processorFinal verdict : If I was to again but a laptop then also I will buy this only as it is a performance oriented machine and I m using MI phone from 2yrs + and still it works like new so I had built a sort of trust in this company now let's see how it fulfills this trust in laptop"
1,Pathetic!It's just been 8 or 9 days and it's not working well now.Today it came to become too miserable to even get shut down and even keys stopped working!I regret I bought it. I don't recommend this to anyone!!
1,"This is after almost 10 months of usage. This is a long post but please do read it. You have to know this about their customer care before buying this deviceSound quality and battery life are horrible. The laptop cannot be used without ear phones or external speakers. My power cord stopped working before 1 year of use. My customer care experience has been THE WORST.I made an appointment on the website at a service centre. When I went to the centre, they said that the company shut down their server. I don’t understand why they booked my slot at this particular centre when they had shut down their server themselves! Talking to customer care agent was useless, as all she did was book another appointment, which I could have very much done by myself.The second service centre needed 2 days to just figure out what the problem is when it was obvious that the power cord had to be replaced. I had to go up and down almost three times just for this!Firstly, it is clear on the website and my warranty card that the charger is covered under warranty for one year. I was told it was only for 6 months. After a lot of argument, they were willing to replace it (more like they had no choice). It is taking them more than 10 days to replace a charger that is covered under warranty fair and square despite the fact that there are TWO service centres and a mi showroom here in my place.There is no kind of status tracking available on the website. The service centre executives will not call you and update you regarding the status. They will make it look it is your job to keep calling them to find out the status. And now, when I called them, they said only half the charger has arrived and the other half is yet to come. Its taking them more than 10 days to get a simple charger replacement!My laptop has been put of charge since a week and everything is stalled for me. They expect me to go to the centre and get it charged if I want to charge it. What kind of nonsense is this!I have learnt my lesson. Although the specs are good at a reasonable price, please never go for companies like this that are not trustworthy. Prefer other brands that know what they are doing. These people are even more clueless than us!"
5,"I purchased it a month ago and after doing little test and trail i am writing this review.Before buying it, i was checking many options, at one point decided to buy Macbook though its little expensive. I read both ptoducts reviews and web reviews by experts. I was scared of 15% reviews which were under 1⭐ ans 2⭐ category of Mi laptop but i have decided to buy this product along with 2 years onsitego extended warranty of around 6k which in hotsl costed me around 63k. Macbook i may have to spend double the ptice for same configuration. I some how feel its not worth.My First impression was, its pretty little as i was using Dell experia from last 6 years and i didn't feel its worth by its size. When days passing on i realized its pretty handy and i can carry anywhere without having a seperate backback like arrangement. It even fits in your wife's handbag if its size is moderate.When it comes to performance, i was totally amazed and its look and feel is just wow. I became a big fan of it. It doesn't take mins to boot, just 30 seconds, you can turn on play. I somehow loved its giant performance.I took this for the purpose of playing/ practicing data science related stuff. Installed tableau, anaconda, java IDE which are heavy and hangs in traditional i3/i4 systems but this laptop served the purpose. Never felt it was taking time. Just a mouse click away. After buying this i realized the quality and bought another MI product (mobile ) for my dad.I never played games as my purpose is to practice Data related softwares and its eco systems. So i cannot ckmment on how it works for games.Overall, its a good purchase worth each penny. If you are struggling to pick bedt laptops with this configuration and undr this price bucket. Don't think too much  just go for it."
1,Already started facing number of issues. My NVidia graphics card is not working!!!You will struggle to get service for the laptop.
5,"This is very a good laptop under 60,000 this will give maximum battery for about 9 hours which is great I don't find any cons in this laptop totally good laptop just take a external mouse and you are fully loaded you can go for this one...... happy with this product :)thank you Amazon for delivering this laptop one day before I forgot to told about charging it has the super fast charger which will charge your laptop in just 50 minutes I will give update after one month of usage ...."
5,Pros :-1) The build quality of this laptop is sturdy because of metal body. it is very light weight and sleek in design.2) it looks very premium3) the quality of webcam is much better than the in built webcam of many laptops4) it is blazing fast thanks to the NVME SSD .The boot time is about 4-5 sec. App opening time is negligible. the read speed is about 3225 MB/sec.5) its display is wow because of very thin bezels.6) this is perfect for day to day tasks. Don't compare this with gaming laptops.7) battery backup is about 7-8 hrs and charged rapidly.Cons :-1) doesn't have back-lit key which is the main drawback of this laptop.2) the quality of touch-pad is average but it is quiet responsive.3) cannot upgrade RAM and storage.Overall this laptop is great package under this price range
5,Loved the product.....very smooth and powerful laptop....its like the classic dell xps with macbook style .....loved the product but sorry for people who could not be able to buy it ......it got i7 processor which you cannot get in this range of laptops ...... and the cam is good
5,Fast and slick
5,I really liked it.. Awesome performance and very light weight.. Seems like macbook 😜😍
5,Very light weight. Beautiful. Good screen.
4,"WiFi connectivity is always an issue even after many software updates.Customer care is pathatic when it comes to solving above stated issue ....i.e., WiFi connectivity. The executives are clueless.As if company knows this issue, no response from their end to resolve the same .... Even after raise multiple queries during the first week of purchase.Overall laptop is good for machine learning stuff at moderate level.The processor ditches you while pushers for heavy algorithms.Speakers are pathatic ... better not to come with one !For below Rs. 60k .... It's a machine with good hardware and software....but if any issue comes by .... May GOD help you! Mi won't..."
5,"See I bought Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition i7-10th gen, Now it has been One month with it. II never experienced any kind of lag, maybe because I don't do heavy video editing.... This laptop is best for Office work , Students , Teachers and Personal use... You can also use this for gaming and video editing also... I'll tell You the Pros and Cons about this laptop...Pros:-Processor : I searched all the laptops available in India. Non has i7 with a range of 60k and also you can i7 7th gen for 72.5k.Storage : It has the latest SSD. I experienced very fast transfer of files in just a while.(I am talking about whole Series about 7-10 GB)RAM : 8GB DDR4 with 2666 GHz speed.(Just Wow)Weight : Very Light Weight , You won't even feel that this is with you....Body : The body is made out of Aluminium which give it a premium look, And its back is purely plane ...(Which mean you can customize as you wish or if you like it plane let it be.)Boot : You don't have to shutdown every time, you can just lock it or put it in sleep or can hibernate...(I prefer hibernating as it Always takes the work from where we left it and saves the battery very much...)And also it takes 2.1s to boot up.(I have kept BIOS password so it takes longer or it would have been much faster... I just want to say it boots up very fast...)Graphics card : I have not used the graphic card much so I can't mention anything , but I can say this for sure it would be powerful...Display : The most interesting part... It has a matte finished Display, which never reflects any reflection as a normal display do... It is very Bright, so I always keep the brightness at 1 unless when I'm sitting under sunlight... It has 91% screen to body ratio...Fan : While playing any game its fans gets boosted up and runs at the high speed.... This may not happen when you are just Normally using your laptop...Cons :-Keyboard : Its doesn't have a backlit keyboard, but I think you don't need a backlit keyboard if you have a very bright screen. if also the brightness is at 1 the whole room brightens up.If you want the focus to be at the keyboard then just tilt your screen ...Cover : I am not able to find a cover for the screen and touch pad, And also I'm not able to find a back cover or sticker of its size...Touch pad : It is a little bit small. But it is justifiable as if they give a larger touch pad then they would have to make the laptop much bigger and the bezels would have been larger...Student : If you are a student who have to keep their camera ON all the time then it would be a Difficulty to carry the camera... If you don't have to keep your camera On all the time then it is best for you... And also without inbuilt camera we get PRIVACY, In the era of Cyber attacks PRIVACY is very important, this makes sure that you don't loose your privacy...AT THE MOST LAST : this is your choice that which Laptop, who are we to tell you that which one to buy which one to not... The decision is yours... Just check whether the laptop has the features you want or not....In my opinion you should buy this laptop if you are a Student , teacher , or just for office use or personal use... I would not recommend this for Hard-core Gamer..."
5,This review is written post using laptop for a week. I m not a gaming guy.Laptop is butter smooth.Especially display is awesome. It's Antiglare.Battery is extremely good with atleast 8 hrs backupExternal web cam is awesomeBoot time is less than 5 secsBest in range.
5,really greaton this price range it is best...when i bought this i didn't no there is dts speaker option from where i increase volume so i don't like that much but there is dts by there we improve speaker and processor is too good opening time is too less and shutdown time too it's really amazing i like it...
5,Best value for money product 👌..received in 4 days in this lockdown period ....feels solid ....very quick in action ... good display ...gives premium feel when you hold it ... under 60k it's the best  laptop... backlight is missing but that can be let go as performance is quite good .
5,Amazing deal.. value for money.. extremely light weighted.. gives feeling of using Apple Mac.. designed well within the price range which is affordable..
1,I saw a worst laptop from mi products .this I don’t expect for mi . Touch pad is worst .don’t buy any one . 😌 to say i have to use this worst product because i spent money on this
5,Its superfast. Battery is atleast 7 hours. Go for it . Only drawback is no backlit keyboard but its manageable for me.
1,"Was excited for this laptop until it got delivered today and turns out to be a huge disappointed primarily due to its poor screen / display compared to the cost of the product wherever superiors display was expected as bare necessary. Resolution is extremely poor when it comes to sharpness of alphabets, Numbers, charts, other internet text etc that it takes a toll on your eyes as if you had poor vision (you often feel as if the eyes can't focus on those alphabets). Not even a day and i wish to return this laptop but company policy doesn't permits so. Please don't put your money in this laptop and go for other better brands as Asus or Dell."
5,powerful machine but a bit heavy ..
5,"As with the looks its very sleek, lightweight and the colour is dark grey which gives it a classy look. It has a matte finish all over.The keyboard is comfortable to type and the font of print on it is big which is good even if you keep your laptop at distant. There is two light settings for the backlight on the keyboard which to me seems pretty useful.The battery backup is also good and no heating issues as such. I did observe that it charges up quickly.The only con I feel is that the colour scheme of display is slightly warmer in tone. If we had an option to make it cooler than I would have zero complaints.  But the warmer tone is easy on eyes so that's personal choice.Overall its the best Machine in this budget, a student can definitely go for it without hesitation for everyday chores and more."
5,its is a perfect banlance of hardware and price ....i will post full review on sunday....it is a must buy
2,"ProsSystem performance is fine, battery back up 9 hours in light usage, light weight to carry.ConsSystem at times does not start. When contacting customer care, they say it is due to static charge.. and i have brought this machine 20 days ago and i have to discharge for more than 7 times. I am a daily user minimum 4 hours to 8 hours.. still this issue persists (they say static charge accumulate when you are not frequent user). And also the audio drivers are at times not recognized. Because the board is new, i think there are many drivers they have to update.. in a nut shell, don't buy this laptop just now, they are still working on it. And lenovo customer care is horrible.. even premium care is not at all satisfactory. Pls don't buy lenovo"
5,"Good product, pricy but it has 11th gen processor which means it is 30% faster then older gen, techies can co relate with it. I have bought it for work from home , I work on virtual cloud and I have found the laptop to be versatile for software development. Display is good but don't expect MacBook type display for movies or online streaming, sound is ok but for zoom meetings it is very much sufficient. I haven't used headset on this laptol so far for meetings, the inbuilt Mike is also powerful, avoids surrounding noise. Keyboard has rich feeling, trackpad could have been better but probably I am comparing apple with oranges. Of course it is not a match to MacBooks trackpad. Best part of thsi laptop is lightening fast shutdown and startup due to addition NVM sata drive where your windows is installed. Lenovo upgrades are very easy , they notify through email for any update. Very well managed on that front. Webcam is very clear. Overall performance is good . This review is after 6 weeks of usage , daily 10 hours minimum. One more point to note is battery performance, My usage is heavy and I g t good 7-8 hours minimum. I still test it every day. And charging is super quick. Here it matches MacBook and in battery life, out petforms MacBook. Not as light and as compact and as sturdy as MacBook but overall the looks are very premium and rich looking. Keyboards are in the race to stand up against the Mac. Windows 10 is also competing very well with Mac in terms of ease of access and this is coming from a person who was Mac user for last 4-5 years. Though it seems pricy when you do comparision with other i5 laptops but then be assured, technically it is at higher place for few things , aethetics and performance fetches the actual browny points. I was sceptical initially but now I feel it was a good decision. my research was fruitful. I will recommend it to software developers."
4,This is the best combination of specifications I was looking for (SSD + 1TB HDD + 2GB DEDICATED GRAPHICS) ...My view  after one week of use ~Starting up with the look because it gives classic premium look. Keys are also upto satisfaction can type smoothly and  backlit feature is very helpful with two options of light (dim lighting and heavy lighting).This machine wakes very quick and ready to work big tasks in about 10 seconds.I don't find heavy heating issues like the other machines during heavy gaming and multitasking. Heatsup reasonably and cools down very quickly.Display is the only drawback it could have been better at this cost but that's also not big issue  it doesn't make the laptop that bad. I always use it in dark room and low display 🔅 light so I don't find it a problem. body is slim but not too light as it was said.Everything else is fine performance is awesome I'm satisfied.Got this for 68.6K on 15th Jan price could have been like 3k less for this machine but overall it's good.
1,Keyboard of desk is very fragile and it is not good within 15 days of purchase the keys are han detached and it is handled by professor so very bad experience
1,internal parts got damaged
5,"Build quality, finish and look of the laptop is excellent.  I use it for basic stuff such as browsing, online classes and some basic machine learning. So far runs smoothly and didn't face any issues. Just a tad disappointed with the battery backup of approx 5hrs whereas product claims 6-8 hrs but depends on other factors too. Audio quality is also good.Overall a good buy for me with exchange of my old laptop."
1,the worst laptop I had buyed it is not working sometimes and this  bad producteverytime i have to call customer care lenovo  is not doing anything please dont buy
4,"Configuration seems adequate for everyday home use, A very thoughtful layout and material choices make it weigh quite light. The screen resolution on this model could be higher to realise the full potential of its graphics card.Processor heat and fan noise seem minimum for now.(that need to be checked on long run with battery duration)"
4,"Overall laptop is good except the screen. I was using lenovo ideapad 310 and compared to it, lenovo 5i screen color tone is little odd/dim. Without bezel in 5i, thought its 15 inch, the height of screen is low compared to 310 which makes its little hard for my neck to adjust to new screen position for longer duration."
5,nice laptop for  editing and multitasking
3,Battery is running out fastly.
1,Quality of items is not good it has been proved that Chinese items is worse item in this world. Side strips of the screen of this laptop has been automatically comes outs and broken from its hinges . I m not able to make a complaints and authorised dealer for show this problem
5,Light weight and best for college students! Sounds amazing! Solid build...
1,Received used product with 9 month of warranty..laptop is slow and lagging...
4,Good laptop for home use
5,Good
5,Great Machine
5,value for money.
5,Value for money
3,This laptop specs are very good but the only problem is the display. I thought its a ips display but after using the laptop. I can say display is very bad apart from display everything is awesome battery backup is 6-7 hours easily.
5,Overall amazing laptop...battery backup with light usage is around 10hours...and with YouTube and surfing - 6 to 7 hours....This is not gaming machine but still u can play fortnite @ low settings and get 100 to 150FPS ...BUT again it's not gaming machine...very handy laptop with slim design and portable charging option (Type c 65watt)
4,"Best device i have got in years, battery backup easily 7-8 hrs of sot,nvidia graphics card works like a charm, processor is blazing fast,wifi 6 and bt 5.1 provides seemless connectivity, cutting one star because the display doesn't provide the customisation options, otherwise best laptop for students and even work professionals👍👍"
5,"Great experienceI bought it from lenovo store .But,i have to say very great productLooks very simple from outside and bewst from inside."
5,Value for money so thankful to LenovoGrate products thickness is very slimNice operating keyboard is very sumtha good
5,"This is feedback is an initial reaction. I already own Lenovo Ideapad 330 and this laptop is our new addition.  Combination of Tiger Lake, Iris Xe and MX450 makes the laptop smooth to use. Graphic performance is good and I expect it will improve further software update. I must say default settings of windows 10 ans FHD resolution graphics works like a charm. I can feel the difference when I switched back to ideapad 330.It would have been better if it has 512 GB SSD (it has only 256 GB NVME ssd) . By default hard disks are bit lock encrypted is a pleasant surprise. Need to back up the encryption key in a safe place.Will write a detailed review after months of usage and I don't feel any heating issue while playing less graphic intense games.Only disappointment was that the charger adapter follows the same old fashion. I was expecting like small wall charger similar to mobiles."
1,"I confirmed with Lenovo customer care helpline that with this laptop we can not extend RAM, so I suggest to Lenovo that it is worst things in this category laptop. Big failure or drawback. Please be aware if anyone buying this."
1,"Without even no better ratings and reviews just trusted the brand of lenovo and Amazon, purchased this product and much upset about the screen fitting and side panel fitting. Return and replaced but for second time expected the better one and recieved the same defected peice."
4,"Power packed product in this price segment.Pros:1. FHD IPS Anti Glare display2. Dolby Atmos Speakers- Stunning Sound3. 512 GB SSD for faster performance-Multitasking4. NVIDIA Geforce MX350 Graphics- latest GPU5. Backlit keyboard, Complete metal body gives premium look.6. Awesome battery backupCons:1. Amazon shows 3Years onsite warranty for this product but while you login into Lenovo site it Shows only one year Warranty2. Uneven brightness distribution while adjusting brightness to low level."
4,"The build quality is top notch, comes with i5 10th gen, sadly the ryzen 4700u version was not available at the time of the purchase. But, dedicated graphics from Nvidia with 2 Gigs memory is a solid deal. In short,PROS: 1. Build quality2. Battery (60WH)3. Display( great color reproduction and 300nits)4. 3 years on site warranty(you need to talk to lenovo customer care to get this activated)5. Front firing speakers (for me it was a major criteria)6. Good selection of ports7. MS Office 19, student edition with lifetime validity8. Excellent delivery from Amazon, got within 2days of ordering9. Typing on the keyboard is a bliss, best keyboard I have used on any laptop till date.CONS:1. wish I could buy this laptop with ryzen 4000 seriesprocessors2. Price should be within 70k3. Claiming warranty should be easier."
5,"(Ordered this laptop on my son’s behalf and this review has been written by him)I am writing this review after nearly four months of regular usage. Will update it in the future if my experience changes for the worse. I primarily bought this laptop for office-based use (rather than gaming) so here’s what I think based on that.Battery: The battery life is absolutely insane – it lasts around 16-18 hours with about 10 MS Office tabs, 15 PDF tabs and 30+ web browser tabs open (switching between windows while multitasking is seamless).  It barely discharges while it is locked/on sleep mode (maybe 2-3%/hour).  The rapid charge function is also really useful and works as advertised.  The only times that I got lesser battery life (around 8-10 hours) was when I used a video conferencing application in parallel with my other apps (the video conference was around 4-5 hours long).  My favourite feature on this laptop is Lenovo’s Conservation Mode which gives you the option of using your laptop on AC power without charging the battery beyond 60% (really wished that this 60% threshold could be toggled with though). It’s a very useful feature when you’re stuck at a desk for long period of time, and will extend the lifespan of your battery in the long run since you aren’t subjecting it to as many charge-discharge cycles.Build: The build quality on this device is lovely and the all-metal chassis feels extremely premium. I love how they have managed to balance a thin & light form factor with the feel of durability. The hinge feels really sturdy and has been designed in such a way that you can open the laptop with one hand. The casing barely smudges too, so that’s another plus.Hardware: As with all other Lenovo laptops, the keyboard is beautiful and ideal for someone who types a lot – it has the perfect amount of key travel.  The touchpad is Windows Precision-enabled, and I personally like the way it feels. The speakers are absolutely insane for laptop speakers (although I still personally prefer an external Bluetooth speaker), and the fact that they face upwards is a huge plus.  The thin-bezel Full HD IPS display is gorgeous – it does have a glossy finish though, so bear that in mind if it isn’t your thing. The selection of ports is a real selling point – 2 USB-C ports, 2 normal USB ports, an HDMI port, an SD card reader and an audio port will ensure that you do not have to invest in any adapters.Thermals: The thermals are really impressive for such a slim laptop.  The only times it heated up was (1) when I initially did a large scale Windows update as soon as it arrived and (2) when I have used a video conferencing application in parallel with my other apps for more than an hour.  But even then, it was a very mild increase in temperature and did not affect by ability to use the device – i.e. it never got too hot to touch.  The cooling fans aren’t too noisy either, but make sure that your drivers for the fans are updated (I was initially worried that this laptop was noisier than I expected, but the issue solved itself after running a driver update).To anyone who is thinking about buying this laptop but is hesitant because of the low rating on Amazon, I would like to point out that all the negative reviews thus far are directed at (1) faulty units or (2) the laptop being overpriced.  Firstly, faulty units - by definition - are aberrations and do not reflect the average performance of a device. Secondly, this device is actually priced extremely reasonably.  My response to everyone who says that an i5 laptop must be priced below INR 70,000 is that all of the i5 laptops in the sub-70k price segment do not have an all-metal chassis (most of them are plastic), nor do you get such a wide range of ports in any of the sub-70k i5 laptops.  When you add in the fact that you also get a 2 GB NVIDIA MX-350 discreet graphics card, a FHD IPS display in addition to 3 years of on-site warranty (you will need to contact Lenovo customer care in order to activate this since the Lenovo Vantage app shows just one year of warranty), I can safely say that this laptop is an absolute steal at this price.If I’m being picky, the only real negatives that I can think about are that (1) the RAM is soldered on, so the option of upgrading is precluded; (2) Lenovo could have provided a privacy shutter for the webcam like it has for some of its other laptops; (3) there are no colour options; and (4) there is no AMD variant in India yet."
1,"Item sold without Q & Serviceability check, it is manufacturing deffect"
1,"Product was damaged. There was a gap between screen and the lid - the screen was not glued properly.I bought this laptop even after reading the reviews but as mentioned in other reviews, the screen had a gap. I believe this is either the same unit being circulated to every other customer or quality control issue from Lenovo's end."
4,Loved the laptopThe windows works lik a charmThe battery life is awesomeCharges very fast...usb type cBattery lasts long as hellDisplay is samsung amoled levelBuild quality feels superb...Loved the trackpad and the backlight keyboard touch and feelWifi is superfastBoot up time is just in secondsSpeakers are my samsung note 9 quality...sound awesomeWhat impressed me the most is finally my bluetooth headphones connect instantly lik the minute i turned them on...its better then a mobile phone levelLastly amazon delivery staff handled a 75k laptop like its some trash box...they dont even know its fragile and costs 75k..the main laptop box was placed inside a box which didnt have proper packing and the laptop kept moving inside...amazon packing team needs to improve too..atleast fe expensive fragile items.
1,the upper panel is not fixed and stable..very disappointed by it and didnt expect this from such a premium laptop.Hoping for the product to get replaced
1,Everything is goodScreen is flickering in this laptop at times. Amazon is not helping to claim warranty outside the return window
4,"I could not understand why they use the Glossy screen it reflects the light a lot and make it harder to see(even indoors).The laptop's performance is ok nothing great about that, all the Ports are fine but not proper for example when I connect a cable to USB or even the charger although it is connected and working but it always feels like not connected properly ."
4,"This is a good laptop but a tad expensive if you compare the US price which I guess is due to import duty. However I managed to bridge the price gap by exchanging my old laptop (thanks Amazon for the no hassle exchange) something which you won't get if you buy from the lenovo website. The screen is a bit glossy which can be annoying at times. It weighs more that 2 kilos (contrary to what is mentioned here) which is acceptable given the fact that it packs so much power. I wish the 16 GB RAM version was available on Amazon because you can't upgrade it. But this laptop is quite fast too with vibrant display and excellent battery backup. If you are not in a hurry to buy, you may choose to wait a bit longer for AMD Ryzen 5 3600 (or higher) based ultrabooks to become available in this website and if willing to spend more, wait for the revolutionary M1 based macbooks!"
1,"Build quality is very poor. Most of the units having joint gap, screen pasting gap."
5,"Although price a lil bit high but nowadays all the business laptops are expensive and This laptop is really nice when it comes to it's build quality, display and sound. I can say It's a great package, I'm using this laptop since 10 days and It hasn't created any kind of problem and 2 gb MX350 graphics is enough for me as I mostly do programming."
5,Best laptop under 80kAwesome battery lifeExcellent built qualityEye catchy displayValue for money
5,Nice and a stable product. Lifetime free window and office 365 is a great add on too. The laptop is slim and light and works pretty well.
1,"poor experience with this laptop yoga Slim 7 (14, Intel) always hanging and I complaint this issue with technician and they said we don't found any issue with your laptop "" I send videos and pictures with proof  by mail but they never resolved my problem even they didn't send any technician to check this issue"
1,"I'm writing this feedback after 10 days of usage,recently I started noticing flickering, it happens for every 5 mins something like that, i don't understand what to do.apart from this rest all awesome."
5,Sleek and light weight and faster booting and good quality
4,Product is very thin and light weightDisplay quality is also very goodSpeaker quality is good
3,"85 thousand rupees on an i5 model is just crazy. this should be in the range of 65,000 to 75000 at most."
4,To the seller:MS Office Home and Student 2019 pre-installed with the Laptop (lifetime warranty) could not be activated. Please suggest the method.
1,A laptop at this cost you don't expect the display screen to peel off from its case at the top. Very disappointed...
5,very nice backup battery and slim and light weight
1,Disappointed. This product started giving problems within 6 months of purchase. It reboots of its own and does not load. And at a critical time when there is lockdown and service centres are closed.
5,Awesome laptop with full metal body
4,Touchpad is not so good
4,Good one
3,Battery is not as much as good what they said
5,"Awesome device, value for money."
1,Not value for money. Price must be around 65000 for Intel i5 variant.
3,"I bought this from Croma Store as it is cheaper. This is my review after owning the laptop for a week. When first getting the laptop, I had so many issues. Some of these are:1. The fan blows all the time. Even when the laptop is idle, it will blow at full volume. I have to restrict the CPU to 70% to stop the fan from blowing all the time.2. The battery charges really slowly. 10% in 1 hour was the average.3. Once the laptop is in sleep mode it does not wake up. I have to force shutdown the laptop using the power button and then turn it back on every time. To stop this from happening, I have to put the laptop in hibernate mode so that it will not sleep.4. As shown in the video, the display shakes and becomes corrypted on some videos and wallpaper. This issue has not been resolved till date.I was seriously condsidering returning the laptop. There are lots of Windows updates to install. I installed all of them and even upgraded the BIOS and all Lenovo software. Then on the second day, the system simply refuses to start. It will boot up to the Windows Sign-in page and goes to sleep immediately. I contacted customer care and they advised me to do a full factory reset. This can be done by pressing Fn+F2 when the system boots and selecting the related option. After resetting the laptop, all the problems disappeared. Windows Update also found only 3-4 updates to install. So, if anyone has any issues like mine, try resetting the system.My initial thoughts:PROS1. Fast enough processor for most people. This will not give Ryzen 4000 level performance but most people do not need that either.2. Battery lasts about 7-8 hours on normal use. Doing some lower processing work like typing on Notepad for sometime will give battery estimate at over 12 hours.3. Display is excellent with vibrant colors, better than my Macbook Air.4. Nice keyboard. I am very particular about keyboards and although this is no Thinkpad level keyboard, I am quite satisfied with it.5. Good sound quality with upward facing speakers. Sound from the earphone jack is also above average.6. Very good trackpad with Windows Precision Driver. My main concern coming from using Macbooks for nearly 10 years is the quality difference in Windows and Mac trackpads but I have to say MS and Windows laptop manufacturers have done a great job in closing that gap to the point where you dont really miss the Mac trackpad.CONS1. So many initial issues. It will drive away non technical users.2. It should have 2 RAM slots as 8GB does not give much room for future requirements.3. Screen is too glossy in most lightning conditions, I dont need to see my face every time I'm working or watching movies.4. A minor one but the earphone jack does not have that satisfying 'click' when inserting earphones and it somehow feels less secure.5. My main concern is the build quality around the screen. When opening the laptop, you do it by lifting the lid from the place near the webcam. The issue is that the connection between the screen and the chassis/frame does not seem to be very sturdy (look at the image of the review from the other reviewer). So if you lift the lid using only the chassis, it seems like it is possible to separate the screen from the actual laptop chassis/frame. This risk is increased by the fact that the magnet holding the laptop body and the lid together when closed is quite strong that you have to use some force to lift the lid.6. You will NEED to disable automatic brightness adjustment in Windows as it is very annoying on this laptop.I have not played any games on it so I cannot comment on the gaming performance.Initial issues aside, I am quite satisfied with my laptop and would recommend it based on my limited usage."
5,Very powerful laptop
4,"It looks amazing, slim profile, fast SSD, light in weight, slim bezels really catches your eyes, light gaming is also posible, for example you can play CSGo on highest settings.But the battery is just not up to the mark, it drains fast enough for me, I am getting 4-5 hours of battery on full charge. There is also this software issue where the screen flickers once in a day at least and they have not fixed it yet. But yeah battery needs to be better. It could be the Windows problem or the laptop's but it is a problem. Otherwise get it."
1,I used this for 2.5 years now. First of its RAM is less and the hard disk is HDD. Overall working is extremely slow. Booting time it promises to be short but it isn't. ANy application takes longer time to open. Overall performance is worst than a 25k laptop.Within few months it started hanging a lot. Then screen kept showing flickering issue. Then the keyboard stopped working.I replaced almost all the parts of my laptop yet it fails to deliver a good functioning. Touchscreen feature i thought is very cool and would be helpful but my dear friends its useless.sound is low..not that good. screen resolution is okay.But i have spent more than 10k on this till now and still i continue to pay as i do not have any option but to repair and use it.DO NOT BUY THIS..ABSOULTELY GENUINE REVIEW.
5,Purchased this laptop recently. Great product at the price being offered. Extremely thin and light. Decent battery life. Amazing performance. Would definitely recommend it.
1,"Cheapest product quality. Total China level. Kindly avoid, this is not the lenovo which was providing quality 10 years ago. The hardware is failing in almost every second laptop irrespective of how premium variant it is. Total waste of money.  The Brand Lenovo indicates Le-NO-vo with a BIGG NO in it."
5,This is the Best laptop under 75k. I am using it since past 1 year and satisfied. Screen quality is very good and its a super fast laptop!!
5,This laptop is well built and I would recommend everyone.
5,Excellent picture quality sounds afffect was so nice and the packing was very good total a good product 🙂🤗 🙂
1,"Lenovo laptops are ok as long as they are within warranty period. Once warranty period overs and if you face any issues with your laptop, be ready to suffer. Service centers are worst and they don't have spare parts available with them. They don't even prefer to work with out of warranty laptops. This is my personal experience with lenovo products. So if you are planning to buy lenovo laptops, keep this in mind."
5,Need to update ram to 8gb for best performanceGta 5 runs well after upgrading ram
5,Awesome laptop in this range. It is truly value for money. Dynamic Physical look. It is very good for work from home in this epedemic covid-19.
5,Wanted a good laptop for daily usage with Windows and Office. The performance is good and does the everyday tasks well. Comes with Microsoft Office as well. Very happy with the purchase at this price.
2,I bought this product but when i open its lid its turn on automatically.... is it defective product or its ok? Let me help to know that
3,"The product description clearly mentions that MS Office Student Home 2019 is Pre-installed. This was one of the reasons for selecting this laptop. However, on activation it shows that MS Office is available for only upto 20 September 2020. This is unfair selling practice."
4,"I was expecting some basic experience but it struggles a lot. My HP pavilion with 2.2GHZ works better than this. I was like oh god what I have did, because I have exchanged my pavilion to get this.but now, 3rd power on after driver updates, BIOS update, now 2004 version is downloading, it's better ( only a nominal paise better)but I need to keep considering the price and it has camera and Mic which my pavilion does not have.To get this far, I need to apply Windows improve performance support link on new laptop with AMD ( I do not know what happened to AMD ( might be they are concentrating on other things where Intel dominates).I truly disappointed with this performance. Every time I click I click I click, I need to wait. In edge browser typing like stuttering.Think Edge is like that ( which is lightest) than any browser for Windows.The display is glare glare glare if you do not have proper lighting.I use on natural light, even with 20 watt LED room light, it glares.so far, as it was mentioned in the product pictures, the AMD Athlon version is tablet replacement and it is complete 15.6 inch ( need to check diagonal).I saw one review with horizontal measurement so clarifying others who check reviews before buying it.It has integrated RAM 4GB, usable 3.38GB and 1 TB Seagate usable 930GB.Over all, I'm keeping as it serves my purpose and basic working laptop with Windows home OS and Office 2019 ) the software's itself comes close to the laptop price if it bought separately.The funny part, I have HP omen Rs.1Lakh and above, this laptop I bought for R.22,000, my family likes this one than Omen since it has brushed aluminum like feel platinum grey compared to Omen matte black.Update 24/10/2020.Now, the laptop seems to be better.After 2004 update installed, I have 1.4GB RAM left for other applications.Total 4GB RAM > user available 3.38 GB ( pathetic) I don't know the user available is so low due to RAM is directly soldered to the Mother board. Windows only uses 1.9 to 2GB.but anyhow, I need to upgrade RAM or user experience might not be best.Update 07/11/2020.I need to upgrade the RAM if not, the user experience would be like order coffee and get it by tomorrow but you need it today.The display is like kind of white (eee) not balanced sharpness/contrast and brightness. I use it for my work and rest is Netflix, Amazon prime and movies collection I have.The exceptional part of this laptop is sound. Yes, the sound. The sound is best, way better than any computer ( I should say) or is it because of Dolby atmos.Yes, I'm typing it in the middle of the movie to praise the sound quality.and yes, I could conclude to myself Dolby atmos is better than DTS X with Bang & Olufsen . Yes, it is. Hail to Dolby.Update 15/11/2020,Installed 4GB 2400MHZ RAM, even though this model compatible up to 12GB RAM since it has 4GB onboard RAM (soldered directly to the motherboard) I'm forced to use 4GB RAM.If I use 8GB RAM + 4GB onboard RAM, I get the average of these 2, which could 12/2=6GB RAM which is now my usable RAM 4GB RAM added + 4GB ono board RAM.Yes, the performance is increased. Additionally I set Windows search indexing to manual so yes the performance is far better improved. Tested multiple application simultaneously.Windows explorer + Edge ( 2 tabs)+ Chrome (2 tabs) + Task manager + Excelall the applications worked better than earlier ( pl.refer my earlier review in the above messages).Note: Total 8GB installed RAM, 2GB allocated to integrated GPU as a dedicated RAM which is the beauty and welcome thing I like. Since the laptop has integrated GPU comes with 512MB dedicated RAM ( occupies the RAM installed or shares the 4GB RAM installed)Now, the integrated RAM increased to 2GB which would help me in running GTA V at low settings easily.and 8GB+ 4GB =12/2 usable RAM would be around 10 or 11GB but the performance would be equal to 6GB.When we are using dual channel memory, we need to always equip same amount of RAM to get same amount of performance.Suggestion to Lenovo: Please provide at least onboard 6GB or 4GB fully usable RAM.To buyers, buy RAM along with the laptop. Seriously it meets the requirements and need.All these reviewing are done with power adapter connected and Extreme performance mode.The thing I feel could be provided better is the display.The thing I feel wow about this product is the sound."
5,"Awesome product,delivered with full safety,good battery backup (5hrs+),attractive design,you may go for this.Best for students got it for ₹25,643.But there is no fingerprint unlock, only a power button."
1,okay... since its not THAT expensive of a laptop...  but still atleast put the right info!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!it says that the battery will be working for 5 hours ... when all i do is open gmail for only 3 hours ;... i need to charge the laptop again even when i started working at 100 % within 2.5 hrs i need to charge it again........... baddddd ... realllYYYY BADDDD
5,It is good laptop. Some people are telling that its processor is too slow and not working properly. If you buy a laptop under 26k and you want processor like 35k laptops then forget it.Under 26k it is very good laptop having slim and stylish design overall i would suggest u that you can buy this laptop.
2,"At such price the laptop is good for basic office work and some online browsing work. Also good for students for online learning, teaching.Please verify first while purchasing the device for compatibility of software you are going to use.Also the warranty mentioned is from 28th September 2020 to 27th September 2021. But the device is purchased on 17th October 2020. And on 18th October after it received I have completed the first time registration process. So warrenty is there.Also after two days of use the battery life is about 2 hours for full charge."
4,"This laptap is version old,but work as we simple needs,battery back up is only 4 hours.looking good, amazing audio quality is best.good key pad. Windows work nice. Disc not devided.design is good."
1,"I brought this laptop and after just 10-12 days this laptop started showing slowness. It takes 20 minutes to just start and then you can start working.Its worst than our desktop of year 1999-2000 eraWhen I tried checking the issue it’s showing disk utilisation 100% while I am having less than 100gb data in 1 TB CAPACITY hdd.I have Mcafee Total protection license to protect this device which is recommended by Lenovo themselves.I will never ever recommend such a useless product to even my enemy.I have all laptops till date I brought from Lenovo but after this experience I must say I feel like getting cheated by LENOVO and dealer.Its better not to sale such products which are not worth using a day.DO NOT BUY EVEN YOU DONT CARE ABOUT MONEY, it’s as good as you are buying garbage for 22K."
4,Laptop was awsome.packaging was good. .at this price range below 26k it's a best laptop.thank you Amazon.
3,"It was said it has ms office home and Student 2019 but it was not there in the laptop only the trial version given then I had to contact lenovo and microsoft for this, microsoft said that they need ms office home & student 2019 mentioned on the invoice also as on the invoice amazon has mentioned only ms office 2019. I faced lot of problems because of this u had to continuously call amazon, lenovo, microsoft on this issue. amazon was not ready to provide any confirmation at first whether it had ms office 2019 the finally after calling for two days I found one customer care executive in leadership team who helped me by sending me a mail which included all the details of the laptop plus she mentioned it has ms office home and Student 2019 then the prob got solved by the microsoft had to even fight with Microsoft too on this issue as it's not the customer's mistake that they trusted amazon. I'm buying it from Amazon not from a lenovo outlet. This caused me lot of problems and tension as they give only 7 days time for return/replacement also. Very bad service by Amazon but that Amazon's leadership executive's service was amazing I gave her five stars. And the laptop is very very slow it hangs also be careful before buying it."
4,Good laptop.Battery comes around 5hrs normal usage.Full charge from 10 to 100 takes around 2hrs.Performance is good.Looks premium.Boots very fast no lags.Overall good laptop.
4,"I bought this laptop for basic home tasks like Ms office, browsing and entertainment. Definitely no gaming purpose . So don't go for gaming although it has graphics AMD Radeon.Pros-1. Convenient keyboard. Love it.2. Dolby audio is superb.3. Usb 3.0 port4. 15.6 hd plus Good display5. Comes with pre installed ms office6. Light weight.7. Doesn't heat up excessively.8. Lenovo Vantage app is great.Cons-1. All usb ports are on left side as in photo but will do.2. Front cam is vga. Very poor quality3. Battery is inbuilt. Cannot detach without an expert4. Battery is average. Don't expect too long to last. Maximum 3-4hrs on continuous usage.5. Multi tasking is ok but not very good.It is a value for money laptop when bought in Great indian festival."
4,"Does all the jobs efficiently,  as expected, Win10 OS, Office packaged is very nicely.Go for it & unpack and start using, to do your daily routine workNice to have : RAM 8 GB, and SSD options"
2,"Good...Light weightBad...Keypad buttons have got exchanged , @ functions from "" and "" functions from @.Extremely slow in booting up with very little data and applications installed. Kind of hangs very frequentlyDisappointed but continuing......Better to buy from a shop where all functions can be checked before deciding a purchase"
1,"The worst laptop I ever seen in life, waste of time and money."
4,Good product according to this price range
2,Sound quality is real bad.. the sound start distorting and buzzing while playing videos on youtube or scrolling through the window..
3,It is good laptop but processor is bit slow. It's good for students but not for office going persons.
5,It was a gift to someone.  They loved it. Good product with OS And OFFICE
5,I got this product 1 month ago. Packing and delivery was excellent. Laptop is still working amazing. I am using Microsoft teams on it and I have downloaded many apps on it. Preloaded office and widows 10 is makes it very efficient. At the starting the password is must according to the laptop and makes it very secure.battery lasts for 5hr. It gets fully charged in 2hr.Must take.
1,Very slow. It a new laptop and mouse moves so slow looks like its not maintained ever. Win 10 is one of problem but config also a part of issue. Will never by lenovo again. Tip: go for laptop with SSD
5,From 4gb built in ram hardly 1 - 1.2 gb is free even when only single application is running. System hangs with continuous usage of 2hrs or if multiple applications are running. With additional 4gb ram laptop is working perfectly fine and response time is improved significantly. By getting additional ram for around 1.4k this laptop is still the best deal at 26k.
3,In this laptop how to install Microsoft office
1,Stopped working within 10 days. The lenovo service center in gurgaon is pathetic. Regretting the decision to buy this
5,I bought it on 05 August 2020. After almost two  months of use no issue...very good for kids in school as a beginner platform. keyboard keys are good...looks are sleek...customer care is world class. Awesome product.
1,Extremely slow and lags when you run teams on it
1,"Extremely slow machine. Bought it for my grade 3 daughter who runs only TEAMS on this laptop for online classes. It run slow, keeps hangin and takes almost 5-10 minutes to start up and/or start apps. Very disappointed."
1,"worst purchase ever. I am not happy with the product and Amazon's service .  I really don't wanna keep the product but as per policy i have to keep it. I don't think so that I'm gonna buy anything again from Amazon,  I'm really very disappointed. I really want that Amazon resolve my issue regarding this product."
1,Worst product Having issue with  using headphones  in this laptop I gone to the service center they told me ou have to reset this laptop if you have any issue with it. Dnt buy this product anymore
1,Hey!When I was formatting my pc....it's not working and to stop this I shut it down using the power button and now it is showing the logo and then appears black screen? What to do...pls make a video or help by text!!
1,automatic start when cover open. Why this happened?
4,Nice laptop god quality easy to carry over all god but I am facing small problem some time when I play video or movie in VLC player hangging that one problem not satisfied others wise overall good laptop 🙂⭐⭐⭐⭐
5,High quality product  with best  keypad
3,"Not bad have been using it for a week installed all the daily softwares, office works nicely, bit slow sometimes when excessive tabs are open, but overall its an ok product, packaging was nice too.( if i3 was included this would have been a awesome machine)"
1,Its not i3 dur to this performance is low...it hang although it has 1tb space. When I asked them to replace it on a very 1st day they denied. I wasted almost 26500₹ if I have been told i would have added 3000₹ more and get i3
5,Woow I found this easy to use ofcourse there r better laptops but this one is awesome. Light weight n battery backup is the main thing they r too good 😍😍♥️just loved it
5,"Okay! Let me get straight into the Teardown review of this laptop as the rest of everything can be found on the internetFirst of all, This is the New Lenovo Thinkpad E14 Gen.2 and not Gen.1. Below are the few upgrades you'll notice right away.1. 1920x1080 Full HD IPS Panel (250 nits max brightness)2. Extra M.2 Slot for up to 1TB of Additional SSD3. Extra RAM Slot for up to 16GB of Additional RAMNow, Coming back to the laptop itself.It comes with Windows 10 Home single language out of the box along with Microsoft Office 2019 Students and Home. You'll need to Activate the Office with a Microsoft account. Upon starting any of the Office Apps you'll be prompted for the registration post which Office 2019 will be activated in your account.The first and foremost thing I'd recommend anyone is to log in with Lenovo Vantage and Register the product with the Product ID as many of them are facing a Product Registration Issue which can be resolved after 24 hours of you registering the product with Lenovo. The warranty of the Laptop will then be counted from the date of your purchase.Coming back to the internals of the Laptop. It is equipped with 256GB of PCIe Nvme SSD (WD SN530 2242) which can be upgraded to 512GB as per Lenovo's Website but I'd highly recommend adding in an extra SSD based upon your needs. Also, I've attached CrystalDiskMark benchmarks of the included SSD.Now to the selling factor of this Laptop. Ryzen 5 4500U. As per the Cinebench R23 results the Processor blows off Intel 11th Gen i7-1165G7 out of waters by achieving a score of 5500 (In my test) which is far more capable of any office or students based task.The Speakers are also from Harman and got to say when it gets pretty loud and punchy.The only con I found so far was the Keyboard not being Backlit for the Indian SKU.However, Everything from the Fingerprint sensor to the Battery Life everything is on par with the mentioned description. In my day-to-day usage, I'm getting a battery life of around 6 to 7 hours with 60 - 70% Brightness and Laptop set on Better Battery Mode.To conclude, I would only say one thing to not think twice about which Ryzen 5 Laptop to buy and buy this one without thinking twice or waiting for the Sale to arrive or the Price to drop. You may never know when it may go out of stock and never come back (lol just kidding). Also, If you've read so far clicking on the Helpful button would be sweet :)P.S The Laptop can be also charged from a USB C PD supported power banks and wall adapter.Review Update Regarding the SSD upgrade. Due to some weird reason WD (Western Digital) nvme SSD are not supported in the laptop I tried with SN550 (500GB and 1TB Both) After researching the entire internet I found no working solution so I had to return back the SSD.Then I decided to go for Crucial P1 SSD which upon installing directly got detected into Disk Management and Device Manager in the very first attempt. So I'd highly recommend to go to Crucial SSD over WD SSD for this particular model.Adding this after the Ryzen 5 Pro (4650U) variant was added.Please Note only RYZEN 5 4500U has IPS Display. RYZEN 5 4650U has TN Panel!!!"
5,"Pros1) Upgradability.Western Digital SSD instead of global Toshiba ones.. really good, but only 236 GB out of which your initial windows setup would eat some 50 GB,Anyways pump in a new one, additional slot present.1 Upgradable ram slot unlike other criminals who solder you with 8gb with a Ryzen 4500u2) Fingerprint is dope goodBattery life is good.Keyboard is omg turu loveeeeTouchpad hmm ok.3) 4500u is brilliant, efficient thermals too.4) light weight considering the well built chassis.5) sound is good as per my needs.Cons1) screen could have been better in colour gamut reproduction, anyways not much complaints, not using for any photo video works.IPS panel, good for coders.Tweak amd brightness settings else it would be locked at 100 nits when on battery.250 nits is fine.2) no backlight on keyboard..i thought it would be same as foreign models... anyways i can type in dark_____________________________________The Indian variant instead of windows 10 pro comes with home single language and office 2019 home and studentGood deal in a few ways.Installing linux was a slight pain...typical secureboot EFI issues, no biggie.This is a good bargain at 46k, if you know your tradeoffs. :)---------------------------------------------------------------------One important thing to note would be the warranty.Old*My laptops warranty started 7 days before the day I opened the box.That was the system setup date, which I found when saw windows folderSo please check your device' warranty stuffs too from lenovo vantage, your mileage might vary*_-----_NewUpdate now warranty starts on the actual date.. After registration I guess"
5,"Bought this lappy @37k with exchange of my 9yrs old i3 Ideapad and I can say this is best deal I've ever got. Now talking about Thinkpad e14 gen 2 Ryzen 5 4500U , it is way more superior than contemporary thinkpad i5 models. i5 got 4 cores but Ryzen 5 4500U got 6 cores.Build quality : sturdy , compact as same as thinkpad other version. Pre-install Win10 home edition ,MS office is trial one however asked for Credit Card Details.One disappointment :  keyboard is not backlit one which I was looking for.Go for this spec rather than intel i3/i5."
5,"Ryzen 5 4500u is fast and power efficient much better than i5 or even i7. SSD is WD also very good,  ram is samsung 8 gb 3200 mhz, screen is not color acurate only 45% CG but its good for general use, keyboard is non backlit, it has extra ssd & ram slot. It could be best option for developers if it come without crap windows.  It come with premier onsite support.There are so many variant in thinkpad e14, it seems diffrent from i5 version in term of build quality. Some version come with better build quality, backlit keyboard etc.. but it seems has much better sound as compared to i5 version. Sound quality is very good"
1,"The laptop is great, but the seller is intentionally misleading regarding the display type. It's a TN display, and therefore has washed out colours and bad vertical viewing angles. All the reviews that mention that it is an IPS display is for the 4500U model, which had an IPS display apparently. Buyer beware!"
3,This laptop is amazing at this price range as far as performance is concerned. But the hardware quality is low as compared to other Thinkpad models. Maybe the product I got has the manufacturing date in Nov. 2020 and I got the latest piece. No backlight keyboard is the biggest drawback of this model. the keyboard doesn't meet ThinkPad standards. I can easily identify the difference as I have already used the Thinkpad series in my office.Performance: It is amazing in this price range. Ryzen 5 is pretty fast. I can do all the office work along with the use of some heavy software. 8GB RAM can be an issue for some of the buyers.Front camera: Worst. Even my 5 years old laptop has better camera quality.Booting time and read-write speed: Pretty fastOverall if you are a performance-oriented person then this laptop is fine despite a few drawbacks. But the price range is pretty low and you are getting Ryzen 5 in 45K. So worth the price range.
1,"I really feel cheated. This is a TN panel, not an IPS panel. Please check the viewing angles. The product that has been reviewed earlier in the same product pages say IPS. If they are changing something, why isn't it pointed out earlier?"
5,"Superfast Booting and Long battery life, I used this Thinkpad Laptop( Normal usage, no Movie/ Audio) on battery for 8 hours and my battery power still was left around 30% , dam good, display is fantastic and Nice and Loud Sound from Harman,One thing that I notice that Laptop Warranty was already started (20 days before the Purchase date) , so I wrote to Leveno about this on their website in product registry page and they asked me to iolaod the purchase invoice and I did that and within 24 hours the Warrenty of laptop was revised with the my purchase date. (In their website it is mentioned that the Warrenty may start early sometime when Vendor or Retailer purchase it in bulk and then sell it to end user but Leveno correct this once you see the difference and raise it to then with Purchase Invoice).Full time Licence Windows 10 and Office 2019 student version.What are you waiting for guys, Go and Grab this Beast before its gone ( as I see this model is very fast moving and get out of stock in few hours).Hope you found my review useful  thanks."
4,"Pros-SturdyFast connectivityFast processingQuick to bootImpressive technical specsGood audio qualityBeautiful machine.Quiet.(Do remember, pros are with respect to class. For the money you've paid, you are getting a good deal)Cons -BrightnessLimited ports. You'd need an external memory card reader. Otherwise, yeah, isn't really a deal breaker but one extra usb port would have been awesome.Going to list a con but I think that's for windows and not for drivers but somehow many software installation dialog boxes are blurry. I have scaled it to 125% and that has helped but I don't know whose problem this really is.Also, damn, the battery settings are complex. You can't just keep it simple now a days like windows 7 or 8 where you could choose between - save battery, lower brightness and performance OR high performannce and increased brightness plugged in.And one last con.. again not sure lenovo or Amazon .. but here is the thing, back in 2008, I bought my first laptop, lenovo y41077578cq and it came with a nice bag.Then in 2013 I bought lenovo essential g505s and I got a bag too.Now in almost 2021 I bought a laptop and I just got that despite shedding 45k .. I mean throwing in one or two accessories would be great. A bag atleast. All I got was laptop. That's all. I mean it's fine, but whatever happened to the extra goodies. Even my grocery vendors throws in some lemons and coriander with main vegetables"
5,"Great all-round performance. So let me start with what the problems could be with this machine. First is, it does not have a backlit keyboard. Second is, it ships with a 256 GB SSD (There's an empty SSD slot but it didn't work for me)Design: The laptop looks premium. The bezels are reasonable for a laptop in 2020. The top lid has 2 brands though, Lenovo and Thinkpad. The size is pretty compact for a 14 inch laptop. It comes with a fingerprint scanner built into the power button.Ports: It has a USB-C port with power delivery, making it possible for you to travel with it with just your phone charger. However, there are only 2 USB type A ports, out of which, only one is USB 3.1Display: It comes with a beautiful 1080p IPS display. The screen brightness is pretty good when plugged-in. However, when the laptop is running on battery, it doesn't go very bright, making it difficult to work in outdoor conditions.Keyboard and touchpad: Keyboard is frankly quite amazing. The layout is a little different and gets a little getting used to. It doesn't however have an right click (menu) key.Performance: 4500U processor performs really well. With a reasonably heavy load while coding or handling large amounts of data, it doesn't get bogged down. Also, the fans run absolutely silent during regular web-browsing, running an IDE, playing videos etc. While gaming, it performs fairly well on last gen games (2013-2019) with 40-50 fps in the couple of games I threw on (Hitman and NFS Rivals). I noticed a significant bump in performance when I upgraded to 16 GB RAM (it ships with 8GB and you can buy another 8 GB for 3-3.5K). Long story short, you should upgrade the RAM if you want to play any games.Battery Life: Honestly, the battery life is pretty amazing. Even with a 45Wh battery, it goes on for 7 hours at 'Better Battery' mode (I have attached Battery Report generated by Windows with the review). In real world usage, I get 10 hours of battery life with medium brightness with regular productivity tasks, like web browsing, sending emails etc.Build quality: The build quality is great. The Thinkpad E14 Gen 2 in India ships with top lid made of metal and the rest of the body made of plastic (but good solid plastic). However, by Thinkpad standards, the build quality is below average.Bottom line: For 46k (or even 57k) it's a great deal. You get a fast processor, upgradable RAM and SSD, great build quality, USB-C charging and decent display making it a great work-horse."
1,"system suddenly stopped booting. Lenevo CC replace mother board. Now windows are not getting installed. At the end of OS install, it ask you to connect with wifi. After wifi it try to connect Microsoft and fails. Lenevo engineer has visited 4 times but no help yet.Lenevo is saying its not their fault as hardware has no problem and I need to reach to Microsoft. Microsoft says they can't help as my laptop doesn't go online and nothing is registered with my name/mail id with them so they can not do anything.So theoretically, I am blocked and have wasted my money.After lots of discussion, they lento agreed to some engineer again to look.So please be careful if you are buying Lenevo.I will keep this thread updated."
4,"The laptops good for work. Only a couple of issues -1. No backlight on the keyboard2. Its heavy, dont expect a macbook air3. Its plastic, but solid4. Touch pad is good, but not in the same ballpark as a macbook. All gestures work fine.Awesome things:1. Upgradable ram2. Upgradable storage3. epic keyboard4. Good battery life5. 13.3 in laptop size (you can easily fit it inside an amazon basic 13 in sleeve)"
5,My initial impressions:1. This is a pretty cool laptop. It doesn't heat up that much even on 100% cpu load.2. Boots up really fast. (4-5 seconds)3. Display is more than decent given the price. Don't whine. You get what you pay for. I am getting a bit of backlight bleeding at full brightness but it's typical of most of IPS display. Viewing angles are decent. I don't see a lot of colour shifting.4. Build quality is amazing. There's a mix of aluminium and plastic. Good quality plastic nevertheless.5. It's too heavy for my liking. But it's almost a non-issue.6. I was quite surprised by the sound quality which is pretty crisp and loud.7. Battery lasts me about 8 hours with WiFi on.8. Trackpad is pretty average.If your budget is around 55k this should be your definite pick.
5,"Guys, if you are here then you already know about Ryzen 4000 series. My god, I am in love with this one but unfortunately I bought ThinkBook 14 just three days ago, I am so pissed.Best Specs combination having Ryzen 5 4500u, Samsung SSD (I guess) with 3.5 GBps read/write speeds, IPS FHD Panel, ThinkPad Model. It is just Wowzaa..Close your eyes and click the buy button."
5,"1. Bought this for my daughter for her online classes. She absolutely loves it.2. Very fast bootup. SSD does make a difference3. Seamless installation experience. Comes preloaded with Windows and MS office4. Brightness is good. Good experience even while watching movies on Amazon Prime5. Sound is excellent6. Thickness: manageable7. Current gen processor at an affordable price. I was in a dilemma as to whether to go for slightly cheaper older gen Ryzen 5 processor or 11th gen i3. Am happy with this choice so far8. Battery life is good.I am a picky buyer and researched a lot before buying. If you are looking for a good performance vs price tradeoff and decent laptop for home usage, I would highly recommend this."
2,"TL;DR: MSI Modern 14 with 300 nits display, 512GB SSD, bigger 52WHr battery, backlit keyboard, lighter (1.3 kg) and similar build quality is a better buy. MSI's service will also be better as they have switched to same vendor which does service of Asus products.Got this for ₹46000 (-₹2300 SBI Yono Cashback) in December, 2020 i.e. first lot.Laptop is decent for the price. Ryzen 4500u clearly outperforms 10th and 11th gen Core i5. RAM and Storage are upgradable too. Display is a mediocre 250 nits LG panel which is fine for the time being, I may upgrade it after few years. Build quality is decent. 256GB is too less. Battery life is anywhere between 5-6 hours which is okay, nothing extraordinary.The laptop got hang-ed a few times while playing Genshin, which is odd considering its a Hexa core processor so shouldn't hang at all. (4 stars)Lenovo customer support is outright pathetic. I wanted to purchase Extended Warranty and didn't know that Thinkpads have their own website (other than the Lenovo's) to purchase it. First I tried the usual Lenovo sites (buyalenovo.com/register), then I contacted (called and mailed) their customer support numerous times and they couldn't reply even after a month.Then when I tweeted to Lenovo India, they shared the site (lenovowarranty.in) but told me since a month had passed I won't get the offer price (3 year EW+ADP for ₹3500), and will have to pay ₹12000 for EW and ₹8000 for ADP. So I am supposed to pay 6 times because their own Premier Customer support couldn't tell me the correct site within the said period. Wow. (-2 stars)"
5,"Best laptop under Rs. 50,000 Period.One thing you should do after getting this is to turn of the vari-bright setting from amd radeon software. It changes the monitor gamma settings to compensate for the brightness. It is very jarring and weird. Over all a beast.Edit: When you go for a RAM upgrade for for a 3200MHz CL-22 model."
4,"Product is no doubt awesome. Pros - ryzen 5 4500u processorBuild qualitySecurityUpgradable ram upto 24gbFast charging and good battery backup.Fingerprint sensor.Cons - no backlit keyboard14 inchBrightness is little bit lowOnly 256gb ssd.The warranty is showing only for 11 months. (From 18/12/2020, though I order it on 2nd Jan and received it on 7th January 2021)I bought it for 49990.(As middle class people can't afford a credit card. So therefore no discounts)It seems quite durable. (Good for long run)4 starts because I had to pay 4 thousands more than the original price."
5,"If your budget is under 50k. Purchase this laptop with eyes closed. Yes, it doesnt have backlit keyboard. Except for that, everything else seems great.Pros:Sturdy build qualityGreat brand. If you are in corporate and want to be taken seriously, appear with a thinkpad, not with an Ac*rIt has shutter that can keep camera off. You can use that in meetings when you are too lazy to get up from bed but unsure whether camera is accidentally onFast booting speedFinger biometric ensures you never need to remember/ enter password while opening laptopGreat processor, few say it's better than i7Full hd displayGenuine office free for life. Count this blessing. It looks awkward when you are making that presentation and red bar appears. Also with genuine office  upgrades will keep coming.Fast USB ensures quick data transferGreat speakers. Sound reproduction is excellentBuilt in Dolby. Additional blessing.Hard drive is ssd. It means fast booting and writing.The current version that is being shipped is gen2 e14. People say they bought it at 45k. That was gen1 model. This gen2 was launched this April only."
4,"the 2021 model when i purchased was priced 53k and within a week it got reduced to 50k. So I really felt upset and amazon won't match the price.Regarding thinkpad:Pros:It is a light weight machine. Battery life is great. AMD 4650u any day beats i5 low power 10 or 11 gen. 6 cores and 12 threads gives performance a boost. Also 3200Mhz ddr4 ram and 256gb nvme ssd makes it a super powerful machine. Also one extra ram slot and extra nvme slot for ssd is there.Keyboard is non backlit but a thinkpad keyboard, which makes typing a charm. Camera cover and fingerprint scanner is also good addition. Not much noise of fan and not much heating issue. But the vent is in bottom not in sides.USB c based charging.MS Office 2019 full version included.Cons:One USB 2 port. Why in 2021 usb2 port ?The display is TN not ips.The display cover i think is polycarbonate not aluminium.The speaker sound is just okay and also bottom firing."
5,First of all I love thinkpad sturdy design. Not the best we can say in e14 series but it will definitely not disappoint you in any aspect of build and premium quality under 46k segment laptop.Pros:Fast boot up thanks to SSDLatest AMD series Processor (hexa core) at this priceNarrow bezzel (Screen to body ratio)Sound quality is amazingThinkpad keyboard (loved to work)Touch pad (if you used of it)Battery life : 7-8 hours ease with regular stuff (not experienced with gaming stuff as I am not gaming lover)Cons:256gb storage (quite better with upgradable storage slot)No backlit keyboardIf you can upgrade this machine with extra ssd slot for storage it will become beast and will definitely not going to disappoint you in any aspect!! Big Yesssss to this machine in 2021!!
5,"First of all, a big thank you to all those who have given insightful feedback about this laptop.I have been using this device for a week now and I'll talk about the negatives of the laptop first, so that those who are specific can look somewhere else.Display - The screen is not very color accurate. Color gamut is terrible and, though slightly, this does impact media consumption. Although the screen is matte, the quality is not that good - I was able to see the reflection of my room's tube light on my screen. Also, I find the screen to be on a warmer side by default but after tweaking it from AMD Radeon Software it looked better. This is basically the ONLY negative I could find in this laptop. That said, it's not a big deal as readability is pretty good and colors won't be much of an issue.Software Bugs - Small bugs like brightness wouldn't change sometimes using the buttons or internally through software but a restart resolves this. Sometimes laptop's screen doesn't wake up from sleep.Now, Positives...it has a lot of them!Performance - 5/5 (great at multitasking and handling load).Build quality is great at this price point, the laptop feels very sturdy.Input devices - just amazing (slightly below the high-end Thinkpad level devices).Thermals excellent. One exciting thing is that the fan is inaudible in multitasking as well! I ran 6 apps in parallel and audio in background and I couldn't hear the fan at all.Speakers - great for normal use. Battery life - I was able to get 6-7 hours in casual surfing, listening and  making a couple of docs and ppts.Fingerprint - Works 9/10 times. Pretty reliable.Upgradeable Memory - Although 8 GB RAM is going to be sufficient for most of us, the laptop can be upgraded to 24 GB. 256 GB SSD is not a lot but its easy to get into this laptop and upgrade that as well, when required.As stated by others as well, warranty was backdated on the device; for me it was a month earlier. Check it on Warranty Lookup on Lenovo's website and reach out to the company to get it corrected.I was confused about my purchase decision at first. I was not sure if I wanted a costlier device or would this do, but I am totally satisfied and can easily recommend this device."
5,"Under 50k, It is the best one. Got the Ryzen 4650U model.I have read about the change in the display panel but it is not impacting me much.Performance is top class - I felt it better than my 10th gen i7 Lenovo Legion.Battery life - Amazing - Giving more than 10 hours with 50% brightness.256 GB SSD is bit less, But something compromised for the price."
4,It's a very good laptop. I had an issue with ms office. Lenovo premier support has resolved the issue today. Now I am satisfied with this laptop.
5,"cons: its slow..i thought it would be good but.. unfortunately it's not as expected... but ok boots up in 30 sec - too slow for ssd, finger print sensor not works properly. battery over heats when kept charging,pros: battery back up is good comes for almost 5-6 hours ,battery fills up super quickly. build quality is superior,  only product in this price range with these specs (i brought at 47.5k in feb 2021).I recommend to buy."
5,"10 out of 5 stars.... YES... read belowAmazing laptop - Balance Specs, performance & quality. Get one for yourself before it goes out of stock0. RAM is Upgradable, 8gb on-board, add 16 to make 24Gb(3200mhZ). IdeaPad not upgradable RAMs1. AMD Ryzen is far better than Intel. Don't buy Intel unless you understand Specs. AMD Ryzen 5 beats i7-10th Gen too.2. Power efficient, battery backup: 6-10 hours on mixed usage.4. Fingerprint is damn fast & keyBoard is great.********RIP Intel.... Bye Bye Intel ******Nothing else required in this price range. I'm happy & satisied. The perfect laptop .Note: My 2nd laptop after Sony VAIO 2011, after 10 years AMD is the game changer & leader in Chipsets. Intel fooled us for decade.Please dont expect gaming performance, get a gaming pc/laptop instead, HP & dell still selling Ryzen 3500 series & intel i5 for 65K with no RAM Slot, grapics.Far better than Intel i3 or i5, AMD Ryzen 5 beats i7 10th Gens too.14' suits for portability and work where you want. get extended warranty from lenovo, better for long term support.Demand is for AMD, Laptop companies are dumping/selling Intel Chipsets in India & other countries."
5,"Excellent - If this laptop has to be described in one word after using the laptop for more than 2 months.Build Quality - Top notch, made of  military grade material, so don't need to worry about spills and drops.Brightness - The brightness level suits for indoors and can be adjusted through Radeon graphics setting for better brightness outdoors.Keyboard - Works like breeze. You will fall in love with the keyboard even if you need to type long hours. The Fn and Ctrl keys are interchanged, so it can be uncomfortable initially. Can be changed from the BIOS setting or the Lenovo Vantage app if needed . Unfortunately it is not backlit keyboard.Performance - I am not a gamer or use it for intensive programming to test the power of the processor. I am pretty happy for my regular home use.Specs - The boot and shutdown time is quick, thanks to the 256GB SSD( would have preferred a 512gb instead). 14 inch IPS display is good enough and the color levels are accurate. Comes with 8GB RAM which is the bare minimum needed these days. It is not soldered to the Motherboard and is expandable.Battery Life - If you run on Battery Saver mode, you can easily get 8-9 hours depends on what and how many applications are running.Cost - Thanks to the AMD processor, Ryzen 5 cost me 47999 and it is absolute bang for buck for this silent laptop. Would have had to shell out 10-15k more if I chose Intel i5 for the same configuration."
1,"I doubt about it's genuineness. Also the LAN port slot bottom is moving and shaking. Is it by design? I have used Thinkpad from Office, the LAN port plastic will not move.  I am wondering if I need to return this or not?"
5,Worth the price... Fully satisfied... Specifications as shown..... The same laptop is around 72000 with intel i5 and graphic card... Because of branding... I suggest to do your own research b/w ryzen and intel... And come to your own conclusion...The best thing is that... Ram and storage is upgradable in future...I would recommend it 100%...
5,"Got it for 50k, have to say it is the best laptop one can get at this price point.Build quality is amazing, top is aluminium finish while remaining body is plastic but it is hard plastic and there is no flexing at all.It has Ryzen 5 4500u, so performance is silky smooth, boot times are fast 5-6 seconds, display quality is amazing as well plus sound output is absolutely dope.Lastly, what this deal at 50k sweeter is the ability to upgrade both SDD and RAM in this laptop, at similar price and spec the Asus Vivobook 4500u doesn't provide this option.So if you are looking for a good laptop, you should certainly go for it, plus if you've old laptop you can exchange it and reduce your overall purchase price even more.Amazing deal at 50k - 10k for 4th gen Intel Dell Inspiron."
4,"I'll list the pros first1. It's a thinkpad. Great build quality and awesome keyboard ( I have a ThinkPad L440 which haven't failed me even once)2. Ryzen 5 4500u, great processor. 3200 mhz ram. Nvme storage (mi notebook doesn't give it)3. Power delivery, think shutter, RJ-45 port, spill resistant keyboard, upgradeable RAM and ssd, good battery lifeCons:1. Heating issue: even running online classes on chrome makes the CPU temperature hit 66 degrees which is quite bad (I had taken a pic of the system diagonstics right after the class). I've noticed that this heating issue is more prevalent when the laptop is plugged in. While running even light games, the temperatures hit 75+ which is real bad for the health of the laptop. Lenovo should have taken more care about the thermals. These temperatures are too high for a laptop using a 7 nm processor.2. There's backlight bleeding, but I personally don't find it much of an issue.3. The left usb port is too tight. So tight that it is impossible to pull out a usb stick without some really strong pull. This is bad because it can cause harm to external HDDs due to accidental shakes. Especially since this laptop has only 256 gb storage."
5,"Here are some pros and cons I foundPros.Ryzen 5 killed it! -Being a heavy user, I use very heavy software like Android Studio, Adobe Premier Pro, etc and trust me it runs butter smooth considering the size of the laptop. I didn't played any game yet I think you'll get 45-60 fps on low-medium settingsSSD - It's blazing fast. Loads windows in just 3 seconds. I got read speeds of upto 2 gbps and write 1.6 gbps.Display -Well it gets complicated here, when I first turned it on, the display was a little more on the yellowish side and brightness was too low. However, I fixed both of them in the AMD graphics  setting.BTW. if yours brightness is also, just turn off vari-brightness in AMD graphics settings.After fixing the issues its gorgeous! IPS panel so no color loss, color gamut is good(not great but much better than other laptops in this price) brightness could be a little betted but it's  ok for me.Other things I liked are -There is a webcam shutter (BTW webcam is great)Fingerprint sensorDevice EncryptionBall pointer mouse (Those who can't understand the need for this, Many coders like me use 95% of pc using keyboard so it just make it convenient if you suddenly need the mouse out of no where.Upgradable ( A big plus point you can install upto 24gb of ram and one more m.2 drive)Cons -  : (The front body is not great, its a little matte (idk but maybe its to protect from accidental damage)Keyboard (Good for basic typing but I type 180 WPM so I feel a little discomfort.Could have back-lit keyboardElse everything is great.Finally,  This laptop is great for me and checks all my need but if you are a graphics designer, I suggest  lenovo flex-5 (has the same processor)"
5,"This is a perfect laptop for most affordable price. I have been longing to buy a thinkpad but they always have been on expensive side because of their build quality. This particular deal got me thinkpad for 45990 for a ryzen 5 processor and 256gb ssd. After doing a lot of search, I realised that ryzen processors r better than intel i5 10th gen and few of i7 processors also. i was looking for a bigger ssd memory than normal hdd. and there i found this amazing combination which was pocket friendly and had all specs i was looking for. Its upgradable to 24GB ram with 16gb ram in slot 2 and 1TB SSD with another free ssd slot."
5,"ProsBuild quality, nice grade plastic, has a metal sheet below panel, overall sturdyLove the size of touchpad, the two buttons, really nice to do the work efficientlyThinkPad keyboard reputation precedes itPersonally love the colorAmazing battery life, should do certain tweaks disabling background apps and all (my unit showed an estimate of 11hrs at 80% with light usage...I haven't tested the same but am confident getting apprpx 8hr on an avg would be it)180⁰ screen angle option is there (see 3rd image)Ryzen 5 4500u beating the intel alternative by a great margin, 8gb ram with upgrade option, I literally didn't find a non gaming laptop offering more than 8gb option or an upgrade option, I personally got another 8gigs added along with a 500gb ssd, so in 46+11k you get a beast configuration of R5 4500u + 756 gb ssd + 16gb ramWhere the brands just offering 8gb soldered in 65kWeight is perfect for office/student lifeAlso has a cute little camera privacy shutter integrated, little details adding great valueFinally, a fingerprint scanner integrated in the power button working like a charm ding ding ding <3ConsWell, I am mesmerized by the unit so can't say much bad of it....just an addition of a backlit keyboard would be great and the placement of left ctrl key towards left most... well its ThinkPad's design so not really a con but yeah some people could be botheredConclusion: Killer non gaming laptop on 31 Jan 21, probably the best considering upgrade options"
5,"This is the best laptop in its price segment. I had this issue where if your laptop is running on battery, it will automatically change its screen brightness. Even reviewers were showing the same issue. Turns out you have to turn off the auto screen brightness(Vari-Bright) in Radeon Software.And yes you have to turn it off manually. It is on by default."
4,"It works as intended, everything runs smooth and as expectedthe only problem is that it heats up quite a bit while charging, this can be solved easily by keeping it on a laptop stand tho, even without any fans is okay, it just needs some air to suck upOther than that amazing laptop which I will use for many years to come as thinkpad durability suggestsThe lights (the one on escape, mute and mic keys) don't work correctly as soon as you open up the laptopso make sure to update the bios and just update the pc up-to-date for the best experienceNot like other reviews but one thing is for sure that you won't regret this purchase imo for the price as low it is atm i.e. 49k without any exchange"
5,"I bought it for a bit less than the price on the site, I'll be honest I usually use it for a bit of coding and work, other than that play valorant maybe a couple of times a week and watch Netflix. For these use cases I find it a bit overpowered, the battery life is just amazing, the display quality is okay I guess for the price I wouldn't complaint. Then the performance, well Ryzen kills it and the SSD is also on par with most in the price range.Pros:BatteryPerformanceBuild QualityCons:Display ( if you don't mind the colour saturation)PortsStorage (but the only SSD can be replaced with a different one, tho you'll have to transfer the data from old one somehow with the OS or reinstall OS again on the new one)"
4,"ThinkPad is for professionals for work purposes. It is not targeted for Movie Buffs or Audiophilesor Gamers. Please remember this when you buy any ThinkPad products.The product is Sturdy, Slim, light weight. Has excellent build quality. Performance looks quite good (fast booting)The in built speakers are average. Don't expect very loud sound.The display is the weakest part of this device. It looks quite dull to the extent of even a bit dirty if you are used to glossy IPS LCD screens. Videos look a bit washed out in colours. I have removed 1 star exclusively due to its display panel (TN Panel)But I'd you intend to use it for office purpose or educational purposes and want a sturdy, long lasting, value for money device - then this is it!"
5,Good spec.Amd ryzen is very efficientbattery life is excellentEasily portableWorth for every penny paidExtremely powerful for daily tasks
5,Brilliant machine with amazing specifications. This should be priced more than 55k.Pros:Battery back up.Build quality.Processor.Thunderbolt port.Sound level and quality.Keyboard and tracker.Mouse pad.Cons:Brightness though it is fine for indoor usage.Backlit keyboard.
1,"I needed a laptop on an urgent basis so bought this but the System crashes all the time. Screen freezes too. My 5 yr old laptop works better than this one. Amazon has booked a technician's visit, I hope i do get a replacement or refund."
1,I bought a new Acer Aspire 3 just 2 days back from Amazon and it's not working properly System hangs while using. It's hangs while opening tabs. Takes more than 1-2 mins to open. This is my new laptop with my first salary and it is showing lots of defects.
5,I have purchased it from acer website.It is 30000 there.U can purchase it. The item will come from blue dart within 10 days. I got I a week.Good laptop
1,Laptop was good for only one month. One day it gets dead and not switching on and taking power.Cannot return..Amazon not taking it back...as return period is over..Totally disappointed from amazon. They should have provided technical assistance for repair. Telling me to contact seller.
1,Very upset with the Amazon replacement policy... The technician will come and then check and then recommend for a replacement.  So why to buy from Amazon better to buy from a Retail shopThe model I purchased yesterday with screen going blank after 30 min.... Also after 24hrs the web cam is showing dark images even after adjusting with Manual or auto mode.....
1,"This laptop comes with WIN 10, 4GB DDR 4GB RAM.This is absolutely a nonsense. It cannot run more than one app at a time. Even google chrome freezes and takes ages to access any app. After windows Update the laptop stopped working."
1,"The 4 GB RAM is just insufficient , guys please do not buy this , simple chrome and firebox , YouTube takes 80 percentage of your ram , just uselessGuys please please don't buy this laptop , it's jist 4 GB of ram and acer has done a bad job of optimizing stuff.. doesn't work at all. It's just stuck all the time..useless.Am writing this after using for a month .simple pathetic"
4,All technical sides are worth money. Processor is quite slow though. I have bought recently & almost no softwares expect Office programs. It takes time while opening them. Its light and very stylish. While buying I opted for Office programmes and other installments (cause I dont know how to use Win 10). Other thing is its genuine product so it comes with Microsoft office 365 1 month free trial. After that if you dont buy full version trial version ends nd you cant use any of them. No DvD reader and no SD card reader. Technology is going advanced so old models have it this one does not.Budget friendly good laptop for students or office if you are not planning to do anything extra on it. For games or graphic softwares go for other models.
1,"Extremely Slow this garbage laptop,,  i want sell ,, prize start with 1 Rs, tatti laptop.30 minute take to start .Tatti laptop, I bought on 17 august 2020, but the issue is that the display of the laptop is "" yellow tint"".  which takes away the quality of natural pictures , all colors looks dull and dirty , find audio problems and HD quality is also not impressive. its to slow ,click wait and watch small circle..anybody facing same display ( colors ) issue ? pls check and confirm or any setting required ? I did all.I will update review and star if my issue resolve."
1,In two days of purchasing this type of screen show many time.... hanging problem occur continuously .even I complain to Amazon customer care till the time complaint not attend....I want to replaced my laptop
1,"Very slow laptop, processor and RAM Are not up to mark  feels like using very old pc. My calculator works fast than this  , response time is very slow , display is average  battery is average, thinking of returning the product in just first 2 hrs of use"
5,Very nice Product and slimIt is very nice
1,"Pathetic product. With Just MS Word open, no other app open, system starts hangs and  Memory usage reaches 92% and you won't be able to open any other application like Web Browser.Battery life mentioned is 9.5hrs but with just one application open its not giving 3hrs.When you raise a complaint to return the product they will simply refuse. They write ""Replacement within 7days"" but in that case also they will make you call Manufacturer, with no final result, you have to keep same product and keep following up with Customer care.Even if you want to go for higher version of Laptop like i5 or AMD , they will not allowed.I am 5+year old active customer with frequent buying behavior  and very low return rate, still they are not ready to support.As they have started fraudulent activity by selling product with wrong product description, it better to refrain yourself from buying on site, especially when it marked as ""replacement only"" as in this case they sell wrong products."
1,"This laptop is totally waste of money, I took it 2 months for my children for online classes, it is very slow, it will take hell lot of time to switch tabs in Chrome/Mozilla or any Brower, Webcam will not work properly most of the times, it shows black. I have updated the windows time to time, but not much of use. we took to it for browsing but it is not at all suitable for anything. This product it not at all recommended. I am totally disappointed with ACER, I am planning to sell it and buying a new one."
4,Good product below 40000 ruppees. But processor speed is slow than information provided.
2,Look - goodThickness - goodProcessor - SUCKSIt looks like I have using older version of pentium processor packed in latest version of laptop.I ve been using i3 since long time as I don't want much from my laptop...I am just interested in watching movies and browsing simple stuff...but doing this in this acer laptop looks very sloppy.I am very unhappy with the speed....and especially at this price...just don't go with it.It takes minutes for programs to open and that too I have not yet installed any new apps ..I can't even imagine what if I install some few basic apps.I would not recommend this laptop.
5,Laptop bag not received
5,"This is my second acer laptop. Elegant fast and sturdy device. FullHD antiglare display, light weight, Good product. Upgrading the Ram to 8gb is suggested. Other than that no complaints. Fast delivery. Thank u amazon."
5,"Laptop look's good smooth design and I say this laptop is  very good for the office use and vedio edit etc ,  to here every features like display,sound, browsing speed, battery(3-4hr continue watching movies)  are awesome for small budget and I have truly satisfied for purchasing the laptop of price 31990 thank you Amazon,so I face  hang problem if you can open multiple window .....😅😅😅😛"
4,"This is my fifth Acer. On second day my screen went blank. I researched on net and realized problem is with Windows 10 and its updates. I reloaded windows 10 ,stopped automatic updates, reduced startup programs to minimum and started using Micro soft Edge as browser. All problems vanished.  Some problems exists while using chrome.Only negative aspect is battery life is 3.5 hours. I am totally satisfied with my Acer and it is value for money as I got it in festival sale of Amazon."
5,From my prospective the laptop is value for money.The reason to be satisfied with the laptop is that it has a good gaming performance not compared with a gaming pc or ps3 or ps4 but a mid quality of resolutions. It does not show any lagging for an ordinary use like little gaming and study work like attending live classes.Its body is made up of plastic which made sensitive to jerks and shocks but if it is used gently it do not create any problem for everyone. Its compatibility is shown in daily life like when doing editing on high end softwares like Adobe editing software and while playing games like assasin creed brotherhood and tomb raider 3 these games are little old but are high graphic games and this laptop handle these games very easily. I recommend to play games and use high lend softwares by connecting to charger because when charger is connected then processor work at its peak levels and work at maximum clock speed . Its touch pad and keyboard are very sensitive so use them gently also I recommend use secondary mouse and keyboard while using laptop because by spending small amount you can save your 3 to 4 thousand rupees.
1,"My review posted immediately after initial Installation by your technician ""The system is very very slow, right from the first day.""The Acer laptop was delivered to me on 26-4-21, return window closing on 3-5-21The technician had problems on inatalling it on 27 and 29 th (two days struggle), said ""it  will become alright, you start using it.""  He could not explain why the laptop is taking 12 minutes to boot and at least 10  minutes to perform any subsequent operationThe present position is we found it is a defective profuct with  hard disk & OS defectsBy the time, we found all these, we have lost the return 0r replace wondowWhen we dig deeper we find that it has been supplied by Appario RetailDoes not Amazon research the reviews about that company? Appario has a long record of such dubious products. Why Amazon, which is a trusted Site, place innocent purchasers like me at the mercy of such vendors? I am sure Appario are masters of supplying refurbished items, thru Amazon, taking you also down the drain.Appario's strategy seems to be "" supply a defective product, let the customer fight it with official service centre of the manufacturer""Perhaps he does not realise there are other remedies like Consumer Court and resultant bad publicity etcMy position is - I feel deceived, and I just dont want it in my house. I would like a full return and refundBut I have also given you valuable guidelines. Please take quick action"
1,"Very very poor quality product from acer. Surprisingly they make this poor quality laptop and when they broke while handling, they deny covering this in warranty.Worst experience with ACER. Poor quality and poorest service."
2,This Laptop's other features are ok  . but its webcam is not HD quality therefore the  image captured  is very dark and blurred even in  ample light.  It can not be used for vedio calling or online meetings!!!
1,The Brand New Laptop delivered had crashed just 1 week after starting.Tried Contacting Acer India/BLR service center but the response was v.poor & finally someone answered the call & diagnosed that HARD DISK needs replacement!! They had taken the faulty Laptop without any Receipt & till date there is no replacement or news on  Delivery.VERY POOR PRODUCT & SERVICE QUALITY
1,"Pathetic, it's not charging from day 1. Initially I tried quite many times and it started charging then I thought it's fine...and I cancelled replacement request but in just 10 days it stopped charging...now totally dead."
1,System works very slow.I have not added any other program to it even then starting Chrome takes a lot of time forget opening next App everything freezes.No dedicated  power button but is provided on keyboard
1,"This is really a horrible product. Dont buy it. Even though the specs are good, the laptop hangs like a dog. Every application you open it hangs for 1-2 mins. Piece of useless stuff. I have written to the Vendor, but no response."
1,"After some days the adaptor of laptop stop working , call doesn't connect to customer care easily , somehow i managed to complaint , more than 10 days has been passed nobody came for solution till now , as customer care said our technician will visit you.....still waiting..... worst service and product for me....need them to improve their customer service"
5,Good product
1,Very bad choice. Repent my decision. Bought on 8 th August . Within month started giving windows repair issue. Service center told mother board needs to replaced. But no spare available in warehouse india. Hardly used for 10 days . No proper customer service. They shipped faulty new laptop. The laptop is still with service center and they don't have answer when they repair it.Think before buying.
2,MS Office was promotional for a week. Battery back up not more than 4 hrs. Amazon platform is more costly than its own site cost. I believed on Amazon for better cost. Its available on its site  at 30K.
1,"Please please Don't buy this, it's too slow and hungs up. it's only for browsing and not for another usage not even some photo editing.It looks good, design is cool but the inner side is worse and the battery stays for 4-5 hrs only. If you want to upgrade Ram u have to open up the back panel which is against warranty policies.You really can't use it without Ram upgraded which may cost u an extra 4K."
4,"It's an awesome laptop.. Just one thing that It says pre installed microsoft.. But for all usage of apps like office excel it asks for PRODUCT KEY.. Suggestion a support call from either Acer or Microsoft should be must after delivery so that ppl who don't know how to start with the set up, can do this.. Still finding trou contacting on call to both Acer and Microsoft.. Nd that's terrible"
1,"Such a slow processor can't Evn open chrome with 4Gb RAM, LCD display is the worst one, Camera dead cheap... instead I suggest buy different with high gb ram, and also NO Microsoft software inbuildSuggest NOT TO BUY THISI suggest i5, 8Gb 10gen in any different brand#experience for getting it"
1,"Hi, The product purchased is very slow and the processing system is lagging extremely behind. The product is not reaching the expectation, the working is slow and it makes the whole profuct slow. Basic software performances take huge amount of time to respind and work. Wishing to return the product as soon as possible. Kindly help for the same."
1,"Experience is horrible. Net surfing is dead slow. Google chrome or any other search engine does not open up at all or takes long to open. Online meeting website like Microsoft Teams or Zoom app is non-responsive or takes long to response. Download speed of any file, even non-bulky file is dead slow. Don't buy this product."
1,"Worst purchasr i have ever done. From the first day the camera was not working properly.  It was  suddenly gets off during VC. Panel is very poor, bad resolution. And today suddenly a noice came out of the hard disk while using the laptop. I have immediatly shut down the system. I want immediate replacement of the product."
1,Totally wrost laptop. Facing hanging problem and also facing black screen while using this lapto. And courier partner is also very great just because he is don't know to talk customers and misbehaving customers while I want to return this order.So I suggested please do not purchase this laptop
4,"Really liked the product, bought it for my friend and he is happy. Thank u Amazon"
1,Not working properly....C drive memory not expand...
3,Writing this review after using 2 days.It's heating like anything while charging and while using also.charger also heating like valcano..tooo hot like appropriate word is fire.Charging is hardly lasting for 2.5hours.Afer some days may it will last for one hour only.Speakers sound is nothing means nothing.its below than any ordinary mobile sound.sound is bad.Coming to built quality below average.poor plastic usedWeights too much above 2 kgs.cant handle with one hand.Design also above average.Speed is above averageCamera is badScreen is goodStorage is goodBooting quickly
1,"Got in this condition...torn plastic, no protective foam..mouse package torn apart no usb..parts missing,brown paper torn. Very dissapointing..Got replacement, again tampered, mouse usb stolen, delivery boy was rude and created much hassel...had to complain..facing garrassment since 5th april, still no laptop.About the replacement laptop, the laptop was heating like crazy, display was bad, sound bad, built cheaply, but but but the charger is heating like furnace, my finger got burned touching it. Returned it obviously...pls dont buy it...."
1,HorriblePls do not buyDefective productWhere is the exchange
5,Bestever laptop ....👍Cheapest and Best....👍Thanks Amazon and Seller....👍Nice and elegant design....👍Simply the Best Laptop...👍No other brand offer such configuration in this price point...So Go for it without any hesitation...👍
5,Fantastic performance. Great specifications at a very competitive price. Truly satisfied with the product.
4,It is very good but 4 stars only because of heating
5,Not given ms office
1,Had bought this thinking it is a Indian company and offering a good deal as well until I lost the good deal to bits in a year. No doubt it is great laptop until it worked and at first it will feel like a great value for money but are a while when we I had to close and open the lid for a while and do note that i am a kind of person who opens & closes lid once a day and the problem with the laptop is its plastic cheap plastic was used to cut cost but the same plastic is used in the hinge area it was not reinforced and that puts a lot of stress in the hinge area and completely destroys it after a while and with it goes the display again display is 1080p and great but its cheap not made for wear n tar mine got destroyed coz of the bend it creates while opening n closing after the hinge support was broken as in first image and then the laptop it self stopped working also I purchased it in mid 2019. and bought a new one in Mid 2020 coz it broke.The only way to may use of it would be to play around with it for a month the keep it in a place where you are just going to use it where you don't have to close the lid
5,An i3 laptop with 8GB RAm and 2TB Hard drive are exactly what a student needs. The inclusion of SSD makes the laptop faster and the HDD gives plenty of storage space.
1,Worst product I have ever seen and total fraud company they show service center in my town on its site but there is no service center .
5,"If you're looking for an entry-level laptop for a bit of work or study from home, you've found it. A definite recommendation for the price."
1,Ghatiya se ghatiya
5,My son is student of 9th class and also learning online coding classes i got this laptop for him now he is happy and relaxed because his all tasks are going smooth
1,Performance-1.5/5Design-2/5Overall-2/5One of the worst laptops I have ever used. Never buy any laptop with the AMD A9-9425 processor. Ever!
5,"Okay! Let me get straight into the Teardown review of this laptop as the rest of everything can be found on the internetFirst of all, This is the New Lenovo Thinkpad E14 Gen.2 and not Gen.1. Below are the few upgrades you'll notice right away.1. 1920x1080 Full HD IPS Panel (250 nits max brightness)2. Extra M.2 Slot for up to 1TB of Additional SSD3. Extra RAM Slot for up to 16GB of Additional RAMNow, Coming back to the laptop itself.It comes with Windows 10 Home single language out of the box along with Microsoft Office 2019 Students and Home. You'll need to Activate the Office with a Microsoft account. Upon starting any of the Office Apps you'll be prompted for the registration post which Office 2019 will be activated in your account.The first and foremost thing I'd recommend anyone is to log in with Lenovo Vantage and Register the product with the Product ID as many of them are facing a Product Registration Issue which can be resolved after 24 hours of you registering the product with Lenovo. The warranty of the Laptop will then be counted from the date of your purchase.Coming back to the internals of the Laptop. It is equipped with 256GB of PCIe Nvme SSD (WD SN530 2242) which can be upgraded to 512GB as per Lenovo's Website but I'd highly recommend adding in an extra SSD based upon your needs. Also, I've attached CrystalDiskMark benchmarks of the included SSD.Now to the selling factor of this Laptop. Ryzen 5 4500U. As per the Cinebench R23 results the Processor blows off Intel 11th Gen i7-1165G7 out of waters by achieving a score of 5500 (In my test) which is far more capable of any office or students based task.The Speakers are also from Harman and got to say when it gets pretty loud and punchy.The only con I found so far was the Keyboard not being Backlit for the Indian SKU.However, Everything from the Fingerprint sensor to the Battery Life everything is on par with the mentioned description. In my day-to-day usage, I'm getting a battery life of around 6 to 7 hours with 60 - 70% Brightness and Laptop set on Better Battery Mode.To conclude, I would only say one thing to not think twice about which Ryzen 5 Laptop to buy and buy this one without thinking twice or waiting for the Sale to arrive or the Price to drop. You may never know when it may go out of stock and never come back (lol just kidding). Also, If you've read so far clicking on the Helpful button would be sweet :)P.S The Laptop can be also charged from a USB C PD supported power banks and wall adapter.Review Update Regarding the SSD upgrade. Due to some weird reason WD (Western Digital) nvme SSD are not supported in the laptop I tried with SN550 (500GB and 1TB Both) After researching the entire internet I found no working solution so I had to return back the SSD.Then I decided to go for Crucial P1 SSD which upon installing directly got detected into Disk Management and Device Manager in the very first attempt. So I'd highly recommend to go to Crucial SSD over WD SSD for this particular model.Adding this after the Ryzen 5 Pro (4650U) variant was added.Please Note only RYZEN 5 4500U has IPS Display. RYZEN 5 4650U has TN Panel!!!"
5,"Pros1) Upgradability.Western Digital SSD instead of global Toshiba ones.. really good, but only 236 GB out of which your initial windows setup would eat some 50 GB,Anyways pump in a new one, additional slot present.1 Upgradable ram slot unlike other criminals who solder you with 8gb with a Ryzen 4500u2) Fingerprint is dope goodBattery life is good.Keyboard is omg turu loveeeeTouchpad hmm ok.3) 4500u is brilliant, efficient thermals too.4) light weight considering the well built chassis.5) sound is good as per my needs.Cons1) screen could have been better in colour gamut reproduction, anyways not much complaints, not using for any photo video works.IPS panel, good for coders.Tweak amd brightness settings else it would be locked at 100 nits when on battery.250 nits is fine.2) no backlight on keyboard..i thought it would be same as foreign models... anyways i can type in dark_____________________________________The Indian variant instead of windows 10 pro comes with home single language and office 2019 home and studentGood deal in a few ways.Installing linux was a slight pain...typical secureboot EFI issues, no biggie.This is a good bargain at 46k, if you know your tradeoffs. :)---------------------------------------------------------------------One important thing to note would be the warranty.Old*My laptops warranty started 7 days before the day I opened the box.That was the system setup date, which I found when saw windows folderSo please check your device' warranty stuffs too from lenovo vantage, your mileage might vary*_-----_NewUpdate now warranty starts on the actual date.. After registration I guess"
5,"Bought this lappy @37k with exchange of my 9yrs old i3 Ideapad and I can say this is best deal I've ever got. Now talking about Thinkpad e14 gen 2 Ryzen 5 4500U , it is way more superior than contemporary thinkpad i5 models. i5 got 4 cores but Ryzen 5 4500U got 6 cores.Build quality : sturdy , compact as same as thinkpad other version. Pre-install Win10 home edition ,MS office is trial one however asked for Credit Card Details.One disappointment :  keyboard is not backlit one which I was looking for.Go for this spec rather than intel i3/i5."
5,"Ryzen 5 4500u is fast and power efficient much better than i5 or even i7. SSD is WD also very good,  ram is samsung 8 gb 3200 mhz, screen is not color acurate only 45% CG but its good for general use, keyboard is non backlit, it has extra ssd & ram slot. It could be best option for developers if it come without crap windows.  It come with premier onsite support.There are so many variant in thinkpad e14, it seems diffrent from i5 version in term of build quality. Some version come with better build quality, backlit keyboard etc.. but it seems has much better sound as compared to i5 version. Sound quality is very good"
1,"The laptop is great, but the seller is intentionally misleading regarding the display type. It's a TN display, and therefore has washed out colours and bad vertical viewing angles. All the reviews that mention that it is an IPS display is for the 4500U model, which had an IPS display apparently. Buyer beware!"
3,This laptop is amazing at this price range as far as performance is concerned. But the hardware quality is low as compared to other Thinkpad models. Maybe the product I got has the manufacturing date in Nov. 2020 and I got the latest piece. No backlight keyboard is the biggest drawback of this model. the keyboard doesn't meet ThinkPad standards. I can easily identify the difference as I have already used the Thinkpad series in my office.Performance: It is amazing in this price range. Ryzen 5 is pretty fast. I can do all the office work along with the use of some heavy software. 8GB RAM can be an issue for some of the buyers.Front camera: Worst. Even my 5 years old laptop has better camera quality.Booting time and read-write speed: Pretty fastOverall if you are a performance-oriented person then this laptop is fine despite a few drawbacks. But the price range is pretty low and you are getting Ryzen 5 in 45K. So worth the price range.
1,"I really feel cheated. This is a TN panel, not an IPS panel. Please check the viewing angles. The product that has been reviewed earlier in the same product pages say IPS. If they are changing something, why isn't it pointed out earlier?"
5,"Superfast Booting and Long battery life, I used this Thinkpad Laptop( Normal usage, no Movie/ Audio) on battery for 8 hours and my battery power still was left around 30% , dam good, display is fantastic and Nice and Loud Sound from Harman,One thing that I notice that Laptop Warranty was already started (20 days before the Purchase date) , so I wrote to Leveno about this on their website in product registry page and they asked me to iolaod the purchase invoice and I did that and within 24 hours the Warrenty of laptop was revised with the my purchase date. (In their website it is mentioned that the Warrenty may start early sometime when Vendor or Retailer purchase it in bulk and then sell it to end user but Leveno correct this once you see the difference and raise it to then with Purchase Invoice).Full time Licence Windows 10 and Office 2019 student version.What are you waiting for guys, Go and Grab this Beast before its gone ( as I see this model is very fast moving and get out of stock in few hours).Hope you found my review useful  thanks."
4,"Pros-SturdyFast connectivityFast processingQuick to bootImpressive technical specsGood audio qualityBeautiful machine.Quiet.(Do remember, pros are with respect to class. For the money you've paid, you are getting a good deal)Cons -BrightnessLimited ports. You'd need an external memory card reader. Otherwise, yeah, isn't really a deal breaker but one extra usb port would have been awesome.Going to list a con but I think that's for windows and not for drivers but somehow many software installation dialog boxes are blurry. I have scaled it to 125% and that has helped but I don't know whose problem this really is.Also, damn, the battery settings are complex. You can't just keep it simple now a days like windows 7 or 8 where you could choose between - save battery, lower brightness and performance OR high performannce and increased brightness plugged in.And one last con.. again not sure lenovo or Amazon .. but here is the thing, back in 2008, I bought my first laptop, lenovo y41077578cq and it came with a nice bag.Then in 2013 I bought lenovo essential g505s and I got a bag too.Now in almost 2021 I bought a laptop and I just got that despite shedding 45k .. I mean throwing in one or two accessories would be great. A bag atleast. All I got was laptop. That's all. I mean it's fine, but whatever happened to the extra goodies. Even my grocery vendors throws in some lemons and coriander with main vegetables"
5,"Great all-round performance. So let me start with what the problems could be with this machine. First is, it does not have a backlit keyboard. Second is, it ships with a 256 GB SSD (There's an empty SSD slot but it didn't work for me)Design: The laptop looks premium. The bezels are reasonable for a laptop in 2020. The top lid has 2 brands though, Lenovo and Thinkpad. The size is pretty compact for a 14 inch laptop. It comes with a fingerprint scanner built into the power button.Ports: It has a USB-C port with power delivery, making it possible for you to travel with it with just your phone charger. However, there are only 2 USB type A ports, out of which, only one is USB 3.1Display: It comes with a beautiful 1080p IPS display. The screen brightness is pretty good when plugged-in. However, when the laptop is running on battery, it doesn't go very bright, making it difficult to work in outdoor conditions.Keyboard and touchpad: Keyboard is frankly quite amazing. The layout is a little different and gets a little getting used to. It doesn't however have an right click (menu) key.Performance: 4500U processor performs really well. With a reasonably heavy load while coding or handling large amounts of data, it doesn't get bogged down. Also, the fans run absolutely silent during regular web-browsing, running an IDE, playing videos etc. While gaming, it performs fairly well on last gen games (2013-2019) with 40-50 fps in the couple of games I threw on (Hitman and NFS Rivals). I noticed a significant bump in performance when I upgraded to 16 GB RAM (it ships with 8GB and you can buy another 8 GB for 3-3.5K). Long story short, you should upgrade the RAM if you want to play any games.Battery Life: Honestly, the battery life is pretty amazing. Even with a 45Wh battery, it goes on for 7 hours at 'Better Battery' mode (I have attached Battery Report generated by Windows with the review). In real world usage, I get 10 hours of battery life with medium brightness with regular productivity tasks, like web browsing, sending emails etc.Build quality: The build quality is great. The Thinkpad E14 Gen 2 in India ships with top lid made of metal and the rest of the body made of plastic (but good solid plastic). However, by Thinkpad standards, the build quality is below average.Bottom line: For 46k (or even 57k) it's a great deal. You get a fast processor, upgradable RAM and SSD, great build quality, USB-C charging and decent display making it a great work-horse."
1,"system suddenly stopped booting. Lenevo CC replace mother board. Now windows are not getting installed. At the end of OS install, it ask you to connect with wifi. After wifi it try to connect Microsoft and fails. Lenevo engineer has visited 4 times but no help yet.Lenevo is saying its not their fault as hardware has no problem and I need to reach to Microsoft. Microsoft says they can't help as my laptop doesn't go online and nothing is registered with my name/mail id with them so they can not do anything.So theoretically, I am blocked and have wasted my money.After lots of discussion, they lento agreed to some engineer again to look.So please be careful if you are buying Lenevo.I will keep this thread updated."
4,"The laptops good for work. Only a couple of issues -1. No backlight on the keyboard2. Its heavy, dont expect a macbook air3. Its plastic, but solid4. Touch pad is good, but not in the same ballpark as a macbook. All gestures work fine.Awesome things:1. Upgradable ram2. Upgradable storage3. epic keyboard4. Good battery life5. 13.3 in laptop size (you can easily fit it inside an amazon basic 13 in sleeve)"
5,My initial impressions:1. This is a pretty cool laptop. It doesn't heat up that much even on 100% cpu load.2. Boots up really fast. (4-5 seconds)3. Display is more than decent given the price. Don't whine. You get what you pay for. I am getting a bit of backlight bleeding at full brightness but it's typical of most of IPS display. Viewing angles are decent. I don't see a lot of colour shifting.4. Build quality is amazing. There's a mix of aluminium and plastic. Good quality plastic nevertheless.5. It's too heavy for my liking. But it's almost a non-issue.6. I was quite surprised by the sound quality which is pretty crisp and loud.7. Battery lasts me about 8 hours with WiFi on.8. Trackpad is pretty average.If your budget is around 55k this should be your definite pick.
5,"Guys, if you are here then you already know about Ryzen 4000 series. My god, I am in love with this one but unfortunately I bought ThinkBook 14 just three days ago, I am so pissed.Best Specs combination having Ryzen 5 4500u, Samsung SSD (I guess) with 3.5 GBps read/write speeds, IPS FHD Panel, ThinkPad Model. It is just Wowzaa..Close your eyes and click the buy button."
5,"1. Bought this for my daughter for her online classes. She absolutely loves it.2. Very fast bootup. SSD does make a difference3. Seamless installation experience. Comes preloaded with Windows and MS office4. Brightness is good. Good experience even while watching movies on Amazon Prime5. Sound is excellent6. Thickness: manageable7. Current gen processor at an affordable price. I was in a dilemma as to whether to go for slightly cheaper older gen Ryzen 5 processor or 11th gen i3. Am happy with this choice so far8. Battery life is good.I am a picky buyer and researched a lot before buying. If you are looking for a good performance vs price tradeoff and decent laptop for home usage, I would highly recommend this."
2,"TL;DR: MSI Modern 14 with 300 nits display, 512GB SSD, bigger 52WHr battery, backlit keyboard, lighter (1.3 kg) and similar build quality is a better buy. MSI's service will also be better as they have switched to same vendor which does service of Asus products.Got this for ₹46000 (-₹2300 SBI Yono Cashback) in December, 2020 i.e. first lot.Laptop is decent for the price. Ryzen 4500u clearly outperforms 10th and 11th gen Core i5. RAM and Storage are upgradable too. Display is a mediocre 250 nits LG panel which is fine for the time being, I may upgrade it after few years. Build quality is decent. 256GB is too less. Battery life is anywhere between 5-6 hours which is okay, nothing extraordinary.The laptop got hang-ed a few times while playing Genshin, which is odd considering its a Hexa core processor so shouldn't hang at all. (4 stars)Lenovo customer support is outright pathetic. I wanted to purchase Extended Warranty and didn't know that Thinkpads have their own website (other than the Lenovo's) to purchase it. First I tried the usual Lenovo sites (buyalenovo.com/register), then I contacted (called and mailed) their customer support numerous times and they couldn't reply even after a month.Then when I tweeted to Lenovo India, they shared the site (lenovowarranty.in) but told me since a month had passed I won't get the offer price (3 year EW+ADP for ₹3500), and will have to pay ₹12000 for EW and ₹8000 for ADP. So I am supposed to pay 6 times because their own Premier Customer support couldn't tell me the correct site within the said period. Wow. (-2 stars)"
5,"Best laptop under Rs. 50,000 Period.One thing you should do after getting this is to turn of the vari-bright setting from amd radeon software. It changes the monitor gamma settings to compensate for the brightness. It is very jarring and weird. Over all a beast.Edit: When you go for a RAM upgrade for for a 3200MHz CL-22 model."
4,"Product is no doubt awesome. Pros - ryzen 5 4500u processorBuild qualitySecurityUpgradable ram upto 24gbFast charging and good battery backup.Fingerprint sensor.Cons - no backlit keyboard14 inchBrightness is little bit lowOnly 256gb ssd.The warranty is showing only for 11 months. (From 18/12/2020, though I order it on 2nd Jan and received it on 7th January 2021)I bought it for 49990.(As middle class people can't afford a credit card. So therefore no discounts)It seems quite durable. (Good for long run)4 starts because I had to pay 4 thousands more than the original price."
5,"If your budget is under 50k. Purchase this laptop with eyes closed. Yes, it doesnt have backlit keyboard. Except for that, everything else seems great.Pros:Sturdy build qualityGreat brand. If you are in corporate and want to be taken seriously, appear with a thinkpad, not with an Ac*rIt has shutter that can keep camera off. You can use that in meetings when you are too lazy to get up from bed but unsure whether camera is accidentally onFast booting speedFinger biometric ensures you never need to remember/ enter password while opening laptopGreat processor, few say it's better than i7Full hd displayGenuine office free for life. Count this blessing. It looks awkward when you are making that presentation and red bar appears. Also with genuine office  upgrades will keep coming.Fast USB ensures quick data transferGreat speakers. Sound reproduction is excellentBuilt in Dolby. Additional blessing.Hard drive is ssd. It means fast booting and writing.The current version that is being shipped is gen2 e14. People say they bought it at 45k. That was gen1 model. This gen2 was launched this April only."
4,"the 2021 model when i purchased was priced 53k and within a week it got reduced to 50k. So I really felt upset and amazon won't match the price.Regarding thinkpad:Pros:It is a light weight machine. Battery life is great. AMD 4650u any day beats i5 low power 10 or 11 gen. 6 cores and 12 threads gives performance a boost. Also 3200Mhz ddr4 ram and 256gb nvme ssd makes it a super powerful machine. Also one extra ram slot and extra nvme slot for ssd is there.Keyboard is non backlit but a thinkpad keyboard, which makes typing a charm. Camera cover and fingerprint scanner is also good addition. Not much noise of fan and not much heating issue. But the vent is in bottom not in sides.USB c based charging.MS Office 2019 full version included.Cons:One USB 2 port. Why in 2021 usb2 port ?The display is TN not ips.The display cover i think is polycarbonate not aluminium.The speaker sound is just okay and also bottom firing."
5,First of all I love thinkpad sturdy design. Not the best we can say in e14 series but it will definitely not disappoint you in any aspect of build and premium quality under 46k segment laptop.Pros:Fast boot up thanks to SSDLatest AMD series Processor (hexa core) at this priceNarrow bezzel (Screen to body ratio)Sound quality is amazingThinkpad keyboard (loved to work)Touch pad (if you used of it)Battery life : 7-8 hours ease with regular stuff (not experienced with gaming stuff as I am not gaming lover)Cons:256gb storage (quite better with upgradable storage slot)No backlit keyboardIf you can upgrade this machine with extra ssd slot for storage it will become beast and will definitely not going to disappoint you in any aspect!! Big Yesssss to this machine in 2021!!
5,"First of all, a big thank you to all those who have given insightful feedback about this laptop.I have been using this device for a week now and I'll talk about the negatives of the laptop first, so that those who are specific can look somewhere else.Display - The screen is not very color accurate. Color gamut is terrible and, though slightly, this does impact media consumption. Although the screen is matte, the quality is not that good - I was able to see the reflection of my room's tube light on my screen. Also, I find the screen to be on a warmer side by default but after tweaking it from AMD Radeon Software it looked better. This is basically the ONLY negative I could find in this laptop. That said, it's not a big deal as readability is pretty good and colors won't be much of an issue.Software Bugs - Small bugs like brightness wouldn't change sometimes using the buttons or internally through software but a restart resolves this. Sometimes laptop's screen doesn't wake up from sleep.Now, Positives...it has a lot of them!Performance - 5/5 (great at multitasking and handling load).Build quality is great at this price point, the laptop feels very sturdy.Input devices - just amazing (slightly below the high-end Thinkpad level devices).Thermals excellent. One exciting thing is that the fan is inaudible in multitasking as well! I ran 6 apps in parallel and audio in background and I couldn't hear the fan at all.Speakers - great for normal use. Battery life - I was able to get 6-7 hours in casual surfing, listening and  making a couple of docs and ppts.Fingerprint - Works 9/10 times. Pretty reliable.Upgradeable Memory - Although 8 GB RAM is going to be sufficient for most of us, the laptop can be upgraded to 24 GB. 256 GB SSD is not a lot but its easy to get into this laptop and upgrade that as well, when required.As stated by others as well, warranty was backdated on the device; for me it was a month earlier. Check it on Warranty Lookup on Lenovo's website and reach out to the company to get it corrected.I was confused about my purchase decision at first. I was not sure if I wanted a costlier device or would this do, but I am totally satisfied and can easily recommend this device."
5,"Under 50k, It is the best one. Got the Ryzen 4650U model.I have read about the change in the display panel but it is not impacting me much.Performance is top class - I felt it better than my 10th gen i7 Lenovo Legion.Battery life - Amazing - Giving more than 10 hours with 50% brightness.256 GB SSD is bit less, But something compromised for the price."
4,It's a very good laptop. I had an issue with ms office. Lenovo premier support has resolved the issue today. Now I am satisfied with this laptop.
5,"cons: its slow..i thought it would be good but.. unfortunately it's not as expected... but ok boots up in 30 sec - too slow for ssd, finger print sensor not works properly. battery over heats when kept charging,pros: battery back up is good comes for almost 5-6 hours ,battery fills up super quickly. build quality is superior,  only product in this price range with these specs (i brought at 47.5k in feb 2021).I recommend to buy."
5,"10 out of 5 stars.... YES... read belowAmazing laptop - Balance Specs, performance & quality. Get one for yourself before it goes out of stock0. RAM is Upgradable, 8gb on-board, add 16 to make 24Gb(3200mhZ). IdeaPad not upgradable RAMs1. AMD Ryzen is far better than Intel. Don't buy Intel unless you understand Specs. AMD Ryzen 5 beats i7-10th Gen too.2. Power efficient, battery backup: 6-10 hours on mixed usage.4. Fingerprint is damn fast & keyBoard is great.********RIP Intel.... Bye Bye Intel ******Nothing else required in this price range. I'm happy & satisied. The perfect laptop .Note: My 2nd laptop after Sony VAIO 2011, after 10 years AMD is the game changer & leader in Chipsets. Intel fooled us for decade.Please dont expect gaming performance, get a gaming pc/laptop instead, HP & dell still selling Ryzen 3500 series & intel i5 for 65K with no RAM Slot, grapics.Far better than Intel i3 or i5, AMD Ryzen 5 beats i7 10th Gens too.14' suits for portability and work where you want. get extended warranty from lenovo, better for long term support.Demand is for AMD, Laptop companies are dumping/selling Intel Chipsets in India & other countries."
5,"Excellent - If this laptop has to be described in one word after using the laptop for more than 2 months.Build Quality - Top notch, made of  military grade material, so don't need to worry about spills and drops.Brightness - The brightness level suits for indoors and can be adjusted through Radeon graphics setting for better brightness outdoors.Keyboard - Works like breeze. You will fall in love with the keyboard even if you need to type long hours. The Fn and Ctrl keys are interchanged, so it can be uncomfortable initially. Can be changed from the BIOS setting or the Lenovo Vantage app if needed . Unfortunately it is not backlit keyboard.Performance - I am not a gamer or use it for intensive programming to test the power of the processor. I am pretty happy for my regular home use.Specs - The boot and shutdown time is quick, thanks to the 256GB SSD( would have preferred a 512gb instead). 14 inch IPS display is good enough and the color levels are accurate. Comes with 8GB RAM which is the bare minimum needed these days. It is not soldered to the Motherboard and is expandable.Battery Life - If you run on Battery Saver mode, you can easily get 8-9 hours depends on what and how many applications are running.Cost - Thanks to the AMD processor, Ryzen 5 cost me 47999 and it is absolute bang for buck for this silent laptop. Would have had to shell out 10-15k more if I chose Intel i5 for the same configuration."
1,"I doubt about it's genuineness. Also the LAN port slot bottom is moving and shaking. Is it by design? I have used Thinkpad from Office, the LAN port plastic will not move.  I am wondering if I need to return this or not?"
5,Worth the price... Fully satisfied... Specifications as shown..... The same laptop is around 72000 with intel i5 and graphic card... Because of branding... I suggest to do your own research b/w ryzen and intel... And come to your own conclusion...The best thing is that... Ram and storage is upgradable in future...I would recommend it 100%...
5,"Got it for 50k, have to say it is the best laptop one can get at this price point.Build quality is amazing, top is aluminium finish while remaining body is plastic but it is hard plastic and there is no flexing at all.It has Ryzen 5 4500u, so performance is silky smooth, boot times are fast 5-6 seconds, display quality is amazing as well plus sound output is absolutely dope.Lastly, what this deal at 50k sweeter is the ability to upgrade both SDD and RAM in this laptop, at similar price and spec the Asus Vivobook 4500u doesn't provide this option.So if you are looking for a good laptop, you should certainly go for it, plus if you've old laptop you can exchange it and reduce your overall purchase price even more.Amazing deal at 50k - 10k for 4th gen Intel Dell Inspiron."
4,"I'll list the pros first1. It's a thinkpad. Great build quality and awesome keyboard ( I have a ThinkPad L440 which haven't failed me even once)2. Ryzen 5 4500u, great processor. 3200 mhz ram. Nvme storage (mi notebook doesn't give it)3. Power delivery, think shutter, RJ-45 port, spill resistant keyboard, upgradeable RAM and ssd, good battery lifeCons:1. Heating issue: even running online classes on chrome makes the CPU temperature hit 66 degrees which is quite bad (I had taken a pic of the system diagonstics right after the class). I've noticed that this heating issue is more prevalent when the laptop is plugged in. While running even light games, the temperatures hit 75+ which is real bad for the health of the laptop. Lenovo should have taken more care about the thermals. These temperatures are too high for a laptop using a 7 nm processor.2. There's backlight bleeding, but I personally don't find it much of an issue.3. The left usb port is too tight. So tight that it is impossible to pull out a usb stick without some really strong pull. This is bad because it can cause harm to external HDDs due to accidental shakes. Especially since this laptop has only 256 gb storage."
5,"Here are some pros and cons I foundPros.Ryzen 5 killed it! -Being a heavy user, I use very heavy software like Android Studio, Adobe Premier Pro, etc and trust me it runs butter smooth considering the size of the laptop. I didn't played any game yet I think you'll get 45-60 fps on low-medium settingsSSD - It's blazing fast. Loads windows in just 3 seconds. I got read speeds of upto 2 gbps and write 1.6 gbps.Display -Well it gets complicated here, when I first turned it on, the display was a little more on the yellowish side and brightness was too low. However, I fixed both of them in the AMD graphics  setting.BTW. if yours brightness is also, just turn off vari-brightness in AMD graphics settings.After fixing the issues its gorgeous! IPS panel so no color loss, color gamut is good(not great but much better than other laptops in this price) brightness could be a little betted but it's  ok for me.Other things I liked are -There is a webcam shutter (BTW webcam is great)Fingerprint sensorDevice EncryptionBall pointer mouse (Those who can't understand the need for this, Many coders like me use 95% of pc using keyboard so it just make it convenient if you suddenly need the mouse out of no where.Upgradable ( A big plus point you can install upto 24gb of ram and one more m.2 drive)Cons -  : (The front body is not great, its a little matte (idk but maybe its to protect from accidental damage)Keyboard (Good for basic typing but I type 180 WPM so I feel a little discomfort.Could have back-lit keyboardElse everything is great.Finally,  This laptop is great for me and checks all my need but if you are a graphics designer, I suggest  lenovo flex-5 (has the same processor)"
5,"This is a perfect laptop for most affordable price. I have been longing to buy a thinkpad but they always have been on expensive side because of their build quality. This particular deal got me thinkpad for 45990 for a ryzen 5 processor and 256gb ssd. After doing a lot of search, I realised that ryzen processors r better than intel i5 10th gen and few of i7 processors also. i was looking for a bigger ssd memory than normal hdd. and there i found this amazing combination which was pocket friendly and had all specs i was looking for. Its upgradable to 24GB ram with 16gb ram in slot 2 and 1TB SSD with another free ssd slot."
5,"ProsBuild quality, nice grade plastic, has a metal sheet below panel, overall sturdyLove the size of touchpad, the two buttons, really nice to do the work efficientlyThinkPad keyboard reputation precedes itPersonally love the colorAmazing battery life, should do certain tweaks disabling background apps and all (my unit showed an estimate of 11hrs at 80% with light usage...I haven't tested the same but am confident getting apprpx 8hr on an avg would be it)180⁰ screen angle option is there (see 3rd image)Ryzen 5 4500u beating the intel alternative by a great margin, 8gb ram with upgrade option, I literally didn't find a non gaming laptop offering more than 8gb option or an upgrade option, I personally got another 8gigs added along with a 500gb ssd, so in 46+11k you get a beast configuration of R5 4500u + 756 gb ssd + 16gb ramWhere the brands just offering 8gb soldered in 65kWeight is perfect for office/student lifeAlso has a cute little camera privacy shutter integrated, little details adding great valueFinally, a fingerprint scanner integrated in the power button working like a charm ding ding ding <3ConsWell, I am mesmerized by the unit so can't say much bad of it....just an addition of a backlit keyboard would be great and the placement of left ctrl key towards left most... well its ThinkPad's design so not really a con but yeah some people could be botheredConclusion: Killer non gaming laptop on 31 Jan 21, probably the best considering upgrade options"
5,"This is the best laptop in its price segment. I had this issue where if your laptop is running on battery, it will automatically change its screen brightness. Even reviewers were showing the same issue. Turns out you have to turn off the auto screen brightness(Vari-Bright) in Radeon Software.And yes you have to turn it off manually. It is on by default."
4,"It works as intended, everything runs smooth and as expectedthe only problem is that it heats up quite a bit while charging, this can be solved easily by keeping it on a laptop stand tho, even without any fans is okay, it just needs some air to suck upOther than that amazing laptop which I will use for many years to come as thinkpad durability suggestsThe lights (the one on escape, mute and mic keys) don't work correctly as soon as you open up the laptopso make sure to update the bios and just update the pc up-to-date for the best experienceNot like other reviews but one thing is for sure that you won't regret this purchase imo for the price as low it is atm i.e. 49k without any exchange"
5,"I bought it for a bit less than the price on the site, I'll be honest I usually use it for a bit of coding and work, other than that play valorant maybe a couple of times a week and watch Netflix. For these use cases I find it a bit overpowered, the battery life is just amazing, the display quality is okay I guess for the price I wouldn't complaint. Then the performance, well Ryzen kills it and the SSD is also on par with most in the price range.Pros:BatteryPerformanceBuild QualityCons:Display ( if you don't mind the colour saturation)PortsStorage (but the only SSD can be replaced with a different one, tho you'll have to transfer the data from old one somehow with the OS or reinstall OS again on the new one)"
4,"ThinkPad is for professionals for work purposes. It is not targeted for Movie Buffs or Audiophilesor Gamers. Please remember this when you buy any ThinkPad products.The product is Sturdy, Slim, light weight. Has excellent build quality. Performance looks quite good (fast booting)The in built speakers are average. Don't expect very loud sound.The display is the weakest part of this device. It looks quite dull to the extent of even a bit dirty if you are used to glossy IPS LCD screens. Videos look a bit washed out in colours. I have removed 1 star exclusively due to its display panel (TN Panel)But I'd you intend to use it for office purpose or educational purposes and want a sturdy, long lasting, value for money device - then this is it!"
5,Good spec.Amd ryzen is very efficientbattery life is excellentEasily portableWorth for every penny paidExtremely powerful for daily tasks
5,Brilliant machine with amazing specifications. This should be priced more than 55k.Pros:Battery back up.Build quality.Processor.Thunderbolt port.Sound level and quality.Keyboard and tracker.Mouse pad.Cons:Brightness though it is fine for indoor usage.Backlit keyboard.
1,"Being a budget laptop, not much was expected as performance. Within 3 days of purchase the camera stopped working. I requested for a replacement, instead it was picked up as a return(this happened after 10 requesting and multiple follow ups-fed up with amazon on this count)."
1,Battery is draining very fast.... I didnot.liked it much...also.it is very slow...go for some.other model instead
5,Buy now
5,The laptop is very good and fast and liked the laptop so much it is windows 10 and amd ryzen 3
1,Laptop battery draining very fast.
5,Nice laptop with nice configuration with long lasting back up battery and clear display . Rock the laptop and enjoy.
5,This product is really good. The ram ans speed is incredible. It is sleek and very stylish. The price is very reasonable also
5,One of the best product in this price rangeOnly booting time is longIf u sacrifice ssd and go with this an awesome choiceI think only lap top with dedicated graphic card and back lit keyboard in this price tag
3,It takes forever to boot. Fan makes plenty of noise.Update [After working few days - 5 days]  Boot is better.Warranty is predating 4 months from my date of purchase. This seems to be also reported by another customer. Not sure if they are refurbishing and selling in name of new.
4,"As expected from a gaming laptop battery life is not up to the mark, below 3 hours of battery life under medium to heavy gaming sessions.The screen quality is good for gaming, but not ideal for the work of colour correction.At this price it is best for students which are looking for an affordable gaming machine."
1,Don’t get carried away with less price and good configuration.1. Very slow. If you want to use this laptop; you need to have 5-7 minutes patience from the time you turn on the laptop till you can actually start the work.2. Keyboard is very poorly designed.3. False information in description regarding battery life.
5,"Best laptop an affordable price range , with very good grafix and gaming experience , battery gets charged quickly, and has a quite good battery backup , 180 rotate  , also laptop has very attractive looks and premium quality....👌💯"
3,Ok but need more battery lifeBooting speed is very lowGaming performance is awesome

5,Great laptop 👌🏻
3,Battery life is good.
1,Not good battery life
1,Bad
2,New is very good but problem is with service ...I have very bad experience as I have faced with my existing laptop
5,Good battery life games run very good like valorant aprx lgeneds recommended to buy a cooling pad because it heats very fast
4,Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good
5,Super computer
1,Sometimes screen goes blank. In order to on the screen I have to connect charger even though I have satisfied battery in my laptop. Then after connecting charger the screen reapears .
5,Installed Ubuntu 20.x as per suggestion for Lenovo helpline. Works like a charm. Would have liked a optical drive too.
1,When I received trying to switched On..But it won't working ..Shows setup booting ....Worst in product dont buy.
4,Look wise its good. Performance is fine for business purposes its getting heated beside the touch pad on top. Lite weight and screen view and camera is good.
4,Nice at this cost but not for gaming . But can use it in every day and office work .
3,"Mouse wkg very very slow. HP genuine charger not supplied.Out of two batteries, one,we can not use. Other battery working only for 1 and half an hour even single program ---Hearing MP3 songs. I will write more about using it further. Booting not a problem. Sound quality best. Amazon and Flipkart application included with MS Office are available in HP Laptop."
4,"No original charger, windows 10 instead of claimed windows 8, proper response on queries."
5,Product condition is very good with nominal price. It looks like as new laptop and not refurbished.
1,Adopter not working
4,Product is good and more then i expected onlybon view
5,"The laptop is good, better than my expectations, is sleek and OS loads quickly.  Good for normal work, Roblox and other light games. Serious games not tried."
1,"I notice that the laptop screen is yellowish as compared to my other laptop even though the night light setting is OFF. I have tried calibrating the display, turning off nightlight and adjusting the color temperature in the display settings."
5,"Initially I was sceptical to buy this machine. I was thinking too low for an i3 processor, but let me tell you this is a fairly fast machine, comes with latest generation i3 processor. Apps open quiet fast and machine boot up time is under 10sec, shut down time is 2-3sec.Fingerprint is blazing fast.Good battery back up was one of my main objective and it is giving me a battery back up of 7-8 hours with normal use. It comes with a 65W type c charger, takes 2 hour from 0 to 95%.Display is brilliant, haven’t used it in outdoor conditions yet.Digital pen works brilliantly, it comes for free which is an added advantage.Overall a fairly good laptop choice if you want touchscreen in a tight budget. Go for it if you want a laptop for normal use and not for gaming, video editing stuff.Cons:Ram is soldered and cannot be expanded. So do not buy anything less than 8GB. I wish it came in 16GB version as well.No stand/holder for digital pen.Low quality web camera.  Camera is a necessity in today’s world and Lenovo needs to work on its quality."
4,Laptop screen: 14 inches2 in 1 laptop can be used as a laptop and even as a tabletRam: 8 GBProcessor i3 11 generation dual core is so fast (plz refer intel website for clock speed and other details)Storage: Thanks to Pcle SSD. But storage capacity is less of 256 GBAccessories: digital pen which runs smoothly over touch screenFingerprint sensor: very fastSound quality: very good and loud...front firing speakersWeight: seems heavy than 1.5 kgPorts for pendrive: only 2 availableCharging: through type c 65 watt chargerMS office not included as mentioned in website..you have to purchase it seperatelyRemarks: fast laptop for those who will only browse internet with multiple tabs and use for office works...laptop is not for a gamer
5,A very good product. 2in1 with styles with capability to write free hand anywhere including word document is great. Very good product with fast response to anything I tried so far. Lenovo experience is far superior than experiences I got after purchasing HP laptops (most of the time a frustrating one).
1,"Invoice date: 26-April-2021Delivery date: 03-May-2021As per Amazon/Lenovo, the Warranty is 1 year from date of purchase.When checked Lenovo site, Warranty remains only for 9 month not 12 months.Warranty start date says Feb-2021. Is it refurbished product?"
1,"Within 8 days of buying this product the Keyboard has stopped working. Some keys are working some are not and worst part I cannot even ask for a replacement, because the return window is closed. Would request Amazon to please help."

3,specifications is good.performance is good as well but battery life is below average. maximum 4 hours.
5,"I like the versatility of this laptop... Has been working well, primarily using to take down notes and ideas. Did not try playing games or such, but I believe it can perform well in those also..."
4,"Everything is good the pen, touchscreen, and the keyboard  but I don't like the blacklight timeout it's for 15 sec then it's off at least they should give the otion to customize it"
1,Poor quality of service by Amazon....broken stylus pen and Amazon not returning the order for 20 days now
2,"Both time products provided we’re having 8 months of warranty, stylus/pen was broken for second time, product is very good but better to purchase from Lenovo site"
1,Screen quality looks like qvga display and touch no responsive and zoom meetings ended abruptly .Not worth of 50K .

3,Dissatisfied in camera and speaker
1,"I had purchased laptop on 18th June 2020 first day of launch & received on 25th June 2020. After 2 days, OS was updated automatically & I faced Automatic Repair Issue.I asked for replacement & Amazon promptly replaced 3-4 days. But again after OS update... I am getting same issue."
1,"Day 1. Laptop showed Bluescreen within an hour of use and crashed. Not even able to perform automatic repair on Windows.Build quality is great and display is amazing, but what good is it if it doesn't work?Thanks to Amazon for accepting the return."
5,"One of the best laptop ever used, android studio, emulator,adobe premiere pro working on beast, no lag observed. Rendering time is also commendable."
2,"Speed not up to the mark,No backlit keyboard,No in built cam,Track oad is very cheap in build quality,No lifetime Microsoft office.High on specs but good for nothing.Mi has really disappointed."
5,Superb quality.. and value for money..  I think best laptop in this budget.. go for this 🔥🔥🔥🔥
3,"Value for money.Super fast booting, hardly takes 10-12 seconds.Easy to open with one finger, hinges are butter smooth.No complaints about webcam, perfect for video call & online classes for kids.Sleek & handy.Excellent pixel size. Though screen is 14 inches, it gives a large view.Sound quality is good.My rating 3.5 stars because of below cons:No backlit.Scroll pad quality is poor, while you click it gives different 'tik' sound.Battery doesn't last for 10 hrs as what they shown in promotion. Max 5-6 hrs.RAM & SSD can't be upgraded.Charger knob is hard. Very difficult to plug & unplug from laptop.Can't place it on the lap not more than 10 mins, getting hot & makes you uncomfortable."
4,"When I first saw the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition, I thought the laptop would be as expensive as the Dell XPS 13 or a MacBook Air. It’s got an aluminum build, an extremely comfortable keyboard, latest Intel processors, and a screen with the thinnest bezels in the market. All of those features, I just mentioned, are trademark of any high-end laptop these days. The Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition doesn’t cost as much as some of its rivals, but still offers excellent performance in a thin and light package.Pros:- 14-inch FHD Anti-glare display with minimal bezels- Intel Core i7 (10th generation)- 512GB NVMe SSD- Nvidia GeForce MX350- 1.35kg- Up to 10 hours of battery (practically lasts somewhere around 6-8 hours depending on your work)- Premium looks- Well priced (I won't call agressive pricing though)- Beautiful scissor-style keyboard with 1.3mm key travelCons:- No backlit keyboard in 2020 is a crime- Lack of a built-in webcam. Sure Xiaomi does provide a USB-enabled HD webcam in the box with the laptop but it's not the something one would like after paying this much- The notebook also lacks a physical fingerprint scanner as well which is again a bummer for the price and this time and age- The biggest downside of the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition is that there is no way to expand the notebook’s 8GB of 2666MHz DDR4 RAM as it's soldered to the board- The audio system on the notebook is weak. The stereo speakers don’t get loud. Plus, they lack bassThe laptop has a good design, better processing power and keyboard than every other Windows laptop in this price bracket. The Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition doesn’t cost as much as some of its rivals, but still offers excellent performance in a thin and light package. I'd certainly recommend this to anyone within this price bracket."
5,"I used it for 4 days, continuously for 7-8 hrs each day, does not heat much, was able to run Virtual Machine as well using VMware, Ram is not upgradable as its low powered module which is soldered on the board so this is China dumping low end models to India. I saw that in China, similar model with very high end specs in terms of Memory (16-32GB) and SSD capacity (1TB) are also available. Windows is Home version and not Pro which sucks if you like to use RDP on your laptop. There is no backlight in the keyboard which is a crime in 60k, keyboard is very small for people with big fingers, I would say if you have 60k for this, add 15-20k more and go for ASUS gaming model which comes with backlight keyboard and 16GB memory, has 15 inch IPS Screen. I would say this is a good ultrabook for office productivity, and low end games, but if you have to go for long term investment which can be upgraded in future, dont buy this model."
5,"Pros:1. Intel Core i72.10th Gen3.Light weight4. SSD5.Value for moneyAt this price the same config is not available in other brandsCons :1.Back lit keyboard,2. inbuilt web cam but the same is somewhat beneficial too.3.Lesser storage space,4.no ms office inbuilt (only one month trial version available)5.No logo.6.Small sized up down cursors."
5,One should purchase laptop what one should need. It may be not good for other but it is best deal for me. Before buying I went to apple store and local shops. Local shops were selling old asus zenbook. I needed light weight notebook.First of all I am touch typist so I don't need backlight keyboard. So backlight keyboard is not necessary for me. It has scissor mechanism keyboard. It is better than chiclet keyboard. It feels like heaven to type. May be that's the reason that they don't provided backlight. But they should provide backlight keyboard if they could but I am not sure whether scissor mechanism can provide backlight.It has two usb 3.1 gen 1 port which are 5 gbs. I wish they could be usb 3.2 gen 2 but I am not sure. Let purchase me external ssd of usb 3.2 gen 2.Battery life gave whole day. I didn't calculate. I am habitual of low brightness  so my battery time will be more.Most of the people are complaining about touchpad. It is flimsy. But they should read manuel. It is flimsy because it gives click sound when you tap it. For right click you have to touch with double finger. I think touchpad is good. It is different and unique from other.Lets talk about processor. The core i7 is beast. All work are superfast. I can't compare with ryzen processor which come with 7nm technology because I don't have one but this 14nm are good. But they do heat.GPU is very good. It's MX350.The best part is SSD . It has toshiba NVME gen 3 SSD which read write speed is 3500 MBps. That's amazing. Other provide SSD upto 1000 MBps.It has intel wireless 9560 card which provide wifi speed upto 1.7 gbps. Who need more speed than that. In India we are getting optical speed of 100-100 mbps.I downloaded games at 250mbps connection and laptop was getting warm. So who need wifi 6? Wifi 6 can support 2.4gbps. Moreover wifi6 it is not sure whether they have put good antenna. If antenna is not good on wifi than there is no use of wifi card.The thing that is missing is type c charging. But the charger supplies charges very fast and we don't have type c fast charger. It has mx 350 so we can play games so we can't charge with type c. Type c cable are short in length  due the reason they transmit data and the supplied charger have lot of length. If thunderbolt is needed than buy apple because it has graphic card and one who is buying this can't afford external graphic card or 5k tv. This is budget laptop. If you are complaining about 1.4b hdmi port than mx 350 can support only hdmi 1.4b. You are getting a lot in ₹ 60000. They have kept essential things and removed non essential items and targetted the needs of people of mind.I was skeptical to buy this due to anti Chinese movement but than thought and bought it and reasons I would not share here. I am not anti national to buy Chinese product. There were options like acer swift 5 but they increased the price by 5k and asus vivobook 14 they also increased by 5k. I thought a lot over it and my justification are only justified to me. I don't want to explain to anyone and I am not anti nationalist to buy Chinese product. I don't recommend this product as it is Chinese product but I have bought this product due to my personal reason. I will recommend only if you think about it and you have no issue in buying Chinese product.And the last thing is design. It design is more premium than apple macbook. Its like you are holding macbook. It is lightweight and metal built and carries 1.35 kg. It has 91% screen to body radio which seems so nice but it can't hold webcam. I don't use webcam and I have privacy issue so it is best for me. So the one who are buying for online classes please think before buying. Even I didn't opened the webcam cable.
1,Don't buy it.. company is misleading it's customer. Earthing problem is very often if working on a table u will feel many shocks in a single day.No protective grill inside laptop which don't prevent motherboard from dust.Graphic card is mx350 which is only for games which in terms don't support content creation like youtube videos on obs and other softwares.If u want to buy go for ryzen 7 8 core processor which takes half the time in tasks like video rendering even the ryzen 5 series perform better than this.Also processor is i7u u means it is designed to save energy if u want to go for i7 go for i7H and graphic card of rtx series but don't buy mx series because it don't support video recording otherwise you will regret later.
5,"Plenty of reviews already out there, but thought I should share my opinions on the device as well, since a few questions that I had in mind could not be resolved from the existing reviews, both on Amazon and Youtube etc.Disclaimer: I'm writing this review after about 25 days of extensive usage. I bought the base variant of the Notebook 14 Horizon during the Prime Day Sale, because it was running on an extra 2k discount and the 7k price difference to the next variant did not seem justified. I got it for 49.5ish thousand after factoring in amazon icici card cashback. Also, the 5 star rating is as per my expectations from the device, since I already knew what I was buying with this package.Pros:1. The display is IPS, or at least acts and feels like one. Though Mi website mentions that the laptop has 178 degree viewing angle, I could not find the mention of the display being an IPS one in any official listing. But I can confirm, the display has no viewing angle issues at all, is perfectly bright for the rare time you might need to use it outdoor, and the anti-glare aspect of it works like a charm.2. Performs really well. I consider myself a non-graphic hungry power user. Android Virtual Device runs butter smooth, more so on Ubuntu/Linux than on Windows.. Apps/software open real quick. Boot time is commendable.3. Lightweight helps make it super comfortable. If you use your laptop for 10-12 hours a day, you'd know how you end up placing it on your lap (or even tummy? or is that just me?). I was confused between going for a regular thick bodied laptop in the 60k price range that come with much better graphic processing capabilites. But time and again, I find myself feeling glad about my choice.4. If you think you'd like to play some games occasionally, and 120 Hz 120 fps at ultra settings isn't your requirement, you'd do alright with this one. I played Far Cry 5 and GTA V on this laptop, albeit with low graphic settings, but barely any stuttering, if at all, was felt.Cons (mostly nitpicking):1. The minimum brightness of the screen is still too bright. I use Dimmer to lower it further, mostly works except for the still-a-bit-too-bright mouse pointer. (Update: dims to a real low point natively on Ubuntu)2. I miss the dedicated Home End Page Up Page Down keys that were present on my previous 14 inch laptop.3. Speaker output is wayyy too low, in that even the voice of a person is barely audible in most youtube videos. I resolved this by opening the DTS Audio Processing app that comes pre-installed with the laptop, and amping up everything in the Graphic Equalizer to the max. Worked wonders to increase the maximum sound output, without causing any noticeable distortion in the sound output. I often find myself keeping the volume at the 70% mark now. (Update: On Ubuntu, install PulseEffects, enable auto gain, set Target to -17 and both Input and Output to 4, for a much louder yet clear sound output)No BSOD errors till date.Would update this review if I stumble upon something else. If you want to install Linux/Ubuntu, the option to disable secure boot will be editable once you set an administrator password in the BIOS settings. You can remove that password by entering a blank new password once you disable the secure boot.Conclusion: For the given price point, at the time of writing (September 2020), I wholeheartedly recommend this laptop, given you know what you are buying. It performs just how you think it would, given its specifications."
1,"Not reliable, purpose not solved, crashed"
3,Gud but battery backup is not gud only 3 hours instead of 12 hours
1,"Never ever buy this product, it has stopped working. Worst product service too"
3,The laptop is over all very good.:But few  points to note:1. The sound is not that much good. It will be difficult to listen properly in a conf call/meeting. Specially for our little kids who are doing online classes.We had to use another speaker or head set.2. The touch pad is little buggy. while moving the mouse pointer it sometime drags objects under it. This might create problem when you are in hurry.3. Camera was OK. But you have to remember to attach the camera.4. The battery back up is excellent. But if you are playing game then it drains 50% of battery in 30 minutes. It may be normal in comparison with other laptop but I'm not too sure.Other than these points still did not find any problem in last 14 days.
4,After using Laptop for one week below are my viewsPros:1:Light Weight2:No heating3:Premium Look4:Display also goodCons:1:Sound Quality could have been better2:Touch pad is not Goodoverall good value for the money
5,One of the best pc in this price range. Battery is enough not bad. It is something allrounder.
1,They won't provide you Web Cam when you buy the Product..It is mentioned that you will get web cam along with the laptop..but you won't receive it.. Amazon or Xiaomi should fix this problem
5,"I had purchased this laptop on first day launch.it is showing amazing performance i have no issues with this laptop, display quality is also good and no lag issues when gaming.i have satisfied with this laptop"
4,"This laptop is feeling awesome like Apple Macbook.I purchased i5 variant. I am not a Hardcore Gamer, not a professional, no any Graphical work. This Laptop satisfy my expectations. Before I used Acer laptop i3 variant which is plastic. But it is Metal which feels great like premium. What a bezel less screen ❤️.without thinking just go for it. No issues found in this laptop. But there are some Cons:-No backlit keyboard.8gb ram .Not upgradeable.512gb SSD which is not  enough but there ar no extra slot."
5,"After searching for one week , 4 hours each day I finally orders this laptop on next day of my 24th Bday for 60k 💥, here's the reviewActually I got admission in IIT Bombay Mtech and needed a laptop which can handle satellite images processing wellPros :--Screen is best , display is amazing, 91% screen to body ratio is killer in looks..-i7 processor is what made me fan of this laptop, as many renowned companies are providing i5 10th gen or below at this price and this is above standards in this price range and futuristic too..- 512 GB nvme SSD is good as most companies offer 256 GB only in this range .- Gforce mx350 graphics card is excellent for gaming and my image graphics work too , I personally have played very less games over it but I have seen people on YouTube playing gta5 , pubg smoothly over it ..- Battery life is good , but this will be too early to comment on this but atleast charging rate is fast- light weight and slim , also plain panel of screen is classic look (some may like llogo of apple , etc but I like this classic professional look )-Cons :-- NO BACKLIT KEYBOARD ,  this is absolutely disgusting about this laptop as I personally like keyboard lighting even at not so dark environment and in night it is miserable . So u need time to adjust with this machine and set it hands with keyboard then only u will be comfortable with it as I type after seeing keys and this becomes intolerable sometimes 😁-Internet runs somewhat slower on it , when I download from ms official site then download speed is better than my phone but from other not so popular sites it shows slower speed , idk why . But YouTube 4k video runs amazingly smooth ..,- HEATING is not a problem during regular use but as soon as u switch on the game the fans start at its full speed and laptop gets instantaneously hot at hinge part of screen this heat is expected I guess but 2 fans could have better dealt it- No ms office , free wps office need downloaded-TRACKPAD is not upto the mark for this price , u will need a mouse anyway- sound is low nearly equal to phone- Ram is not upgradable , presently I don't find it a problem but according to many youtubers this is not futuristic and will hamper the full utilisation of i7 processorFinal verdict : If I was to again but a laptop then also I will buy this only as it is a performance oriented machine and I m using MI phone from 2yrs + and still it works like new so I had built a sort of trust in this company now let's see how it fulfills this trust in laptop"
1,Pathetic!It's just been 8 or 9 days and it's not working well now.Today it came to become too miserable to even get shut down and even keys stopped working!I regret I bought it. I don't recommend this to anyone!!
1,"This is after almost 10 months of usage. This is a long post but please do read it. You have to know this about their customer care before buying this deviceSound quality and battery life are horrible. The laptop cannot be used without ear phones or external speakers. My power cord stopped working before 1 year of use. My customer care experience has been THE WORST.I made an appointment on the website at a service centre. When I went to the centre, they said that the company shut down their server. I don’t understand why they booked my slot at this particular centre when they had shut down their server themselves! Talking to customer care agent was useless, as all she did was book another appointment, which I could have very much done by myself.The second service centre needed 2 days to just figure out what the problem is when it was obvious that the power cord had to be replaced. I had to go up and down almost three times just for this!Firstly, it is clear on the website and my warranty card that the charger is covered under warranty for one year. I was told it was only for 6 months. After a lot of argument, they were willing to replace it (more like they had no choice). It is taking them more than 10 days to replace a charger that is covered under warranty fair and square despite the fact that there are TWO service centres and a mi showroom here in my place.There is no kind of status tracking available on the website. The service centre executives will not call you and update you regarding the status. They will make it look it is your job to keep calling them to find out the status. And now, when I called them, they said only half the charger has arrived and the other half is yet to come. Its taking them more than 10 days to get a simple charger replacement!My laptop has been put of charge since a week and everything is stalled for me. They expect me to go to the centre and get it charged if I want to charge it. What kind of nonsense is this!I have learnt my lesson. Although the specs are good at a reasonable price, please never go for companies like this that are not trustworthy. Prefer other brands that know what they are doing. These people are even more clueless than us!"
5,"I purchased it a month ago and after doing little test and trail i am writing this review.Before buying it, i was checking many options, at one point decided to buy Macbook though its little expensive. I read both ptoducts reviews and web reviews by experts. I was scared of 15% reviews which were under 1⭐ ans 2⭐ category of Mi laptop but i have decided to buy this product along with 2 years onsitego extended warranty of around 6k which in hotsl costed me around 63k. Macbook i may have to spend double the ptice for same configuration. I some how feel its not worth.My First impression was, its pretty little as i was using Dell experia from last 6 years and i didn't feel its worth by its size. When days passing on i realized its pretty handy and i can carry anywhere without having a seperate backback like arrangement. It even fits in your wife's handbag if its size is moderate.When it comes to performance, i was totally amazed and its look and feel is just wow. I became a big fan of it. It doesn't take mins to boot, just 30 seconds, you can turn on play. I somehow loved its giant performance.I took this for the purpose of playing/ practicing data science related stuff. Installed tableau, anaconda, java IDE which are heavy and hangs in traditional i3/i4 systems but this laptop served the purpose. Never felt it was taking time. Just a mouse click away. After buying this i realized the quality and bought another MI product (mobile ) for my dad.I never played games as my purpose is to practice Data related softwares and its eco systems. So i cannot ckmment on how it works for games.Overall, its a good purchase worth each penny. If you are struggling to pick bedt laptops with this configuration and undr this price bucket. Don't think too much  just go for it."
1,Already started facing number of issues. My NVidia graphics card is not working!!!You will struggle to get service for the laptop.
5,"This is very a good laptop under 60,000 this will give maximum battery for about 9 hours which is great I don't find any cons in this laptop totally good laptop just take a external mouse and you are fully loaded you can go for this one...... happy with this product :)thank you Amazon for delivering this laptop one day before I forgot to told about charging it has the super fast charger which will charge your laptop in just 50 minutes I will give update after one month of usage ...."
5,Pros :-1) The build quality of this laptop is sturdy because of metal body. it is very light weight and sleek in design.2) it looks very premium3) the quality of webcam is much better than the in built webcam of many laptops4) it is blazing fast thanks to the NVME SSD .The boot time is about 4-5 sec. App opening time is negligible. the read speed is about 3225 MB/sec.5) its display is wow because of very thin bezels.6) this is perfect for day to day tasks. Don't compare this with gaming laptops.7) battery backup is about 7-8 hrs and charged rapidly.Cons :-1) doesn't have back-lit key which is the main drawback of this laptop.2) the quality of touch-pad is average but it is quiet responsive.3) cannot upgrade RAM and storage.Overall this laptop is great package under this price range
5,Loved the product.....very smooth and powerful laptop....its like the classic dell xps with macbook style .....loved the product but sorry for people who could not be able to buy it ......it got i7 processor which you cannot get in this range of laptops ...... and the cam is good
5,Fast and slick
5,I really liked it.. Awesome performance and very light weight.. Seems like macbook 😜😍
5,Very light weight. Beautiful. Good screen.
4,"WiFi connectivity is always an issue even after many software updates.Customer care is pathatic when it comes to solving above stated issue ....i.e., WiFi connectivity. The executives are clueless.As if company knows this issue, no response from their end to resolve the same .... Even after raise multiple queries during the first week of purchase.Overall laptop is good for machine learning stuff at moderate level.The processor ditches you while pushers for heavy algorithms.Speakers are pathatic ... better not to come with one !For below Rs. 60k .... It's a machine with good hardware and software....but if any issue comes by .... May GOD help you! Mi won't..."
5,"See I bought Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition i7-10th gen, Now it has been One month with it. II never experienced any kind of lag, maybe because I don't do heavy video editing.... This laptop is best for Office work , Students , Teachers and Personal use... You can also use this for gaming and video editing also... I'll tell You the Pros and Cons about this laptop...Pros:-Processor : I searched all the laptops available in India. Non has i7 with a range of 60k and also you can i7 7th gen for 72.5k.Storage : It has the latest SSD. I experienced very fast transfer of files in just a while.(I am talking about whole Series about 7-10 GB)RAM : 8GB DDR4 with 2666 GHz speed.(Just Wow)Weight : Very Light Weight , You won't even feel that this is with you....Body : The body is made out of Aluminium which give it a premium look, And its back is purely plane ...(Which mean you can customize as you wish or if you like it plane let it be.)Boot : You don't have to shutdown every time, you can just lock it or put it in sleep or can hibernate...(I prefer hibernating as it Always takes the work from where we left it and saves the battery very much...)And also it takes 2.1s to boot up.(I have kept BIOS password so it takes longer or it would have been much faster... I just want to say it boots up very fast...)Graphics card : I have not used the graphic card much so I can't mention anything , but I can say this for sure it would be powerful...Display : The most interesting part... It has a matte finished Display, which never reflects any reflection as a normal display do... It is very Bright, so I always keep the brightness at 1 unless when I'm sitting under sunlight... It has 91% screen to body ratio...Fan : While playing any game its fans gets boosted up and runs at the high speed.... This may not happen when you are just Normally using your laptop...Cons :-Keyboard : Its doesn't have a backlit keyboard, but I think you don't need a backlit keyboard if you have a very bright screen. if also the brightness is at 1 the whole room brightens up.If you want the focus to be at the keyboard then just tilt your screen ...Cover : I am not able to find a cover for the screen and touch pad, And also I'm not able to find a back cover or sticker of its size...Touch pad : It is a little bit small. But it is justifiable as if they give a larger touch pad then they would have to make the laptop much bigger and the bezels would have been larger...Student : If you are a student who have to keep their camera ON all the time then it would be a Difficulty to carry the camera... If you don't have to keep your camera On all the time then it is best for you... And also without inbuilt camera we get PRIVACY, In the era of Cyber attacks PRIVACY is very important, this makes sure that you don't loose your privacy...AT THE MOST LAST : this is your choice that which Laptop, who are we to tell you that which one to buy which one to not... The decision is yours... Just check whether the laptop has the features you want or not....In my opinion you should buy this laptop if you are a Student , teacher , or just for office use or personal use... I would not recommend this for Hard-core Gamer..."
5,This review is written post using laptop for a week. I m not a gaming guy.Laptop is butter smooth.Especially display is awesome. It's Antiglare.Battery is extremely good with atleast 8 hrs backupExternal web cam is awesomeBoot time is less than 5 secsBest in range.
5,really greaton this price range it is best...when i bought this i didn't no there is dts speaker option from where i increase volume so i don't like that much but there is dts by there we improve speaker and processor is too good opening time is too less and shutdown time too it's really amazing i like it...
5,Best value for money product 👌..received in 4 days in this lockdown period ....feels solid ....very quick in action ... good display ...gives premium feel when you hold it ... under 60k it's the best  laptop... backlight is missing but that can be let go as performance is quite good .
5,Amazing deal.. value for money.. extremely light weighted.. gives feeling of using Apple Mac.. designed well within the price range which is affordable..
1,I saw a worst laptop from mi products .this I don’t expect for mi . Touch pad is worst .don’t buy any one . 😌 to say i have to use this worst product because i spent money on this
5,Its superfast. Battery is atleast 7 hours. Go for it . Only drawback is no backlit keyboard but its manageable for me.
1,"I have purchased this laptop 3 months ago. I noticed that the serial number on the laptop and invoice are different, So I tried contacting the amazon customer service center, they said they will resolve the issue. They have raised multiple trouble tickets to resolve the issue. Even after three months, this issue is not resolved. Every time, when I call them they will say, give us 3 to 4 days we will resolve the issue. This is one of the worst customer experiences that I ever had. I will never purchase costly electronics from Amazon again. Then I tried to contact the seller they sent the corrected invoice to my mail but the actual warranty p-slip is still not corrected. The only option left for me is taking action through government procedures. Considering only the laptop, it is pretty good and solid, Battery backup is not 16 hours as given on the website, it is around 7 to 8 hours. The sound quality is very good. The screen quality is also good.Update:Do not buy this laptop it comes with a faulty charger and has a serious screen and graphics issue with windows 10."
4,Great performance in a very small footprint. Love the keyboard and display.Only issue: Battery life could have been better. ( My 5 year old macbook air still beats it in that area)
1,"Absolutely rubbish product and worse experience from Amazon.First of all, the laptop has many issues, like mouse and keyboard lag, then graphics problem where the screen doesn't update. Plus network connection issue.Secondly, when I went to report these problems to Amazon within the return period, They had me waiting for a serial mismatch in their BILL. Which took 3 months to resolve. They promised that since problem was taking long to resolve, return window won't be a problem. But later blatantly refused and argued with me when I took it up with them. They even blamed me for the bill issue taking long. Total scam."
5,"I have ordered it for my company for an employee who work on AutoCad and Revit, all kinds of heavy stuff, but being an IT person I have got the chance to unbox and use it for almost 2 days to properly configure with all the required software and test it. The machine is fast enough, great build quality, light weight, screen is also super bright and crispy. The laptop is of consumer series instead of business  but yet it boast with look and feel of a business laptop.In terms of specifications the laptop has everything i.e. Powerful Processor, SSD, Additional Graphics, Fastest Frequency of DDR4 RAM. Rest of things are hardly matter to me but since this one is flagship model so everything remains in parity. So no need to worry for."
1,worst experience
5,For video editing
1,Overpriced laptop. It should be around 80000 rupees. This laptop have only 512GB nvme ssd. Not even 1tb and u can't expand the storage. Best price for this laptop is Rs79990.
1,Overpriced laptop.... Must be around 75k.... Overall it is a good laptop with all the latest specifications.... Good for normal to moderate use... Asus S14 compete it lack behind for Mx350 graphics...
5,"Elegant design, superb performance from the 10th Gen Intel core i7 and Nvidia mx350 gfx. Gorgeous display.  Super fast SSD. Face unlock is superb! And really fast! Great battery life along with front firing speakers with Dolby Atmos. Go for it. Genuine Windows and office. Plug and play. Excellent device."
1,I am writing this review after one month of using the laptop. Worst of the laptops i have ever used. One of my friend recommended to go for msi instead of other more familiar brands but now I regret for it. The boot itself sometimes takes more than half an hour. Hang many a times during normal use. Battery drains like anything. Even a completely charged battery drains itself in a couple of days inspite of not using it at all. My suggestion stay away from msi. Go for tried and tested brands with proper service centers nearby.
5,"Awesome laptop for commercial uses & development.Pros:Boots up within 9-10 secondsGood PerformanceBest ScreenBest Backlit KeyboardGood Camera & SoundAlmost no heating issueCons:Build quality, do handle with care.Battery life not up to the mark at best performance."
1,This Laptop Very Worst. Hanging Is Common In This Laptop. Boot Time Is More Than Half An Hour. Don't Buy It.

5,Value for money Laptop. Only thing that I missed is full HD display. Processor is working fine. No lagging.
5,Laptop is good Asus of the company and it is in the processors for online classes for work from home. The value for money is also very good. There is a very good laptop in 25000 and you can use it and the processor is also good.
4,"Very fast boot time because of nvme. Good for every day light office use and students. Big downside is webcam which is very bad. I got it for 23k, and worth every penny."

4,The Laptop is very decent and has a quality feel. The processor is fast and the entire build seems rather satisfactory . It comes preloaded with Windows 10 and has been able to support daily work for a week . Quite the beast at this price range .
4,"Hardware is decent....trackpa, screen and chassis(all plastic) are better than expected.Battery life is subpar.Webcam is really bad(likeost other laptops)Booting speeds and app launching speeds are slow because of absence of ssd.But once you install ssd....the machine just flies"
5,All are good and it work very fast
5,"It has Ryzen 5 processor with vega 8 graphics and trust me its much much better than intel hd graphics.First the laptop will feel laggy, remove the antivirus provided (windows defender is more than enough) and update system to latest.Note: after updating windows make sure to download Amd graphics driver from website.Tried some games:Gta v 720p Normal graphics : 55 fps averageValorant 1080p: 70-80 fpsFar cry 3: 55fps average"
4,Look wise Awesome but battery backup remains only 2 to 3 hours only.processer is good but they give 4gb+4gb ram not 8gb ram.
5,A bit slow due to absence of SSD but all other things are good
5,It was amezing laptop nice speed and good for mony......
4,Very good product for the price.gonna buy it for my brother and myself. And I must say Avery light weight.
5,Found this great specs laptop with good pricing what I was looking for. Gonna order this for my brother to gift. The same spec is high price in other brands and other websites also.
5,"Super laptop, light waight, nice battery backup, awesome screen resolution, great performance, more satisfaction than my expectations."
5,For people who are wondering what they are gonna get.In the box:Laptop + cover + ChargerUSB-type A to ethernet and USB-type C to audio jack
5,"Superbly built and very light. It is excellent. Excels in all the areas required for business usage.But don't buy it for gaming, or you would be disappointed."
2,the frame around the screen is very weak few months after buying it the frame started to come out from the hinge side and then you can't turn your display as if you turn it the the frame will come of and also the Clapper at the backside of screen is broken now just turning the display and the battery does not last more than 1 hour
5,An excellent machine for the price for business usecases like MS Office and web browsing. Intel CPU does work well and at cooler temperatures than the Ryzen 3 processors that come at a similar price. Go for it if you're not looking for very CPU and GPU intensive workflows like hardcore gaming and video editing as it has only integrated GPU. The system is extremely lightweight and blazing fast due to the ample 8gb RAM and 512 gb SSD. This is a 1 week usage review. Will post updates if I notice anything else.
4,"Serves well for kids online classes. MSO license being trial one is the only negative felt. Otherwise rest specs are all decent. If one isn't particular about MSO, go for it."
4,Good looking and useful for official work and online classes. Processor speed 3.5 is too much. Best buy in this price
5,"Looks are good and its slimAnd charges really fastIts battery life is maximum 3hoursAnd with high usages it barely go above 2 hoursI think after 2000 investment on it , it will become excellent i.e 256gb ssd , it has extra slot for that.Best of the best excellent gaming device minimum 40 fps on any game you play from fortnite to gta 5 it's a great gaming device."
4,"if, unlike me, you care for long battery life and good display this ain't for you. You can play any game on this laptop at medium or sometimes high settings. Battery life ios not the best. 1 hour on gaming, 4-5 hours on content consumption and 3-4 on light work related thing and viewing angles are not good too. But if performance is what you want, then this is the best in the price category!"
5,Good product
5,"over the performance, it works like a charm for daily usage.heats a lot on longer usage, less battery backup, 3 hours max on high brightness.Sound is average, headphone works great as it supports Dolby Audiono comments on graphics as it has Readon graphics which is great for Gaming. played Asphalt and no lag found."
4,"I was bored from intel i5 hence went for Ryzen. Personal experience Ryzen is way better than intelComing to laptop this is one of best you can get at this price.ProsSuper fast boot up faster processing.1TB Memory, 8GB RAM and Nice displayI have not used for hardcore gamming but I use CAD & heavy 3d graphics software which works very smoothlyNot lighting fast as dedicated pc but yes system wont make you wait for loadingI have tried Call of Duty & God of War apart from screen size I was having a play station experienceConsFirst I would like to point out battery life, it is hardly 3-4 hours. Can't use for long time without charging but yes it charges fasterSecond it could had come with better inbuilt speaker. Quality of sound is good but volume is a concern. While watching movies i either have to switch off fans or put Bluetooth speaker.Doesn't have LAN port I am using a converted from LAN to HDMI makes it difficult to use monitor as I dont have Wi-Fi signal strengthGets heated up while gamingKeys could have been improved. Sometimes feeling like tapping instead of pressing.Overall If you are looking a multipurpose(gaming, design, business & personal use) laptop at economical price, this one if good has value for money. It could be more better but yes nothing is perfect."
1,Super slow laptop. Don't buy this laptop. It takes very very long time to boot and then all applications work very slow and get hung often. It's Lenovo V15 AMD Ryzen 5. Very very very poor performance
4,Very good 👍 😊 product . Sound is clear and loud graphics are also good. But the boot time is little slow
3,Volume is hardly audibleThis problem needs to be fixed
1,"I'm writing this review after 8 months from the date of purchase.I never used it roughly. My usage was minimal.From the first months onwards the lap was very slow and I have reported that and the support ppl reinstalled the OS.But the issue still persists.And today when I tried to turn on, its not responding.When I checked the back side of the laptop, 2 screws are missing.( I never brought this to any srevice center)"
3,Too slow. Does not work as you would expect an i5 competition to work. The webcam also refuses to work 3 out of 5 times.
1,"Bought this laptop, however there have been multiple issues. First time motherboard went off.. second time keys are not working. And its jus 4 months since i have bought it."
1,"camera quality quality is too low, and sound is also very low, you cant even hear anything during zoom call or confrence call.do not buy this."
4,I bought this fr 42k in great indian sale bt now itz 38kOff u add ssd to it its worthBattery backup 3hrHeavy usage 1.30 to 2hr
3,I only used it for office work . But it lacks and i tried gaming laptop becomes hot . Stuck
4,Good but if you add SSD it will become best
3,Speed is very good.Battery  average.Graphic good.Sound is very poor.
5,Simply superb... didn't find any issuesJust need to install ms office
1,Bettery backup is not so good because it's working only 2-3 hr that is not enough other wise laptop is classy and good looking.
4,Battery is not that great
3,I has no ethernet port. Don’t buy it.
5,Nice product from lenovo..heat transmission is well defined that is due to gaming..overall nice product..
4,Working good while buying add ms office

5,Nice
5,lenovo is best best than acer elite now it is the best than ever seen before it and lenovo v15
5,Nice build quality and at this price nice specs for day to day office task also for intermediate gaming. Happy with the product.
1,Very bad product don't buy any lenovo product from AmazonAfter sale service of lonovo is very bad and amazon don't intertane after 10 days of delivery.
5,Have been using this quite long time( though bought from local vendor). Just too good. the only point of concern is battery backup. Otherwise performance is really good
4,Super fast boot in 4 second with ssd. FHD screen. Num keyboard. Super battery backup. Most valuable price. Ryzen 5 with vega 8 graphic
1,Nice!! But battery problem i don't like this type of problems and for gaming is 🙂 to be a good
4,Link loosks cool but .. performance wise slow really disappointed.. although return window closed in 1weel only and o was in isolation..
1,"Lenovo laptops are ok as long as they are within warranty period. Once warranty period overs and if you face any issues with your laptop, be ready to suffer. Service centers are worst and they don't have spare parts available with them. They don't even prefer to work with out of warranty laptops. This is my personal experience with lenovo products. So if you are planning to buy lenovo laptops, keep this in mind."
5,Think it's price should be more compared to its performance of the laptop. Ryzen 5 with 8 gb ram is very good.
3,Its OverHeating and a bit glitchy a lot of time.it overheats everytime use it even if ur watching a 144p video it will still overheat
5,Heating issues moreBattery draining very fastI am getting sound while opening and closing the laptopI put a replace the itemLet me change the review if I get a good one.....or else if it persisting with the same issues then will return the lapiSame heating issues are persisting even with replaced oneIf u use the YouTube continuously we are getting full charge of  2:30 hrs  only
1,The code of whatsapp web is not visibleHence whatsapp isn't opening up

5,not received hungama play offer email
3,What app not working. Heating issue
3,It is fixed.thanks Amazon and HP
5,Good laptop
5,Very nice laptop. I get battery backup up to 7hrs without charger. Touch screen is very responsive and the performance of i7 is really good while working with graphics. Rich color display with glossy finish make every picture to see each pixels in details. In one word this is value for money. I don't see any heating issue even working 7hrs continously. Best laptop and very sleek design.
1,"Got a damaged pieces, and Amazon customer care be like we don't care  extremely unpleasant experience will suggest customer better to go for offline mode for such delicate material"
1,after one year getting battery problem. I purchase 8000rs battery. Do not buy. This HP company faile to give quality product.
1,"Such a disgrace post waiting for many days, the Laptop arrived at my doorstep today. Just to find out that the display is internally damaged.Added to the disappointment, I was told there is no replacement available. The defective piece now has to go back for me to secure my refund, which takes several days.Cannot find words to explain the feeling!"
1,"Slowest ever, takes 15 mins to function properly, never buy"
3,It's a i3 processor but still it works very slow. Has to wait couple of minutes to open new blank file.
1,"Keyboard not working. Some words, system full dead slow. Delicate keyboard."
3,worst battery backup
5,Great budget laptop. As lockdown imposed i had to order a laptop and my company help me by ordering it for me for WFH. I really like it. Fast bootup and great battery life.
3,It's kind of.... Not up to the mark..... But still... Not that bad too... Battery life is ok ok.. but the computer is a bit slow
5,Super awesome laptop....runs smoothly ...valorant runs on it like fluid...just amazing
4,"I'm using this for past 1 week without any issues. Overall product is good with smooth performance, good resolution, pre-installed MS products etc. Could have been better with backlit keyboard, finger sensor & camera cover option which is available in 15"" inch variant."
5,"Light weight,smooth to work , processing is better"
1,It says Full HD screen and they delivered with a HD Ready screen.My mistake is that I didn't search for the model no and check on hp website.
1,"Truly disappointed with HP . Its a corei5 11th gen laptop, which heats up like old amd laptops. I urge everyone not to go for this one. HP need to think and change this model. Thanks to Amazon for accepting the return"
1,Worst ever product i got it... They mentioned processer is 4.2GHz in specification and when it came it was 2.42GHz ....and when replaced that same product came with 4.2GHz.And now when i am calling to return it no one is receiving call..... Even with app also i am not able to place return order it says to contact us and which again does not get connected... Really frustrated with such service
4,Awesome laptopGood for engineering students.we bought it for my brother's 18th birthday. He is going to go into it so a really good hit. light weight. smooth like butter.*army refrence* go for it
5,"Very good product. After switching on it gets ready to use in less than 10 seconds and gets switch off in less than 5 seconds. Using multiple tabs at a time does not make anything slow. Heavy word, excel and PowerPoint usage is also smooth. Product is recent launch in 2021 and very useful in working from home or for online tasks. Best value for money. I exchanged by Dell laptop which was i3 and 4gb ram and was very slow. For any decent use the minimum requirement is i5 with 8gb ram and in this product the SSD, turbo boost and graphics card makes it much faster. Full HD resolution gives super picture quality."
3,"There has been an incorrect description of this product.  The display quality of the is really bad and strain to eyes, one can not use for a longer time.  Please be watchful before buying it.  We did not have the IPS version and opted for the Full HD version but it is nowhere near that.  If you are going to use a Laptop screen for primary display purposes, this laptop is not ideal.  The description should be fixed ASAP."
5,The product is truly awesome. One cons that i observed is during the video calls the laptop heats up higher than usual.
5,"First of all this is a very very good looking laptop. The size is absolutely perfect and the screen is amazing, not anti glare though. The processor does its job without any hiccups and battery gives back-up for 5-5.30 hours. SSD with NVMe interface is very fast and I did not experience any heating issue as such. It comes with MS Windows 10 Home and MS Office with lifetime validity. Overall this will be a good choice for anyone who is looking for a lightweight and compact laptop with amazing performance for work or study purpose."
4,"Bought this laptop for my kids to attend online classes. Fast booting in 10 secs and smooth operation. Compared other brand models in the same range, less features.  No fingerprint reader ord keyboard back-light. Sturdy look, Good display."
1,"Received this laptop on Friday, n on next day Saturday it didn't boot up, hard disk error. Had to call HP service center, now I'm waiting for the technician to come n seal the device n get some letter before I could approach Amazon for replacement.."
1,I am very disappointed with this laptop because. I got the replaced product. But it is very very worst product ever. Please don't buy this laptop. Heating Issues + charger Heating Issue + laptop hang issue. This laptop battery is working only upto 3 hrs. Worst class Laptop😡😡
1,I was already requested for return.1. Laptop is overwhelming issue.2. As mentioned in specification processor speed is not matching with delivered item.
1,Battery life extremely poor. Keys are depressed at left and right side. Heats up quickky. Have bought laptops from amazon before but this has been a bad experience.
5,It’s been 3days device is quite fast and it’s a great experience till now let’s see how it goes further.Recommended from my side if someone is confused don’t be go for it.👍🏻
5,Good quality lappy for students as well as for gamers. I5 processor brings in the speed which makes it a worth buy.
2,"Performance is good, lightweight and fast, but even if there is no program is running, it starts to overheat. Battery backup is very less (3-4 hours only) about half the time boasted on the website. I do not recommend this"
5,"Light weight, easy to carry, anti glare screen, and intel iris xe graphics, overall  very good product. Worth of money."
5,"HP laptops are always awesome, go for it without any hesitation. 👍👍"
2,Poor battery performance
4,"This is a very good laptop,it's light weight,doesn't hang in betwee like our older laptop,it's good for gaming and fortnite works just fine on it.I would highly recommend this laptop,and its value for money."
5,Products is awesome. All the things of this laptop is good. Nice battery backup around 7hrs.
4,Good product. Only drawback I learnt is it can't be extended for Warranty which is disappointing.Seller shud be more clear while selling. As customers we expect transparency.
3,Got the laptop with a  clearly visible dent on its bodyNot so satisfied with that
5,Good
1,"Laptop is not upto the mark as expected, heating problem and charging is getting over easily, camera is not good..don't buy."
1,"1st point don't by on exchange any product coz, while collecting they come up with new rule and 2nd don't buy HP laptop they service sucks"
5,Speed and processing is so fast . I bought what i need . Perfect product for office and home
5,"Amazing build, quality, sleek design, easy to use"
5,The best thing I observed in this laptop is its screen quality is the best and I really appreciate to HP
4,Nice laptop for personal use
5,"Very Light weight and performance and speed is good but ,experienced heat while using."
4,"very thine and light laptop,definitely guys you can go with HP this 14 series with i5 processor,"
5,Best and worth it
3,Screen is 14 inches
4,Good with light weight
4,Everything is fine..but camera quality is not good
5,Like
1,"Its way overpriced for what it offers. 2.8 lakhs for 2070 Super Max Q which is just 80W on this laptop? Asus Zephyrus S15 offers a way better 2070 Super Max P 115W option for 2.35 lakhs, and has liquid metal on the CPU as well. If msi can't keep up in terms of specs, at least price it competitively."
5,"The 300Hz display is super power for the 2070 Super GPU, Can play any games super smooth.The GPU can handle anything application that you can throw at.Even the design is super sleek and light weight making it very portable.The cooler boost trinity cooling system helps keep the system cool and running"
1,Overpriced! Don't buy u can build a pc less than 1lakh with these spec's also with the newest rtx vram's
5,Simply loved the laptop. My first experience of an amd processor. Not disappointed at all. Very smooth. No heating issues. Upgradable to 64 GB ram. Colors are good. Build quality is very good. Overall I loved it.
5,"Everything is fine, this machine is powerful. Heating issue is there but can be solved by using an improvised stand and cooler boost in Dragon Center."
4,There are no video driver available linux. If you still try to use dual boot then cause too many issue. It's litle bulky to handle. Battery last for 2-3 hrs. Battery charging is very slow. Not suitable for travel.
5,"Though it's a gaming laptop, I only use this for my work and have opted for the hardware MSI has bundled together within the price range that I'm looking for.And it was a tough call due to few negative reviews that I came across on youtube but now I do not have to repent looking at the performance and the battery backup I'm getting. And all those reviews are big trash for me now :)CPU & WIFI 6 - With 8 cores and 16 threads, I would say it's a beast considering the price band for this laptop. Its performance is comparable to that of an I7 10750H. And the processing is pretty good and sometimes while working on the web apps it gives me an impression that they are desktop apps.Temperature/Heating: With Room temperature at 25°C CPU temperature is constantly between 34°C and 37°C when the power cable is not plugged in, which is pretty decent. But, when put on charge it is very high at 59°C which is the only cause of concern.Battery - Have set the battery setting to Balanced from Dragon Center and the power mode to ""Better Battery"" and with this setting, I'm getting a very decent 5+ Hrs from a full charge of 80% charge.Display - With the power mode and battery settings my screen would look a little dull. But Display is much pleasing after adjusting the settings. But then you may have to compromise on the battery.Graphics - I do not use this for gaming at all so I do not have much to comment about the performance of this 5500M Radeon Graphic. Again I saw few reviews not in favor of this graphics card so better cross-check if you are buying this just for Gaming.Future Ready with the following Hardware Upgrades :Comes with 2 SODIMM slots that support up to 64GB DDR4 RAM @3200 MHzAdd on slot available for extending storage capability. You can add either a SATA an NVME M.2 module and extend the storage.ConsThough the display seems to be alright now, I noticed the flickering on the initial two days of use which did not happen later. Did anyone else notice something similar?Also for some reason, I see a color variance and missing clarity while watching the youtube videos.TrackPad: There are no buttons and it's a little tricky it's not like clicking but tapping it hard at the trackpad for left and right clicks. Might be by design but MSI should consider fixing this for their next builds.Keyboard Layout: Comes with a short keyboard layout with big keys. Got used to the long keyboard layout so it's a matter of time that one gets used to it. Till then be aware of what you were typing.Material: Looks like very cheap black plastic all over.Heating: Dragon center shows the presence of two fans. But I never saw the other one working. So better check on that."
1,"Don't buy MSI , worst after sales you ll ever get. It's better to go for conventional brands. I am done with these service center guys. If you still want to buy MSI just vist Quora and check MSI after sales service you ll understand why I am telling you to buy conventional brand laptops"
5,Its too fast.. Value for moneyFor audio select boost mic option in driver.For heating issue use Cooler boost
5,Only good for casual gaming.
5,Nobody! Absolutely nobody gives this much of configuration in this price range. Looks great! Performs great! Go for it. Dont bother about the power backup of 3-4 hours. Nobody works/games on battery! Come on! We all know that!
3,I am not able to register this product in MSI site with the sl. no
5,This  laptop is good for gaming as well as productive tasks
4,Value for money. However I do notice some problems with brightness/contrast which comes up sometimes.

1,Sound quality is very very poor. System performance is also slow.High price and low quality product.Don’t buy.
1,"I recently bought a DELL Inspiron 7591, and it has been a nightmare. First of all the the delivery was horribly delayed and I the customer care service was pathetic. Nobody answered the calls, the wait times were as long as 60 to 75 minutes at the end of which the call used to get disconnected, horrible experience. The product delivered to me was drenched in water, luckily it worked okay. But it has the worst thermal. Gets overheated quickly. I also tried to avail of the Dell offers Sennheiser headphone. That was another tragedy all together. The delivery for that is delayed by 45 days, the portal doesn't get updated quickly, the customer care executives are uncouth, don't help, are rude. Worst experience. I would suggest noone buy a Dell product, the quality of everything has degraded. Save yourself a world of trouble, go in for Lenovo or HP."
5,"Overall laptop is good, light weight parfect design and best screen resolution. Long battery backup and fast bootup."
5,value for money....I am happy...thanks
5,It's a great laptop. It's very fast and has quick response time. It is perfect for business and official use. It is 512 SSD so you need to keep a check on your storage but otherwise everything else is fantastic
1,"83k for an i5 laptop ,are you serious .Not worth at all. maximum 60k nothing more. Dell just making money for the brand"
1,"Just don't buy this damn laptop!Like why tf u buy this laptop spending 75k without a hard drive?U can even more best laptops with better specs in hp, lenovo....but this dell is just hell of cost with less specsDamn DELL!!DONT BUY SUCH IDIOTIC LAPPTOPS!"
5,Excellent product..Superfast..Good for programmers too..For gaming I am not sure but otherwise best laptop in this price range..It's worth every penny..
1,1. windows not getting updated2. Screen display randomly switching on/off3. Needed to reinstall windows on day1 as the laptop lost its password file for no reason
3,The processor speed mentioned in amazon listing shows is 4.2 GHz whereas actual speed received is 2.4 GhxThat is why I have not given 5 stars. Pls someone explain me how this happened.
4,This was a great upgrade from my i3. I7 is a much better and faster processor. Laptop starts on a few seconds. 1 tb ssd snd 16 GB ram is a great combination.It looks beautiful and premium very thin and relatively lightweight.Good combination at this price
5,The best laptop I ever seen. Brightness is very greater than I expected. it gives battery life of 5 hours with is good. It is very very light weight. The best thing is in performance it give smooth experience while running heavy softwares also. At this price 79499 rs this is the best value for money laptop
5,"My first choice was to take Microsoft Surface. Instead, I have got the highest configured 14-inch laptop for the same price that Microsoft Surface Laptop doesn't. Comparatively, HP provides a high quality, light weighted laptop for a reasonable price. Worth grabbing it."
5,"Hello allFirstly I'll like to tell that this is one of best product from hp that's out there. I went with 2gb graphic card one. Activating office is little tricky, else everything works on getgoIf you don't want graphic card then you can go for ryzen 5 version which is around 20k cheaper than this one.Best laptop in 14 inch category, period!"
1,Battery Life is not up to the mark. Won't even last for 2 hours on normal browsing.
3,"This is the review after 2 days of useIt's lightweight and looks robust.Installed a few resource hungry softwares (DaVinci resolve) and no issues noticed till now.In day light, don't forget to switch-off the keypad back lights, else you won't recognize the keys! Also, after using touch screens for quite some time, working without touch support cause confusion at times.. but considering the price and other features, I guess it's fine.This will be good for programmers or mid kevel video editing works (if you got an additional monitor). The only problem I faced, tried connecting a 2nd led screen with HDMI and not detecting it as a second screen. Voice also not working while connected to second screen."
5,"Pros: Fast, Adequate battery, Display clarity, light weight ( Subjective to individuals), Sound is awesome, NVIDIA boosts it's capabilities.Cons: No Touch screen, SSD could have been been better with 1TB."
5,Best as i have expected.I only trust Hp for laptopsPros1. Light weight2. Amazing display3. Smooth experience4. Keyboard5. Easy to carry6. Superb performance for business purposes or designing purposeCons1. Battery not that much satisfactory2. Safe old charger3. Plastic body but still look metal finish4. If you don't have this laptop at this moment its your loss.5. MOST FRUSTRATING IS HEATING ISSUEI am satisfied with the quality and durability.
5,"This laptop is good for Programmers and it is running like mac pro, smooth multitasking and battery life is good.Not for people who don't like 14 inch screen."
4,"It’s light weight, i7 11th gen laptop. The battery life is good till now. The processor speed is 2.8Ghz.Below are few of my dislikes- It’s only 14 inch- There is no CD room- The graphics card is Intel Iris- The processor speed is 2.8Ghz not 4.7 mentioned."
5,"Very light weight, value for money."
5,"The laptop seems to be very good for a regular usage. The battery lasts long for a normal use and it charges quickly. The screen is wonderful and the keyboard is soothing. Overall, best laptop in this range."
5,"Battery life is about 2.5 to 4 hours of moderate use inluding web browsing, watching film, online class etc. With digital drawing tablet and wired mouse attached"
5,vert good product
5,"Love the look of this laptop. Very compact, lightweight with great processing power. Have faced a few issues with network connectivity but those seem to have resolved. A month of use so far and loving it."
5,Excellent

5,Powerful Laptop compare with other available options.loving it.its not touch screen.battery charges and drain fast as well.
5,Best quality low price goods products any hp  battery life I'd goods and long body is semi metals good product
4,"The only notebook brand in the market offering the latest specs for under 90k. I bought the Core i5 + 512 GB SSD model in April 2021 for about 61k from a recognised HP showroom instead of Amazon. After one and a half months of usage, I can say it's one of the good ones.Although the webcam this model has is the worst. It is not 720p HD, it's worse than a low-level VGA webcam. The video and photos are extremely grainy and tinted. I approached HP Care thinking there was an issue with this unit. Turns out it's a universal problem and they wouldn't change the unit because the hardware was fine.Sound is pretty good, finish looks premium metal, but is plastic... hopefully durable. It's on the quiet side with respect to fans, which only make noise if you're processing something heavy like updating the BIOS or converting a rather heavy raw video file to MP4. The chiclet keyboard is good, not too creaky and the backlight feature has a dimmer setting too.There's a handy-dandy fingerprint scanner, which is smooth and fast with tactile recognition. The display is reasonably good, but not so powerful outside. If you work outdoors a lot, you'd have to put it on full brightness. You probably won't get optimum results even then.A little disappointed in HP Care and the declining webcam quality. Given this day and age, there is a need for at least standard quality webcams. However, considering the price and the specs, the notebook is still worth it.Pros:- Latest Core i5 processor- 16 GB DDR4 Dual Channel RAM- Lightweight and smooth design- Reasonably good display- Backlit keyboard- Decent battery life ( I got 5-6 hours of heavy useon battery, but that might be different based on what applications you're using)- Good audio- Intel Iris Xe graphics are really good. You don't need an extra graphic card unless you're into hardcore video editing, 3D modelling or design orheavy gaming.- Expandable SSD storage- Fingerprint readerCons:- Terrible webcam quality- Plastic build- Screen hinges aren't the most flexible- Number of ports - 2 USB, 1 HDMI, 1 USB Type C, 1 MicroSD reader slot (as opposed to a full or mini SD slot, which makes it a bit difficult for DSLR users)- Only 512 GB of SSD storage- Colour - only Natural Silver, surface prone to scratches.Will update if I notice anything else. Hope this helps!"
5,Very good laptop and you must buy it...
1,SIMPLE WORK IN CHROME AND LAPTOP AT SAME TIME LAGGINGFACING HANG PROBLEM WHILE DATA TRANSFERRING.12GB RAM INSUFFICIENT FOR THIS WORKPERSONALLY NOT RECOMMENDED.
5,"After a month of use I can say that this is the best laptop you can get under 30K, make sure you buy the laptop with AMD processor because the same model is available with intel i3 processor which is compratively slow than the AMD."
3,I am not getting same colour as showing in image.......not happy
4,Overall good product. You can go for it.
1,"The laptop is absolutely not worthy. The specifications and features mentioned in the product do not match at all. Very delicate, battery is very weak, the on off button automatically gets started without doing anything, system is very slow and hangs up. It was mentioned during the time of order that preloaded Operating systems will be there but unfortunately I had to buy it at the cost of Rs. 4000 as it was laoded on trial basis and kept asking for renewal. Totally it is therefore absolutely crap at 30K. Request friend don't buy such third grade products. Even I am reluctant to buy such type of products online. It is better we buy in person."
1,Very very slow. Don't buy it wastage of money.
3,"After two weeks usageFirst of all i use only lenova products (my mobiles, office PC, brother's mobile). But only this laptop i dont prefer because,Slowest to the core if u do multitasking(browser and ms office).Booting also slow.Good things are, looks solid and smooth keyboard.Not suitable for 2d drafting."
1,"Touchpad was faulty. Lenovo couldn’t fix it over the phone. I tried to return the item but the order couldn’t be found on Amazon and it’s been so frustrating that I cannot even return. No response from Amazon, Just bad"
1,"The laptop has some kind of graphics problem..As u can see,it has a midline shadow.in the left side the display is darker & in the right side the display is brighter..I ordered for ""replace the product"""
1,"I received this item 2 days back on its first use after charging it full it starts discharging fast. It's battey life is very poor, discharge very fast.It runs only for 1 hour."
1,Charger not received in box? Is this refurbished ??
1,"Please don't purchase it, waste of money, hanged in every 15 minutes, it does't matter how many times you restart it but it will always act same. You can never work even for half an hour without intrupption. Worst product i have ever purchase from amazon."
4,Everything is good at this price range except the keypad. And AMD ryzen processor is way faster and better than intel i processor.
5,Awesome 👍👍👍
1,Laptop Camera not working
4,It is a good laptop for teaching and office work. but not for gaming
2,Good product
1,"Very bad, slow speed, dont waste your money on this laptop."

5,"Model, performance and stylish lookPerformance of cpu is above expectationYou can go for it. Best of luck ."
5,I bought it from a nearby store and it is a great product. Absolutely amazing for this price. It works great and i am more than satisfied.
1,"Lenovo laptops are ok as long as they are within warranty period. Once warranty period overs and if you face any issues with your laptop, be ready to suffer. Service centers are worst and they don't have spare parts available with them. They don't even prefer to work with out of warranty laptops. This is my personal experience with lenovo products. So if you are planning to buy lenovo laptops, keep this in mind."
5,"Good Product for Routine works like accounting, surfing, online application, online study, good looks, overall a value for money product."
3,"Camera is way worse than I expected, my 5 year dell laptop has better camera quality than this. If you use camera often I wouldn't recommend this at all."
5,"Laptop quality, design, screen quality is too good. Battery backup is also good.Backlit keyboard is attractive and the touchpad is just outstanding.Touchpad works so smoothly."
5,Best for study and online classes 👌.if you are searching a laptop for online  classes this one is best for you .speakers are op
5,Extremely good for official and online class purposes. It's a quick processing system. Due to SSD performance. Best to purchase this model for us.
5,1. Great performance on heavy audio editing software.2. superb upgrading capability with both SSD & HDD.3. free SATA cable inside the box.4. Battery performance is ok.
5,"OverPowered Specs for the price!The laptop comes with pre-loaded Windows 10 Home with all essential apps like Word, PPT, ect.TUF metal and plastic Build!The coolers keep the laptop very cool.RGB is very good and even the brightness of the rgb keyboard is adjustible!The camera is decent.i5 10300H with GTX 1650 is a good combo for gaming and you can get upto 120fps for Valorant.The 144hz fhd display is Killer!Go for it!"
4,"I got this laptop under 62k and I love this laptop, it's jst amazing, solid bulid quality, looks simply sexy, very smooth as well as fast and it's 144hz screen was cherry on cake but it feels quite heavy otherwise it's an amazing laptop. If ur budget is approx 60k then close ur eyes and buy this without any doubt......."
1,"My laptop arrived in great condition but just after 2 days of normal usage it suddenly died and did not turn on at all.I plugged in the charger and jt showed no indication of charging or anything.Pretty sure he sent me a defective product that might've been returned by several people before.So when it died the whole return and refund process was nothing but a huge waste of time.Firstly I had no other option than exchange so as I requested an exchange I received a call from amazon customer support for fixing the problem but nothing worked so now I was waiting for exchange.Now the delivery guys with the new laptop arrived to pick up the defective one and give me the new one but since the laptop wouldn't turn on they were unable to provide the exchange and Now I have to talk to the customer service and ask them to file a refund.So now I wait another 4 days and they finally took it away and I got my mlmey back. Such a huge waste of timeMy experience with the laptop for those 2 short days where good, its a great laptop runs everything with ease.144hz screen is great is amazing but still I'd recommend not buying online.Amazon is pretty reliable and never does wrong to the customer so props to the great customer service."
3,The Paking Box of the laptop was damaged I don't know how a strong box like this can be damaged. I was very disappointed seeing that . Amazon should atleast check the items box before delivery.
5,Killer speed killer look
5,"All thing is good sound quality is nice but not so loud , camera is below average, booting time is awesome, heavy but very thin laptop battery backup is ok , the dhansu RGB backlit keypad is awesome and also wasd keys are highlighted, I haven't tried a game yet so I'll edit the review for performance impreasion in some days.  This is a beast in 62k segment"
4,"Got this awesome laptop today. Took 10 days for amazon to deliver this order, but that might be due to the covid situation. The laptop is a bit heavy, but thin. The ""grey"" color on the top is actually darker than what's seen in the pic. The screen is fabulous. Tried valorant in it today and it was okay. Gave 160fps in medium settings. There's no MS subscription but there's a one month xbox game pass.The boot up time is around 3-4 secs. i5 10th gen with 1650 is good, although 1650Ti or 1660Ti would've been better. But I suppose they can't sell laptops with such GPUs for 62k. The backlit keyboard is awesome too.The battery is okay."
5,"It is an absolute value for money, best for gaming in budget, and for using CAD and other designing softwares. Excellent Screen Resolution for Movies and Games. Only hiccup I have is that it should have come with Office 365 free for a year as how it comes with other laptops which are less than its price range. ASUS should look into that as it is mianly used by students so MS Office is a critical feature for the students.For gaming, i would suggest 60hz for such games which don't require too much usage, but for heavy games such as Red Dead Redemption 2, Call of Duty, Battlefield, and many newer games switching to 144hz with laptop charging on will give you best performance."
5,Ignore the negative comments I got the delivery in 3 days product came with sealed registered warranty geniune accesories #happy product
4,Mandeep ye latop lele nahi to mere ghar pe aake tera ps le jaonga mere aur dkmaag mat kharab kar
5,"What could I say more, it's awesome laptop, excellent performance for gaming, heavy coding and for other video related editing works, got this around 62k, good colorization and everything's great, screen is awesome no worries such as screen bleeding."
5,"Excellent performance in all respects. I like and recommend everyone to purchase this Laptop without hesitation.Great build qualities & easy to handle because it is portable. By & large it is good in all respects. It would be much better if it's weight is reduced by a little bit. Performance is awesome. If someone wants to purchase a high performance laptop, then he/she can go for it."
1,I bought this product 2 days before and the product which was delivered to me was the worst defective peice ...the speakers were damaged and not producing the full sound ..it's recorded in phone that's why it's loud but in love the sound is not good and the voice is not heard and the surrounding sound doesn't works and the battery life drains in low performance i.e within one hour ... Asked for replacement but they gave me refund option .. now I have to reorder this again
4,"I got this laptop for 62k, for that it has a good spec to price ratio. I won't call it a bang for the buck but the price is pretty good.Pros-1) its has an 144hz display which is an eyecandy, and no other laptop offers such display in this price range. For a normal user the display is crisp and punchy.2)performance is top notch for 1080p gaming i get 144fps constant while plugged in valorant (this is the only videogame i play.)3) battery is above average i got around 3-4 hrs of screen onn time with normal use and 1.5-2 hrs wits gaming depending on graphical settings. I recommend to play games while plugged in.4) boot time is really fast. Laptop boots within 6 secs most of the time. Thanks to ssd.5)The design of this laptop is really catchy but at the same time it doesn't scream gaming. To be precise its balanced design.6) There are all the ports you will need on the laptop.7)The rgb keyboard cherry on the cake. This is also not present in any laptop in this price range.8)the my asus feature on this laptop is really convinient to wirelessly transfer files from phone to laptop. And its really fast.Cons-1) Due to rgb keyboard and 144hz display the storage option on this perticular model is 512gb and for higher storage option u have to go for the more expensive varient.2)The storage here is 512gb but after all the windows installation and bloatware from both asus and microsoft we are left wits around 418gb which may seem a lot but isn't enough for a power user like me.3)Asus's armoury crate in this laptop is pretty much useless as there aren't many customisation options available.there are only performance customisation which i think also customise the fan speed and rgb customisation which include only 4 options as its one zone rgb keyboard.4) camera on this laptop is straight up trash though it claims to be 720p but the video is really grainy even in good light.5)this may be nitpicking but asus claim this laptop to be military grade durable and i doubt that as there is flex in deck as well as screen."
5,"A product that stand near it's promises,if you're mid range gamer then this is your laptop for sure.screen quality isn't that good in sunlight,About battery life as you can see any laptop you buy for gaming don't give you that much battery while playing without charging"
5,A pack of awesome-ness from asus. Its made in china. But performance and looks are great. Got it under 62K best perfomance under this price range.
5,"Overall you will get all the things you are looking in this laptop and everything will work just great ......just 1 con is the ""CAMERA IS NOT GOOD"".....IF YOU WANT A GOOD WEBCAM JUST THINK AGAIN. otherwise just go for the laptop it looks way in real life than photos."
4,"This is one of the best laptop under 62000 and I will definitely recommend you this under this price range.This laptop is Allrounder uses like:- gaming, editing, and display quality was also good according to price range.In this price range you cannot get better display quality but this the beast"
4,Very nice laptop but only bad thing that it has a very short battery
5,Display is really good with 144hz refresh rate.Backlit keyboard is a very good touchBattery back up is decentBoots up in 4-5 seconds
5,"for the price point i am absolutely stunned.boot time is awsome. Best in class speakers. and the fan sounds a bit loud but no problem it also have a silent mode.overall its a gem in this price point.Go for it without any hesitation.delivery is also better than my expectations.absolutely love it.,❤️✨😌thank you amazon."
5,Recieved in a perfect condition and am happy with the out of the box feeling. Will update after a few months of usage .
5,"Amazing laptop for the price, if you want to go for a budget gaming laptop this should be your go to, upgradability is also very good with empty slots for easy upgrade of ram and ssd"
5,The lap was truely worth
1,My laptop arrived in a good condition but just after 2 days it's keyboard stop working and now I have placed a replacement let's see how the new laptop works
5,This Laptop is Awesome For Gaming / Coding /Editing . Don't think Just Go For It ... Its aa beast 😍😍😍😍😍😍
5,Hey what are you thinking just go for it. This thing is a beast. It looks more better in real than in photo.
5,The best laptop for students
5,Good performance and speed with smooth and fast gaming experience. However long gaming requires with charging on. Very good product and recommend at price of 62K.
4,"For gaming goood, battery life aint so sustainable overall good deal"
3,"All rounder, worth money ,except battery and overheat issues"
5,"Battery life is Okey , and other things are superb"
5,"Awesome,I love it"
4,Love The Product .......
5,Super 👌
1,Laptop switched on but nothing is displayed on screenSeems display is not working
2,Overall it's a good laptop bt the performance is slow while multitasking and video editing
5,Best laptop for gaming
5,laptop is best but battery and camera disappointed me
5,Best laptop for commercial use and u can play gta V too with rtx and mods u should buy this item
5,"A good one for students. But no cd/dvd reader and need to buy a lot more accessories. Could have been offered more add-ons like a laptop bag, screen guard or something."
4,The graphic card was amd radeon vega series and not nvidia before. Though still happy with the product
1,Worst laptop ever... In one month the keypad stop working
1,"The laptop started malfunctioning after a few months. The webcam stopped working and the charger port had loose connection. After complaint, Acer replaced the motherboard but it did not rectify. They advised me to buy new charger without even testing the product properly. The service centre is found to be ill mannered and uncooperative."
1,"Battery back up is bad, VGA camera, system is slow, I'm 100% not happy"
5,No comment
4,"Good for Educational , Light Gaming and editing purposes thanks to Nvidia MX230. On the other hand , the speaker is Bad and Hangs sometimes when running heavy applications"
3,I bought this laptop from Croma but sharing review here so it helps other people. The laptop overall can just be called average. Design wise its okay but few important features are missing like it doesn't have a card reader and also no CD/DVD reader/writer. Also it comes with NVIDIA graphics but if I compare it with my previous HP laptop there is not much difference in the way things look on screen. I mean it adds to the price but not the the overall value of the laptop. In short you can do without NVIDIA graphics and still not miss anything on the screen.Overall an average laptop. I bought it because I was tricked into buying this by the Croma salesman.
1,Worst laptop ever. super slow in hdd. not at all getting the performance of i5. while gaming it will heat and performance drops like 15 fps in lowest settings. bad battery backup bad performance bad keyboard . i will never recomend acer after using this product. i am regretting for buying this laptop.
1,"The charging wire is damaged...request to replace the same immediately,"
2,"Pros1. The look is good2. The WiFi connectivity is good3. The picture quality is good4. Normal operations are fast5. The battery backup is quite good.6. The processor is good.( Lower version of i5 10gen processor is provided)Cons1. The mouse pad is of very low quality2. The keys should have been better.3. No RJ45 port( business strategy to make u buy external USB to RJ45 convertor)4. The speaker's outlet is placed below the laptop. This minimises the sound's loudness.5. Integrated camera should have been planned. The external camera quality is quite poor6. SATA SSD is present so shifting of large files won't be very fast. Since NVme SSD is absent.7. The expandability is a huge issue in this laptop. You can't expand any hardware.In the modern times this is a a crime( not literally) on the manufacturer's part.Do's:Test for screen:-Make the whole screen black.Switch off all the lights of the room. Wait for 2 minutes. Then watch the screen. If you notice any white light getting displayed from any parts of the screen, then your laptop's screen is faulty.Hardware test;Write ""Performance monitor"" in the search bar.Then click on ""Data collector Sets""Then on ""System""Then right click on "" System Diagnostics"",then press start.After the process completes.Click on Reports-> System-> System DiagnosticsYou will be able to check the hardware report on a shallow level.Same process to be done for "" System Performance ""Note: My laptop's screen is faulty and has spots.I have ordered for a replacement.Yet to receive one.Would update with more points.After getting replacementThe last 3 pictures  are of the new replacement. This is even more defective.Amazon :-Service is very prompt and professional.I have got the full refund after returning the second defective laptop as well.Note :Most of the people don't even check all the technical details.(mainly because they don't know to check and many are lazy to verify even after knowing how to check)Suggetion:Do NOT buy this laptop.If you are buying, please check properly by the procedures mentioned above."
1,"Pros-Battery -10/10(used 5 hours continuously yet 54% battery was remaining.)Screen quality- 10/10....(the picture quality is awesome. Size is a bit small as previously I was using a laptop of 15.6"" screen size but quality is way more better than that old laptop screen.Performance- 10/10( core i5, 10 generation processor provides lightning speed. Maximum 5 sec to boot)Build quality- 10/10(alloy of aluminium and magnesium gives it a premium look. Strong, durable and classy look)Cons-Sound quality- 8/10(average but yet good in this budget.)No backlit keyboard but I personally don't care much about that.Edit- After 2 months of use a blue vertical line is appearing on screen which is a hardware problem. Now I will have to take this to mi service centre. Downgrading it rating From five to 1Conclusion- Don't trust Chinese products build quality ever."
5,First look :1. Good build quality2. Good speed3. Good screen clarity4. Good battery backup5. Good WiFi connectivity - no hassle there6. Good Sound - but only if you enable the DTS audio processing (open app which is preinstalled. Go to graphic EQ and enable it - sound increases by close to 50%). if you don't sound is low7. rapid boot - 6-7 secondsMeanwhile -1. The key pad is slightly sluggish2. USB cam - external so there is a wire always3. While charging if you touch the back of the screen you can feel some uncomfortable static on hand. Goes away if charger is switched off.4. No back lit keyboard5. The touch pad could have been better
1,"Ordered this a little more than a week ago during the festival sale. I ve used many Xiaomi devices so even though laptops were a new territory for Xiaomi (at least from an Indian market standpoint), despite mixed reviews I thought why not give it a try considering the price to value ratio, all the while knowing that should it give me any issues I can always return it.From day one, the laptop gave me issues :1) mousepad stopped working2) usb cam does not get recognised 50 per cent of the time3) the mic is not recognised in online meetings 50 per cent of the time. Only solution is to end meeting and rejoin.4) browser hung on day 1 without multiple tabs opened.I gave it a few days but the issues were consistent and therefore I called Amazon within the stipulated deadline, to return the product as I had lost trust in Xiaomi as a laptop brand and wanted to invest in an established brand like dell,hp.First, Amazon have kept specific windows now to get hold of their team for returns 8am-12. 12am to 1. I kept an alarm so that I don't miss the second slot, as because of my shift time the first one is not possible. The rep. told me to my shock that returns are not possible anymore on electronics and I should have a technician visit and fix the issue. I told him I'm not a person who can afford to keep switching laptops and hence I intend to invest in a laptop which doesn't run into issues as I will keep it for 8-10 years. The rep. transferred the call to the manager. He repeated the samething, dealers complain to us so we changed policy. I asked them to check my purchase history, I ve been a regular customer with expensive purchases like washing machine, multiple flagship phones etc. which I have never returned. So I told them that I can understand if you say this to a habitual offender but not me.Then he said they can't see ""what options will be "" available until a technician visit happens. The other option was an online test. Since I work in shifts, I said I prefer an online test to which I was told there was no option for manager to transfer call and also the tech team didn't work at this time. I told him what's the point of having a specific slot for return calls when the relevant team doesnt function at the time.After a lengthy conversation, I wasn't left with any option but to book a technician visit. Looks like they re going to force me to stay with this laptop but I feel very cheated as I never used to consider any other e commerce company due to Amazon s customer first policy, but when it was really my turn to experience it, this is what I got.I even said I'm fine with credit of my money as Amazon balance for future purchases so that I can buy a laptop of my choice. This will give dealer s confidence to sell faulty products. Most importantly a loyal customer lost is a loss of free word of mouth publicity and there's no data on how many people that he/she shares their experience with. It all adds up. Hope Amazon wakes up sooner than later and starts respecting it's customers again (at least ones who have a clean history)."
1,"Regardless of what review you read about this laptop, dont go for it.I just recieved it, and not really confident about how my experience is going to be but my last HP core i3 lasted for 5 years and was still good.As you can see the picture taken with a black background in full darkness and see the white lights coming from everywhere. Not sure if this is normal but it doesn't give you a good feeling about future experience.Overall, its too much a risk taking just for i5 processor."
5,"If you are not a heavy-duty person, Go for it. It gives you the best performance at this price range. If you can live with a keyboard that doesn't have a backlit feature and an integrated webcam, you will be fine. (They are providing a 720p HD USB webcam separately)Don't compare this with the gaming laptops, their built is different. You can run games on this for sure, but don't expect it to be an all-rounder. The power back-up and UHD screen with its processing speed make it a great buy for people who enjoy watching video content and for coding...Con: I have mixed opinions on the trackpad. you have to get used to it for it to work smoothly. (If you generally use a mouse on a laptop, it doesn't matter)I will try to update my review when I start to see new things. Keep Smiling..."
1,AVOID. DON'T BUY. It's a sub-standard cheap product. Have used it for around 8-10 months. The Windows OS has crashed twice. The mother board has malfunctioned. Had to replace it with own money. Now the keyboard has stopped working. Have ordered a new keyboard by making payment. Have spent more than 20k on repairing a product that costed 45k. Mi Laptops are sub-standard. NO ONE SHOULD buy this. Top this that the keyboard of an Mi laptop is expensive than Lenovo Thinkpad series !! Avoid Mi Laptops. They are just scrap stuff.
5,"Amazon makes us smile and happy at heart with sweet little surprises, I had ordered for this variant and Amazon gifted me a Horizon Edition Highest version variant,I contacted amazon service and informed them  through chat, they offered me to return the product and take refund if i don't wish to keep the horizon edition ,well guys you will rightly guess what i did.Thanks amazon for the wonderful surprise  gift .Now about the Laptop ,its best in class , clear and crisp display, top speed , no heating and last but not the least the killer looks ,so guys go for the laptop and more purchases through Amazon.Thanks amazon"
4,I order for 512gb variant with intel graphic which weighs 1.56kg and also screen bezels are more compare to horizon edition.After almost 2 month of usage I feel it's a good product if we ignore few things like backlit led keyboard and a good Camera missing as the camera given by mi is not great. I purchased a different camera for video calling.Below are my review and rating based on max 10.1. Built quality is very nice. Not so premium bt it doesn't give you a cheap look. (7/10)2. Screen viewing angle and colour is very nice. 8/103. Battery is decent but not as per my expectation. Watching video 3 to 4 hr and without video 5 to 6 hr. My expectation was with video at least 6 hr. 7/104. Keyboard is very nice quality and response is also very good. I was aware of the fact it doesn't have backlit led but after buying sometime I used in dark and that time I was missing that feature . 8/105.One more biggest drawback is no type c charging point. That could be a better feature.6. Performance wise for me daily normal usage no issue. Dont expect gaming with intel integrated graphics. Not that great.7. Heating. Actually till date never had such issue.8. Sound quality...I am happy with a laptops sound quality as I am not expecting a woofer out of it. Its decent and good.
5,"The one thing that Windows laptops always lacked was the premium finish that Macbooks offer. Here is Xiaomi's answer to that. This could be the most finished and premium looking laptop under 50k. Great display, great battery and great keyboard! They've covered all the basics.The decision to avoid camera in Horizon edition was a wise choice considering its thin bezel on top edge. But this model had plenty of space available on top of display to add a camera. Don't know why they didn't add it. Anyway, the separate camera given together is better than Macbook's camera.Getting a battery life of about 10 to 12 hours with browsing & watching videos. More than what they promised!!Did not face overheating while charging or using Photoshop & Premiere.There is a lot of Windows updates including latest version of drivers are pending to install. Do all updates to get the best performance.Hats off to Mi for bringing this laptop to India. Hope all future models also will release here."
4,this is review after using 2 weeks this laptop.1- battery  10/10 its is giving best battery performance like a mobile.. lol2- display 10/10 you are never gonna get in this price this much better display.3- full metallic body looks like macbook 10/104- performance i5 10th gen its rock in this device no heating issue at all not even little. 10/105- connectivity little bit dissatisfied with wifi connectivity with router when internet speed is less it gets disconnected everytime 5/106-web cam its far better than any laptop inbuilt web cam no problem faced till now.7- price no one can give this much bundles of things in this price range . i'm not a MI fan this is genuine review.8- charing time really its amazing 50 min for 100%
5,"For the same configuration, you would need to pay a couple of more thousands from any other competitor. There is so much clutter in the market you will find it difficult to choose a model. This package is good - CPU, Battery life, size, compactness, HD screen with anti-reflective coating.Also, in your previous laptop if you just sync with Onedrive the move will be seamless. However, my major anxiety was about the kind of trackpad having used a Macbook for a last couple of years. It is pretty good - very responsive and smooth.A couple of drawbacks to watch out for:No backlit keyboard (Too much to ask for at this price point)No integrated webcam (will be shipped separately and may take a few days) - This will take up one slot on your USB if you are on video calls. An immediate alternative could be to use your phone as a webcam wirelessly - Quite a few apps are available for that."
5,Pros:1.Metal body(really well built)2.Screen quality really good3.Enough bright(not under sun)4.Really fast SSD(mine is samsung)5.Bootup speed is 11s6.Good battery life(46Whr) (around 7hrs with mixed use)7.Design(minimal and slim and light)8.Almost scrach proof(upto an extent)9.Good performance (least of my worries😁)Cons:1.Backlight bleeding(only noticeble in dark screen)2.Upgradibility(doesn't matter to me)3.Trackpad(tracking is ok but buttons are worse. Feels like it would break. I use gestures only)4.No type-C (i dont care)5.No SD card slot6.Speakers distort on high volume7.Headphone output lacks base and it distorts too.Conclusion:Has some cons but every other laptops have it too(in this price range).I say its a great laptop for the pros it delivers 💯.The external webcam does not bothers me as i dont need it.Not for gaming but can handle older titles.
5,"Laptop design and performance is awesome. But I want to bring in notice of Amazon official about their recent delivery scandals in mostly rural areas.Now a days all the product box are either damaged or is torned out. Like for this MI laptop the outside box completely torned out. Someone must have tried to change to rob some accessories from this box. The main box seal is already torned out.Similarly for another one product of mine, the delivery team has given a completely different brand product without any charger or accessories.Amazon team should investigate into this. I have all the supporting proof."
1,Professionals please dont purchase this product. The screen size is 14 inch and that is very less for professionals. Camera quality is very poor so client calls and meetings cant attend with this creepy product.I contacted the customer care several times and they are not even ready to check the product and they said they cant return any electronic products purchased from amazon. So please consider this review before you purchase this creepy product. Total disappointment. From both Mi and amazon
2,Laptop is good the screen is faulty and it bleeds when we starting up the device. Amazon and Mi both are working good but in my condition they cheated me. When I am trying to replace the product Amazon is  only returning my product not replacing this. Amazon please replace my laptop.
4,"They provide trial MS office software of a month long.So they sell cheap but once you install it,MS starts roaring to purchase new paid version.And then either purchase or compromise your data.The same old story of saying big at the time of selling ,then after the sale , asking to approach other for services .Better buy other Indian product evenif it may seem a bit costly than chinese."
5,"It's an excellent product from Xiaomi. I have been a Xiaomi phone user for many years now and hence i know the way their product performs and this was no different. A very handy product, light weight, compact and looks good too. The SSD provides a very fast boot-up and shut down operation and the 8GB RAM ensures seamless performance. I don't use it for gaming or high end graphic software and hence not sure how those would pull through but for a normal user this laptop is a gemTwo suggestions for improvement. It's always better to have integrated Webcam even though it might compromise and little bit of the screen space on the top. It's not that convenient to connect the webcam separately. Second suggestion is to have an Mi Logo embossed on the outside of the Laptop like HP, Dell and other companies do as this would give the Laptop a premium look."
3,"Well after more than 6 months of usage now I can say that its not the best buy for the price. The battery performance now is quite poor may be around 2 hrs against claimed 7 hrs. the WiFi isn't the best at all. Drops not very frequently but quite regularly. Display, performance etc are fine for the price though. But one of the reason for my purchase was battery performance and that turned out to be poor. So not very satisfied overall."
2,I will divide my feedback in pros and cons.Pros:1. Performance is good2. Display is good3. Battery life is decent4. Look is goodCons:1. MI Extended support not available unless you purchase this laptop from MI website. That too you cannot extend the warranty post purchase of the laptop even from MI website or store.2. The above was not explicitly mentioned anywhere in Amazon or MI website. I came to know when I called the MI customer service.3. Home service is available in only very few selected place so please check this in MI website with PIN code very purchasing this laptop3. Track pad is bit rough4. Keyboard is bit hard to press5. Camera quality is poorI am extremely dissatisfied with the warranty policy of the laptop. My overall rating is due to this only.
1,"I was disappointed to find that less than a month after buying this product,  I started getting display issues,  where the screen started flickering when I put down the screen. The display would come back again when I opened the laptop.  In other words i faced this problem while opening and closing the screen.I paid 45000 for this new product and already its showing defect. Didn't expect this from a Xaomi Mi product. For the last 4 days it is at a Xaomi service centre, and god knows when I will get it back."
4,"Using it for a week now. Everything looks good except battery life. Charging is fast but it is lasting 4 to 5 hours not 10 hrs as mentioned when it is in use.Couple of things to remember, no network cable slot and no card reader slot available. You may have to buy usb network pin and card readeraeperatwly."
5,"It's best. Just need to buy ms office but it's very easy. Just search in YouTube and you will get lot of ways how to use ms office. It's super smooth like a spark.charging's good. Screen is not IPS but well it's good too. It's good for all range of students and workers and was even good for heavy usage. Can't say anymore.Disclaimer : you can get lenovo laptop with same 8gb and 512 gb ssd with ips display, more ports and Dolby Atmos ( this one had dts audio) but has less battery life. It's 2 to 3k more than this so don't forget to compare that to this. Because some like that and some like this. Don't regret later.Well I personally like redmi one more 😃."
5,"What an amazing machine..I bought this a month ago.. since then I am in love with this machine- The display quality at this price is top notch.- The battery backup is simply awesome (at least 7 hours)- The design, the feel of the mouse is better than my older dell laptopGo for it!There are only few reviews for this laptop on YouTubeTrust me, you won’t regret buying this"
1,"1. Don’t go for this product...trackpad stopped working just on the first day of slight use. Called Amazon customer care to cancel it and ask for refund as the product was far below the expectations, agent put my call on long hold, didn’t even transferred the call to his Manager at first, did only after I insisted many times..CRUX IS BAD QUALITY AND BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH NO AVP in place. (Strange NO AVP, in Amazon India, Managers may be directly reporting to Jeff Bezos)2. No Refund only Replacement, Irony is the replaced product which should have been be delivered on priority would now be delivered in 12 days, however the originally ordered product was delivered in just few days.3. Since there is no refund only replacement, What if replaced laptop malfunctioned after the return window? or if within the return window then again the same SOP has to be followed.."
4,The screen quality in not good but experience with this this screen is goodMain problem with this laptop is performence is less than other brand laptop on this prize segmentIf you require for a nice looking laptop so bought this product but if you require a good quality laptop so you choose other brand
2,"If you are looking for MI advantage that you get in mobile for laptop, you will be mistaken. There is no price advanrage for this laptop.Good:Build qualityBad:Screen sizeCamera quality,Rest I will update once I use it for a month at least.Feedback after 2 months of usages :-Battery life is not upto the mark.I have experienced better battery life from HP/Dell as well. No match to Mac OS of course.Design of external camera from usages perspective is also not good...Aaprt from image quality( which I had udpated in the begining as well) , usability is also poor.Overall, Mi Laptop is thumb down from me."
5,"First of all, excellent service from amazon. Delivered in just 2 days as promised, and in excellent condition. I was worried about purchasing electronic and electrical items online but now I m more than confident, Thanks to Amazon.And coming to laptop what more could I say, it's just simply awesome and more than worth the price for its specifications. Camera quality is good, battery life is awesome and the 60watts Fast charging is amazing, light weight, easy to carry, lives to its name notebook. Just as the size of a notebook , slim. And coming to memory once you get to taste the speed SSD , you wouldn't even bother looking back to HDD. This is definitely one for those who are looking for laptop within budget and without compromising in features."
5,"I was afraid that I would receive a defect or damaged product during delivery as it was my first online laptop, But yes Got in perfect shape.!Now about the laptopIt is speed, I use java jdk, eclipse neon for coding and it works really smooth without a lag, mi camera is still on the way as it is coming from different place. Again after a month I will update my review. About warrenty they said I can claim warrenty on invoice in any mi store within warrenty period.If you are chosing for programing it is perfect.!"
1,"Two specifics things which are big (-) for this product are:1. There is no built-in webcam and website does not make this known to customers. The additional web camera provided by MI is not sitting properly on the laptop since the specifications differs.2. Does not come with loaded Office 365. There is a provision for 30 days trial offer. Funny thing is... you can not use this 30 days free trial till the time you provide your credit/debit card for auto deduction towards licence purchase after 30 days.One positive:1. Ultra light weight, you can feel the difference.Overall, just be mindful about the above 2 limitations before deciding."
4,"Except for the trackpad and the fact that the webcam is external, everything else is good.  The lousy trackpad can be overcome by using a mouse. But the external webcam is a sore point, especially if you are planning to use for online meetings."
3,"Got disappointment after keeping lot of expectations,1.If you want to use this laptop for professional purpose like 10 to 12 hours a day then don't go for it. Mentioned screen size is 14 inch but actual display is less than this which troubles to pay attention for longer time and this laptop looks like the toy laptop.2.Lookwise is good, display quality is good , Battery life okay. Sound quality and volume is less."
5,"Have been using this laptop for more than a month and really happy with it.Super fast, slick looking and light weight. Using the trackpad might take some getting used to.Was also really happy that Amazon gave me almost 12000 discount on my old laptop which made this even a more compelling buy."
5,This laptop has reconfirmed my faith in Mi products. High quality finish and premium  configuration at sach low price make it a perfect buy.  Didn't find any concerns with the external camera and it's easy-to-use plug and play when needed.  Picture Quality too  is great and unmatched against other integrated Webcams.
5,"7 hours straight playback on mixed mode (Excel, Movie, Music playback) usage post full charge. Did not hang.Air release is on bottom bezel, will recommend to be used on flat surface to avoid overheating.Graphics are ok HD as expected.DTS Sound experience so-so.Light sturdy build quality, clean lines.Keyboard acceptable, key placement fine. Some laptops have more premium quality, do not expect the same.Price to component value. Good value for money and uncompromised performance."
4,"I am a college student and giving this review after 2 weeks of rigorous usage I will give it in form of advantages and disadvantagesPS: Mine is 512 GB variantCons:- Separable Camera , Detaching and attaching camera and carrying it around every time you attend classes is not cool especially for lazy guys like me and camera hold is not good thus inconvenient to keep in proper angle. Must have given a default camera at least for this non horizon version.- Back lit keyboard, Mi usually is a brand for middle class people where we enjoy high specs at low costs and thus Mi should have given this support.- Speakers - Speakers are placed underneath the laptop with low output levels , they could have been front facing and output levels must be equal to that of Macbook.Pros:- Light weight - very easy to carry and operate anywhere feels like 1 kg- keyboard - the typing feels good in this keyboard- SSD with i5 - Works swiftly carrying any task- Looks - metallic classic finish ( For the classy people )- The best pro is diplay - The best you can expect - with 100% brightness gives very good output the best in classI have given 4 stars but I am completely satisfied with the product and would definitely endorse it for students and office workers who do not use it to extremes."
4,"1. Display is amazing but White light appears when you are watching videos or movies in dark and any dark scene come out on display.2. Not for modern gaming.3. Battery backup is excellent until some of windows update will be installed and ruins your laptop battery life. ( In this scenario uninstall that update and pause automatic update of your laptop)4. No led keyboard is a serious pain when you use your laptop in he dark.5. Laptop charges very fast so, It's very convenient to use anywhere.6. I bought it in @40,700/-"
3,"Initially I got a defective product where lines were appearing on the screen but thanks to Amazon for hassle free replacement now everything seems alright.The best thing about this laptop is its battery backup and the worst thing is the sound quality (maybe they want us to purchase headphones or external speakers) and it lacks backlit keyboard, fingerprint scanner also we have to attach the webcam which takes up a slot, ram is not upgradable, trackpad seems not so good."
1,Its a crappy laptop to be honest.I bought this laptop 5 months back because of the configuration Mi is providing in this price segment along with amazon discount offers.But its not worth the price I have paid for it.As Mi laptops in general shuts down abruptly & also have headphones jack problem.To give perspective to anyone thinking of buying Mi laptops just google NO BOOTABLE DEVICES error on Mi laptops. You will realize that its a regular problem in all the Mi laptops and it happed  with me as well.There is no solution to this till date and if you have decided to buy Mi laptop then I will suggest you to buy a good pair of shoes as well because you will have to visit less experienced customer service centre more often.
1,"Mismatch of Hardware and software. Windows 2010 was not properly installed as laptop was having booking issues. Mi in laptop is emerging, will take some time to come up with refind product. I criticize amazon for not able to deliver the replacement as delivery agent cancelled the delivery over verification error, resultantly i have to return the laptop."
3,"I purchased this laptop and giving review after using it for almost a monthNo doubt the Laptop is very good with such a configuration but let me talk about the cons1.No Ethernet Port2. Both USB, Type C , HDMI all are at one side3. No Fingerprint Sensor or IR Camera for login using Windows Hello4. Most Important thing, you cannot install other Operating system in it. All you can do is create a Recovery pendrive and use it to reset your Windows 10 home to factory reset."
4,"To all the people who were not able to scan the whatapp QRcode in their laptops. Pls uninstall the iris Xe graphics (without deleting the driver software for the device) and then reinstall it by clicking the ""scan for hardware changes "", so ur driver will be reinstalled as well as the Qrcode will now be able to help u access whatapp web in your laptop.NOTE:It's just a temporary solution, once you logout again the same situation arise,Maybe we have to wait for driver updation, till then if u don't logout from ur system things are set!*****************************************************APART FROM THAT, EVERYTHING IS GOING WELL SO FAR WITH THIS PRODUCT*****************************************************"
5,"Major selling point is 11th gen i5 with iris display, rest of the features are similar to any other available laptop. Got delivered on 1st dec on time, there is also an exchange option for old laptop available. Thanks to amazon. Overall great deal. Actual usage and issues will come out gradually. Giving 5 stars 👍🏻"
1,"I bought the laptop from Amazon and I just have to say something is wrong with the laptop because it doesn't work properly and I just used it for a day. It's extremely slow, the apps don't work properly and stops responding and minute and it's causing me alot of trouble. I have called hp customer service and talked to the agent but they were not able to help either. The apps don't appear on the taskbar after starting the laptop, it takes them more than a minute to come. And the audio also stops anytime. And when the last time I tried opening it, the system said the pin is not working and told me to install a app for the same. I have also called a technician from Amazon and they'll look into it but I just have to say that I didn't expect this from hp. It is causing great inconvenience to me."
4,Its very smart
5,"This is a very good laptop. Got product on time. Speed is very fast. Boot time is 3-4 secs. Only issue I am facing is with graphics. WhatsApp web is not able to scan QR code generated on this laptop screen. Though I tried whatsApp web using other laptop and with same phone it worked. So it seems, there is some issue with graphics of this laptop"
1,Pathetic service from Amazon. My invoice serial number and laptop service don't match and it has been 9 days and this has not been resolved. Please be careful. Also the warranty has already been activated when I got this.
1,"Waste of money...dont choose this product,when i want to return this product amazon is not directly accepting for retun and they were connecting to manfacture technicanFinally dont invest money on this product through amazonLot of fan sound and laptop body is not good"
5,Thank you amazon and ARY TECH. for my new laptop. I love it!!!!
1,"The laptop has major software issues from day1. HP customer care wasted 5 days, trying to resolve the issue thru remote control...but failed. And now Amazon doesnt want to replace, giving excuses. ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC SERVICE"
1,Very much dissapointed by the laptopThe keys started coming out of its place .I have purchased this laptop on 31st dec 2020 and in just a span of week the key disappointed a lot 😕
5,The product lives up to its description. The manifestation of so exalting a description is as immaculate as what you feel when you operate it. I am mesmerized by as much of its design as its functionality.
3,"Configuration and price this Laptop is good choice.But I received the faulty Laptop its screen was continuous flickering. Though I thanks Amazon, very next day they scheduled the person and Laptop went for refund(since for replacement was not possible with seller). If you take this laptop then I suggest to purchase 1 year ADP and 2 year extended warranty will cost extra 7k."
1,"Sad stroy with amazon ! I am regular customer i use to take small products , but unfortunately planned new laptop worth of 52,000 INR ,but i got defective proudct and they replaced agin after 2days but second time also got defective and perfomance issue and may be manufacture issue also and i have informed to csutomer service , they are not taking my complaint .pls let me know how to go for escalation on services ..really i didn't from amazon"
1,"Buying this model is waste of money. Always lags, delays, slow slow performance. Laptop not responding after bootup. Bootup time keep on increasing every time it boots.Don't buy hp laptop"
3,"Cons1. Battery draining quickly, within 3hrs it is completely discharging.2. Charging also taking long time more than 3hrs with given 65watt charger.3. Power or Charging indicators(light) are at sides of laptop, not knowing whether laptop is charging or switch on. You have to strech yourself to side and need to see.3. All ports are at one side. Inconvinent to insert charger pin, mouse usb and pendrive at a time.4. Not able to open screen more than 110 degrees.5.Not able to charge with USB TYPE C port, need to charge with only pin.Pros1. Screen clarity is good, with brightness and colors.Almost same as tabs and mobile screens clarity.2.quick reboot , taking 5 to 10 seconds to login or logoff.3. Processor and RAM are efficient, able to work smoothly.4. Speaker sound is decent , getting good voice clarity while listing calls or youtube viedos."
1,Bad product ... track pad is producing annoying sound and rinsing sound while full volume!
2,"The laptop is good. Have been using it for a day and things work as expected. Purchased it for 55k. Unfortunately I had a bad experience with the seller for this item. I don't think anyone properly checks what he is dispatching. The laptop that arrived was already used. Packing of latop and charger were all over the place. Dirty fingerprints all over the laptop. Switched the laptop ON and it said no Operating system installed, which was kind of funny. So it was basically a paperweight worth 55k.Amazon team was hepful to arrange a replacement. But the seller took his own sweet time of like 8-10 days to deliver the replacement laptop. And this is inspire of me being a Amazon Prime customer. In today's times, sitting without a working laptop is akin to doing nothing. So yes, had a lot of mental. Tension and pressure while the laptop was arriving. I had a not so good experience with the seller."
5,"After a week's usage.. It's fast, compact, light weight. The screen is very bright and vibrant. However it was causing bit of irritation to the eyes even when I had normal brightness. Except that it's a go to device."
5,"Though on the costlier side, the benefits of i5 negates it all. Amazon needs to ensure the package is sturdy. The tape on the side was tampered with and there were marks of sharp objects used on the backside resulting in holes in the cardboard box. Thankfully nothing happened to the laptop inside."
1,Super Bad Graphics!!!!!!!!!It's only 3 days old right now and already RAM is 70% used
5,Speed in great due to SSD. Sleek and  light weight.Packing: The hp package was great. Amazon only added a cartoon around it without any safety material.Note: This laptop only have 512 GB SSD without any additional HDD.
5,"The laptop looks very classy. without compromising with the performance. Boot-up speed, read-write operations are super quick thanks to 512 GB SSD !!The display is impressive as well, with backlit keyboard always an add-on.Overall, the laptop serves the purpose for day-to-day programming, business/personal tasks. 11th gen i5 processor performs well for heavy programming and light video/image photoshop."
1,Worest product from HP. It's very slow and now it's stopped working. I purchased this 2 weeks back and now it's not working. Please dont buy this product and don't waste your money.
2,"The brand new Laptop did not recognize the external hard disc drive used to transfer data , which drive  which works perfectly well in existing older HP laptops. I have spent extensive amount of time with HP onlince support going component tests, checking various aspects in device manager etc- updating BIOS version , but problem remains unresolved, so seeking replacement"
3,"Worth buying but have some problems like it takes nearly 5 mins to start and work, alexa won't response sometimes, battery back is is ok not soo good it stays around 5 hours in we r in meet and nearly 4 hrs when we play movies.Rest all fyn runs fast after 5 mins after switching on. We can pay 50k for this with this problem not more."
4,"Nice laptop with high-end configuration.Light weight, better battery life. Ms office with life time validity. Got it at 54450/-"
2,Never buy hp laptop. Very bad service bought the laptop 15 days back and started facing problem in mother board and inspite of having the warranty period I had to pay for the mother board but till now my laptop is not repaired inspite of payingNever ever will go for hp product very pathetic service
5,"It's stylish and sleek. Light weight. Excellent product for the price. Charging cable is short, but that's not a problem."
4,The item was received on 25/01/2021 . but its warranty card was not provided in the packing.in this regard kindly provide its warranty card to the delivered address at the earliest. Also furnish the  address of the service Centre nearby.Request to do the needful
2,Dummy laptop...camera no clarity.... system problem...speakers daggara fan air sounds vastunnay.... don't buy guys
5,My first day of use......Most of the people were complaining about whatsapp login.You can see the result..There is no issue after updation
1,"Heavy fan speed, not really sure if this is problem with this particular product"
5,"you can go for it . it is definitely a good choice under hp laptops . the battery is not very long lasting but if you charge it fully you can use it for like 4-5 hours . and overall display is good ,lookwise it is amazing it looks sharp and is totally worth it ."
1,Fan noise is too loudBoot time is almost 2minutesBattery performance is not so goodWorst  laptop don't go for it
3,"Having some issues related to battery life, working only 4 hrs maximum. Producing too loud fan sound. Unable to start it at times."
5,Well balanced laptop with i5 11 gen and 512gb ssd. It has got the latest Intel Iris XE gpu which is a plus point.
2,Received damaged product for first display problem second time fan problem for brand new product not excepted this from Amazon
1,Opened the box today and this is what we have got . This is so not we were expecting from a brand like hp . I have ordered alot of gadgets online but never faced a problem like this before . Fix it as soon as possible
2,Getting hanged a lot within a month of purchase......That too on running basic things like presentations.. needs a serious re-evaluation.Worst laptop... Worst than my i3 3rd gen
5,The laptop is definitely worth every penny. I use it for official work where I have to run heavy files and it works perfectly! Fully satisfied
4,Hybrid and simple verson of laptopSimple brouser.. entertainment.. and Android app .. if you are light user and not want windows then this is best for you... In this price range 360 and touchscreen is good..Pros:-Price range-touch screen with 360degree-use most Android appCons:-Screen is 4:3 so u can not use full screen to view vedios- screen quality not upto mark-camara is 0.9pixle wich is ok for vedio calling but not more than that
1,Screen flickers while watching movies and there is disturbance like you see in old TV sets. Trying to contact HP but unable to do so.Update: Got a replacement laptop but still the same issue. Still screen flickering. The issue is with netflix and prime
5,"fantastic laptop there is only one con that you cannot use ppt, word, etc all other windows applications"
4,"Short review - An excellent portable laptop from HP with superior tablet and laptop support 2 in 1. Great B&O speakers, sturdy hinges, decent screen, great battery life and a full size keyboard and trackpad. Must buy!Long review - So I have a hi-spec desktop at my office which I use primarily for all intensive jobs like video editing, photo editing, gaming, etc. I was using an iPad Air at home since the past 10 years. I was done with Apple and wanted to switch. I read about Chromebooks online and was immediately interested in purchasing one.After doing some research I came across the HP line of Chromebooks. My budget was around 30k which was the price for a new iPad. After seeing a number of reviews and work around videos for the Chrome OS, I shortlisted the HP line. I found the x360 and there were two options available a 12 inch convertible or a 14 inch laptop. The 12 inch made sense to me as I was looking at a tablet style PC. It perfectly fit my budget and I bought it in a flash.Received delivery from Amazon in one day which is as usual perfectly packed and on time as always.Unboxing it was a delight and I was in love at first sight. Extremely sleek and stylish and I was logged into Chrome OS and ready to go within a few clicks. The speakers from B&O are a delight and the screen is decent for its price. Can't expect a 1080p or 4K at 30k. The keyboard is extremely comfortable and so was the trackpad.A huge number of ports available and the USB C charging is a breeze. I use my OnePlus 7T Pro Warp charging cable to charge the X360. There is a stylus pen available from HPs website for 3.5k but I don't see myself using it so I didn't puchase it.Twist the screen and it becomes a tablet! No accidental tocuhes and a great quality touch makes using this a delight. YouTube, play store apps, browsing, doodling, zoom calls, all available at your disposal.I really don't have any cons at this moment but if I really have to be picky, I would want a better display but I know a higher screen resolution would mean lesser battery life.If anyone is looking at doing basic tasks on their laptop and have a budget of 30k I would strongly suggest Chrome OS and Hp x360. If you are looking at a tablet and laptop experience together, go for this model or then choose the 14inch which is 5k cheaper but it's only a laptop.Chrome OS is extremely easy to get used to and there are tons of videos online to take you through it.Thanks HP and chrome OS for finally helping me to get rid of the useless iPad. Goodbye Apple."
1,I am running from piller to post to get the stylus/Pen getting compatible to the laptop. It's so pathetic when information claims it is compatible but when I receive the laptop it's not getting compatible. Irony is HP tech support had no clue how to do it. How can Amazon go so far without checking the compantability of the systems.
1,Sometimes touch is not working when I am using in tablet mode and and some android apps are not working properly. I am tired of reaching out to hp customer service because I want to return it and get the refund. They said they will get back to me but they never did. Amazon only allows the replacement. I don't want to have same product it's not at all value for money.
5,"My requirement was a device that takes care of my child's online classes during the pandemic and in future. I do not like windows and all the inherent security issues and extra cost for utilities and security mitigation. Linux would be too complicated for a kid hence chromebook is just right. There are a coupe of other HP Chromebooks at ~25k (touch screen / no TC) but those do not flip 360°. This one does and it is just the right size to be used as both tablet and laptop.The interface is fast and it runs most of the Android apps like Microsoft Teams and all the office applications. Configuring printer is easy. So a well rounded device.Battery lasts all day. The backlight keyboard allows working at night without disturbing others in the room.Build quality is good. Doesn't feel too plasticy.It is in use for several weeks now.As of now, I cannot find anything bad but will update in future if I do. Five stars all the way."
5,Good Product. My daughter loves it. Like an enormous tab with a keyboard. Can be flipped and used either as a laptop or a tab. Parent supervision app is useful.
2,As mentioned in the product description this model supports stylus pen and it should be bought separately - I bought one HP USI stylus pen. The USI HP stylus pen that I bought separately supports on the other Chromebook but not on my Chromebook(this purchased product).Even went to HP service center but no response till date.
5,"This is simply amazing laptop available at very good price.Go for it but , before buying read below for my experience.What is the purpose? It's for general computing, web surfing, Web conferencing (Google Meet, Zoom, MS Teams, etc.), simple document editing.Not for high end computing, games, programming, etc.I bought it for kid's school online classes. I have MS Teams Android app and Zoom installed. It works perfectly well for this purpose.But if you or your kids are used to windows then it might take some time getting used to. Remember this is Chrome OS. If you are Android user it will be very easy to get adjusted.You can install Android apps and get most of the normal work done.If you install MS Office Android app, thinking it's free like on phone, then you are in for a surprise. MS Office free version of Android App requires subscription on this device. If you have subscription it will work. Nevertheless, Google Apps (Docs/Sheets/Slides) is good for me. I am very comfortable with it. Although children initially complained lack of MS Office they got used to Google apps.You will have to get used to different keyboard shortcuts. They are not like windows.The screen ratio is 4:3. So if you want to watch movies on this device then it may not be a good experience as this is not wide screen ratio. Give it a try, go ahead and install Netflix Android app and watch movies.You can fold the screen completely and use it like a tab. Chrome OS has multiple virtual desktops so in tablet mode (and laptop mode as well) you can switch between seeing meeting screen and taking notes.Battery life is very good. At least  6-7 hrs. Really you don't have to switch off the machine through the day, but do give it rest from time to time, as this is a consumer class machine not the business class machine.You have to get used storing all your work (documents) in Google Drive. I have not figured out a way to store them locally but I think you can store your work locally as well.This thing can also run Linux (beta is available). So if you are brave go ahead and try. BTW developers out there can also run VS Code as Linux app. If have not tried though.It's storage is like on phone. It's not SSD. So do not expect SSDI wish :It had more Storage. (You can have SD card, just like in phone)It had more RAM"
5,Excellent hp chrome book. Light weight. Very fast. 100% better than a windows laptops. 4 GB RAM & 64 GB ROM.
3,"well computer is okay for light use, but do not expect it to be windows. despite both from google, its particularluy difficult to transfer files and photos between your phone and computer, i did not find anything mentioning this fact anywhere in my research.overall good for surfing internet and watching videos.documentation, which i thought i would need a simple computer for is also hindered by lack of file transfer between the phone and the computer.overall one may use some web based apps and usb cable to transfer files, pics and videos. but impossible to send via bluetooth like you normally do! wtf"
5,"It is the perfect size, light weight and very convenient for reading and writing purposes, it's good if you're not into gaming or photoshop. I was confused if it would be fast enough turns out it is. It's very easy to operate.  You don't need to think twice if you mostly indulge in writing."
1,Not working . bought 20 days back and started giving problem . waste of money.no worth
4,It is a very smart laptop and has impressive features and the battery life and sound quality is amazing! But it glitches sometimes and the body is very weak
1,"Not user friendly, it is for children.you cant do offce work.just big size mobile.wastage of money.not easy to use like other laptops."
1,Within 2nd day of use the laptop got slow... And frequently hangs... Very disappointed... Now return window has also been closed.... Amazon should compensate for this..
1,Worst experience from hp Chromebook x360°.Power button sideways didn't even worked.And then i filled  replacement or refund but Amazon didn't even heard my complain...But now i am happy with Asus vivobook.
1,system was not working please advise hp service center in vishakapatnam
1,Body is so fragile.keyboarb letters are dull.os after update unstable.
4,ismein aap Bor Ho jaaoge ki mobile aur laptop mein difference kya hai jo mobile mein hai vah laptop mein hai yahan tak ki mobile ki bahut sari chijen ismein nahin chalti hai
5,Its a new generation product and preety fast.This is fast enough to serve my purpose.May be i. Future we are going to choose chromebook over windows for every purpose.
4,Great product if you would like to have a tablet and laptop function for your daily use. Kids are loving it as well. Have a question. If I check the warranty in HP website its showing for 9 months and not for 12 months. Why it is?
5,"Value for money in this price range, Absolutely amazing one..I like the concept with dual purpose use as tab and laptop.."
5,Good laptop in Thor price. You will get a 2 in 1 with chrome OS. Chrome OS is really fast. I am able to install MS office. Good product.  I really like it.
4,Good for online classes n browsingTwo in oneTablet + mini laptop
5,"Lightweight laptop, handy and easy to use. Best for people who use laptops just for basic things like web surfing. Although the screen flickers while using Netflix. Apart from that, it is good product for students."
5,"Just one word, its Awesome...."
5,"It's better to take this Chromebook,  than buying a 10inch tablet.I Need screen guard,If they provide along with it, it's better"
4,In this we can't work on ms paint and can't download it so I was a bit disappointed for this thing

If you are looking at a tablet and laptop experience together, go for this model or then choose the 14inch which is 5k cheaper but it's only a laptop.Chrome OS is extremely easy to get used to and there are tons of videos online to take you through it.Thanks HP and chrome OS for finally helping me to get rid of the useless iPad. Goodbye Apple."
1,I am running from piller to post to get the stylus/Pen getting compatible to the laptop. It's so pathetic when information claims it is compatible but when I receive the laptop it's not getting compatible. Irony is HP tech support had no clue how to do it. How can Amazon go so far without checking the compantability of the systems.
1,Sometimes touch is not working when I am using in tablet mode and and some android apps are not working properly. I am tired of reaching out to hp customer service because I want to return it and get the refund. They said they will get back to me but they never did. Amazon only allows the replacement. I don't want to have same product it's not at all value for money.
5,"My requirement was a device that takes care of my child's online classes during the pandemic and in future. I do not like windows and all the inherent security issues and extra cost for utilities and security mitigation. Linux would be too complicated for a kid hence chromebook is just right. There are a coupe of other HP Chromebooks at ~25k (touch screen / no TC) but those do not flip 360°. This one does and it is just the right size to be used as both tablet and laptop.The interface is fast and it runs most of the Android apps like Microsoft Teams and all the office applications. Configuring printer is easy. So a well rounded device.Battery lasts all day. The backlight keyboard allows working at night without disturbing others in the room.Build quality is good. Doesn't feel too plasticy.It is in use for several weeks now.As of now, I cannot find anything bad but will update in future if I do. Five stars all the way."
5,Good Product. My daughter loves it. Like an enormous tab with a keyboard. Can be flipped and used either as a laptop or a tab. Parent supervision app is useful.
2,As mentioned in the product description this model supports stylus pen and it should be bought separately - I bought one HP USI stylus pen. The USI HP stylus pen that I bought separately supports on the other Chromebook but not on my Chromebook(this purchased product).Even went to HP service center but no response till date.
5,"This is simply amazing laptop available at very good price.Go for it but , before buying read below for my experience.What is the purpose? It's for general computing, web surfing, Web conferencing (Google Meet, Zoom, MS Teams, etc.), simple document editing.Not for high end computing, games, programming, etc.I bought it for kid's school online classes. I have MS Teams Android app and Zoom installed. It works perfectly well for this purpose.But if you or your kids are used to windows then it might take some time getting used to. Remember this is Chrome OS. If you are Android user it will be very easy to get adjusted.You can install Android apps and get most of the normal work done.If you install MS Office Android app, thinking it's free like on phone, then you are in for a surprise. MS Office free version of Android App requires subscription on this device. If you have subscription it will work. Nevertheless, Google Apps (Docs/Sheets/Slides) is good for me. I am very comfortable with it. Although children initially complained lack of MS Office they got used to Google apps.You will have to get used to different keyboard shortcuts. They are not like windows.The screen ratio is 4:3. So if you want to watch movies on this device then it may not be a good experience as this is not wide screen ratio. Give it a try, go ahead and install Netflix Android app and watch movies.You can fold the screen completely and use it like a tab. Chrome OS has multiple virtual desktops so in tablet mode (and laptop mode as well) you can switch between seeing meeting screen and taking notes.Battery life is very good. At least  6-7 hrs. Really you don't have to switch off the machine through the day, but do give it rest from time to time, as this is a consumer class machine not the business class machine.You have to get used storing all your work (documents) in Google Drive. I have not figured out a way to store them locally but I think you can store your work locally as well.This thing can also run Linux (beta is available). So if you are brave go ahead and try. BTW developers out there can also run VS Code as Linux app. If have not tried though.It's storage is like on phone. It's not SSD. So do not expect SSDI wish :It had more Storage. (You can have SD card, just like in phone)It had more RAM"
5,Excellent hp chrome book. Light weight. Very fast. 100% better than a windows laptops. 4 GB RAM & 64 GB ROM.
3,"well computer is okay for light use, but do not expect it to be windows. despite both from google, its particularluy difficult to transfer files and photos between your phone and computer, i did not find anything mentioning this fact anywhere in my research.overall good for surfing internet and watching videos.documentation, which i thought i would need a simple computer for is also hindered by lack of file transfer between the phone and the computer.overall one may use some web based apps and usb cable to transfer files, pics and videos. but impossible to send via bluetooth like you normally do! wtf"
5,"It is the perfect size, light weight and very convenient for reading and writing purposes, it's good if you're not into gaming or photoshop. I was confused if it would be fast enough turns out it is. It's very easy to operate.  You don't need to think twice if you mostly indulge in writing."
1,Not working . bought 20 days back and started giving problem . waste of money.no worth
4,It is a very smart laptop and has impressive features and the battery life and sound quality is amazing! But it glitches sometimes and the body is very weak
1,"Not user friendly, it is for children.you cant do offce work.just big size mobile.wastage of money.not easy to use like other laptops."
1,Within 2nd day of use the laptop got slow... And frequently hangs... Very disappointed... Now return window has also been closed.... Amazon should compensate for this..
1,Worst experience from hp Chromebook x360°.Power button sideways didn't even worked.And then i filled  replacement or refund but Amazon didn't even heard my complain...But now i am happy with Asus vivobook.
1,system was not working please advise hp service center in vishakapatnam
1,Body is so fragile.keyboarb letters are dull.os after update unstable.
4,ismein aap Bor Ho jaaoge ki mobile aur laptop mein difference kya hai jo mobile mein hai vah laptop mein hai yahan tak ki mobile ki bahut sari chijen ismein nahin chalti hai
5,Its a new generation product and preety fast.This is fast enough to serve my purpose.May be i. Future we are going to choose chromebook over windows for every purpose.
4,Great product if you would like to have a tablet and laptop function for your daily use. Kids are loving it as well. Have a question. If I check the warranty in HP website its showing for 9 months and not for 12 months. Why it is?
5,"Value for money in this price range, Absolutely amazing one..I like the concept with dual purpose use as tab and laptop.."
5,Good laptop in Thor price. You will get a 2 in 1 with chrome OS. Chrome OS is really fast. I am able to install MS office. Good product.  I really like it.
4,Good for online classes n browsingTwo in oneTablet + mini laptop
5,"Lightweight laptop, handy and easy to use. Best for people who use laptops just for basic things like web surfing. Although the screen flickers while using Netflix. Apart from that, it is good product for students."
5,"Just one word, its Awesome...."
5,"It's better to take this Chromebook,  than buying a 10inch tablet.I Need screen guard,If they provide along with it, it's better"
4,In this we can't work on ms paint and can't download it so I was a bit disappointed for this thing
5,Product as described. Immediate start up and very easy to handle.
2,Not recommended to buy online
5,"Superb quality ,A better lap from HP."
1,wrong description
5,i like it
5,Good one
1,Worst product i hate it
1,Dislike
5,Excellent
3,The laptop gets very hot within 10 Min of uses..I don't know whether it is normal or laptop has some problem
5,"This is overall a good laptop for web surfing, editing documents and working on accounting softwares. All the applications open in an instant because of the ssd present. Screen quality is great for watching Netflix and content. Sound could have been better. I went for this laptop due to its compact 14 inch form factor and its great looks.However it will heat up pretty quickly if you try to push it to its limit, as it is by no means a gaming device.Secondly I still don't know whether it is made of plastic or metal, HP people say it is ""metallic"", even then I'm not 100 % sure.Third, some people are mentioning that only 1 month trial of MS Office is included, for this you have to skip the 1 month Office 365 trial while setting up the laptop for the first time, instead, after this on the desktop open a new word file and voila ! you have life time subscription of MS Office."
5,"First impressions are awesome, I didn't expected at all ..I was looking for all purpose machine (tablet functions, laptop, light weight,  great design)So I have order samsung tab s7 (I thought for good reading and writing purpose, and with keyboard attachment documentation work, and as usual multimedia consumption) after lot confusion, within budget I canceled tab, and placed this 2 in 1..I have seen same laptop in hp showroom with i3 10th gen processor.  Liked it ..But when I received i3 11th gen laptop, minor build changes but looks awesome because of square shape design, resmeled samsung design when we use in folded mode..Okay, now I like the most is design, its fantastic in this price range, full glass display, metal finished type plastics ( may be mastic like glastic) but good to hold and eye catcher in a crowd.I feel bit heavy than mi laptops, and display is only 250 nits, Indoor works fine, but not recommended at all in outdoors,Camera is waste , but manageable,Pre installed ms office 2019 is big plus with ssd, glass display, awesome sound, new gen processor (in single core i3 11th beats i5 10th gen) flexibility to carry.. and pen supports .. good latency.. battery backup is 4hrs max..Finally I can say go for it, 256 ssd, and buy external ssd separately..ALL PURPOSE MACHINE WITHIN BUDGET"
5,"Best under 55k laptop.11th gen i3 is super fast and ssd does its magic, so no hiccups all laptop activities run silky smooth."
5,"Bang for the Buck!It's a great buy at this price point. i3 11th gen processor + SSD makes it a nice combo for fast boot ups and decent everyday performance.Positives :1. Good processor + SSD make the laptop fast enough2. Screen is decent enough, and not dull according to some reviews3. Speakers are nice too, it's not super loud, but good enough4. Touch input is pretty accurate.5. The build and the looks are a plus, compared to other laptops in this price point6. The fingerprint reader is accurate7. Battery backup is decent8. Comes with Back-lit keyboard. Keypress is OK, not comparable to lenovo keyboards at similar price9. It supports USB C type charger. It charges a bit faster too, tried with a lenovo USB C charger I had at home (compared to the supplied charger)Negatives :1. Laptop gets a little hot from bottom right side (Near the heat sink/fan)2. It's slightly on the heavier side (maybe due to aluminium construction and heavy touch screen)3. The camera doesn't come with a privacy shutter4. HP inking pen isn't included with the laptop5. Doesn't come bundled with a USB C type charger"
3,Just got it two days back ..it's heating alot I don't know why...rest is perfect..
1,this machine comes with ms office trail version and it was not mentioned during purchase  and it will last for one month and you need to spend extra money to buy MS office hence returning the laptop
4,Screen quality is number 1Gamming is superBattery life is genuine****
5,Laptop has absolutely stunning looks. Material is good and no plastic feeling as others mentioned. Screen and display is great. SSD and i3 booting up 12 seconds. Battery performance is good. Touchscreen is all great. Touchpad dosen't deserve 10/10 but 8/10 is good as well.
5,"This laptop is AMAZING! It's worth the price and also the audio, video and microphone quality is excellent. The packaging given by Amazon was very good. It was very secure and came with all the instructions. The touch screen worked really well and it's true to its name as it also came with a LICENSED COPY of office and home& student which is also free forever (means you don't have to pay yearly to renew it) Overall this product is great for students as well as office work. And I forgot mention that it doesn't come with stylus you have to buy it seperately (I didn't buy because it wasn't my need) Also the shipping was very quick, it came the very next day after placing the order. I love this Product!"
1,Poor product from HP. Key board design / colours are not ergonomic.Product return support from Amazon was also disgusting.Mr first regretful experience thru Amazon.
5,"Very very best product because in ₹50000 it has touchscreen, tablet mode, Bluetooth, wifi, and 360' o full rotation but it has not given a pen inside the box . If this is in budget then it is the beast"
4,"Heating issue is there. The second I put it to charge, it heats up like a pan. Overall I would say it really good and fast."
5,Good and impressive
4,"overall this laptop is good. However it doesn't include touch pen, so you have to spend extra 5000-8000Rs. While pen is included in the hp x360 (2019 manufactured set) and that too with the cost of 45000. So for me this is not a value for money product which cost 50000 and extra 5000 for hp pen."
2,"When laptop is fully charged and you run zoom meeting without connecting charging adapter,Screen get flicker and becomes blank..Laptop gets heated more when you start working."
4,The back of the laptop gets really hot when under heavy task. Rest is good.
5,Excellent need inking digital hp pen with yhis
4,Till now working fine. Screen display is very good. Touch screen works properly. Anti glare is also good. But how to type of we rotate 360 degree
2,It gets very hot in 10 minutes of usage.... Not a good product from HP. Though screen and looks are very nice but you can not use as laptop.
2,Suddenly stopped working after 5days...start button not working....micro phone not working...asked for replacement
4,received product .unable to activate office license.it is asking for product key that is not available anywhere in package
4,Overall best in this range very smooth no lag and best.Just small heating issue when performing heavy tasks.
5,Best budgeted laptop with lot of features
5,Very nice product at this range.
5,The best Latop ever. Loving it. Sleek design what i was looking for.
3,Camera quality can be improved
4,webcam is ver bad
5,Outstanding product
5,Very good product
5,Excellent product
5,Value for money.  Received with very secure packing and the product just wow everything was perfect love the design. Good for students
5,"Good in response time while doing multitasking, 360 rotation hinges supports convenient usage as Tab(little heavy to use).. Once we receive,  we need to activate MS Office and Windows 10 which supports touch screen.."
4,Worst camera quality if you buy please buy warranty And when you are charging it well heat only little so no need to worry rest is good
4,I am using from last 1 month.... till now its working fine... only issue what I felt is battery will drain fast... so I need to keep charging frequently.
2,"Heat vent opening directs all inside hot air towards laptop screen, which start damaging screen during long continuous ussage. I was not expecting such poor design from Dell."
5,Nice laptop
1,"Pls don't buy this laptop. It does not have a keyboard backlight also 2 GB graphics card.Actully product details and product images dose not match. in images it clearly shows that this laptop has backlit and 2 gb graphics card but in details section its missing.pls, be careful while buying this product it faults in amazon product info.pls pls pls don't buy anything from amazon you will only feel cheated. also, customer care is also very bad.you feel harassed by amazon customer service guys. Every time you call them there will be a different person and you have to tell him everything from start."
5,Nice anti glare and sleek  screen
5,Best product for students.
4,I like this product. Screen quality is excellent.This product is excellent for Home use.
3,Well I got a stuck pixel over screen that's why I am giving 1 star to display
5,Working smoothly. Screen quality is good.
5,Actually it is good for multitask tabs.. And batteery will drain if u use it for longer tym... battery drains fast ... Having a backlit keyboard is heelpful as u can do your task by light off ...
4,Nice
1,Shuts down automatically and there is no display on screen. Tried rebooting as well.  Bought this with so much of excitement and product is bad.  Very disappointed
4,Good one
5,It works really great
5,Nice laptop
5,Good one for gaming alsoAnd for programingFor video editing..Has 4gb video cardGreat productAnd for engineering student it is best....
5,Nice product and i specially like thin border and design of this laptop and colour is also awesome and value of money...
5,"Best laptop ever made..Better than Macbook ai r🖕🖕,but not as good as msi gl65 leopard(RGB) 8gb, 4gb graphics card(Sidechick)"
5,"Best laptop dell inspiron 3501,core i5 11 gen,8 gb ram very fast laptop nice product, coding,photo edit and student user best laptop. Battery backup 5,6 hours . Dell laptops much better than Asus and Lenovo laptop."
4,"I REALLY LIKED IT AWESOME,BOOTING TIME IS VERY FAST AND 11TH GEN IS SUPER . THE RAM IS  NICE ."
5,"This laptop is pretty decent in terms of performance, quality, battery life.The top has fabric treatment on metal which looks amazing.Performance is top notchScreen brightness is pretty good however glossy finish sometimes show fingerprints.Battery life is good, it gives around 7-9 hrs depends on the type of work you do.Audio is pretty loud and clear.Full metal chassis with fabric treatment on top.Touch response is fast.Charger is slim type c but it sometimes gets hot while charging.Price could have been little less however much better than HP envy series."
4,"I got this laptop at 64K. At current price of 70K, don't buy it. I'm writing this review after 2 days of usage, so it'll be my initial impressions.* The processor is of HF variant that means it doesn't have integrated intel graphics. So all the gpu related tasks are handled by Nvidia gpu(1650 GDDR5) and remains active all the time. However the activity percentage varies according to workload. I think this is one of the reason of poor battery life.* For basic tasks like watching online videos, browsing web, editing documents etc., I only got around 3 hours of battery life with balanced mode. It can be slightly increased by turning on power saver mode.* Hybrid mode is not available in Lenovo vantage app.* Display quality is very good according to me(as I'm coming from TN panel), but the brightness level is not that high. I had to keep it at least 80% always for better visibility in a room with normal lighting. It's a 60Hz panel.* The HDD model is WDC WD10SPZX 5400 rpm.* The SSD model is Micron MTFDHBA256TCK."
5,"I got it for 63,990 rupees without applying any additional discounts on 23rd june 2020, which is really a very good dealIt is amazing laptop. Built quality is really premium.But it is very heavy for me.Display quality is very good.It given me 5 hour of battery in my first experience.It includes 1 month trial of ms office and McAfee antivirus, which should be given for atleast 1 year.My model: 1TB+256ssd, gtx 1650, 8gb ram.Will update you after a month use.Edit : After 4 months of use, battery is still lasts around 4 hours and performance is up to the mark."
4,"Received the product today, it is good, everything is nice and flawless so far.But the outer cover packaging of amazon was very poor that the entire cardboard tore off, at first I thought it was tampered with, but after a good examination realised it was poor packaging and was not tampered"
4,"Great laptop with the following pros and cons...Pros:1. Great display2. Very good thermal management.3. Great performance.Cons:1. Little bit screen bleeding issue, although common in IPS screens.2. No integrated gpu from Intel. Not much of a big deal though.3. 3-4 hrs of battery life in normal usage w/o gaming (in balanced mode)."
3,"Laptop is decent, hybrid mode is not available despite updating BIOS (HF variant). Around on balance performance gives ~2hrs. Packaging was worse, tapes were not put properly and they have kept the laptop box in a way bigger box with no fillings in btw so whenever the whole box moves the laptop box moves hard. This unprofessional packaging can damage the product, luckily mine seems ok for now."
1,"Likes include:1) Screen and graphics quality2) smooth touchpad and keysDislikes include:1) Worst battery life. Only lasts 2 hours after a full charge. Btw this was without playing any games yet. I only used it for programming.2) very heavy to carry around3) No laptop bag provided4) The screen hinges are worst and not at all flexible. When u try to adjust the screen forward or backward it feels like it can get stuck or break at any point.5) Slow in starting up. My other laptop from lenovo which is 4 yrs old starts faster6) Harman speakers SUCK big time. I think its duplicate of harman. Again my 4 year old laptop speakers are louder than this one.7) The charger heats up very quickly and it is way too bulky and heavy8) Camera quality also SUCKS.Overall i would not recommend buying this laptop whether u r a gamer or programmer. I wasted paying 63k for a piece of METALLIC JUNK which should only cost 30k.Therefore Lenovo, if u guys are listening, this product of yours is the WORST OF THE WORST."
5,Best entry level gaming laptop.Just a heads up for anyone who didn't know this laptop has i5 9300HF chip. HF series don't have integrated intel hd graphics. Means no hybrid mode where you can switch from nvidia to integrated graphics to save battery.
5,"This is a pretty good laptop. Decent build quality. 10/10 looks, more professional than gaming (due to lack of rgb keyboard). SSD is pretty fast. Getting around 3-4 hrs on Battery Saving settings.GTA 5 runs at 30 FPS in Very High settings with negligible heating. The thermal design and cooling system is pretty good.Valorant at around 180-200 fps with everything at low and V Sync off.Screen is good, not the best and brightest outthere, but it does the job.Sound quailty is above average for laptops at this price range.Build is plastic but feels sturdy. It's a huge fingerprint magnet tho :/Keyboard is excellent and the lightning is pretty good too.Will update after 1-2 months of usage.Trust me, it's worth paying the 5-10k premium over competitors."
5,"I have been using the Legion Y540 (Intel i5 GTx 1650 8gb ram) for about 3 weeks now and I have to say it's one hell of a laptop. The SSD helps with fast boot up. No lag,crisp display, decent speakers. Battery life is just above average. Normal heating nothing more than that. I have been playing CS go for sometime with the built in screen recorder and there is no lag and also coding is super smooth and easy.It does take some time to get used to the keyboard layout but it's nice.  It would have been just perfect if it had a better battery and a bit more premium finish (although the quality is excellent). Amazon packaging was terrible still the Laptop's box was in good condition. If you are looking for a gaming laptop between 60-70k I would strongly recommend this spec."
4,"ProsAll spec's are good Except the Battery backup.We can play any type of games, but some games are need to change the graphics settings to medium.ConsBattery backup not good.Discharging very fast while using the product.Ok ..go for it."
4,"It's a capable machine for gaming cyberpunk 2077 runs around 40 frames at 1080p at low and 60 frames at 720p at medium, despite the glitches. GTA V at 80 frames on high at 1080p. Witcher 3 at 70+ frames at max (hairwork turned off). Apex legends 80+ frames at max settings.Battery life on the other hand is dependent on your workflow, this perticular model 9300HF doesn't have an integrated Intel graphics, so the GTX 1650 runs all the time which sucks a lot of charge.Personally it doesn't bother me carrying a 2 kilo weight around classes, but maybe different for others, the num pad is something people will need to get used to.Doesn't heat that much highest recorded on mine was 76°C on prime 95, while rendering a clip in Resolve max recorded was 70°C (undervolt of -1.135v). Results may vary during summer.Be careful of the keyboard deck it gets dirty easily because of the soft touch plastic."
4,"Writing this review after using the product for 3 daysThe package was delivered on 27 th and was in good conditionPros -Performance is just awesomeWindows is installed on ssd so system boots within secondsGameplay is awesome thanks to the nvidia 1650No heat or lag issue on heavy gaming till nowConsBattery life is averageIt gives 3-4 hrs on normal usageAnd 1-1.5 hrs on gamingFor the ones who are confused about thr HF processor - The F stands for fused integrated graphics , ie you wont get integrated graphics with your processor , it doesn't matter much because anyway they are disabled in gaming laptops"
4,"This laptop is amazing! Here's some Pros and consPros-• The laptop is quite slim• The panel is really good an has amazing colours• The leds on the keyboard are really bright• The performance of the i5 & 1650 are really good, 50+ fps on most games at High - Very High• The track pad is really good, it's very accurateCons -• The theramls of the cpu are quite high I recommend undervolting• The Keyboard is quite mushy• The fan noise is quite high• The battery life is okay, 3 hrs are quite good for a gaming laptop. Wouldnt excatly say this is a con but it's neither a pro.• The panel is 60hz.A four starts from me, go for it I recommend it highly.DISHCAW DISHCAW"
5,"I'm writing this review after 41 days of continuous and rigorous use of this beast Laptop.Firstly, This is a best laptop u can get for this range and it contains the features worth 1Lac and you are getting this at 60k, so I guess it's the best deal ever.Battery life --> good (4-5hrs)Gaming --> I play GtaV and Formula 1.I had very good gaming experience. The brand NVIDIA  tells u all.😁 I also use heavy softwares such as matlab, xilinx and It's works simply great without any buffer so I recommend this laptop.Lastly, Every laptop will have its cons.The cons in this laptop is its webcam. It is situated right above the keypad and we have to bend the laptop much to fit our face into the screen. But I guess it's not a very big deal.Lastlt, Thank you lenovo for this beast."
4,Laptop performance is really good. Its been 2 month i am using this laptop. Perfect laptop for machine learning and gaming.Battery performance can be batter.Only poor part was product packaging. Delivery boy was bring laptop on their sholder and there were no proper packaging.
5,"I have always been a huge fan of Lenovo Thinkpad series since 2005. No wonder I picked it up and as always Amazon did a fantastic job of delivering it on time as promised. 5 Star rating for Amazon service, as usual.The product is just mind-blowing as per my use. I don't use it for games as such. Regular office use - browsing, etc. However, I got it for a very reliable deal and I didn't blink to pick it up. I exchanged my old Lenovo Thinkpad T430 and almost got a discount of 10K. So, net-net, I got this Lenovo Legion for just 47K - which is a steal.Pros:The display is world-class, the mouse-pad is super-silky. Start-up booting is super smooth. Just a couple of seconds. All windows open and close like a blink of an eye - no sound, no noise, and quick. Switching between windows is such a breeze. Battery life in the case of a power cut is awesome.Areas of Improvement: Not many - just a couple:1. Camera positioning is very weird at the bottom of the LCD display. Especially for video calls, Zoom meetings, etc., I have to sprain my neck looking down. If I look at the screen for any reason, it looks weird to the audience. I had invest another 2K for buying a Logitech Webcam and place it on top of the panel. That serves the purpose.2. Keyboard is a bit oddly placed. If you are used to the traditional Lenovo Thinkpad - your fingers automatically land at the wrong places. Perhaps the number pad on the right is for gaming purposes I am assuming... Haven't found a use for it yet - hence it is a waste of space for me.3. The power cable charger panel is very bulky - almost feels like carrying a brick in the bag. I wish it was a bit handy.Overall very much satisfied with the product. Go for it!"
5,"It's been 2 days now..Laptop is working fine...Battery backup 3.5hrs+ while standard useWhile gaming it could be about 2-2.5hrsFor gaming it's doing wellI tested COD, Battlefield,Kingdom Come Deliverance  and it is working fine, lags a bit sometimes for KCD but it's not consistent.Other than that works smooth like a hot knife on butter...Good Buy"
4,"I got it for 53k (exchanged my 9 year old laptop and Amazon was kind enough to give me 6.5k for it), so I cannot complaint much about it. The styling is very understated and i really like it. Build quality is great and excellent finishing. The battery life is average, around 3 hours on regular use. However, the weakest link has to be the screen. It gets bright only till 240 nits, which is fine for indoor use, but under sunlight, you will struggle. The placement of the camera is also awkward. All in all, it's an excellent buy if you are a casual gamer. I use it for my work and play fifa, nfs and forza, which I beleive it can handle well."
4,"I bought it for 64k in an offer.I am writing this review after 40 days got the product.This is simply superb,i got no other product at this price with the mentioned specs.when it comes to battery its not bad,it allows you to work continuously for 3-3.30hrs once it charged 100%,but 1-1.30hrs for gaming.Camera quality is good,but what makes little bit worry about it is position of cam (below the screen),but it gives best screeing experience with thin bezel up and sides.Though it is gaming laptop,it gives very professional look unlike other gaming laptops.Its build quality is also good."
4,Runs most of the games at 40-100 fps Depending on the settings. For its price it is worth it and u can gofor it. But if you want to get a solid 60-120 fps go for higher laptop but if you are a casual gamer definitelygo for this.
1,This is certainly not worth it. The battery drains even while the laptop is shut down. I charged it a night ago and didn't use it since then. Next morning when I turned it on 20% of the battery was already drained. Not sure what Lenovo is trying to do by introducing such products which are faulty and don't live up to the hype.
4,"The design is absolutely super and the display is also good ( really nothing to complain about )but,the camera can be made bit high resolution (1080p)and the battery is draining fast (3 hrs on high performance ) any how, for this design and its purpose it is ooookay!!Overall it is a good laptop and classy laptop.and the ports are all back ( i really love that) for that thanks!!!!"
4,Nice laptop for the budget gamers out there and it performs seamlessly without any lag thanks to the ssd and hdd hybrid setup the nvidia gtx 1650 performs very well with 60 FPS capped continuously because of 60 HZ display the ips panel provides true colour immersionOverall a great budget product for professional workers and gamers as well. Also in terms of editing and videography this performs really well the premier pro works well with this setup and no lag felt while rendering. In conclusion go for it and you will not get disappointed but only con it has is the battery backup otherwise all others are very impressive.
5,"Ok so the product, wonderful. I was wondering if the i5 9th gen processor will be good or not but it was wonderful. The vantage software slightly overclocks it so as to get good performance. The graphics and gaming performance is seamless, and I can play AAA titles easily. I've played Assassin's creed Odyssey, DC Injustice 2, GTA V, Forza Horizon 4, and all works wonderfully without a glitch(medium-high settings).My most favourite feature with this laptop is the thermals. The fans are ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL, they suck in air and spit it out with such efficiency, I've only seen the body get hot once or twice that too just a bit, not the cooking oven temperatures other laptops achieve. So the dual fans work like a charm, even though I find raising the back of the laptop a bit as helping with thermals a lot(as the intake in under the lap).I've used some very good gaming customising software like the asus armory crate, so I find the Lenovo vantage software as just overkill. It's not that great and it's mundane, and don't offer much customisation. But it's ok so no worries.I've seen many guys complain about the battery life of the laptop, whining that they only get 3 hrs of battery life, to be honest people, u only get 3 and 4 hrs maximum in gaming laptops, that's the industry standard, if u want u idiots better look for a notebook or something. It's just annoying finding so many people complain about something that the common standardThe display is good and all but not that bright but that's how many companies keep the price down, by compromising on the screen quality. The keyboard is membrane and not mechanical but that's expected in most laptops in this range, but it's got good travel and it's not too bad, I like the keyboard, so no problems. I've bought the 1TB HDD and 256 GB SSD version and to all the guys out there please change your default storage to your HDD cause of that 256 u lose a big chunk for windows so it will fill up fast so change it to the HDD.The charger is pretty chunky and big so that's a small problem, but a very small one. The keyboard isn't RGB only blue light but it's not a big problem for me, but if u want it, this is not the lap for u.So overall the laptop is wonderful and inlove it, it even works well with primiere pro and photoshop and all. Haven't used it to render so don't know about that. But overall it's a wonderful laptop with great performance and all the perks of a gaming laptop."
5,"Hi, i bought this laptop for my son at independence sale for 59000. Product came in good packing. Its a value for money laptop with great specifications i.e, 8gb RAM, 256gb SSD, 1tb HDD, i5 9th generation chip, 4gb nvidia graphics card etc. High definition games run smoothly with 60 plus frame rates. I have ZERO issues with it and one can go for it without second thoughts."
2,"Now after  2 months of use . Suddenly Hdd is missing, SSD is still available. I have tried calling Lenovo Service Center but no response. Guys dont buy its waste of money. Better you guys go buy some mac with the same money."
4,Itss a realy great product For this price range ..I have used this for around 6-7 monthsNo lag aur delay that i have experienced till nowYou might Find battry life little annoyingIt losses battry life real quick if you use everything at high graphics/settingThey show that its battry life is around 5 hrs but its around 3-4 hrssYou have to use it with charging on while gamingI haven’t faced must isses while gamingIt’s pretty good product at the price range it’s availablePlus Points:Good gaming ExperienceNo lag issuesNice Display QualityStorage is also really good available at this priceNegetive Points:Not a good battryCamera placed at bottom of the screen
4,"Ordered this laptop after much research and got it for 61k. Have always used Dell laptops and hence this was the first time I decided to go for a different brand. Following are its pros and cons that I have encountered as of now:Pros:1. Looks wise it's quite awesome. You can use it for your office meetings. Even though it's a gaming laptop, looks wise it seems to be quite sleek and professional. The laptop feels premium.2. Runs all the recent games quite smoothly.3. Boots up in less than 8 seconds.4. Built quality is good.5. Audio quality is good.Cons:1. Webcam is very very poor. Though it mentions HD but it's like VGA quality.2. Sometimes Fan tends to make too much noise. Especially while gaming.3. It's a little heavy to carry around.4. Battery tends to drain very fast.5. Charger cable is somewhat short."
1,They sent me a laptop which was 3 months into warranty. Clearly a used and returned product. The inner box too was damaged. Returned it for a refund. Please all check your warranty status via Lenovo help tool. Its the only way to know if you have been sent a second hand unit.
4,It is a nice laptop with good build quality and performance. Good for doing regular work and gaming. After continuous usage also not seeing any heating issues.  One major flaw  I can see is the webcam located at bottom of the screen. I didn't like that . Otherwise it is a very good gaming laptop for decent price. My purchase price is 59k.
4,"Boot time is very good ~8 seconds (with windows loaded on SSD)Applications are loaded fast (Being a developer, the experience is good) (with apps installed on SSD)Above average performance for Machine Learning processing.Gaming experience is good. However, sometimes my GTA V gets little slow as the CPU usage increases - Note that I have McAfee always running on my machine). GPU performance is nice.Camera quality is bad considering the price of laptop(However I am fine with quality for processing with openCV framework)Sound quality is good.Overall experience is good at this price (I bought at ₹63,500) after using for 1 month."
2,Product is good as long as you don't update any drivers or try to change any settings. Things will start messing after you update drivers.bkack screen issues and also sudden fps drops during gaming. Better go for amd processor and graphics card and also there is no help from the Lenovo service centre.
1,The product was warranted for 12 months but warranty card shows warranted for10 months.Product was delivered on 29 may 2021 but warranty started on 26 April 2021 it means product was used by someone
5,"I have just bought this product but it is evidently really good product. When you handle it, it becomes wow clear how good it is... So far very happy with the purchase except for the fact that warrantee begins from manufacture date and not customer purchase date."
5,"Amazing, sleek looking product, Bought it for my son who is in college, He is happy with this product, But wanted a laptop bag along with it. Had seen it was bundled with this laptop before. Hope lenevo sends one"
5,"Pros : This laptop is great for budget gamers , Streamers and a mid level programmer , this comes with a Nvidia 1650 which is decent for gaming and can run games like Valorant , Pubg Pc , Apex legends , GTAV very easily on more than 60 Fps .2 : Battery Life is Decent .3 : Screen is 60hz which i good at this price point .4: Decent Build .Cons : Bad Camera Placement and poor Quality ."
5,Don’t hesitate to buy it online if u get it in the range of 60-63k....I was worried whether the product could be damaged or defective but nahhhh ...products lit ! Do buy it from amazon !
5,The camera is at the bottom of the screen which makes u feel like you looking up while talking with someone over VC. The battery is good enough for 3-4 hours. It's look Aswom..Do not think twice before this purchase it's a good buy
4,Laptop is really performing well. Iam not a severe gamer i bought it for my CAD softwares and it does work really well.The only demerit is the battery backup as it is a gaming laptop you cannot expect more than 4hrs. If this was better it seems a perfect laptop for me.You will also get frustrated with the awkward placement of the web cam its really a waste if ur thinking of having a video call u better go for webcam externally.
5,"I loved the Piece, amazing at Gaming, doesn't even heat much even tho I am gaming on Extreme Graphics and have multiple apps open, glad I bought this :) Superb Purchase."
4,Good product as expected. Keypads are really soft and the processor is also good
1,"Dislike the product, screen height is very less compare to other brand laptop, very much handle with care item. Not suitable for every day use and also not suitable for kids online class.It is not clearly written about return or replacement of the product, now Amazon is telling they will replace the item with same model, no return option is there."
4,"Fast and sleek. Nice design, fast boot, good for office work and online classes."
5,Using this product for office. Did not use for gaming. But overall good quality.
4,Best at this price point.
4,"Not so good,because after purchase of 1 month pc is getting slow, hanging problem and stop working google crome between work. My experience is not good at this laptop"
5,One of the best budget laptop for official use . Great performance. Fast speed. Light weight and decent build quality with budget friendly price
3,"product is easy to use screen quality handy Core i3 Laptop with Alexa Built-in, 8GB RAM, 512GB HP 14 (2021)"
5,Good product. Speed and quality are best best best item ever seen. best best best best best best best bes
5,Best screen quality⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Max 5 hr. battery life⭐⭐⭐⭐Light in weight⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
5,Very good laptop but camera is very poor ......
4,Sleek design and a good product.
4,Great laptop considering it provides 11th gen i3 with 8gb 3200 mhz ram and 256 nvme m.2 ssd. There's no alternative in this price range. Go for this one. ♥
4,At this price range it's a very good laptop.Ryzen 3 3300u is performing well. You can blindly go for this. It easily gets stained it's the only thing that I didn't liked about this laptop till now. Will post a fully updated review later
1,Too slow and it's not 4gb graphic as shown in description it's 512mb .Battery backup is poorSound volume is s good
4,"Hey! I think this is a decent product. It works fine for its price range.Sometimes, one may feel the system is little slow. And, that is a issue.May be adding a SSD might help. Then, there is little heating issue. But, its only a irritant if you are over perfectionist. Otherwise, it works fine with most productivity apps like ms office, vs code, xilinx ise, vivado, chrome etc. But, as mentioned there is a noticeable lag. Battery is very good. Some others mentioned it is not good. But, I strongly disagree. Battery is working good. I don' play many games. So, can't say about that.Bought it for 29K. If it was price in 28K-27K range it would be the best."
2,Very slow compared to i3 10 gen laptops. Camera quality is also poor. Battery back average last around 2.5 hrs with zoom video. Not suitable for this price range. Also seller keeps on fluctuating the price. Price during Great indian festival was increased so that even with discount user end up paying same. Very poor ethics from Amazon and Seller. Only good if u get it at around 25k.
5,"Product is super awesome and speed is really quick. I must say laptop is value for money. It is light weight and thickness is less.It may work slow a bit in the starting but when you go through the initial installations, speed is superb.  No issues related to heat. Every essential app like Ms-office, browsers comes pre-installed. Battery life is superb and can last longer. I do not know why others have faced issues with this laptop but my experience is terrific. Price range is perfect and best in that range. I would suggest everyone to get this laptop in this range. Thanks"
1,waste laptop don't busy HP laptops. Service also not good. They are not responding properly
5,"This laptop comes up with AMD ryzen 3 3300u which is far way better than this range's i3 processor. Vega 6 graphics at least better than intel integrated graphics. Working very well without optimizing my windows 10. And yeah it comes with windows 10 with a legal serial key which is already registered, you just need to set it up.Micro details everyone misses that it doesn't contain numeric keypad and that's why it is lesser in size with 14.0 inch size display. So keep that in mind if you are looking for a bigger size lap. Otherwise it supports latest 5G band and wi-fi range is pretty impressive.For me it is the best laptop in this range."
4,"Pros : speaker very loud 2w ×2  : Camera 720p great  : Processor very good  : Battery 6hr no worries  : Gaming will be great I did max settings in  Minecraftt 44 chunks and gave me 45fps  withh all shaders of default.  : Very light weight can hold it in 1 hand.Cons : bcoz of the HDD it will feel very slow and  But u can always upgrade it so no worries  : Display is 720p quality so u will not enjoy  reading texts  : It is very sturdy laptop but it will feel not  premium. For example this laptop has  better chance of surving a fall than a  macbook or any other brand.So:? This laptop was available at 26500 without windows and no ms office . I bought it at 29500 with windows . The alternative is lenevo i3 version which is always available at 32000 to 34000 .  It looks Premium better keyboard, better display, small speakers thou and has SSD."
1,Got a used laptop with a password ...
3,"One at a time I doubt multitask switching tab feels slow , initially boot feels fast around 10 sec but after updates boot takes around 30+ secfile explorer sometime too slow in loading ,battery regular usage with internet 3-4 hours , around 2 percent battery loss after overnightAround 135 degree hinge not 180 degree , No ms office available for this price is disappointing,diagnosis and mcafee live scan eat more battery with full scan around 2 hours battery drop 45 to 17 in 20 minutes,Happy with hard disk 930GB and ram 3.42GB , HP assistant is excellent . Until now no error message . Compact and lightweight , windows home comes with essential software. Value for money ... kind of ."
4,The system is slow means I know the limitations in this price money but it's really slow .. need to buy and SSD and a ram to get some results
5,At this price range it's a very good laptop.Ryzen 3 3300u is performing well. You can blindly go for this. It easily gets stained it's the only thing that I didn't liked about this laptop till now. Battery back super best product would have been the best laptop for price
4,"Although a novice in computers, the cheap plastic body outside makes me wonder  about the quality inside.Bought recently only because of the processor and the price, it's working okay for now..."
3,"The product is ok, didn't check much in its original state(as it is when it arrived).. I installed SSD and 4 GB ram as soon as I get it. It's much faster and all..but I am not able to change the boot order.. tried everything, I feel something different about this laptop's BIOS"
3,The laptop looks classy....is light weight and travel friendly....but what upsets me itls that it's a bit slower than I have thought it would be cz of HDD storage.
5,best product dor the money just one propblem if they gave 8bg ram it whould have been the best laptop for price range
2,Adopter is not working....so I hv to buy new one...
5,Had looked at many options and was unable to find one a compact machine with all the required features which will suffice day to day tasks. This HP machine is great and am able to perform all my tasks flawlessly. If required one can get the RAM upgraded and that will help to boost the performance
1,Pls do not buy. Extremely slow and you will get pissed off working on it. It takes too much time to start and you will not be able to do simple work on word or excel. Bad experience
1,Iam using this laptop occasionally as Iam service engg busy with my company provided laptop. Gifted to wife its really slow. Very disappointed even after installing update its slow. Fan always running.
3,"Good but not the best, slowness is incomprehensible despite Ryzen 3, overall can go for day to day office task."
3,It's not as expected
5,Really the product is value for money..with little upgrade of SSD M.2 Nvme 500GB and 8 GB Ram..system boost up..and VRAM stand alone with 5GB more Ram with bios update...Don't hesitate to buy it
1,Worst laptop. Please donot buy this laptop. Very very slow. They lie on the description. It has only 512 mb graphical card. Simply waste
2,"Received Damaged laptop charger , so charging cannot be done properly , so I need replacement . Please try to provide  good quality laptop charger"
2,"RAM is showing 3.42GB, HP and Amazon is unable to fix the issue, the booting time is also little higher."
3,"As mentioned window-10 is installed in it but i received a unit without windows 10 , when i start, it shows an error saying windows can't be installedHeating issuesOtherwise good"
1,"Windows 10 is of no use as it is unable to edit word files , ppt etc..don't buy HP LAPTOPS as the HP SUPPORT is also useless...they don't know what is included in WINDOWS 10 HOME EDITION."
1,Worst performance  do not buy it its cheap
5,Add some extra RAM and a SSD and this laptop is the best VFM for daily usage.
1,Not satisfied this product.....
4,"This is very good product. However, I had to do some changes in setting and did not enjoy its excellent performance until I uninstalled chrome."
4,good looking.Perfect for normal work.
3,"It's best for  student, it's light weight, thickness,and value for money and good for normal use"

2,"First of all I would like to tell about the delivery of this product I ordered this laptop in 19th October received 27 th October, look at the duration .I was fedup with this daman delivery it is shame on amazon.noby is expected such a terrific delivery.lenovo budget laptop it's disply is really pathetic viewing angle is so sad. if it is 8 GB ram deffnetly performance will improve amd 3020e chipset  really a power saving chip and there is no heating issue at all.laptop charging speed is amazing, sound is average ,earphone sound quality is good ,Dolby sound equaliser does the job better,,only becoz of this cheap disply no one is going to accept this laptoplaptop,Lenovo could have given IPS HD disply otherwise budget friendly normal usage laptop from lenove"
5,I was happy by this product. I didn't expect this much good. If there was MS office it would  have helped for more users.
5,Nice👍
1,Its a big cheat. Amazon is delivering refurbished products as a new product. Big cheat. Suggest not to fall into such trap.
4,"Read this review before u purchase this laptop..i will clarify all your queriesU can blindly buy this laptop if the price is below 25.6kFor this price range performance is okay..u may find Avita laptop provide more specs from this..go for Avita ..if u no need of separate nmbr pad and u are okay with windows SWe wont sit on this laptop , we will not keep this laptop under JCB tier ..so build quality is enough for a normal personIf u are looking for laptop under 30k then u buy this product and replace SSD as a primary storage , it will cost around 2.5k or less..now under 30k this will be the best laptopU won't get free Microsoft office inluded in this laptopBattery is good from asus and avitaDisplay is okay..Camera is worst ..don't buy this laptop if camara is ur priority, for online class, Skype call. Other person will not come to know that image is yours. Go for asus its cam better than thisIt has a power button like every laptops but this laptop will turn on when u unfold the laptop..in other laptop first u hv to unfold then u have to press power buttonI recommend this laptop to people who's budget is below 26k and those who need dedicated number pad. And those who want to watch movies .DrawbackNo gamingNot a superfast processor u have to adjust with itNo keyboard light which is very essential actuallyNo Microsoft office subscription included.even u won't get it from any laptops under 26k I bought this laptop for 24.4k so i will recommend people to buy this laptop if u get this below 26k if the price i high then go for asus or avita"
1,"I am unable to open excel and power point,I want return it,  or kindly replace good system.Ready to pay excess amount"
4,Nice laptop. 😃😃😃But camera quality is a bit low
1,"Very slow processor , there is no finger print censor , don't buy it's plastic box only ."
1,Very bad product don't buy itLot of Lang when using browserWeight is lessBut processor is too slowFingerprint sensor is not workingFinally too slow laptop
2,I have purchased the same for my kid and he is using it for a month.Pros:light weightGood screen resolutionGood viewing angleIn built sound okCons:4 GB RAM many cases become not sufficientTake lot of time to bootC drive usage showing 100% many cases and becomes very slow ..until do frequent  re booting.Not suitable for any game using graphics..System is getting hanged in between..Not a optimized productThe actual memory is 3.4GB available and always 90% or above in use with only a few programs..Will share more after further use.
5,"If you are buying this laptop for study use , it is useful to you."
5,"I got it in 20,000 only. Its a wonderful device with sleek design and ultimate performance. Poor camera is only limitation."
1,"This laptop is gross. It is way too slow. Lagging in every simple task-be it opening a pdf or browsing something. Yes, I didn't expect a great device in this budget but at least provide a decent one. 27k is way too much for this garbage. Not expected from Amazon"
2,"Facing issue in ms office.. Its not activated and asking for key,Connected with lenovo support, they kept on 15min hold and them hung up..Need support else well return the product"
5,"It's a laptop equivalent to intel core 2 duo processor, most of my development work involves server side compilation and things so all I neede from ot was a putty solution and a couple of tabs to be opened which is pretty basic need which this laptop fulfills effortlessly.CPU at times go to 100% where as the RAM usage doesn't drop below 45-50% thanks to windows 10. Other than this, if you are comfortable with LINUX installation with basic home needs, I'd say go for it."
2,Very slow processor performance. Even chrome browser won't work property. Avoid purchaseNot even useful for personal/office work
5,"I brought it in 20999.In this price it's screen is 4/5Thickness is good = slim 4/5Performance = 3.8/5 (for students)Battery is 2.5 hours approx.If full brightness + heavy use then more lessIn oowe saving mode it can give u 3-4 hours.Bootup time 29 to 31 seconds.Overall i m happy coz.Avira is a winner in these segments but due to the build quality issue i don't want to face it's customer service which is not very good.Lenovo is future proof for servicing and spare parts.Otherwise buy anyone.Nowadays laptops and phones all are good even in starting models unless u r heavy user like gaming editing.Note - in 720p video on YouTube over wifi its cpu usage is 25-55 %. If u are poor but clever then u can go with it.Multitasking can be a problem. So,If u r poor but not clever than be clever coz there is no option.I am giving u allIn pics and videos1. Viewing angle2. Plus task manager details3. Build = good lookingThough it's plastic but look very good like aluminium4 etc see the pic and video"
5,excellent laptop bundled with all the necessary specifications .design  is fabulous and very sleek as well
5,This is best value for money laptop. Can be used by anyone who has causal work and not much resource intensive work. Good for office work. I can also run Visual studio very easily on this laptop. Cannot play graphics intensive games or do animation. But good for day to day normal work.
5,Nice laptopBut little slowBut worth of buying itGifted to my father he is happy
3,Product is good. Camera is not of good quality. Probably we hv to fix exernal camera.
1,Laptop absolutely worest.i recognized bit late and unabke to return.System is very slow tried all the possible ways to make it run fast but such a waste product..i dont know how lenovo launched this product.sucha a waste product. And amazon you need to give atkeast more time to realize.Absolutely disappointed with this.
3,"Me bought in September 2020 at 29000 rs, now 6/12/20 27000 .Lost few money .Product is 4 gb ram , best to buy 8 gb ram for fast working the product."
1,In the product description it is given as Pre loaded windows with life time. But in the laptop windows not working. Whom i need to contact?
1,Very bad product processer is very slow and battery drain quick.lenovo clam 9.5 battery backup.in my use battery backup is 2 hours only.so please don't buy this product.
1,Very bad performance ...Very slowAutomatically shuts down takes too long to open again .Wastage of money totallyIf possible refund my money too bad product by lenavo
4,दिखने में बहुत अच्छा है पर इसका वर्क बहुत ही स्लो है आप पागल हो जाएंगे थैंक यू
5,"Its a lag free laptop with 4hours battery ,really good product by lenovo"
2,The picture says that the product have finger print lock... but there is no option for finger print.. nice look.. nd i get 4-5hrs battery backup
4,Its a good device for streaming netflix and other forums and easily compatible
5,Prompt delivery even at village location. Great.
1,"Worst product. Don't even think to buy.""Isase tez to kAchhua chalta he""I have purchased 2 laptop and both are too slow and ultimately I have decided to sold out."
4,"Good, Slim and good battery back up"
5,Thickness n authenticity of the product
1,Display failed in 1month
1,Within 15 days hard disk dead
1,"I am very disappointed  with this item, they are not providing microsoft  product key with it we have to purchase it separately. This item is  not worth for the money"
1,You can't imagine after starting pc 5 minut its hanging and only one gd data used in storage I don't know why its not work properly please don't buy
5,"Best entry level laptop for browsing, checking mail. Good battery backup, lasts for 3 hours. Got it at 21000/- in exchange"
1,The ideapad is very slow.microphone is not working.we want to replace the product as it is warranty period.so as early as possible replace the product
5,"Yeah, the review title is correct. This machine gives desktop level performance at it's best price. You're never gonna find a product like this. Feels bad for Dell, it should advertise more for this laptop. Again, this is a completely awesome machine with an rtx 2060 level graphics card. Any game you throw at it, it'll run at 60fps ultra settings on 1080p. Any productivity workload, you'll be able to do it in lesser times. The 120hz panel is awesome. Just make sure to update the BIOS, drivers, and Windows OS. And one thing for seller, you should've given me the power cable man, I had to buy it separately."
4,Laptop does pack power but the battery performance is not up to the mark even if fully used on battery saver.Display brightness is mediocre.Comfort zone to view will be mostly above 70-75% in normal room lighting.
5,Worth to buy but some what heat problem
1,"Please.do not buy these laptop, it heats two much cheap quality parts, heavy games not even running for 5 minutes it heats and restarts. No driver support from dell absolute shame"
5,"Brilliant productMost of the configurations available in this price range (less than 40k) were either 4 GB RAM or 1 TB HDDMy base requirement was 8 GB RAM as Win 10 just doesn't work with 4 GB and going for aftermarket RAM on a new laptop did not make senseSecond requirement was SSD. I needed anything at or beyond 256 GBThird requirement was latest generation of processor, 10th Gen in this caseFourth requirement that kind of became mandatory after I was doing the diligence was MS Office preinstalled. Again, why go for aftermarket installation. Note: lot of people complain that this is only for 30 days. That's not the case. I activated just by signing in and updating Office.The only other competition to this is Lenovo in similar price bracket, but it has a poor camera. With all the online classes and office, you can't look like crap just because you have a camera dating back to 2000s. All else are either expensive, do not have SSD, do not have 8 GB RAM or MS Office.The screen could have been better, but I have a 29 inch LG screen so no complaints.I missed checking if the swivel opens 180 degrees and this laptop doesn't open 180 degrees, so if you do use dual monitor then you have to place  adjacent to additional monitorVery satisfied till now. Boot time with SSD is awesome, the system boots in under 10 seconds.Although it says 1.47 kg it feels a tad heavier.  I have been using Mac but that's twice the price.I wish there were more USB ports, it has 2 USB and 1 C typeThis is default choice in the specs/ requirements so best buy"
3,"I've been using it for 3-4 days now. Experience wise it's great. It gets your work done.I'm not a gamer so can't comment on its gaming performance.Pros:8GB RAM helps windows 10 experience a lot.Light Weight.I don't consume storage space on my laptop so 256GB SSD is more than enough.Boots in less than 10 secondsWindows 10 & Office Student lifetime Subscription is a huge plus tooCons:The looks are pathetic.The display is very very very BADPlastic Body, Heck Plastic Trackpad feels very cheap.If you are able to make compromises on the cons then It's an average buy. Okay to use for work & study.Gets things done. I think it's the only 8GB product under 40K.Let's see .. I will update this review in a few months if the product still exists till then."
1,First got the product delivered couple of days late. It worked fine for 1 week and then all of a sudden screen is gone ! Poor response from HP service centre ... they are saying screen must be physically damaged which is not the case at all and there after no update from last 3 days after constant follow ups ! So I cant use laptop anymore just 1 week after buying it! Poor Quality and worst service By Hp support !!!!!!!
1,"It's the worst product ever. First time when I ordered this, it stopped working after two days. Software crashed. (EROOR CODE 3FO)When amazon replaced this order, nothing worked in replace order. I couldn't access camera or internet. I mean it was horrible. One after I unboxed ans it was useless.Reading the other reviews, I see a trend in these laptop. They all are cranking a little while after use. Heavy software problem. HP should pull this profile r out of market and replace it with better models.I was lucky that I found the fault after two days ( in replacement, one hour). You might not be so lucky. What if these laptops stop working after 7 days days replacement policy overdue.You are stuck with a dummy for a laptop and you are 36k. Please make q proper decision and buy a better laptop. Just don't buy this one. I am telling you from my personal experience."
5,"Very good product in these range, under 40,000-i get it in 38,000 somethingIt saya 7hours battery life but it is near about 5hours , it's very good 👍.It take near 2 hours to charge fully.It has ssd , it starts in seconds.Good for light gaming 🎮 , light - average video editing.It take another hard drive for storage, after sometime.It's good in these price range, go for it. 👍😎It has 1 year warranty and you extend it by buying the extented warranty package for 14 15 series hp laptop."
4,My one week usage experience:Boot time:10-15 SecondsResponse time for a folder & apps opening:1-2 secHardware wiseKeyboard -Excellent ergonamically for constant usageDisplay- Color gamut and the resolution will be flawlessTrackpad- Average but for long usage one should rely on External mouseSpeaker: Does the job perfectly for a laptop both in call quality and infotainmentCharger: 65w adapter will charge 0-100 in 2 hours timeBattery Backup: with 100% Cpu usage can expect 4-5 hours anything with 50%-80% Cpu usage can expect 6-7 hours as mentioned in descriptionComclusion: For office / commercial user who require emails and Ms office online classes & infotainment mutitasking of 4 at a time can close your eyes to buy
1,"Worst product. Within one week boot volume crashed and one year HP support is awesome, I raised a complaint and after two weeks they said to contact nearest HP support center directly. It's been around one month I keep pushing the HP people but no one rectified my issue.It's not'HP customer care' it's'HP Customer DON'T care'."
1,It’s been 1 week only n laptop stuck on bios update loop.i m not able to see window screen. Bios update is never ending. I don’t know it’s laptop problem or sellers problem. This is my second laptop from same seller.
3,"Web Camera quality is average, ok for light conference calls. Speed is decent and best part is the original and activated Windows 10 and MS Office 2019 Home & Student software. It is perfect for home use. Some people have posted that it is not FHD panel, rather HD (1366x768). But for Student or for parents it is perfectly fineNote: Product Delivery experience was the worst ever. Be prepared to have delay in delivery for absolutely no reason at all."
5,Very light and thin.Best one within 40k.
5,"Super product by HP. Got this HP 14s cf3047tu at Rs 35990 on great indian sale. Awesome Performance! Writing this review after 1 week of usage... Here is the detailed review of the product..Battery backup is impressive. If you are not a heavy user it can last for a day. ( 9/10 )Performance wise it's a beast.. with 8GB of ram, i3 10th gen processor and SSD storage you will not face any problem related to speed and performance. Windows boots in just 6-7 seconds. The software or apps takes max of 3 seconds to load... I have not faced any lagging issue till now. ( just avoid high end softwares and games and your laptop will work like a charm ) (10/10 )Display is also good... I don't know why people are complaining about it. Also bezels are not too thick as in dell vostro and others. (8/10)Looks are also decent with patterned surface which feels amazing to fingers and also provides a good grip. (8/10)Sound is AWESOME! at 100% volume it feels like i am playing music over a Speaker... It is really loud. You'll have to keep volume at 40-50% for general use.You'll not get any other laptop with this sound quality at this price. Really! (10/10)Camera is Average or you can say good for video calling purposes... As you don't have to take selfies with it.So finally, This laptop is good in every feature. A power packed machine by HP. You will not get any other laptop with this type of performance, speed, sound and battery for this amazing price. Better than vivobook 14, vostro and ideapad series. Just Go For It!Overall rating 9/10.(you also get a lifetime version of MS Office 2019 home & student - powerpoint, word, excel & one note which comes preinstalled with it that is you just have to sign in with ms account in any of the application and you will unlock the office suit)Also a big thanks to Amazon. They delivered it within 2 days of ordering.- vivek 😊"
4,Good and affordable system from HP. The system come with loaded windows 10 and MS office. Slim and light weight the important things at low prices is the RAM which is 8 GB with i3 processor make the performance excellent. The battery back is more than 5 hours which is also food
1,"Its just around 10 days since we bought the laptop.  Today as we were working it showed ""HDD 3FO Error"" on bootup.On BIOS tool it says storage volume is not present!!!Have raised an issue with HP for technician visit.  Hope they could solve it!!!Not sure it is an one off problem or general issue with this model."
1,"This is the worst product ever. DO NOT BUY.I bought this laptop in Sep 2020 and the laptop stopped working within one month. Amazon is refusing to take return and replace this product.For the past 2 months I’m trying to get the laptop fixed through HP service. Most pathetic service. They close the tickets immediately without resolving the issue. Despite repeated requests, they are not sending technician to fix the issue.Getting no warranty support or technical support."
4,"Pros: The product is amazing as it has 8gb Nvme ram and 256gb SSD storageIt boots up within seconds and is very fast, It comes with pre installed MS Office and Student editon which is a boon for students.Cons: Not so good webcam  And marks on the laptop when  we touch it but it is manageable at such a good price range of approx 39k INROVERALL I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU THIS LAPTOP."
1,"Before buying this product please make sure you this. We have decided to buy this product the first ever problem was it was enabled to connect with router and second thing it get's hang frequently which only brought before a month. We have consulted the hp services they are were will be responsible of ntg as you brought it from Amazon. If we consult this Amazon these people are asking us to contact hp people. 35,000 matters it not 10 for our middle class people. Even if like have any exchange these would allow choose any options. Please before buying any electronic goods make sure that the company and also refund policy are good otherwise there would be lot of problems to be faced just like did"
5,"# 8gb Ram, 256gb nvme SSD at a decent price point is a great deal..# laptop is pretty thin and light, good for carrying around and regular usage.# Has good processing speed due to nvme ssd n 8gb Ram installed in it..# Lag free windows 10 experience# Comes bundled with student/home ms office, just need to activate it.# Looks and build quality are moderated but decent enough for the given price point.# Display quality as mentioned by some of the buyers isn't that bad either, i could hardly notice any problems in it..# Has got a good sound quality."
4,"This isn't review after 3 days of Use.Pros: Very thin and light.  Easy to carry  Battery backup is good 5-6hrs  Boots up in less than 10secs and b  shutdown in less than 3secs  8gb ram+256ssd makes the laptop super  smooth and fast.  Sound output is good.Cons: Camera is average. Not Very great.  No backlit keyboard.  Track pad could have been more smooth  but a mouse will do the work.Overall: Great Laptop for 35000 price range. Best for students, office use,  etc.Rating 8.5/10"
5,"Worth the investment.  Got this with an exchange offer and got it for 30k. Great for business and home use. Not recommended for games or heavy duty data processing works.1. Light weight2. Quick bootup thanks to SSD.3. Mat finish, keyboard quality is great4. MS office 2019 comes free5. Audio quality is above average6. Video streaming and display is quite good7. RAM can be upgradable up to 16gb but may have to let go 4k *2 rams  DIIMs8. Hard drive cannot be expandable, need to replace."
3,"Purchased this as replacement for my aged HP ProBook 440G1. Replaced an i7 with this i3 option for these reasons: Latest technology -11 Gen, 2021 model, SSD, 8GB RAM. Did not want to spend a lot as I have a Surface Pro. Got 12k in exchange for the 440G1. So this fit all the bills. First impression of product is good. Plastic feel was the only putoff, but you can't expect a metallic body at this price. Laptop doesn't feel very sturdy for the plastic body. Booting / Shutdown is very fast because of SSD. 8GB RAM is min required for decent Windows 10 performance. Screen resolution is good. Very lightweight so you will not mind it carrying around. Easy to activate both windows and MS Office with instructions given on product page in Amazon. Overall, a decent product that won't dent a hole in your pocket. Would have given 4 star had the body been metallic and sturdier."
4,"Amazing speed, at first I had issues with start menu response but later fixed by update. Only laptop in the range with 8Gb ram. Keyboard is perfect as the button's stiffness  is well manged. Very light and almost negligible bezels. Only problem is the display which is HD and not FHD, although resolution  doesn't  make much difference but the inaccurate colour reproduntion and lack of Antiglare coting makes it an average display. Battery life is 6hrs + once full, charging is fine alomost 2 hrs. Overall I cant find a better laptop in this range."
4,"Before you go for this product, also keep in mind that how much money you spend on this laptop.After exchange, I got it at 32k.At this price, it's more than I expected.Intel i3 processor is enough for my needs. I even run VMs with 2 core. I don't want to launch 3-4 VMs so that's reasonable for me.SSD and 8GB is very quick and smooth operations.Genuine Windows and Office is a plus. One less thing to worry about.Last, Amazon is very good that it got delivered same day..."
1,The product which we received was really bad. Problem was faced with WiFi connectivity. Initially it get connected with WiFi and then automatically get disconnected.
4,"Writing this review after 1 month of usage.Purchased for 36k and here are few observations:(I am not a tech guy, but who use laptop for regular day to day usage)- Installation can be done by self and not required to avail the Amazon service at additional cost.- Ideal for School/college students/ regular users with not much of technical work to do.- Not ideal for Gaming purposes.- Decent booting speed & No hanging issues encountered so far- Video streaming apps load decently, the streaming quality is Okayish.- No keypad light available."
1,"After 1 month of use,1. display is blinking2. and bios boot issue appeared.3. Power button doesn't work some times... You need to hold for seconds4. Only advantage of this laptop is thin and fast boot due to ssd.5. Least quality Graphics6. My final advice is... Go for different models.. This is built with least quality material. And motherboard  doesn't support even small applications... Dell inspiron models are seems best as I used it earlier."
4,"Its been a week , so far so good. Only disadvantages are the screen's viewing angle are terrible and back lit keyboard is a must for laptop which costs more than 35k.Apart from these issue it is one hell of a laptop in the price point and its super light and compact with a decent battery backup of 5hrs + for now although I guess it will fall to 3hrs in around 6 months time as per my experience with Hp( Finger Crossed ) ."
3,"Review is for the 10th gen i3 - 2 core model laptopProsCompact  size / weight to carry around.Windows 10 Home for life time.Office 10 (I guess that is only Word, PowerPoint and Excel) but for single user .Has Ethernet LAN connectivity (newer models do not have this).8 GB RAM (contrary to the 4 GB mentioned on HP site for this model)  which will give good performance .256 GB SSD storage, improves speed and handles shocks.ConsA little reflective screen.No DVD drive.Both  the legacy USB Connectors as well as Power Supply  connector are on Right hand side while 1 USB .Type C USB connector is on left hand side.Wifi speeds are only upto 150 Mbps,  though YouTube streaming experience was good without any lag."
1,"In less than a month, the laptop failed while in operation. The SSD hdd is not accessible although the diagnostics indicate the disk is fine. From the reviews, it appears the laptop model has inherent problem & hence should be called back by hp and replaced with functional/tested models. Other features like light weight & thickness are overridden due to these failures leading to data loss."
5,"Bought this laptop during about 3 weeks ago during the Navratri sale offer. Delivery was quite prompt, got it properly packaged the very next day.Usage wise quite satisfied. Battery backup is also good.Regarding display, am satisfied for regular googling / reading, even watching a movie is decent. Screen was not very clear during a Zoom call.So overall am quite happy with this laptop for regular use."
3,"Got it in a good price with exchange. Coming to the features it's a 2021 model with 11th gen i3, suitable for most day to day tasks. I use it mostly for logging to remote work machine. Can use it for light to medium level programming. Camera quality is fine for zoom calls. Speaker looses clarity at full volume. Battery gives around 2-2.5 hrs average backup when I used for video calls and its self discharging if laptop is not used for long. Keyboard and trackpad are the worst, always use a external mouse and keyboard combo. It has 2 USB 3.0, 1 hdmi, 1 USB type C, 3.5 mm ports. So need to judiciously use them or buy an external USB adapter. Overall good buy if you get a great deal on the price."
5,"Bought for my son, he didn't want it, I landed up using it. Exceeded expectation considering it is only a core i3. The included Windows 10 boots fast in about 10 to 12 secs. Standard application like Microsoft Words, excel, chrome, edge etc runs without any lag. installed MX Linux as a dual boot and it runs very very fast without any issue, in fact it boots to desktop in about 6 to 7 secs. The laptop is well suited for normal computing needs. Gaming haven't tried. At 34k price point it is a value for money product. Recommended."
5,"Look no further if your budget is 36K, close your eyes and buy it. 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD and I3 10th Gen with MS OFFICE-License configuration you won't get it anywhere else. It boots in just 5 Sec with super fast performance. Initial Setup is very easy and you can do it yourself. Also if you follow Video uploaded by seller, registering MS OFFICE License is also easy. Display and Camera is ok (not best). Speakers are loud and clear. Overall a great buy."
1,It's a pathetic product. Very bad build quality looks fragile. Never expected such kind of product from HP that is too through Amazon. The quality is highly detoriated and.when I am asking for the return through refund Amazon Customer Care people are giving absurd policy reference. I am contemplating on approaching the Consumer Court for the redressal of the issue.
5,Overall experience is good as expected. Performance is mind blowing I just bought this laptop for coding and personal works. This is only products with 10gen ssd and 8 gb ram within 40k range. I am using HP laptop for 8 years that's why I chose HP laptop only. Those who are looking for laptop for study and personal purposes can consider this product.Booting speed: 4.5/5Camera: 4/5display: 3.5/5lightweight: 5/5charging: 5/5battery backup: 4.5/5overall: 4.5/5
4,"Speed is fast. Very quick boot time.Build is average. But performance was very good after initial 3-4 days of usage.Need to have Microsoft account in order to activate the laptop first time. Also it's required to activate the MS office product which comes pre installed with laptop.If you have opted for old laptop in exchange then delivery might get delayed as in my case they could not arrange and it got delayed by 2 days.But overall experience with laptop is good. Battery back up satisfactory. At least for 4-5 hours. Camera quality is average. Sound is good. Since it's ssd, much faster than traditional hdd."
4,"It is better product for those who have the budget under 40000, its processing Power excellent. Startup 10to15 seconds. 8k videos are run comfortably. Battery backup upto 4-5hours. Mice good. Speakers excellent. Overall performance good. I suggest it for the students who require laptop. Only the problem is that there are only two USB ports , should have been three."
5,"I have been using this device for almost 3 months. For the price there aren't many laptops under 40K with offer 8GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, and Office as well. This laptop has some good compromises for the price. No backlight keyboard but a good, comfortable keyboard. No FHD display but a decent battery life. The SSD speeds are pretty fast as well. So a fast boot up. Speakers are also decent.Overall, I use it everyday for work and no problems till now."
4,This is an amazing product for liye coders. Who are noob in coding they can try this lappy.SSD- because of ssd the timing of loading am operation and opening the os is little faster.RAM 8GB- 8 GB ram is enough for specific coders. It is good for multitasking. But don't try this if you are a heavy gamer or heavy coder.KEYBOARD- keyboard is greally good. Easy for typing but there is no numpad.TOUCHPAD- a fine and smooth touchpad with mat finish which is appreciatable.Screen- Full hd and 14 inch. You may find it a little small but still it is very much clear.OS - windows 10 is preloaded in SSD. Therefore the machine is faster than others.MS OFFICE- ms office is also preloaded. You need not to buy or download it.HARD DISK- 1 TB hard disk is there.LAN PORT- LAN port is given.USB PORT- only 2 USB port at your right side.SD CARD PORT- available at left side.CHARGING POINT- at your right side.HEADPHONE POINT- at your right side.CAMERA- camera is quiet okay for normal video calling.KEYLIGHT- Keyboard light is not available.Battery- you can use it up to 6 hrs.All over you can buy this if you are a lite coder. But not recommended to heavy gamer or coder.
5,"After going around shopping at shops for a 8 GB Ram +SSD +i3 11 gen specs I met very high quotes and low spec config models from various popular brands.Finally this purchase met all my expectations and fit my tight 40k budget.Windows+office was a bonus, highly recommend."
4,I m writing this review after using for about nearly two months . So i bought hp i3 8th gen 8g 256gb ssd model . Im a college student casual user only for powerpoint and browsing only i decided to go for it .Basically i was using old model of hp laptop only with amd old processor which gave lot of problems i cannot able to use that for simple one. I searched compared with other laptop also .when i bought i purchased for 36k i dont know why price been increased while that time some of the model like asus laptop avita were good also they were not some thing to look like asus had 4gb ram and typically having hesitant to with amd ryzen processor.This laptop till now basically fine it will feel compact also microsoft office free version preinstalled that also major advantage there are some things to be look after like:- Only one time i faced lag or hang i dont know  why i had put my pen drive so due to that may be i faced other than that i didnt hang problem.-While update notification the laptop like flickering the screen blackish that i also faced twice after updating it will not come.-Also keyboard also it  good feel will not comfortable to type it will feel cheap feel quality but mousepad feels fine. it necessary to wireless keyboard .-while turning pressing power button for turning on the laptop i feel that i have to press 2 times for that i dont know why but boot time is like 3 seconds .These are all things that need to be considered although it is not a major con somehow have to check with that.Performance is decent normal use whilw i played wcc2 game that feels like hiccups happened anyhow it is a decent processor no heating problem or fan noise i didnt heard of till now.Another thing that everyone should after is that battery backup the battery capacity mentioned like 41 or 42whr so claiming less than 7hr majorily i also one of the reason i bought but decent battery backup only charging also take less than 2hrs last 5 percent takes time little battery backup at a stretch use u will less than 4 hrs only.Screen quality is hd only it is decent enough.FINAL VERDICT: Overall i suggest for buying this laptop mainly should be based on price only for 42k we can get better laptop also ig u get a price of 35 to 38k it will make much sense and value for money.Also mi laptop learing edition will be there still it is not that available there are not that much review i didnt go for it . other than it is only available above 40k better buy mi laptop with i5 gen or asus laptop mainly there will be i3 only it will be available Regard with amd processor in amd ryznen 3 or 5 are available in avita brand or some other company also but still not suggest only in case of heating or battery draining issue this with old experience of processor also review of other laptop only im saying.U can buy hp mi acer and asus with ssd option better value .Also thing this laptop im not sure about we cant add ram or expandable that thing need to check after in cas of mi laptop im sure that is not upragable.
5,Beautiful and light weight
5,Value for money
1,Good laptop god gift it isExcllentDell is best lapIt is not very much hot that we think
4,Best laptopValue for moneyGood battery backup is upto 4 to 5 hoursNice screenGood charging cable and pin
4,Best laptop for this price.But the laptop is little heavy about 2kg .It is absolutely very fast due to ssd .Also we can run heavy graphics game for medium performance. Also it is provided with additional slot for upgrading Ram upto 4gb.But the only disadvantage is for this money we can buy ASUS vivobook which is provided with more good internal parts . But for this price HP laptop is very valuable . Because HP has more brand value than ASUS .If you see this review as helpful pls press the button helpful. Thanks a lotfor reading.
3,"Just got it a month ago..... Found some merits as well as faults..... The biggest merit being HDD+ SSD combo ..... while the biggest fault being ""the time which it takes to start working when switched on"""
5,Super very nice product.... with all features in low price.Win 10  boots up in 5 sec. Thats really fast which I was expecting.
5,"One week into it. One of the best performances, storage and hardware, in this price range (35-36k INR), having 256 SSD,  plus 1 T HDD, DVD R/W, 2.4 G dual core processor and 4 GB of Ram with anti glare FHD 15.6 screen, with Win 10 and genuine office.Hope this work like this for a long time. Worth buying!!"
5,"1 TB HDD + 256 GB SSD (net storage about 1256 GB) along with a decent processor and 4gb ram, what else u want for office work and online learning !!Can't do heavy gaming coz it's just 4 GB ram , but it is fast thanks to the SDD provided. Build quality is decent , can't argue considering it's price. But definitely a budget + value for money laptop."
5,using 15 days best laptop in these range 33.902
1,It shows Microsoft office 2019 given with the prodúct but it is not true. I can't believe u are giving àmbigous details to sell a product
4,Bought this product for 29990 with windows and ms office and it was working good.  Within few days upgraded the laptop with m2 ssd and 8gb RAM and now its working very smooth and its very fast. My current configuration is 12GB RAM+ 250 Gb WD Blue SSD and 1 TB HDD. Upgraded to SSD as HDD is 5200 RPM and after upgrading laptop is very fast and system boot within 3-5 sec and there is no lag. If Your budget is under 30000 go for this laptop and  you can upgrade RAM and SSD in future.
1,Delivered the laptop with 1tb hdd only.Ssd not included...
2,"I might return this and take a replacement or a refund, I will never go with HP .. On second thouht the lagging thingy might be because of OS Windows 10 (not sure)"
1,Damn slow!!! Cant complain because at this price I think this is what you will get! But it is damn slow! Takes hell lot of time to start things and all this when absolutely nothing extra is installed.. I might need to add extra RAM! Screen quality is good though and it is light in weight but guys it's really slow!
5,"It's very good laptop for our day to day life... Comes with very good configuration...Even I was confused before purchasing, but after receiving i have got full satisfaction... Happy with this laptop..."
5,"The Peoples Who got This model laptop are Luckiest according to me, This laptop is Awesome so it's not available anywhere, don't think More go for This, just see it's specification it's HDD + SSD and also with optical drive it's amazing. Screen quality is also good. Overall everything is Good Best laptop."
1,"The system is extremely slow. And when you connect it to wifi it turns out to be thr slowest. The sound quality is quality is good but when it is turn to its maximum range, produces a weird noise.Toggline the screen is worst, it is so slow that you can only use one application at a time, that too keeps on hanging.And the worst of of all is the heating problem, it hardly takes 5 minutes to heat the system. You can literally feel the heat on the right side of the track pad.  I feel it will explode someday.I would suggest you to take better quality laptop than this. It's a complete waste of money. Even the botting process takes nearly 3 minutes. Once I had intelligence pentium, it was faster than this.  Wish I had the return option, I would have done it long time back."
1,Cheated256GB SSD not in delivered laptop. Picture attached -- Description while selling and end product what delivered.
1,HP laptop delivered to me is having an issue. Cooling fan is making unbearable noise. Customer care is not good. still chasing them. Let me provide update once my issue is resolved.
1,I'm writing this just 10 days after buying this thing. Long story short. Don't buy this one. It's unspeakably slow. Hangs a lot and I don't have any memory intensive app. So disappointed.
1,"The laptop takes huge time (around 10 mins) to boot and post that the applications like MS word, MS excel, zoom etc takes minimum 5 minutes to open. Feels like I have been cheated out of my money. Plus there is only 7 days refund window for this seller. Not acceptable at all."
5,"Thickness slim, value for money and screen quality is good. No SSD & DVD drive."
1,"Worst ever laptop experience.  In 2weeks facing issues with webcam, hanging, qpps not working. Already did factory reset after contacting customer supports. Worst ever HP experience"
1,Snail🐌 is faster than this laptop. Even if you bring egg 🥚 it may get hatch and if it's hen then that will also give an egg still that this laptop won't get started. It is slower than amoeba. hp deserve an award for making something very slow even one day scientists creat a spaceship which will move with the speed of light where time will get freeze but still it will have more speed that this 💻laptop
1,"this laptop is very worst product and very poor performance.this laptop is waste money.please don't buy this laptop.any browser is not open.very slow working,hang problem.amd ryzen processor is very bad process in hp product."
1,Really hate this HP laptop and total waste of money. I got this laptop for my kid for online classes. It takes around 10 mins to start with this configuration and not even worth for just surfing internet. I wouldn't recommend this laptop to anyone and lost complete faith in HP brand
5,"It has premium look with full sliver colour. Boot Speed is really fast thanks to SSD. GOOD LAPTOP for business, Home and Gaming purpose."
4,"Screen quality, sound etc is good and upto the mark. However, the laptop seems slow, even with just Google meet running on browser and no other applications running, it hangs."
1,"Worse product never buy it....Very very very slow proceesing and hang all time...You can happy with a 10,000 phone but not with this 32000 laptop...Worse product ever bought by meTotally Wastage of money"
1,"I didnt know that Ryzen processor might be so slow, when i start the laptop it takes nearly 5 minutes to start and stabilize. And this use is not even for some high gaming, Its for my sons school on Teams, so he has to be sitting 5 minutes early (good for him to be before time), but bad on part of HP to bring out such a lousy system at such a higher price, another 5K and i would have got a coreI5 system"
4,"The keyboard layout is not user friendly. Even with 4Gb ram it lags, even performing simple tasks/ actions(I am not using it in Developer mode). Navigating between folders and apps, files is not quick."
1,It's very slow... Not worth for 30k.. I faced the slowness after using it for one month.. after that return period is over. Now am not able to return it.. is there any way to return it??
1,Actual product spec is different than mentioned in the product page.. 1TB HDD is not actually present but wrongly mentioned in product buying page.
3,"The laptop don't have a CD play drive. Can't insert CD. Disappointed by the lagg. It's too lagging to turn on and to work as per our need, double tap the application and wait for about 30sec to open it."
3,A more suitable configuration would be 8 gb RAM or higher with SSD drive.Decent laptop performance nothing special.
4,Decent product at this price. Delivery was superfast. Have used only for 4 days. Performance is good so far
1,Don't buy this product from Amazon.. Amazon is cheating.. there is no SSD as per description. When I complained they removed 256gb SSD from description.. totally cheated product. Don't buy...guys..
4,I have purchased this laptop just a week ago does this laptop has an option to insert simcard and does this laptop has an option to connect external graphics card?
4,"Laptop is bit slow but if you are using it for online classes and light office and other work then it will full fill your requirements, screen quality is good you would like the HD video also its a light weight all n all with price range of 30K its worth buying."
1,As Mentioned in the configuration there should be a 256 Gb Ssd + 1tb Hdd but I received the Laptop wit only 1tb hard disk ssd is Missing.Not Happy at all
1,The laptop is worst product. I brought it for my kid's online classes. It hangs 2-3 times every day if attend 2 hours online classes. Even after optimization of system. Worst performance.
4,Worth purchase
1,"Very slow processor, hang in every 2 minutes, full wastages of money. Spend some more money and take good one"
5,"I received this laptop on 21st April 2021 and i am writing this review after a week's usage.I will break this down into 3 parts which are:1) Specifications2) Real World Performance!3) For whom is it?=>Specifications: How it looks on paper?AMD Ryzen5 5500U built on 7nm technology is a beast and can run through anything you throw at it.It has 6 cores and 12 threads and they are decently clocked. GPU present is AMD Radeon integrated graphics.It comes with 8GB (Micron Technology 3200MHz) SODIMM RAM and out of that 512MB is allocated to VRAM. You can increase the RAM up to 16GB in future with both RAM’s working in dual channel mode.It has PCI Express 4.0 and 512 GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD.For other hardware info: https://support.hp.com/in-en/document/c07119618Now if you look at these specs it is definitely a steal deal. No other laptop company is giving you these specs at this cost in India. [₹50,990]=>Real World Use: What things matter in day to day usage?1) Boot time: Try to spell the laptop name along with the model number and it will be up and running. For me it was always less than 20 seconds.2) Battery Life: Normal usage – 6 hours, Intensive usage – 3 hours (These generally vary on what you have installed on your laptop and background processes)3) Multitasking: It can handle your tasks easily and most of the times it will be a cruising experience.4) Display: Here it depends on an individual’s priority. It has a BrightView (glossy) display with 250 nits brightness which is decent for indoor use but it will struggle under sunlight. So, you can either use an anti-glare screen guard for your purpose or make a compromise because of the price.5) Gaming: It can handle casual gaming very well. I played FIFA 19 for a while at low settings and never once it suffered a frame loss. Will update it with more games and cofigurations.6) Portability: It weighs around 1.4 kilograms and is easy to carry around.7) Build Quality: I would say since its lightweight+14inch so a little compromise on build quality should not be a concern. It looks like it’s made of hard plastic but maybe here and there HP might have used some aluminium (or any other alloy). Sometimes when you lift the laptop with a single hand it produces a faint creaking sound. Feels like it’s due to hard plastic but can’t ask more at this price point.8) Ease of Use: It comes with Microsoft office Home and Student 2019, HP Support Assistant, HP PC Hardware Diagnostics & Alexa for romance(lol). So, this gives you a very good platform to work on without any hiccups and still if it’s there (Same old Linux vs Windows thing) then you have enough tools to deal with it.9) HP Hinge: No one talks about it so I brought this up. Most of the HP laptops faced this issue 3-4 years back but now I think its alright. I regularly use HP Zbook as my office laptop and I think this laptop uses the same type of hinge (quality difference is definitely there but Zbook is expensive too). Hinge is not too tight but Ok’ish tight.10) Speakers: They are not adequately loud but produce clear sound with a decent base. If you are using it casually to watch movies/videos in a not so loud room then it will be fine. Dedicated Bluetooth speakers are definitely going to outperform the budget segment laptop speakers. Personal suggestion is to buy one if you are willing to use this laptop to watch movies/videos in a group.11) Heating: Whatever work I have done in last 7 days I did not face any overheating issues (AMD processors are doing a good job here). Fan is silent most of the times. Only when you are running intensive tasks you can hear them gushing air out of the laptop’s fan vent.12) Keyboard: It has a laptop sized backlit chiclet keyboard with two levels of brightness control for the light. Again, I would say it depends on one’s preference and budget.13) Connectivity: It has Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 4.2. For day to day use its Ok but not seamless. I faced some speed drop while being connected to both. When I disconnected the Bluetooth, it was back to normal. I still need to confirm it with other users.14) Zoom/Teams/Skype calls: Haven’t tested the video on live calls which very much depends on how good your internet connectivity is but it has a good camera setup. It is missing physical camera shutter but that’s fine with me.15) Trackpad is not that great but it gets the work done. It would have been better if it had two click buttons. It supports multi touch and gestures.16) After Sales Service: HP has one of the best after sales service so it has to be mentioned. It’s always a plus point.Overall, it is a great laptop and is performing better than what I expected. I tried to keep all relevant points and these points may be updated in future after a long-term use. Do let me know if I missed anything.P.S.: No unboxing video was made by me 😜Just a neutral review with no promotions for either party.=>Is this laptop for you?This is a very subjective question and its answer depends on how you are going to use the laptop.In short here are my views:1) College Students: Considering the fact they need to run various simulation/modelling software along with an added benefit of portability it’s a good option for them. This laptop would be able to handle all of that.2) Business Professionals: Its portability will attract you but if you are looking for durability too, I would suggest you to wait a little and see if there are alternatives. Its not a laptop like ThinkPad which can also be used to play cricket.3) Content Creators: Your first choice would be Apple’s M1 powered devices but if you are on a budget then there is no other laptop near 50K who can compete with them on paper. It has 6 cores and 7nm tech whereas M1 has 8 cores and 5nm tech but the price difference is huge. I know it’s a wrong comparison but still it shows the power of this processor. I would encourage you to get one more 8GB RAM stick at the time of purchase only.4) SDE’s/ML Engineers/Data Scientists:  It’s a good laptop for you too. It has expandable RAM capacity and a good processor. It would be able to handle data manipulation, cleaning, etc. well and can run popular software with ease. For those doing intensive tasks like deep learning where high end GPUs are suited, they should definitely give this a rethink. But for that too we have alternatives by using cloud-based processing/computing power. Beginners can manage with 8GB RAM but later on you would need to increase it to 16GB.5) Others: If you don’t need much computation power then go for cheaper laptops, they would also be able to manage your day to day tasks. HP 14s fq1029au is an excellent choice for you.So ending this with just one conclusion….you will not get a better laptop under 51K at this time."
1,I don’t have a review about the product. It’s about the seller. On the backside of the laptop one screw is tampered. It’s like someone struggled and opened it. I didn’t notice it first. I opened the laptop and checked the warranty. Warranty started on April and I bought the laptop on May. I doubt that someone opened the lap and replaced something. Saddest part is that this delivery was fulfilled by Amazon. The retailer was VTM_SLP. I think the laptop is good but never buy it from this retailer. And if Amazon.in or hp cares about their reputation; blacklist this seller.
5,"Bought it for Rs. 50,990.Pros:1. Excellent sound. Loud clear with decent bass. Did not expect this.2. Really good display. Decent peak brightness. Excellent viewing angles.3. Decent webcam. Better than expected.4. No heating issues. At full power option, kept only warm.5. Good battery. I guess on normal workload (word, excel, youtube, browsing), you can expect around 7 hours easily.6. Good feedback on the keyboard. Good travel distance.7. Has backlit keyboard.8. Speedy ssd drive and powerful processor.9. MS office 2019 bundled for free.10. Trackpad does the job. Has multigesture support.Cons:1. Looks and colour (subjective). Doesn't feel premium and silver isn't really a good choice.2. Heavier than i expected. Not sleek.Haven't stress tested the laptop yet. Didn't test graphics.Overall verdict - unless you want to wait for Zen 3 ryzen processors (remember 5500u is 5000 series but is based on Zen2, not Zen3), choose this without hesitation."
5,"Great product with AMD Ryzen 5 5500u. 8gb ram with one empty slot and dual channel support. 512 gb NVMe M.2 ssd upgradeable upto 2 tb. 2 stage Backlit keyboard, glossy screen, great 65w charger, good variety of ports, good for programming and browsing and multitasking. Comes with pre lodaed win 10 and office 365 with life time lisence. Overall best for programming and day to day working. Because I bought it only for programming. At these price range one can blindly buy it."

3,"Packaging is very good and safe and Only good thing in this laptop is Processor is latest and efficientI observed some cons in this laptop are:Not anti glare displaySpeaker Sound feels low sometimesBattery charging takes nearly 2 hours for full charge inspite of having 65 watts fast charger.Battery life is around 4-5 hours on normal usage.Pros:Efficient processor 5500u fast processingBack lit keyboardVery easy to handle ,light weight and portableMain points to consider while buying this laptop are:They installed Hynix 512GB SSD Which is of average quality when compare with Samsung and some other brands.8 gb Ram is of micron company"
5,Display-5/5Build quality - 4/5Connectivity -4.5/5Sound - 5/5Design - 4.5/5Battery - 4.5/5It is value for money and good choice
4,I am currently using this laptop . The battery life seems low .
4,I had doubts with the seller .  I was relieved that the product was in good condition and my doubts related to the seller were cleared. Good laptop with good specification i.e. value for money.
5,"First like to appreciate seller vtm slp... Very helpful and faster replies.. Helped in replacement too.Laptop is great. Slightly looks bulky but around 1.5kg.No heating issues, v fast. Hp service also good.Smooth playing for most Supported games. Battery is good but expected bit longer. Life time office package is added advantage."
5,"Writing this review after 7 days of use.Love this product ❤️ it has a good battery life,and because of the SSD it is very fast🔥I used it on the minimum brightness and with the keyboard backlight off then it gave me around 7-8 hours battery life .I used premier pro and when it was loading there was a little flicker but then it worked smoothly!Overall good product , I'm satisfied ❤️Also no problem with the seller - appairo ltd.It's good deal, go for it👍"
3,"Today it got delivered to me, this is just initial impressionLaptop looks cheap build quality is cheapEven the edges between( from area around the keyboard and side )is not evenly assembledFor anyone looks of the laptop matter plz avoid it"
4,"Where do I start, 6core 12 thread 5500u handles everything you throw at it.Light weight,has 65 watt charger arguably the most value for money laptop with 5500u processor.I would recommend a ram upgrade if you want to utilize full potential of this laptop.The only time fan noise was audible is during bios update Battery 4/5Display 4/5Keyboard 4.5/5Will update later on"
1,"Although The Laptop is State of the Art and all the things mentioned in previous reviews, please be aware that MS office has to be bought to be activated in this laptop(minimum of 4899 per year for single use) . This will include word and exce.lOutlook Express has to be bought seperately."
5,"I usually don’t write reviews but this is such a steal for 51k, just go for it. Obviously try if you can get it offline first but if not, Amazon is great. Although YouTube reviews said the Bluetooth and wifi are older versions, they work absolutely fine with my new gen devices too. Boot time initially is 6 seconds then after some changes and app installation 8-9 secs.•Ryzen 5 at this price is just wow•Body + looks are amazing and sleek•You get MS office•SSD is great and fast overall•The speakers omg amazingIt’s amazing 💜 I’m happy with the purchaseDo get a wireless mouse for a better experience"
3,"Nice range laptop under 51000k.Some cons : 1)laptop panel is little loose due to which side panels keeps moving while u sit under full fan # like Avita laptops2) Adaptor gets more heat while charging due to which laptop gets heated3) keeping laptop on bed or cushion/pillow gets heated from backside -dont know why !4) now a days hp support are too slow , raise a complain for change of adaptor more than 5 days over still no calls.5)Rest is all okay, small things matters alot while buying.Antiglare :2/5Brightness:4/5Battery: 4.5/5Processor:4.5/5Heating : 1/5Adaptor heating :1/5Value for money: 3/5"
5,"*First read all points after pressing the buy now tab.1. Many users are telling in reviews that ""This product is broken, damaged ,opened, software issues, warranty started one month before , Invoice , (Serial no.) not given in invoice etc.Ans. First of all , after buying any product from Amazon or any online platform .SEARCH first for verified sellers of any brand product on their product Website . ie. Ihave searched Hp website after buying this laptop where i found that the only seller (Appario retail pvt.ltd) is showing as a verified , because 1000 of fraud sellers are Roaming in all online platforms.*Imp>1. If you got some other SSD in place of SAMSUNG then you are ripped. Because in this model (14s fq1030au and 14s 1029au ) hp company is providing samsung ssd.2. if you haven't got any invoice or poduct serial no. in Invoice , then you are buyed from unverified seller. (they can replace anything in product because HP company dosen't sells them product directly and they won't take their service as their responsibility.3. IN MY BUYING EXPERIENCE >*product is well packed, no any damage.* Proper invoice with serial no. is given.*Display is IPS and glossy (not anti-glare).*tiny screen bleeding in left bottom screen (as normal to all laptops).*sound is not loud but very clear voice that makes feel premium.*Use all laptops on table or at solid surface instead of using on bed etc ,For better ventilation.*I'VE brought it from appario retail pvt.ltd.*Very good and sleemless performance.*Body is made up of plastic but of premium quality.** Brought it for 50990/-* If your budget is 50-52k last then buy it without any hesitation .***THANKS ALL**"
5,"Good screen, clear and loud sound. Best is we get a backlit keyboard which is not mentioned in the description. Best laptop in this price."
5,"Firstly, Amazon service is great. My Laptop got delivered within 24 hrs. You will get amazed by the look.After one week of usage, I must say that, this laptop is worth to buy.Processor Ryzen 5 is superfast. NVME SSD makes it even more faster.Display is awesome.Backlit keyboard is also looks cool.It is lighter in weight. So, you can carry it anywhere.Camera can be better but still it is good.Battery gets fully charged within 2 hours (If you have 15% before charging). Also, it lasts for a complete day. So, nothing to worry.As I am not a gamer. So, this review is based on my experience as a programmer who works in IT industry."
5,"Bought  this for Personal  Coding  using  Visual Studio, VS Code and SSMS all works smoothly. The review  after 2 days.The laptop  looks very attractive  than the sample pictures  shown here.Pros*Slim*Best Display*light  weight*boot time*small bezelsCons*Build Quality Week*FragileThere is a small crack near audio jack for tge item that I received.Overall Value for Money."
4,battery last 6 - 7 hrs on battery save mode with half brightness. But only last 1-2hrs on performance mode.Ryzen 5 5500u is best at this this price pointif you mant more processing power go for ryzen 7 5700u.diplay is goodbuild quality is not that good. there are some small panel gaps. i was going to buy lenovo thinkpad e14 gen 2 amd but its has poor screen quality so i bought this.ms office life time validity and i also got 100gb of dropbox for 12 months.very portable and lightwieght.overall rating 4/5
4,"Laptop's specs are good. Configuration wise this laptop is amazing. However, the build quality of this laptop is not upto the mark. The quality could have been better.Trackpad is just average doesn't funtion well. It's better to use external mouse. Display is good but doesn't come with anti-glare display.Keyboard does seems like made of cheap plastic and you could see the flex in keyboard as well.Although laptop's performance will not disappoint you."
5,"Cheapest, efficient and reliable laptop to have. It has really beaten IdeaPad and best configuration in this range. Couldn't have asked for better. Battery is doing well 4-5 hours on medium brightness. Ryzen 5500 U is delivering really great results in multi-core performance. Really handy and light weighted. Go for it. Cheers"
1,It's very slow in its processing.
5,"I use this product for coding.It's light and fast, only thing I am concerned about regarding this product is durability, although it has a aluminium body its not strong and it should he handled with care.Screen is good its an led displaySpeaker system is also good.You can definitely go for this product if you want to code or do some office workIt's definitely not for gaming purposes."
4,It's a good device to work on...but at some point of time it's giving too much heatThe overall performance for the budget is good
5,Laptop is good. But the seller Appario Retailer sent an old laptop and hence returning it.
5,In this prize range it is best laptop. All features is good but in this laptop display is not anti glare which is disapointed me. Battery performance is good .processor is excellent.i think this is best laptop and y should go with.....
5,"Very good choice if you are open to Ryzen. Small, cute silver looks and light weight. Performance is as indicated in the configuration. No complaints till now, overall."
4,The laptop has many features and I laki the laptop it have backlit keyboard and dual ram channel but only one thing that they have mentioned antiglare screen but is is glossy other wise every thing is correct
3,Keyboard lights not working.
5,I am using it from 1 month. Everything is good only screen is not anti glare but it is not a big issue. But bluetooth and Wi-Fi is old version. It is little bit issue. And price is also adjustable.
5,This laptop come with very stylish look and light weight and come with backlit. Keyboard
5,Just go for it 🔥Under 50k ac to me this is the best option for all purpose !!
4,"Everything fine except I am not getting sharpness in videos. No matter how high resolution f playing video is, picture lacks crispness."
5,The display is not anti reflective but it is too good.Light weight.Speaker is awesome.Trackpad and keyboard is good.Cons:Only 512mb of vram and the bios is locked.It would have been a perfect machine if it had atleast 2gb Vram.
5,It is a great laptop. Performance is awesome. Battery life is good. Backlit keyboard is also very good. Thanks to the seller VTM _SLP also. The laptop got delivered to me in 2 days. Overall a great laptop for students. You can even do light gaming.
1,In product description it is mentioned anti-glare display. But the product screen is super reflective. Didnt expect this from amazon.
5,Best hp laptop under 51k. Just go ahead. I got damaged shipping box but the laptop was in good condition.
5,Delicate fully loaded machine. Handle with extra care. Excellent specifications for this price point. Not Anti Glare but the IPS panel does the job. Overall satisfied with this purchase. Thank you Amazon.
4,Good but little bit expensiveIts powered by Intel 10 Generation i3 processorIt has 4GB RAM but its enough for 512 GB SSDIts has Windows 10 Pre Installed but Office is not installedScreen size is 15.6 inch  and it Full HD Display (1920*1080)Weight is 1.78 KGAnd i3 processor has Dual Core processorComes with integrated Graphics cardBut if you get This under 36k then Go for it.If you have any questions feel free askThis laptop is suitable for normal use and its not recommended for gamers.Because for better performance gaming you need dedicated graphics card keep in mind
1,"If you buy from amazonHp does not support warranty extension scheme which is available for hp productsSee the below mail received from HPWith reference to your redemption code, we would like to inform you that your claim has been rejected due to purchase made through an un-authorized channel partner i.e."" Amazon """
5,Very nice working good responds
2,"This HP laptop doesn't justify the price I have paid for it. I got it at 39K post applying the discount of 1500 on my credit card. So at this price point I was expecting better screen, backlit keyboard and less bazzles as due to very thick bazzles the laptop looks very old fashioned.Also need to note that you are getting only 4GB of RAM not 8GB which will be required if you are programming or doing heavy task on it.Go for it only if you are getting it below 35K."
1,Worst laptop don't buy i am personal requestDisplay and sound clarity very bad battery backup also only 3 hr
2,This laptop is ssd based which should not have produced any noise but it's exhaust han is producing  excessive sound. I think it's amazon problem ...Amazon is selling defective products under name of new products. Multiple times it has happened with me.
1,I was facing a battery charging issue. I want to return this product but it is showing the return window is closed please help

5,Tally and excel
5,"If you're looking for a basic commercial laptop for light office work, you may choose to go for this one."
1,Please do not buy it from Amazon. I bought it and system did not even turned on. Now I am struggling to return but getting very poor response from Amazon. None of the delivery agent is coming to pick it up neither getting any call.
5,Best product...... worth buying for programmers and gamers
3,Performance is good. Laptop camera resolution is not good
3,Battery backup not good
4,"The compactness , lightweight, HD CAMERA, FP SCANNER, BATTERY LIFE, KEEPS cool even if it is used continuousely/persistently, ETC. are some of the best features.The only thing which is observed is about the speed of the processor which is listed onsite as 4.20ghz but practically its different."
1,Wort product . system is to slow.should go to another product..try to not buy  and these products  charging is to slow
5,Core i5 11th generation laptop available with affordable price!! Powerful processor with SSD and Microsoft office completely suited my requirements and met expectations
5,best laptop in 60000 range really it is best for students but you cannot do gaming...and very nice it can used for years with no problem
1,"Useless  ,third class  product , purchased  it for  my son who is pursuing  his  engineering for  online  classes  but having  a horrible  experience. Initially the  one  delivered  was defective  , had to call  for inspection  followed  by a technician  visit and got  a replacement on 30th  Nov'2020 .Now today  its screen  has again  gone  blank as visible  in photo...you know  pay such a hefty  amount  to invite  so many  troubles & waste your  time  in all this  stuff...highly  disappointed  by this purchase , it would  have  been  better  to buy it directly  from  the  market."
1,Got defective product. Loose power connection. Please make sure before delivery you are delivering a fresh product. So that user could believe on quality of product from Amazon.
4,"Good, light weight laptop with ssd but purchase only if you get it below rs . 50000 best under 50000 ."
1,At this price range I would suggest to take any other laptop over this one even if it's a gaming laptop or not. Battery performance is bad and the whole laptop heats a lot even while watching videos. Heat sink system is badly structured as hot air wouldn't be able to flow outside. I had a lot of expectations.
5,ProsLaunch time  is goodMX 350 graphics card (latest)Backlit keyboard (not mentioned in either specs or description)Metal body and sleek designMemory and storage are upgradeableHigh precision touchpadConsMicrosoft office (30 days trial)
5,"Worthit for money product.In my opinion it is best laptop.It has aluminium body, great display, good speakers, and not get over heating while doing normal work or playing videos on youtube.And battery life is also good.Over all i say it is a good laptop."
3,as per specifications mentioned on Amazon web site the Product processor was to have a speed of 4.2 ghz but what aws delivered was of lesser speed of 1.2 ghz
4,"Very good, light, suitable for all types of work.Very good value for the money ."
3,Due to 512gb SSD it will better than others laptop of this range.
5,Nice product
4,"Bought around 4 weeks ago. It is a great laptop for productivity. The battery lasts me around 5-7 hrs normally. Speaker are loud enough, u won't complain. Also it has got everything checked be it SSD or backlighting. Charging the device takes around max 1 and half hours. The performance is also great. The Norton security which comes with it is highly optimised and would recommend u the same antivirus software if are interested in a security software. Even Bitdefender lowers the performance noticeably.Keep in mind the notebook is not designed for gaming so u might feel heating issues while playing fps games. But I have played Valorant on it and it doesn't get that hot while capping the fps around 110 at all low graphic settings.Don't except more than 2 hrs of battery life while gaming. Also the weight of the laptop is on a higher side so consider burung a lap desk."
4,ProsIt handles all my programs quite well..The camera quality is good won't say greatBacklit keyboard looks amazing it doesn't really get into your eyes.This laptop feels as if it's been modelled after a macbook. So it's really sleek and doesn't feel plasticy at all..Mx350 card is a boon I can run most games at medium specs..ConsThe keys are matt finished so I often have to clean my oil smudges.The bezel is not very narrow It will look a bit thick..No privacy shutterAnd the battery is quite bad it will last for only 6 hrs if you are casually using the laptop.. and if you are gaming don't expext more than 1.5 hrs at full chargeFinal thoughts - I'm currently a student and this laptop meets all my requirements a better than average graphics card full hd screen a sleek design.. if you are a heavy worker then I won't really suggest this because of the battery..... Overall I like it
1,"I used this laptop taking good care of it and it didn't gave me any problem till the time it lasted. And it lasted for only 1 year and 4 months when it's motherboard fired up 🙃. Hell with acer, I feel like crying but i would like to waste that time by cursing them.Most importantly they will leave you with your system after the warranty period is over as if who are you?? And that laptop in your hand does not belong to us. Get lost."
5,"It is what it says and looks like. Satisfied with the purchase. The display is amazing.Laptop turns on in 4 5 secsWebcam is not very good, but usable."
4,56k is the better price for this laptopI bought it in bbd saleComparatively the best laptop with no cons
5,"Nice Product - The large screen and decent processor is really helpful for online classes as it captures the board really well!! Initial impressions including styling, display quality and sound has been quite impressive."
1,Very bad
3,Product has a rich texture...but lacks in durability and performance...download sucks...takes hours to download...the camera is so awkwardly placed....u can do minimal stuff like...surfing....classes...or lectures...I would certainly not recommend this product to kids for online classes due to the placement of the camera....sound quality is good....
5,"Nice performance ,best battery ,worth buying ,cheap in price , , , , , , , , , , ,"
1,This is a bad product don't go for it wasteof money waste of time don't buy it please 🙏 .
5,"Great product serves the purpose very well.Pros-LightweightIts almost new product (seems just returned)Battery life is great ~10 hrs ( continuous usages)Very simple to useAll the accessories are genuineAll the Android apps works smoothlyDid not feel I need to have windows for any of my day to day work.Good sound qualityLove the build qualityUSB type c port(allows charging of mobile devices)Touchscreen is icing on cake but not much useful in your daily usage except if you play games etcCons-Wish it had 1 more USB port(not a deal breaker you can buy USB hub separately)Verdict-Best for those who have light usages of laptop with just surfing, gaming, calls documentation works.There is no lag in term of operations, works smoothly even if you keep more than 50+ tabs open.If you are mostly around internet connection this is a perfect device.However you can do all the offline work as well on G-Suite.(the way a normal laptop gets used without internet)Highly satisfied.❤️"
5,Product is good look neat and clean . Delivered on time.
5,"It's beautiful and very I am very happy.10/10 for screen quality , anti glare, battery life. Brilliant."
1,Extremely slow not at all working
1,Waste laptop very very slow to open chrome it takes 1hour Don't waste ur time by watching also change opinion
1,Very slow even after update your zoom meeting will over then this laptop will open worst laptop not good laptop
5,"I think those who are looking for the office work segment and daily tasks, should go with this laptop , Note just install one SSD and 4 gb stick with it then it will be beast for the productiveness."
5,"Superb PC, outstanding performance."

1,This product started going slow  in exactly 24 days. After chatting on the app. The laptop was taken  for repair. It does not connect to the wifi also.  Today it is a month of my purchase and I get a call that the hard disk has to be changed...... isn't this a joke. Tge product did not work properly for even a month.
1,"Display quality is very bad compared to other laptops in this price range. I've bought this one on 23rd March and screen got damaged on 20th April without any external damaged caused. When we showed them to customer care, they refused to get it changed. Asus really has to take up their game in customer care service, Now I have to pay another 6k to get it replaced. Don't buy this Laptop!!!"

1,I want to return this item due to its bad performance but nobody contacted to pick this.  Please depute some one immediately
4,"IT'S WAY BETTER THAN LENOVO, THE SCREEN IS GOOD, THE OVERALL BUILT AND LOOKS IS AWESOME, PERFORMANCE IS GOOD. WEIGHT IS SO LIGHT. W JUST ADD 4GB RAM MORE AND THIS LAPTOP IS PERFECT."
1,It’s very very slow not even suitable for an 8 yr old kid attending schools.

5,"Best laptop in i3, vary good laptop for basic use at best price for i3 10th generation go for it.."
5,"Don't expect gaming experience at this price range. For students or office work its a very nice laptop and performs satisfactorily all basic jobs like MS Office, web browsing, online classes skype or zoom. For two days windows update takes quite a time but after that no lagging. Never tried any games but used adobe photoshop and corel draw no issues. Earlier thought of installing SSD but as if know not required after using it for 5 days.Don't know why Asus laptop have yellow tint? This one also have yellow tint even after adjusting to normal in splendid settings.Very Light weight as compared to my earlier Dell."
1,"Guys always check processor, don't check i3 or i5, i7. Word doesnot matter hardware matters.Just check processor speed, it's base processor speed is 1.19ghz. which is equivalent to celeron processor. Pay 2 or 3 thousand more, but processor speed must be more than 2.2 ghz."
2,"Not good to comparison its price, it is 2020 old launched.Not fulfill satisfaction of any buyer on this budget."

1,PRODUCT HAS DAMAGED.APPLIED FOR REPLACEMENT
3,"The laptop is strictly for office/student use.Gaming capabilities are less, battery life is adequate, 15'6"" screen makes videos and movie lover's life easy.For the above purposes, I would rate 4/5, I've rated lesser since it doesn't cater my performance requirements"
4,Its a best laptop than 3593 as it has LED display and brighter screen.  Licensed MS Office and Macfee security for 15 months.

5,"When I obtained this device, I was unsure of its quality and reliability. But in the last 30 days, I have gradually changed my mind and can say with some certainty, that it indeed is a good product for the amount I paid for it. let me hope it will serve well beyond its warranty period."
2,Camera quality is not good.😔
5,This laptop with an i7 processor is a great choice for anyone looking for a faster machine to work from home. Highly recommended
1,Don't but this booooo never on and if on say laptop is hacked waste of money don't buy trust me
1,Looks and price are deceptive. Do not throw you ur hard earn money here. These guys can not send simple adaptor of my esrlier laptop useless for a long if life digital. I am sure this will be also same . Another challenge is no upgrade n no support if you stuck throw your laptop only way ...

3,Good product in medium range. Can be more effective with the backlit keyboard and other options of the 11th generation laptop.
1,"Poor display, poor battery backup, poor boot up time, poor touch pad.. extremely disappointed with the product"
1,"The keyboard keys were not working. Need to long-press the keys to type any character. Delete/backspace keys are also not working. Tried to place return/replace on amazon, they gave message slots are unavailable at your address. Now I am stuck with defective product."
3,Keyboard is very hard to use and no USB ports are provided at right side of the laptops.Go for any other make.
1,"Not a good product. Very disappointed with seller, Lenovo brand and Amazon. With in 15 days of its arrival, we have faced issue of ''Key Jam or Key not Pressed"". I Cannot trust Lenovo and Amazon for future shopping. Even seller of this product has not replied for the issue. Amazon is asking for service denial letter from Lenovo company and Lenovo is not providing same for this laptop. After replacing upper case of my new laptop the screen flickering problem is occurring now. Lenovo is suggesting for screen replacement. What a non-sense suggestions Lenovo is providing for new laptop."
4,"Performance is good. Build quality average. AI Powered, Very soft keyword."
1,Laptop is not working properly. there are lot of screen flicker and blackout issue. Battery backup is also very poor and a lot of heating issue in laptop.
1,Pls don't Purchase this ladptop. Bust laptop. Hang issue battery problem. Keypad issue.When I connect with Amazon team they refused to retrun this product.
5,Works fine as expected. Fast delivery by Amazon
3,poor display go for only IPS Panel  Zero viewing angle
1,Laptop slowed after 1 day.Dont buy this so many better options are available. Not worth the price. Keyboard and build quality feels cheap
1,"Worst quality by amazon such a bad response guys dont ever buy laptops from amazon such a worst guys they are dont buy, no clear responce"
3,Laptop manufactured with poor plastic material
5,"Looks lovely, dgrey matt finish, easy to Install immediately, works awesome, good value for money with a Core i5 and 8GB ram.. works great for home and school use.. definitely recommend it!!"
4,Extraordinary product
5,Good product
1,"Lenovo laptops are ok as long as they are within warranty period. Once warranty period overs and if you face any issues with your laptop, be ready to suffer. Service centers are worst and they don't have spare parts available with them. They don't even prefer to work with out of warranty laptops. This is my personal experience with lenovo products. So if you are planning to buy lenovo laptops, keep this in mind."
5,"I got the laptop last night. It is amazing. The display is awesome. The laptop is very light and it is well constructed overall. The keyboard is great with a few quirks e.g. A somewhat strong backlight. The performance is awesome. Kudos to Lenovo for bringing an excellent product at the right price point to market.There is an inbuilt facility LENOVO VANTAGE to check your laptop overall performance.You can do Hardware Scan, System Update, Enable Dolby, Enable Rapid charge, Enable Network Boost.1. CPU-Intel(R) Core(TM)i5-10300H CPU @ 2.50GHz. Very powerful processor.2. RAM-Samsung 8GB. RAM is not enough. For improved performance, more than 8 GB need to be upgraded.3. The design is very cool and the fabrication quality is very good.4. The battery is like most gaming laptops.5. GPU-NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 makes the gameplay flawless.6. SSD-Samsung 250GB. More than enough to boot OS smoothly.7. HDD-WDC 1 TB. Enough to handle the storage.8. 15.6-inch Full HD with 120 Hz IPS screen for better viewing angles, outstanding image quality and color accuracy.9. The sound and bass quality is really good. Must use the headset in a noisy environment otherwise you will not be able to hear the speaker even with full volume.Top of that you get access to over 100 high-quality Xbox game paas. After one month your subscription continues to be charged at the regular price and selected terms unless cancelled in Microsoft account."
4,"Talking about the Specs:Display is fabulous ,no complain for that, more than expectation.Battery is a big issue but but but there is charger that charges it fastly...Iris display becomes a big game changer from any angle you view it it will simply look awesome.Talking about the battery time ... It gives normally 4.5 hours in normal usage in full brightness...While editing(adobe prmere pro) and while coding on heavy usage i got 2.5 or 3 hrs of battry.Backlit keyboard is not provided as it has been hour while i was searching for that but didnt get it.No fingerprint and thats not a problem at all.Overall i wont return this ..its processor is okay not an issue,Sound is also a great at this budget...If you are still in a doubt buy this.. Value for money , i would rate it 4.5 just because of the less battery backup but i wont complain for the rest by the way a good choice.Disclaimer: i had put the battery on power saving mode it gave me almost 5 hr backup.Finally overall best for me... While you are buying a laptop of 45k just add more of a bit money and buy this a brand that would never let you regret."
5,"Pros:Build quality - feels premium.Display quality - ips display with excellent viewing angles.Battery life - easily gives 7-8 hours and charges within 1:20 hours.Sound: loud and clear with Harman Audio.Performance: boots up quickly and performs very well for general usage.No deal breakers as such but would be tempted forBrightness: although it's sufficient but another 20-30 nits would be awesome.MS Office: at the price they could have bundled it with office home and student.RAM: at the price 8 GB of RAM should be there. Can be increased, but existing ram would be useless as there is judt one slot.Overall really happy with the purchase and would certainly recommend this at this price."
5,"PROs:the laptop boots fast, apps open fast. very snappy.laptop build is quality is good. though not as premium as thinkpad t series.you get sata drive, you can connect HDD or sata SSD to expand storage.the concern i had before buying the laptop was how well it could run linux. It runs linux very well. tried ubuntu 20.04LTS. on linux battery backup is very good and does not heat during normal usage.con:there is only one ram slot. if you plan to upgrade ram, you will have to remove existing ram and keep aside.no keyboard backlightthe warranty had started two months back when in checked lenovo vantage. there is optionnin lenovo website to correct it. mine is corrected now"
4,"This laptop has amazing build quality for the price.Everything feels solid and well put togather.The Ips Display,Though not that color accurate has really wide viewing angles.The Looks are also really good.The laptop can handle basic tasks very well with the default configuration.The NVME SSD makes the laptop boot up and open apps really quickly.The laptops feels really snappy overall due to the ssd.  The only dowlside is the 4gb single channel ram.I'm planning to upgrade it to 8 gb ram since the ram starts to get filled up to 90% if i open 5-10 tabs in firefox"
2,The laptop is heavy.The display is not good. compared display with other ThinkPad machine.rest config is average as per the price.
4,"1. Laptop looks good at this price, purchased 2 days ago.2. Keyboard is not backlit. But it is wrongly mentioned under product description that Keyboard is backlit."
5,The only cons of this laptop is RAM is not upgradable. Either you should use it with the given size or completely replace the existing one.
5,"I use it for normal home use,  Like watching movies , light browsing. Can watch 2 movies continuously once full charge. Light weight, compact and sturdy feel."
5,"Go for i5 , i3 is bit slow . Fast Charging is good though . I’m enjoying it for now"
5,"Thinkpad E14 is a very nice product. It comes with 256 GB SSD which gives a good performance. It came in a good packing, new piece without any issue. Cost is worth to spend."
4,"Thinkpad is the best. As far as this model is concerned, it's good for it's price. If you upgrade the RAM to 8GB, it works like a charm."
5,My Lenovo think pad best in ever unbeatable last seven yearsDurable and performanceAmazing 3 hours battery backupMy favorite

1,"This laptop is extremly slow, I have posted a video of how long it takes to restart will help you decide. I really was excited about it, but since the time I got the laptop, I am just behind fixing the issues and the best part is you can't even get a new one unless it's faulty. By faulty Amazon will consider only when there is a fault found while running tests, and this slowness will not pick up as a fault. Its extremely slow, not sure if the hardware is to be blamed or windows 10, but makes it difficult even to carry out basic tasks. Would recomend you to stay away from it"
1,"I've received Defective item, Keyboard was not working properly and battery was drains too fast."
5,It's a very nice product.. delivery was prompt.. the laptop is quite sleek and good battery life..
5,Good battery life
1,I recieved a defective product its not open yest opend display only.i was order for emergency purpose but it not open we cannot belive to emergency
5,Vey nce
5,"Very great laptop. Just a bit heavy and the fiber material not that perfect. But interesting colour, great display and very nice hardware and software. Overall a good Investment."
5,I like dell laptop because it is processor and battery is very good and very thickness laptop so that I like dell laptop
5,At this price range performance is very good with 120hz panel..
5,Bought this from lenovo store. It's good for casual gaming. Also buy it in as low as 59.8k from lenovo store
1,I am regretting after purchasing it. It is super slow.
5,"It's an amazing laptop at this price. Boot time is few seconds and its fan doesn't make any notice. It is preloaded with windows 10 home and Microsoft office and student 2019, which you just need to activate (no need to buy key). Vdo and sound qlty is decent. It is not shown in the picture but it has finger print scanner alongwith the touch pad"
4,"One of the best laptops i had ever used. With SSD support, it works like a rocket. As of now the best quality product with reasonable price. Amazon service is also equivally good with safe, timely and well packaged."
4,Till now...no problem is there.... I' just worried about the battery how it performs.. otherwise it's a good laptop.... I like it's design..it's a small laptop with no number keys onthe right.... Very small that I expected
1,Couldn't expect this type of product recieved the product which have scratch on the body panel
5,"Superb design, light weight, very fast response, excellent keyboard"
4,"The machine reboots within 30 secs so thats great. All activities and multitasking related to office work ie  word, spreadsheet, gmeet, zoom calls etc are smooth and without any hicups, Batter backup is also good. The only con is that its heating up quite a bit. I cannot complain much on heating as I have a P50 Lenovo which costs a lot more but still heats up. so, All in all this one is a great buy and recommended. The killer addition is the 256G SSD drive +1T HDD."
5,"I reviewed after 15 days use, I like it, look wise OK, RAM 8gb with ssd it works smooth, battery backup 4 to 5hr, you go for normal use not heavy gaming work, you can use it for small game and little editing work. Weight is very less, very handy.In cons side camera quality is not OK."
4,Good for school students. Battery file is low. Camera so so. Speed more or less ok.
3,"It solves the basic purpose but it's not a very good laptop. Its auto brightness adjustment is really irritating and there's no option to disable it , battery drains 20 to 30% every hour if you're on YouTube or doing video courses or presentations so not impressive.It sometimes flickers when a lot of apps are being used though it's rare thingPositives are that its light weight , comfortable to use and solves your basic work and study purposeBut I don't suggest it for high end gaming and long work hour schedules"
1,The picture of the laptop as shown in the Amazon website had the keyboard in ash color with the characters written in white. The laptop which was delivered had characters in ash written on ash color backgtround which made it extremely difficult to see the keys and type in.

Perfect in every sense, very swift because of the SSD storage, screen and laptop body are stunning and have no defects. All the features as promised in discription plus theres 100gb Dropbox cloud storage 1 year subscription free to which I was fairly suprised but really elated as I do use Dropbox regularly and recently completed my subscription period. In all a perfect laptop especially in just 35990. I would suggest to go for it. Also it has backlit keyboard even though it's not specified in description."
5,I love this product good build quality and great performance at this price range and i surprised that it has backlit keyboard.
5,very good product of Acer in this range1. Display quality is very good.2. Keyboard's backlight feature is excellent and the keypad is also smooth.3. battery backup is 5-6 hours.4. Easy to carry because of its lightweight.5. MS office of 2019 is preloaded.6. I was expecting a window 10 pro version but it is a window 10 home.7. Ram is  4GB was expecting 8GB.8. Speaker sound is a bit low.9. Trackpad could be more improved.10. Laptop's extended warranty option is not there on purchasing from Amazon but it is there on the Acer site.Overall it's a great deal in this budget by Amazon.

Just average.Ram management is gud but planning to upgrade ram and add hdd
4,"Smooth, breezing, light weight, very good laptop for office work, awesome screen quality, boot time, app opening very fast. Good for light gaming /editing although keypad and bottom area gets a bit hot. Would definitely recommend to someone who is looking for personal laptop for wfh purposes and daily normal use case scenarios on long term basis."

5,"Very nice , I like it, really it is working fine and Performance is very very excellent, I am so happy"
1,In 37k u have to give atleast 8gb ram or 512 gb ssd..in 34-35k u should go but in 37k its average
1,The body of the laptop is plastic and look very odd
3,"For a price of 40K, I expected more on the sound. Totally disappointed in sound."
5,Good
5,Like Dell
5,Perfect product . Worthy of money
3,Good
1,Third quality product no battery life and heated very fast . Camera is not good. I totally disappointed with this Dell product
2,Likes : PerformanceDislike: build qualityI have been using Dell laptops since long. This is my first time I bought a HP laptop and I am very disappointed. Went to pavilion series so that I can get better quality than essential series. But worthless.When I am lifting the laptop in my hands I am hearing annoying sound. Seems like bottom panel near speaker is not well built and set.Easily banding while lifting. 0 stars for build quality.Can anyone help me to get refund instead of return. I want to go back to Dell again. Big regret buying this laptop
4,"1-look/finish/color awsome 5/52-display 4/53-battery 4/54-speed super 5/5 (multiple tasking easy)5-graphic card 4/5 (GTA5 tested)6-price 4/5 (brand value, otherwise 2-3k should be less)7-big still look compact8- inbuilt speakers 4/59-front camera 4/510-office support free lifetime (+point)"
4,"The laptop is sleek for its weight. Feels premium. As long as you dont drop or scratch it with any object, the body would stay like new. Finger print scanner is lightning fast.Performance is very good. In battery saver mode you can watch downloaded videos for upto 8 hours. In performance mode the battery drains up too quickly. Everything about the laptop is near perfect, if battery life is not your major point of usage, go for it. The battery life is decent but could have been better. The sound quality is superb. Will update after a couple months of use."
5,"This is a complete package laptop 💻 for professionals, if you want to work with high end softwares, editing and development.But build quality can be made better, we need to take extra care, while traveling but I am completely satisfied with the 16GB RAM ( i5 11 gen), 2 gb graphics.Kepad backlit can be made better. But totally satisfied with overall features."
3,"Assumed being i5 11th Gen with 16 GB RAM and SSD it would be fast, but not as fast as the ones I saw of MI and Asus 10th Gen with just 8 GB RAM.It's advisable to go for those models which are much lighter and faster with much cheaper price than for this HP."
4,"Pros:1) This laptop is value for money and have  the latest i5 11th gen processor.2) It is slim sleek and light weight, easy to  carry.3) Has narrow brezzels.4) Keyboard has backlit.5) Some people were saying that it haspower button on the left of power button  which makes them think that laptop may get shutdown while clicking delete but it is totally wrong as if it may get clicked by mistake then laptop won't get shutdown we need to press windows button+power button to shut down.6) Fingerprint is very fast get log in 1 sec.Cons:1) It doesn't have backlit in spacebar.2) Battery backup isn't that good as it has  41wh battery.3) laptop doesn't open single handed.4) camera quality is not that good but it isn't a major issue as all laptop except surface books and macbook have bad camera quality.5) touchpad is a little rough but again not an issue you will get habitual towards it."
4,"I am in love with the build quality and design, it's very elegant and sleek. The display is beautiful and can be seen clearly from any angles.The performance is amazing, the responses are quick. The camera is good too. The speakers however are below and the sound might get muffled at times other wise the sound quality is great.Battery backup is average, don't expect it to last more than 5-6 hours. I feel the need to keep the brightness on maximum in a well lit room.I used the laptop for casual games, I got more than 100 FPS on medium-high settings and 150+ on low settings. Mx 450 is good enough for light gaming.One huge con of this laptop is that it heats up a lot while running heavy tasks such as running multiple platforms and meetings, or gaming. But with this light weight slim design it is expected of it. The dual fan cooling doesn't do much to help it.Overall I love the laptop wouldn't change it for anything else. perfectly suits my needs."
3,"Laptop is good looking and fast. However it has heating issues from day one. I recommend not to use it without a cooling pad. I got it at 65k and I think it was a reasonable price. Fingerprint scanner, audio speakers, battery backup are all fine. Screen is ok. Not too good, not too bad. My last laptop with Dell had better screen."
5,"I love everything about this laptop. Light weight, boots up within 10 seconds, very fast and smooth experience using it. Value for money. I got this for about 67k. Great laptop. I recommend to buy this laptop if you are looking for decent battery life, great performance and fast and smooth user experience."
4,"- Battery drain is faster- not suitable for gaming- it has got plastic body and build quality is ok- rest all is good, like screen, speaker, processor, RAM, etc- not sure about additional storage space, I can't find any information"
5,It's very good product by HP. I love to do work on it. It is very fast booting time and work so fast. Transfer speed is too good. Value for money product.
5,"Everything good, It installed heavy softwares for me in quick time. 1Tb SSD would have made this machine a beast."
5,Good battery life but costly as per specs
4,Everything is perfect with this laptop except backlit / back light keyboards.
5,"The product is really good, really fast, slim, good batteryCons GPU heat in high frame rate game  Screen is not top level"
1,While changing time touch pad current passing it is  waste product
5,Nyc  productGood qualityGood battery backup
5,The laptop is as per the provided details by the seller on the listing. Pretty satisfied with the overall performance.
5,Super product smooth good quality good battery backup go for it
3,Battery drops suddenly by 6percent each time when I use.
5,"We bought this laptop last week from hp website after reviewing many laptops. We are very much satisfied and thrilled with features. It is light weight, 16 GB RAM (6GB internal graphics) , 2 GB dedicated graphics, backlit keyboard, FHD resolution, RAM extendable up to 32GB. Battery may come around 5 hours I think.It's the BEST. Blindly go for it."
5,Slim and smart looking piece..easy to handle for longer work period also. Very nice screen.. Battery life is very good ( upto 6 to 7 hour for normal work). Graphic intensive gaming also work perfectly.. Finally it's very fast compared to whatever laptop u have use now.. Value for money..
5,Build quality is awesome and also performance is too good. Boot time is maximum 4 to 5 seconds. I think in this price rage this laptop is good. I bought it at 69000.
4,Overall it's good.What I Like:1. Bootup (within 3 sec.)2. Screen3. Processor4. Speaker5. DesignWhat can be improved/ don't like:1. Build Quality (Plastic only)2. Overheating3. Battery Life (It's average 4 to 6 hours only)
5,"If you are student or proffesional developer please buy it, it's amazing laptop, it's same like using macSmooth and fast awesome experience"
5,Nothing like this this is for those who wants light weight but slightly powerfull laptop with sleek looks it comes with 3 colour option and trust me all of them are looking to good
4,"Bought this one from the store as it was not available few days ago in Amazon. laptop's build quality is good.Pros-16gb + 512gb nvme + nvidia MX450Blazing fast. Took less than 3 sec to startup, thought it was in sleep mode but not. LoLVery sensitive fingerprint reader.Backlit keyboard (only white colour with 2 types of brightness control)1.75kg is a decent weight for modern laptops.Nvidia MX450 is a good Gcard.65 watt Fast charging is a good thing.Decent battery backup 5-6 hrs of using from 70% charge.Full HD IPS display. 250 nits. 60hrz refresh rate, 45% NTSC (it should be little bit higher upto today's mark)Cons.Lacking of extra ports. No RJ45, only 2 usb 3.0 ports and one type c and a card reader which can't read SDHC card because you can't insert that.Price is little bit high.Most and probably the one question for everyone who want to buy this one is Can I upgrade the SSD or is there any extra slot for ssd or NVME?I HAVE NO IDEA!! I contacted with HP supprot to ask about ssd upgradable or not, they didn't answered.Overall I am happy with this product of HP. The purpose for buying this laptop for me is serious editing works and office jobs. It has everything That I need. But I can say that you won't regret after buying this whatever your purpose of working. Let me know if any one buy this laptop and get any answer about upgrading ssd."
5,A decent laptop purchased from store 67k. Amazing features and easy to carry and use it. Veey fast laptop in current ratio of amount.
1,Quality of LCD is poor and needs to replace within 15 days and Amazon billing issue to claim warranty service
5,"Good speed because of SDD HDD, good looks, light weight, good battery backup & with back led keyboard. HDD&SSD both HDD."
1,"Guys, never go for this laptop.1. My purchase had warranty issues. I received the product yesterday, and the warranty has already started in the month of Feb.2. No MS office included.3. It has display issues. I have placed a replacement request.4. The system lags a lot while browsing. It’s a one day old laptop and it’s slow AF. I just can’t believe this. I haven’t even installed any applications or software.5. The task manager button doesn’t appear for me to end task the browser when it’s stuck, the only way to close the apps is to power off the system. I have attached a picture below. Take a look at it.6. System automatically shuts down and turn on. I THINK THERE’S A GHOST INSIDE THIS LAPTOP. LolPlease don’t waste your hard earned on this. I recommend you to go for a better version (8gb ram at least). That’s okay, not everyone is a techie and has product knowledge. Take your time. A Sunday evening with a cup of coffee may be, open YouTube and watch product review videos, compare and then purchase as per your requirement.I’m not seeing an option to remove that one star. Okay you can take that for the design. Thanks for reading."
2,"The warranty period started on February 6th 2021, whereas we received the laptop on 30th May. That is almost 4 months less warranty period. Does that mean, we should not order such items through Amazon?"
1,My money is waste don’t purchase ever Lenovo laptop in this model the biggest issue is that sound system worst .
4,"The first laptop received was a defective laptop which don't even boot up, there were two beeps and a ""Fan Error"" was displayed and laptop immediately shut down. Raised a replacement request and waited for the service technician who was scheduled to visit after 5 days and approve the replacement/return.With such issues I was getting doubt over the manufacturing quality and how long will it work even after a replacement is provided, feel so bad that even after spending such huge amount cant use the product for even few mins.***Update***The technician visited after 5 days and immediately approved a replacement as it was an hardware error, after an I hour I was able to order a replacement on Amazon website and an a new laptop was delivered the very next day, thanks to amazon for their exceptional delivery of products.The replacement laptop worked fine and I was able to configure windows and the applications I wanted to install, activating windows and Microsoft office was seamless and one just needs to create or provide an existing outlook account to enable all services provided by Microsoft.Now coming to the laptop review, the machine is slim, lightweight and perform really well.Body / Build : Top panel is made of some metal with matte finish but still susceptible to finger prints. the screen opens smoothly and the hinge is perfectly adjusted to avoid any shakes to screen on using the laptop. The bottom panel and the keyboard area is made with matte finish plastic which is thinner than the old ThinkPad laptops. I have used ThinkPad T430 earlier which had a thicker but a stronger base. the laptop tends to bend if you hold it with one corner, so I feel Lenovo should have better provided the same metal casing at the bottom as well.Screen: The one I received is an IPS LED screen and has good brightness and color reproduction, unlike may customers who have reported a yellowish tint is not present my model, may be on a TN display E15 it may appear but I am not sure on that.Hardware: Comes with decent mid range Intel Processor which has 4 physical cores and 8 logical cores, so will be more than enough for students and user who need it for light photo / video editing, RAM is 2666 MHz but as only one slot is provided one needs to remove existing 8 GB module in order to upgrade.Laptop has two separate horodisks >  a 128 GB NVME SSD with excellent performance compared to a SATA SSD, there is a 1TB 5400 rpm HDD which can be upgraded with a SATA SSD in future.Fingerprint reader is really fast and comes handy to preform several authentication related tasks, it turns green from white when a user input is required.Keyboard is more of less strong and no depressions are observed while typing, keys are chicklet type which provides better response than those rubbery keyboards in cheaper Lenovo laptops. Typing is fast and easy, the numerical keys on a 15 inch mode is also very handy to perform calculation and excel based operations. Lenovo has provided several functional shortcuts which are integrated with the function keys, also there is a dedicated rupee symbol and equals with parentheses which are very handy for programmers. There are two levels of keyboard backlight ledsBattery: Battery backup is great and I was able to get over 7 hours with light video watching and internet browsing, the 65 W charger is able to quickly charge the battery. Also if someone is able to use the laptop with the charger continually plugged in they can use the Lenovo Vantage app to control the battery charge %. This will prolong the battery life, does not heat up the charger and save power as well.Camera: Camera quality is not that great, and its definitely not a HD camera, the images are blurry and dark in a poorly lit environment, but still can serve the basic purpose of video calls which don't need very clear videos. Mic is okay but still not great and one needs to sit near the laptop in order to speak and others in the call to understand clearly.Connectivity: It has the latest connectivity options with USB-C 3.0, Two USB 3.1 and a USB 2.0. Wifi has good range and connects to 2.4 Ghz or 5 Ghz without any hassles. External HDD with USB 3.0 and Flash Drives with USB 3.0 provides good data transfer speeds of over 35-40 MBps, Bluetooth connectivity is good and usable with audio devices.Conclusion: One can easily do all normal tasks and even light photo/video editing, playing medium games which don't require a dedicated graphics card. Laptop works silently and cooling seems good, there is a slight heating up on the middle right of the lower panel, but since using it over 10 days didn't faced any hardware of software issues."
5,"Received laptop yesterday after waiting for good 4 days post placing order. Surprisingly the laptop is very lightweight and sleek and unlike previous Thinkpads doesn't feel bulky.On first start it took few mins to configure Windows10. But subsequent startups happened within 5-7 seconds thanks to 128 GB SSD. The fingerprint scanner works flawlessly and is a good feature for a modern laptop.The red dot on i of Thinkpad logo glows when laptop is on, a subtle feelgood feature.The laptop body feels premium with smooth finish however it is a fingerprint magnet.Keyboard is very smooth and back-lit too. Two levels of brightness are supported.Overall a good purchase."
5,"Excellent laptop with a fair price. I got the laptop for 58 K during the GreateIndian Festival. The laptop look sturdy, compact and lightweight. Because of its compact appearance, the screen size never feels like 15.6 inches compare to other laptops of the same size! Loves the display. It is 1920X1080 IPS with antiglare technology backed by Intel UHD graphics. Excellent sound quality as well. It is capable of performing extremely CPU intensive operations with its 8 GB main memory and I5 4 core processor. Of course I am not a gamer - I am using laptop for design and programming purposes.Few things noted are:- It is required to create a Microsoft outlook/live account, if dont have in handy- to activate the MS OFFICE. Only one month trial antivirus(McAfee) is with the laptop, so need to purchase another antivirus software after a month. There is no SD card slot with this laptop,therefore the external micro sd cards can not be used directly with the laptop.(But there are other mechanisms like put the sd card in a mobile and connect via usb port...etc)."
3,"I bought the ThinkPad as they are quite popular for business purpose. However quite disappointed with the display quality. The display is really not that bright. So I will rate dispaly as quite poor. Second the battery life is ok not great. And 3rd is that SSD is only 128 gb which is quite low. They should have given at least 256 gb. There is also no micro SD और SD card reader. Not quite happy with the purchase especially because of display quality, battery life and Low SSD. It doesn't justify the Thinkpad brand."
4,"Will do an update later after more use.Immediate views on receiving and setting up provided below.Pros:1. Lightweight and normal sized? (this could vary on user experience of previous laptop used, for some reason I imagined 15.6 is big in terms of screen size)2. Has all the advertised features of E15 provided on Amazon page. (I have read reviews where sometimes laptops received didn't have the features mentioned in description)3. Easy to setup and use (I'm a simple user, no gaming or coding... Just basic ms word, powerpoint, browsing, entertainment and minor editing)Cons :1. Warranty mentioned starts in early October 2020 while I bought the laptop exactly one month later, so only 11 months left Instead of 12. (Manufacturing date was mentioned as September 2020 which is good to know)2. Expensive, considering ssd is only 128. For this price, atleast 256 if not 512 should have been there. (During the Diwali sale, I got it for 48000 on exchange + other offers, without exchange it would cost you around 60000)3. Fingerprint magnet (laptop as of otherwise looks sleek, again this depends on individual preferences)Additional info :1. Incase anyone didn't read the details clearly like me, there is no dvd drive. Again not everyone needs one, but if you do, then stay away from this one.2. Original price mentioned on box -  829333. Made in China."
5,"Had been looking for a 15'6 Thinkpad since quite sometime. And wait was worth it. Is value for money product. Keys are soft, good battery back up, was light in terms of weight than what I was expecting and 128SSD with the 1TB hard disk is good enough in terms of performance. The more I am using it, more it amazes me.The highlight is the backlit keyboard."
1,The warranty of the thinkpad E 15 laptop shows start date of 13 October 2020 whereas the purchase date is 19 November 2020 which is the Invoice date.Why is warranty not starting from purchase date of laptop.Why is product warranty on Lenovo website showing for 325 days instead of 365 days.
4,At the very first day it was nice but after that its hard disk started troubling.2 days later its screen completely gone except the mouse pointer.But i think it was an exceptionally defective product.I'll review it again as i get a replacement against this.
5,"There are other laptops with maybe better specs at lower or equivalent price if your primary purpose is gaming or video processing. However if you're a software developer or a business person and want a laptop you want to work reliably for next 5 or more years i think this is the one i'll use even though i've been using it for just 15 days myself. Below are my observations after about 2 weeks of use which matter to me the most:-WHAT I LIKE:-# Display bright enough to work comfortably outside on a bright sunny day while sitting under shade of a tree for example.# simply the best laptop keyboard with very good tactile feedback and key travel even after using the silicone protector.# free office subscription.# wifi 6 compatibility with dual receiver antenna & USB C charging make it future proof to some extent.# ability to disable wifi, bluetooth, camera, microphone, ports, fingerprint sensor, etc via BIOS if case that's your thing. Bios is very good and offers a lot of customization.# length and width less than most other 15 inch laptops so does not feel bulky. Almost feels like a 14.5 incher.# Everything works very well on ubuntu 20 which is what i use personally. It even does not have any bluetooth driver issues like most other laptops have on linux with choppy and distorted hd stereo audio playback. I installed ubuntu on windows partition itself in dual mode to utilize the ssd. allocated 50 gb each to windows and ubuntu all the while keeping the recovery partition intact.WHAT I DON'T LIKE:-# battery locked inside (although this helps reduce the laptop size)# placement of function key. (Although you can swap it with ctrl key via BIOS).# Although build is very good but still there is slight flex in body due to plastic body if you hold it with one hand and wave it or move it too quickly.# outer body attracts fingerprints.# fingerprint reader used does not work on linux due to lack of driver as of writing this review. It may be available in future though or in ubuntu 20.10 which i've not tried yet."
5,"I was looking for a sturdy and quality laptop with at least 15inch screen. ThinkPad E15 model is a robust laptop and very good performance. I am using it mainly for software development and this is my first ever Thinkpad(personal), since all my previous personal laptops have been only from HP. I am happy with the laptop performance.Backlit keyboard is activated by pressing Fn + spacebarThere are two level of brightness in backlit keyboard, default settings is off.Intel I5 Processor is fast with quick SSD and Windows 10 Home comes preloaded. It is very much sufficient for multi-tasking such as software dev, office work or even videos playing, not tried playing any game on this."
1,Picture quality not good.screen is quite yellowish compared to other laptops..dull..not expected from Lenovo in such a high priced product
5,"Pros1. Overall lightweight package, has aluminum lid, with a splendid keyboard with adequate typing feedback.2. Usb C charging, TPM chip for data security, with trackpoint (to use mouse pointer when using gloves).3. Powerbutton integrated finger print sensor.4. Camera shutter for added privacy.5. NVME plus SATA storage support, the product i received uses WD Blue spec HDD and NVME storage (performace and durability oriented drives)6. Overall build quality is satisfactory.7. Lenovo vantage software with good system management tools including battery management tools.Cons1. Its a finger print magnet.2. Only one ram slot ( memory upgrade means you have to buy a 2666MHZ 16gb memory, means your existing 8gb one go wasted)."
5,"I received the laptop in just 2 days from the order, as usual super fast delivery from Amazon. I am very happy with the delivery speed, the performance, and battery back up. Even when I open 2 Instances of Android Studio, Visual Studio code, multiple browsers there is no delay or lag in navigation b/w apps. I would have preferred some color choices, but this is available in only black. Overall I like it very much."
5,A light weight and slim laptop. No non sense laptop which is value for money. Works flawlessly and very snapy. One thing you need to know is that it's a fingerprint magnet.No lag in using any heavy apps. I don't play games on laptop so can't comment on that. Display is good as well.Overall a classy product.
4,"Okay, so I bought the 15 inch version .I really like the keyboard on this laptopI have used close to 3 laptops over 10 years and by far this Keyboard 'chicklet keyboard' is pretty damn good. It doesn't flex that one of the most important thing. And the Track Point is just love to scroll around. Works really well with Windows. The palm rejection on this thing is Greaat, like literally when you're using Trackpoint you tend to go over the track padSo Palm rejection is NEAT.Battery : close to 60-70 percent brightness would last you 6 hrs with Wifi On.The screen does have a yellowish tint to it but when you ramp up the brightness it fades away but yup there's a tintGreat Audio outputIt does get a little warm near the hand rest or lower side of the keyboard .All in all worthy 60k laptop.I would suggest if you immediately need one go get this one . If you can wait until April 2021 buy the ThinkPad AMD GEN 2 version .That would be great Deal if the price is still under 60k.Thanks ;)"
3,"Pros:-- Decent build quality-- FPR works like a charm-- Keyboard is great-- Decent battery life-- Having PRO appeal to itCons:-- Poor display with yellow tint & backlight bleeding issues. Can literally give you jaundice if you work many hours a day on this! You don't even need to enable the ""Night light"". It's there out of the box! Even my 5 yr old hp is having a great life-like IPS panel where whites are just white. Whites are not white on this thinkpad one but yellowish!-- A huge fingerprint magnet. Will look dirty just after 30 mins once you get this out of the box.Pro tip: if you are serious about display quality, never buy online. Shop from an offline store after auditioning the display quality yourself!"
5,"Thinkpad have always been ahead with competition whe it comes to performance. This one is no difference although I got this one primarily for entertainment ( I am already using T490 for work). It just breeze. No lags. Screen is pleasing at 15.6"" & Harman audio with Dolby is an added charm. With 3 days of usage I am getting around 4 hours backup time while playing movies & games. Build quality is sturdy. Will add another review after a few weeks of usage."
2,I have been trying to upgrade my warranty date but still not done with it @ amazon.in pls upgrade my laptop warrant date as i have purchased on 22nd feb 2021 its warranty have started from 23rd nov 2020 pls update this date
4,"This laptop was purchased on 24 Feb 2021 delivered on 26.02.2021. As per my usage on last three week, this laptop gave three and half hours battery when battery saver is off, 4-5 hours when battery saver is on upon WiFi connected to mobile network. Upon purchase from Amazon I have checked this laptop serial number on Lenovo India  website if this product is genuine and iam happy about this product is genuine but warantee issue you can solve when you depose to Lenovo customer support. Charging time is ok but chager adopter was too much hotter during charging."
5,"Product is very good, happy with this, but in payment mode they show Zero EMI option that is also fine but while i received approval of EMI from my bank its shows hidden processing fees 588.42 that is wrong thing, they have to mention clearly in this so before taking EMI option i will pay full amount............"
3,"Received a defective product , Non ssd hard disk was making click sound when reading,  looks like the issue was from day 1 i noticed after 20 days , then I reached Lenovo  support and got confirmed from the support that hard disk to be replaced. finally I am getting the hard disk changed on a brand new laptop. Felt bad , but thats how it is ."
5,"Well I always wanted a Lenovo thinkpad series laptop. Very good, sleek and elegant. Strong and sturdy. And yes it does come in black with the signature thinkpad logo. Very good laptop at this price. Timely and prompt delivery by Amazon. It arrived couple of days before Dussera. Thanks Amazon!"
5,"As thinkpad as ever, even though it is win 10. Light and sturdy.No issues since a month. Maybe a a generation old, but good enough for work - non engineering."
4,"Decent thermals, good gaming experience at high graphics settings.Screen is not that bright. I have the brightness turned all the way up during the day.It was between this and the HP Omen 15 for me. Bought this because the Omen was way overpriced."
5,"After two days of working (being new to thinkpads) everything is very smooth about the device. New users might get irritated with the fn key on far left corner.Lenovo Vantage application on the device would help swap the keys (cntrl and fn), without needing to make changes in BIOS settings.I think everything else is covered in other reviews."
5,"Can do everything with this piece of beauty! Display, audio, build quality all are awesome. Battery backup and weight seem OK. Can do some casi6 gaming as well. Only disappointment is the camera, mere 0.9 MP max though it was shown a 720p HD cam."
5,"The laptop as such is good. It took a few calls to the technician to get MS office activated. The battery life for the laptop is reasonable, I'm getting 6 hours with normal use. Battery charges fast and reaches full charge in about 1 hour 20 minutes. The laptop is surprisingly light weight."
5,"Powerful and sufficient machine. I recieved the order two days before mentioned date. For day to day work , you can buy it blindly. It wont disappoint."
4,"I liked the built quality, the way it's design, keypad with smooth key, light weight with so handy.. About Battery life, seems to be average.. Reboot very fastly.."
4,"Build quality up to the mark, vantage option on battery I liked most, as 15"" screen battery back is not that long compared to 14"" laptops, touch pad, keyboard, Harman output awesome, overall performance is good"
4,"Besides the build quality and toughness and updated software and Operating system, this laptop doesn't have additional Graphics card. At this price range most of other laptops has additional Nvidia graphics card. So this is the only disappointment. Besides that, its hybrid  harddisk works perfectly without lag issues."
4,Lenovo Thinkpad E15 is a good laptop with awesome battery backup! The 128GB SSD makes the laptop turn on within 5-7 seconds! It has a built in fingerprint power button. Also it is very thin and light weight.But no face unlock!
4,"Have been using it for 1 month, battery backup is good and lasts for 6 hrs plus. Build quality and design is good. Liked overall looks, keyboard, finger print sensors.Cons :Screen has somewhat yellowish feel... So watching photos and videos may not be great.But again... But Its okay.. as all other features are good."
4,Nice one with this high configuration.looks good in style and design silky.Display good.sound average.battey good.Spewed processor restart and boot quickly.
5,"I am happy to Buy this laptop. It has full filled all my  requirement , fast Processing , Sufficient Space to store,No Need to get help from some one to Installed the system , this will automatically installed once you on the laptop. So avoid wastage of money to get help."
5,FEELS NICE WHILE WORKING ON IT.I THINK PRODUCT IS VERY STURDY AND WORKS VERY FAST.LOOK VERY NICE
4,Pros:- Laptop is sleek and good looking. Starting time very less. Performance good.Con:- picture quality not up to the standard. Very poor picture quality.
5,"Perfect combination for productivity, work and personal uses.Only con is that display screen is yellowish in color."
5,Value for money...less than 5 sec to boot super fast charge 65w. Amazon delivery on or before the day ..I got a day before expected date. Overall very satisfied.
5,"ThinkPad at its best; at a price I could afford!Thank you Lenovo!🙏🙂Ordered at 1:00 PM & Amazon delivered it by 8:30 PM, same day!Stupendous delivery system in place!!Way to go, Amazon! 👏👏👏"
5,"Good processer , smooth running l,lite weight nice looking..."
1,Very poor performance also startup and boot time very slow performance is very bad processing speed is very low .
1,"I had purchased laptop on 18th June 2020 first day of launch & received on 25th June 2020. After 2 days, OS was updated automatically & I faced Automatic Repair Issue.I asked for replacement & Amazon promptly replaced 3-4 days. But again after OS update... I am getting same issue."
1,"Day 1. Laptop showed Bluescreen within an hour of use and crashed. Not even able to perform automatic repair on Windows.Build quality is great and display is amazing, but what good is it if it doesn't work?Thanks to Amazon for accepting the return."
5,"One of the best laptop ever used, android studio, emulator,adobe premiere pro working on beast, no lag observed. Rendering time is also commendable."
2,"Speed not up to the mark,No backlit keyboard,No in built cam,Track oad is very cheap in build quality,No lifetime Microsoft office.High on specs but good for nothing.Mi has really disappointed."
5,Superb quality.. and value for money..  I think best laptop in this budget.. go for this 🔥🔥🔥🔥
3,"Value for money.Super fast booting, hardly takes 10-12 seconds.Easy to open with one finger, hinges are butter smooth.No complaints about webcam, perfect for video call & online classes for kids.Sleek & handy.Excellent pixel size. Though screen is 14 inches, it gives a large view.Sound quality is good.My rating 3.5 stars because of below cons:No backlit.Scroll pad quality is poor, while you click it gives different 'tik' sound.Battery doesn't last for 10 hrs as what they shown in promotion. Max 5-6 hrs.RAM & SSD can't be upgraded.Charger knob is hard. Very difficult to plug & unplug from laptop.Can't place it on the lap not more than 10 mins, getting hot & makes you uncomfortable."
4,"When I first saw the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition, I thought the laptop would be as expensive as the Dell XPS 13 or a MacBook Air. It’s got an aluminum build, an extremely comfortable keyboard, latest Intel processors, and a screen with the thinnest bezels in the market. All of those features, I just mentioned, are trademark of any high-end laptop these days. The Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition doesn’t cost as much as some of its rivals, but still offers excellent performance in a thin and light package.Pros:- 14-inch FHD Anti-glare display with minimal bezels- Intel Core i7 (10th generation)- 512GB NVMe SSD- Nvidia GeForce MX350- 1.35kg- Up to 10 hours of battery (practically lasts somewhere around 6-8 hours depending on your work)- Premium looks- Well priced (I won't call agressive pricing though)- Beautiful scissor-style keyboard with 1.3mm key travelCons:- No backlit keyboard in 2020 is a crime- Lack of a built-in webcam. Sure Xiaomi does provide a USB-enabled HD webcam in the box with the laptop but it's not the something one would like after paying this much- The notebook also lacks a physical fingerprint scanner as well which is again a bummer for the price and this time and age- The biggest downside of the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition is that there is no way to expand the notebook’s 8GB of 2666MHz DDR4 RAM as it's soldered to the board- The audio system on the notebook is weak. The stereo speakers don’t get loud. Plus, they lack bassThe laptop has a good design, better processing power and keyboard than every other Windows laptop in this price bracket. The Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition doesn’t cost as much as some of its rivals, but still offers excellent performance in a thin and light package. I'd certainly recommend this to anyone within this price bracket."
5,"I used it for 4 days, continuously for 7-8 hrs each day, does not heat much, was able to run Virtual Machine as well using VMware, Ram is not upgradable as its low powered module which is soldered on the board so this is China dumping low end models to India. I saw that in China, similar model with very high end specs in terms of Memory (16-32GB) and SSD capacity (1TB) are also available. Windows is Home version and not Pro which sucks if you like to use RDP on your laptop. There is no backlight in the keyboard which is a crime in 60k, keyboard is very small for people with big fingers, I would say if you have 60k for this, add 15-20k more and go for ASUS gaming model which comes with backlight keyboard and 16GB memory, has 15 inch IPS Screen. I would say this is a good ultrabook for office productivity, and low end games, but if you have to go for long term investment which can be upgraded in future, dont buy this model."
5,"Pros:1. Intel Core i72.10th Gen3.Light weight4. SSD5.Value for moneyAt this price the same config is not available in other brandsCons :1.Back lit keyboard,2. inbuilt web cam but the same is somewhat beneficial too.3.Lesser storage space,4.no ms office inbuilt (only one month trial version available)5.No logo.6.Small sized up down cursors."
5,One should purchase laptop what one should need. It may be not good for other but it is best deal for me. Before buying I went to apple store and local shops. Local shops were selling old asus zenbook. I needed light weight notebook.First of all I am touch typist so I don't need backlight keyboard. So backlight keyboard is not necessary for me. It has scissor mechanism keyboard. It is better than chiclet keyboard. It feels like heaven to type. May be that's the reason that they don't provided backlight. But they should provide backlight keyboard if they could but I am not sure whether scissor mechanism can provide backlight.It has two usb 3.1 gen 1 port which are 5 gbs. I wish they could be usb 3.2 gen 2 but I am not sure. Let purchase me external ssd of usb 3.2 gen 2.Battery life gave whole day. I didn't calculate. I am habitual of low brightness  so my battery time will be more.Most of the people are complaining about touchpad. It is flimsy. But they should read manuel. It is flimsy because it gives click sound when you tap it. For right click you have to touch with double finger. I think touchpad is good. It is different and unique from other.Lets talk about processor. The core i7 is beast. All work are superfast. I can't compare with ryzen processor which come with 7nm technology because I don't have one but this 14nm are good. But they do heat.GPU is very good. It's MX350.The best part is SSD . It has toshiba NVME gen 3 SSD which read write speed is 3500 MBps. That's amazing. Other provide SSD upto 1000 MBps.It has intel wireless 9560 card which provide wifi speed upto 1.7 gbps. Who need more speed than that. In India we are getting optical speed of 100-100 mbps.I downloaded games at 250mbps connection and laptop was getting warm. So who need wifi 6? Wifi 6 can support 2.4gbps. Moreover wifi6 it is not sure whether they have put good antenna. If antenna is not good on wifi than there is no use of wifi card.The thing that is missing is type c charging. But the charger supplies charges very fast and we don't have type c fast charger. It has mx 350 so we can play games so we can't charge with type c. Type c cable are short in length  due the reason they transmit data and the supplied charger have lot of length. If thunderbolt is needed than buy apple because it has graphic card and one who is buying this can't afford external graphic card or 5k tv. This is budget laptop. If you are complaining about 1.4b hdmi port than mx 350 can support only hdmi 1.4b. You are getting a lot in ₹ 60000. They have kept essential things and removed non essential items and targetted the needs of people of mind.I was skeptical to buy this due to anti Chinese movement but than thought and bought it and reasons I would not share here. I am not anti national to buy Chinese product. There were options like acer swift 5 but they increased the price by 5k and asus vivobook 14 they also increased by 5k. I thought a lot over it and my justification are only justified to me. I don't want to explain to anyone and I am not anti nationalist to buy Chinese product. I don't recommend this product as it is Chinese product but I have bought this product due to my personal reason. I will recommend only if you think about it and you have no issue in buying Chinese product.And the last thing is design. It design is more premium than apple macbook. Its like you are holding macbook. It is lightweight and metal built and carries 1.35 kg. It has 91% screen to body radio which seems so nice but it can't hold webcam. I don't use webcam and I have privacy issue so it is best for me. So the one who are buying for online classes please think before buying. Even I didn't opened the webcam cable.
1,Don't buy it.. company is misleading it's customer. Earthing problem is very often if working on a table u will feel many shocks in a single day.No protective grill inside laptop which don't prevent motherboard from dust.Graphic card is mx350 which is only for games which in terms don't support content creation like youtube videos on obs and other softwares.If u want to buy go for ryzen 7 8 core processor which takes half the time in tasks like video rendering even the ryzen 5 series perform better than this.Also processor is i7u u means it is designed to save energy if u want to go for i7 go for i7H and graphic card of rtx series but don't buy mx series because it don't support video recording otherwise you will regret later.
5,"Plenty of reviews already out there, but thought I should share my opinions on the device as well, since a few questions that I had in mind could not be resolved from the existing reviews, both on Amazon and Youtube etc.Disclaimer: I'm writing this review after about 25 days of extensive usage. I bought the base variant of the Notebook 14 Horizon during the Prime Day Sale, because it was running on an extra 2k discount and the 7k price difference to the next variant did not seem justified. I got it for 49.5ish thousand after factoring in amazon icici card cashback. Also, the 5 star rating is as per my expectations from the device, since I already knew what I was buying with this package.Pros:1. The display is IPS, or at least acts and feels like one. Though Mi website mentions that the laptop has 178 degree viewing angle, I could not find the mention of the display being an IPS one in any official listing. But I can confirm, the display has no viewing angle issues at all, is perfectly bright for the rare time you might need to use it outdoor, and the anti-glare aspect of it works like a charm.2. Performs really well. I consider myself a non-graphic hungry power user. Android Virtual Device runs butter smooth, more so on Ubuntu/Linux than on Windows.. Apps/software open real quick. Boot time is commendable.3. Lightweight helps make it super comfortable. If you use your laptop for 10-12 hours a day, you'd know how you end up placing it on your lap (or even tummy? or is that just me?). I was confused between going for a regular thick bodied laptop in the 60k price range that come with much better graphic processing capabilites. But time and again, I find myself feeling glad about my choice.4. If you think you'd like to play some games occasionally, and 120 Hz 120 fps at ultra settings isn't your requirement, you'd do alright with this one. I played Far Cry 5 and GTA V on this laptop, albeit with low graphic settings, but barely any stuttering, if at all, was felt.Cons (mostly nitpicking):1. The minimum brightness of the screen is still too bright. I use Dimmer to lower it further, mostly works except for the still-a-bit-too-bright mouse pointer. (Update: dims to a real low point natively on Ubuntu)2. I miss the dedicated Home End Page Up Page Down keys that were present on my previous 14 inch laptop.3. Speaker output is wayyy too low, in that even the voice of a person is barely audible in most youtube videos. I resolved this by opening the DTS Audio Processing app that comes pre-installed with the laptop, and amping up everything in the Graphic Equalizer to the max. Worked wonders to increase the maximum sound output, without causing any noticeable distortion in the sound output. I often find myself keeping the volume at the 70% mark now. (Update: On Ubuntu, install PulseEffects, enable auto gain, set Target to -17 and both Input and Output to 4, for a much louder yet clear sound output)No BSOD errors till date.Would update this review if I stumble upon something else. If you want to install Linux/Ubuntu, the option to disable secure boot will be editable once you set an administrator password in the BIOS settings. You can remove that password by entering a blank new password once you disable the secure boot.Conclusion: For the given price point, at the time of writing (September 2020), I wholeheartedly recommend this laptop, given you know what you are buying. It performs just how you think it would, given its specifications."
1,"Not reliable, purpose not solved, crashed"
3,Gud but battery backup is not gud only 3 hours instead of 12 hours
1,"Never ever buy this product, it has stopped working. Worst product service too"
3,The laptop is over all very good.:But few  points to note:1. The sound is not that much good. It will be difficult to listen properly in a conf call/meeting. Specially for our little kids who are doing online classes.We had to use another speaker or head set.2. The touch pad is little buggy. while moving the mouse pointer it sometime drags objects under it. This might create problem when you are in hurry.3. Camera was OK. But you have to remember to attach the camera.4. The battery back up is excellent. But if you are playing game then it drains 50% of battery in 30 minutes. It may be normal in comparison with other laptop but I'm not too sure.Other than these points still did not find any problem in last 14 days.
4,After using Laptop for one week below are my viewsPros:1:Light Weight2:No heating3:Premium Look4:Display also goodCons:1:Sound Quality could have been better2:Touch pad is not Goodoverall good value for the money
5,One of the best pc in this price range. Battery is enough not bad. It is something allrounder.
1,They won't provide you Web Cam when you buy the Product..It is mentioned that you will get web cam along with the laptop..but you won't receive it.. Amazon or Xiaomi should fix this problem
5,"I had purchased this laptop on first day launch.it is showing amazing performance i have no issues with this laptop, display quality is also good and no lag issues when gaming.i have satisfied with this laptop"
4,"This laptop is feeling awesome like Apple Macbook.I purchased i5 variant. I am not a Hardcore Gamer, not a professional, no any Graphical work. This Laptop satisfy my expectations. Before I used Acer laptop i3 variant which is plastic. But it is Metal which feels great like premium. What a bezel less screen ❤️.without thinking just go for it. No issues found in this laptop. But there are some Cons:-No backlit keyboard.8gb ram .Not upgradeable.512gb SSD which is not  enough but there ar no extra slot."
5,"After searching for one week , 4 hours each day I finally orders this laptop on next day of my 24th Bday for 60k 💥, here's the reviewActually I got admission in IIT Bombay Mtech and needed a laptop which can handle satellite images processing wellPros :--Screen is best , display is amazing, 91% screen to body ratio is killer in looks..-i7 processor is what made me fan of this laptop, as many renowned companies are providing i5 10th gen or below at this price and this is above standards in this price range and futuristic too..- 512 GB nvme SSD is good as most companies offer 256 GB only in this range .- Gforce mx350 graphics card is excellent for gaming and my image graphics work too , I personally have played very less games over it but I have seen people on YouTube playing gta5 , pubg smoothly over it ..- Battery life is good , but this will be too early to comment on this but atleast charging rate is fast- light weight and slim , also plain panel of screen is classic look (some may like llogo of apple , etc but I like this classic professional look )-Cons :-- NO BACKLIT KEYBOARD ,  this is absolutely disgusting about this laptop as I personally like keyboard lighting even at not so dark environment and in night it is miserable . So u need time to adjust with this machine and set it hands with keyboard then only u will be comfortable with it as I type after seeing keys and this becomes intolerable sometimes 😁-Internet runs somewhat slower on it , when I download from ms official site then download speed is better than my phone but from other not so popular sites it shows slower speed , idk why . But YouTube 4k video runs amazingly smooth ..,- HEATING is not a problem during regular use but as soon as u switch on the game the fans start at its full speed and laptop gets instantaneously hot at hinge part of screen this heat is expected I guess but 2 fans could have better dealt it- No ms office , free wps office need downloaded-TRACKPAD is not upto the mark for this price , u will need a mouse anyway- sound is low nearly equal to phone- Ram is not upgradable , presently I don't find it a problem but according to many youtubers this is not futuristic and will hamper the full utilisation of i7 processorFinal verdict : If I was to again but a laptop then also I will buy this only as it is a performance oriented machine and I m using MI phone from 2yrs + and still it works like new so I had built a sort of trust in this company now let's see how it fulfills this trust in laptop"
1,Pathetic!It's just been 8 or 9 days and it's not working well now.Today it came to become too miserable to even get shut down and even keys stopped working!I regret I bought it. I don't recommend this to anyone!!
1,"This is after almost 10 months of usage. This is a long post but please do read it. You have to know this about their customer care before buying this deviceSound quality and battery life are horrible. The laptop cannot be used without ear phones or external speakers. My power cord stopped working before 1 year of use. My customer care experience has been THE WORST.I made an appointment on the website at a service centre. When I went to the centre, they said that the company shut down their server. I don’t understand why they booked my slot at this particular centre when they had shut down their server themselves! Talking to customer care agent was useless, as all she did was book another appointment, which I could have very much done by myself.The second service centre needed 2 days to just figure out what the problem is when it was obvious that the power cord had to be replaced. I had to go up and down almost three times just for this!Firstly, it is clear on the website and my warranty card that the charger is covered under warranty for one year. I was told it was only for 6 months. After a lot of argument, they were willing to replace it (more like they had no choice). It is taking them more than 10 days to replace a charger that is covered under warranty fair and square despite the fact that there are TWO service centres and a mi showroom here in my place.There is no kind of status tracking available on the website. The service centre executives will not call you and update you regarding the status. They will make it look it is your job to keep calling them to find out the status. And now, when I called them, they said only half the charger has arrived and the other half is yet to come. Its taking them more than 10 days to get a simple charger replacement!My laptop has been put of charge since a week and everything is stalled for me. They expect me to go to the centre and get it charged if I want to charge it. What kind of nonsense is this!I have learnt my lesson. Although the specs are good at a reasonable price, please never go for companies like this that are not trustworthy. Prefer other brands that know what they are doing. These people are even more clueless than us!"
5,"I purchased it a month ago and after doing little test and trail i am writing this review.Before buying it, i was checking many options, at one point decided to buy Macbook though its little expensive. I read both ptoducts reviews and web reviews by experts. I was scared of 15% reviews which were under 1⭐ ans 2⭐ category of Mi laptop but i have decided to buy this product along with 2 years onsitego extended warranty of around 6k which in hotsl costed me around 63k. Macbook i may have to spend double the ptice for same configuration. I some how feel its not worth.My First impression was, its pretty little as i was using Dell experia from last 6 years and i didn't feel its worth by its size. When days passing on i realized its pretty handy and i can carry anywhere without having a seperate backback like arrangement. It even fits in your wife's handbag if its size is moderate.When it comes to performance, i was totally amazed and its look and feel is just wow. I became a big fan of it. It doesn't take mins to boot, just 30 seconds, you can turn on play. I somehow loved its giant performance.I took this for the purpose of playing/ practicing data science related stuff. Installed tableau, anaconda, java IDE which are heavy and hangs in traditional i3/i4 systems but this laptop served the purpose. Never felt it was taking time. Just a mouse click away. After buying this i realized the quality and bought another MI product (mobile ) for my dad.I never played games as my purpose is to practice Data related softwares and its eco systems. So i cannot ckmment on how it works for games.Overall, its a good purchase worth each penny. If you are struggling to pick bedt laptops with this configuration and undr this price bucket. Don't think too much  just go for it."
1,Already started facing number of issues. My NVidia graphics card is not working!!!You will struggle to get service for the laptop.
5,"This is very a good laptop under 60,000 this will give maximum battery for about 9 hours which is great I don't find any cons in this laptop totally good laptop just take a external mouse and you are fully loaded you can go for this one...... happy with this product :)thank you Amazon for delivering this laptop one day before I forgot to told about charging it has the super fast charger which will charge your laptop in just 50 minutes I will give update after one month of usage ...."
5,Pros :-1) The build quality of this laptop is sturdy because of metal body. it is very light weight and sleek in design.2) it looks very premium3) the quality of webcam is much better than the in built webcam of many laptops4) it is blazing fast thanks to the NVME SSD .The boot time is about 4-5 sec. App opening time is negligible. the read speed is about 3225 MB/sec.5) its display is wow because of very thin bezels.6) this is perfect for day to day tasks. Don't compare this with gaming laptops.7) battery backup is about 7-8 hrs and charged rapidly.Cons :-1) doesn't have back-lit key which is the main drawback of this laptop.2) the quality of touch-pad is average but it is quiet responsive.3) cannot upgrade RAM and storage.Overall this laptop is great package under this price range
5,Loved the product.....very smooth and powerful laptop....its like the classic dell xps with macbook style .....loved the product but sorry for people who could not be able to buy it ......it got i7 processor which you cannot get in this range of laptops ...... and the cam is good
5,Fast and slick
5,I really liked it.. Awesome performance and very light weight.. Seems like macbook 😜😍
5,Very light weight. Beautiful. Good screen.
4,"WiFi connectivity is always an issue even after many software updates.Customer care is pathatic when it comes to solving above stated issue ....i.e., WiFi connectivity. The executives are clueless.As if company knows this issue, no response from their end to resolve the same .... Even after raise multiple queries during the first week of purchase.Overall laptop is good for machine learning stuff at moderate level.The processor ditches you while pushers for heavy algorithms.Speakers are pathatic ... better not to come with one !For below Rs. 60k .... It's a machine with good hardware and software....but if any issue comes by .... May GOD help you! Mi won't..."
5,"See I bought Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition i7-10th gen, Now it has been One month with it. II never experienced any kind of lag, maybe because I don't do heavy video editing.... This laptop is best for Office work , Students , Teachers and Personal use... You can also use this for gaming and video editing also... I'll tell You the Pros and Cons about this laptop...Pros:-Processor : I searched all the laptops available in India. Non has i7 with a range of 60k and also you can i7 7th gen for 72.5k.Storage : It has the latest SSD. I experienced very fast transfer of files in just a while.(I am talking about whole Series about 7-10 GB)RAM : 8GB DDR4 with 2666 GHz speed.(Just Wow)Weight : Very Light Weight , You won't even feel that this is with you....Body : The body is made out of Aluminium which give it a premium look, And its back is purely plane ...(Which mean you can customize as you wish or if you like it plane let it be.)Boot : You don't have to shutdown every time, you can just lock it or put it in sleep or can hibernate...(I prefer hibernating as it Always takes the work from where we left it and saves the battery very much...)And also it takes 2.1s to boot up.(I have kept BIOS password so it takes longer or it would have been much faster... I just want to say it boots up very fast...)Graphics card : I have not used the graphic card much so I can't mention anything , but I can say this for sure it would be powerful...Display : The most interesting part... It has a matte finished Display, which never reflects any reflection as a normal display do... It is very Bright, so I always keep the brightness at 1 unless when I'm sitting under sunlight... It has 91% screen to body ratio...Fan : While playing any game its fans gets boosted up and runs at the high speed.... This may not happen when you are just Normally using your laptop...Cons :-Keyboard : Its doesn't have a backlit keyboard, but I think you don't need a backlit keyboard if you have a very bright screen. if also the brightness is at 1 the whole room brightens up.If you want the focus to be at the keyboard then just tilt your screen ...Cover : I am not able to find a cover for the screen and touch pad, And also I'm not able to find a back cover or sticker of its size...Touch pad : It is a little bit small. But it is justifiable as if they give a larger touch pad then they would have to make the laptop much bigger and the bezels would have been larger...Student : If you are a student who have to keep their camera ON all the time then it would be a Difficulty to carry the camera... If you don't have to keep your camera On all the time then it is best for you... And also without inbuilt camera we get PRIVACY, In the era of Cyber attacks PRIVACY is very important, this makes sure that you don't loose your privacy...AT THE MOST LAST : this is your choice that which Laptop, who are we to tell you that which one to buy which one to not... The decision is yours... Just check whether the laptop has the features you want or not....In my opinion you should buy this laptop if you are a Student , teacher , or just for office use or personal use... I would not recommend this for Hard-core Gamer..."
5,This review is written post using laptop for a week. I m not a gaming guy.Laptop is butter smooth.Especially display is awesome. It's Antiglare.Battery is extremely good with atleast 8 hrs backupExternal web cam is awesomeBoot time is less than 5 secsBest in range.
5,really greaton this price range it is best...when i bought this i didn't no there is dts speaker option from where i increase volume so i don't like that much but there is dts by there we improve speaker and processor is too good opening time is too less and shutdown time too it's really amazing i like it...
5,Best value for money product 👌..received in 4 days in this lockdown period ....feels solid ....very quick in action ... good display ...gives premium feel when you hold it ... under 60k it's the best  laptop... backlight is missing but that can be let go as performance is quite good .
5,Amazing deal.. value for money.. extremely light weighted.. gives feeling of using Apple Mac.. designed well within the price range which is affordable..
1,I saw a worst laptop from mi products .this I don’t expect for mi . Touch pad is worst .don’t buy any one . 😌 to say i have to use this worst product because i spent money on this
5,Its superfast. Battery is atleast 7 hours. Go for it . Only drawback is no backlit keyboard but its manageable for me.
2,"I bought this laptop from HP Eshop 15 days ago. Before there models, Hp was providing Inking Pen with all X360 Pavilion Laptops. But this latest laptop is without inking pen.Now what is the fun of buying a convertible laptop without inking pen. You can buy A**** convertible laptop with almost same specification and ships with inking pen with lesser price.One more thing, If you want style only, then this laptop is for you. Also remember the style is also incomplete without inking pen.If you want performance, then look for other options, as you can buy latest i5 in same price range.If compared to other i3 laptop in the market, the response of this laptop is good.It has , 512 GB SSD, Win 10 , Office 2019 Home and student, i3 10 th generation, 8 GB RAM, HD Web Cam, Backlit chiclet keyboard , Alexa inbuild and more.You will feel great when the laptop reaches you, but you happiness will be for a moment when you open the box and get to know that the inking pen is missing.Finally i will say that this laptop is not worth to buy at this cost untill HP provides Inking Pen with it.Please go for some other higher end laptop at this price."
3,"Be alert, inking Pen Stylus is mentioned in specifications but not supplied with product. When you ask about it they say it is not included in components mentioned in technical details. So while purchasing be alert with such mischief.We purchase these products as Amazon is taking responsibility of product & there specifications as mentioned in the advertisement. And when suppliers delete some of it's accessories mentioning not included in components then this will be very dangerous in near future, they may specify some thing in advertisement and may include different in the list. So whether the customer should see the specifications, or should be worried whether it is included or not in the list. We have to take legal action against such events and even Amazon must take notice of it that what ever suppliers mentioning specifications in the advertisement they must supply it to consumer as per specifications."

4,Every Thing In This Laptop is Great but IF STORAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN 1TB SSD THEN IT COULD HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT .. REST ALL THE THING IS OK
3,Laptop is excellent.... Only issue with the fake product details posted here..... No inking pen in the box.... However product detail picture shows the same.
3,The features and everything else is just fine delevery was really fast... but the only thing which is disappointing is it does not have a inking pen or stylus which is writen in the specificstions.... really disappointing...!!!
4,This laptop look beautiful and it is good to have this this model but you must mind the cost of this laptop as it cost around 50k . It should have been caused around 40 to 45 k. The touch screen was good but the toggle between tablet mode in laptop mode is Quad Tower troublesome. Not very strongly recommended to buy at this price.
5,Best in class product in this price. All the features loaded. Beautiful design and Superb Build Quality. Love it. Touch screen works phenomenal. It gives the premium fell with no cheap plastic things around. Battery life is also good with loads of standout features.
4,It’s for a tender use only not for heavy office work. Product is ok with average battery life of 6-7 hrs. Touch screen is smooth like phones(don’t compare with premium phones).  Has WiFi 6. A few misinformation from the description over the amazon site. Like inking pen. In question and answers it was cleared out that no pen with it. Don’t know why hp giving charger with they should remove it from box as well. LOL.It’s not too slim. 19.7 mm. Do u call it slim in 2020. I had dell 15z ultrabook in 2013 which is same sleek 20 mm.1. Biggest misinformation abt Ethernet port. No Ethernet port on it.2. Built in Alexa. No Alexa on this PC. Want to confirm from other buyers if they got Alexa with it. By the way I tried to download Alexa from windows App Store but it’s not available for Indian market. While sign if you choose us/uk etc you can download it. But it would not be a handsfree Alexa. You have to tap to give commands or ask questions.3. Amazon had biggest problem with pricing. Different sellers different price of same product. I bought it for 52500 after all discount during sale. No cost emi was not available with the seller.When this was delivered. I found an other seller  Appario Retail Pri… had this for 52250 + disc of sale+ no cost emi on my HDFC card.Due to minformation and variation of pricing in just two days. Iym considering to return it.
5,"I bought this laptop in October 20 at 52K. I have general impression is that HP is much costlier than other Brand. But after going through the features, price of the Laptop is right.What I liked about the product is: Compact, edge to edge display, Sufficiently Bright at home(not checked outdoor), Awesome keyboard, quick to start in 5 seconds, finger print unlock.However sound volume is lower than expected, considering B&O speakers.I have seen lot of  the reviews on Amazon complaining about not providing Pen with this Laptop, however it is clearly specified that Pen is not part of the package. Checked the same Laptop Price @ Croma which is priced at 55K & that too excluding Pen.cost of 2 year extended warranty is 9000. Similar touch screen laptop from Lenovo which I have purchased at 4000 Rs. so do factor in this aspect while buying."
3,In the product description it is written as the laptop is coming with in-built Alexa app in it. But I couldn't find the app in my laptop and I contacted 'hp' customer service for the same. They told me that the Alexa app is from Amazon and contact Amazon for the same. I contacted Amazon also but they informed it is 'hp' to provide the same in their product as per description. I tried to download the app from store also but it is not available. 'hp' is fooling the customers by claiming fake product specifications in their description. We will not get Alexa app in this laptop.
5,Ordered from Apprio retailer on 5/1/21 got delivery on 7/1/21. Got September 2020 manufactured laptop.Pros:1) Built quality is excellent. The lid is made up of aluminium. The surface keyboard is made of magnesium alloy and the bottom is built of aluminium. So no plastics at all whatsoever. There no flex in the body anywhere. So 10/10 for built quality. Lenovo flex5i is made of polycarbonate plastic for comparison.2) Screen quality is excellent. At 250 nits it’s the best ips display in market. Excellent brightness and HP dark night mode helps reduce blue light at night. Lenovo flex5i is total fail in display department. Touch is amazing without any lags and enjoying 14’ display for reading and even typing. The on screen keyboard is swipe enabled so just glide your fingers on keyboard and predefined words will be formed. Too good to resist. 10/10 for display and touch quality in tablet mode.3) Excellent battery life. I was able to easily get more than 8 to 9 hours of battery life in both normal and tablet mode. It has replaced my cell phone indeed.4) intel i3 is more than enough for normal day to day work and media consumption. Ssd works like butter5) zero fan noice. So much so that I had to literally bring my ears near the fan vent to hear the fan noice still could not hear any.6) No heating problems. The laptop not even heated once since I have been using it. It has remained absolutely cool in all tasks.7) Only con is that the warranty is from date of manufacturing and not from date of purchase. Though I bought on 5/1/21 I am getting warranty from October 2020. Please be aware of this fact. But I really don’t think it is a deal breaker given and excellent quality and design of the product.8) It’s a full value for money product just go for it and enjoy.
5,The product is good..! Official usage it’s wonderful..! Problem here is Amazon. The delivery agent and supervisor were so rude with me and their behavior costed me my job..! The supervisor was literally shouting at me even after he got written instructions to deliver the product. It costed me my job.! Customer service of amazon gave me fake promises for 4 days! BE CAREFUL WHILE YOU BUY!!
4,"everything is perfect to begin with.. So many reviews are unnecessarily negative on Amazon. I was so afraid after reading them but it did have all features as described in product page. Ms office 2019 home and student lifetime, finger print scanner ,etc are all there..touchscreen, backlit keyboard are awesome.. Only disappointment is they are not supplying active pen (which they have mentioned clearly in the product page that it has to be bought seperately ) but it would have been five star with an active pen at the same price !"
3,It's a huge disappointment that the laptop doesn't come with inking pen even thought the specification picture mentions otherwise
4,"I am using this laptop for a month or so and absolutely love it in every way. I touch screen, battery life, camera works  great! Only issue I have with is that :1) The stylus should have been included with it. I don't see any reason to sell the laptop without it.2) The power button instead of it being in the middle of the left side panel, it could have been on the panel top. Every time you wan to move the laptop, one accidentally ends up switching off the laptop."
2,"Product Packing by Amazon is very bad, it is open from one corner side. Laptop can be easily dropout from that side after 2-4 jerks. अमेज़न बॉक्स की पैकिंग में बहुत लापरवाही बरती गई थी। एक कार्नर या छोटी side से बॉक्स खुला(open) था। जिससे कि कोई भी बिना tape काटे laptop box को बाहर निकाल सकता था। मैंने भी बिना tape को काटे ही laptop उसी side से laptop को बाहर निकाला। HP की पैकिंग अच्छी थी, पर amazon की बहुत ही बेकार पैकिंग थी।1-2 झटके में लैपटॉप बाहर भी गिर सकता था। आजतक इतनी खराब पैकिंग नहीं देखी। Product MRP 70,000 PLUS होने पर भी इतनी लापरवाही।"
5,"Purchased this HP pavilion laptop from Amazon. First time I used SSD. Unbelievable speed. Almost nil booting time. Battery backup I got almost 5-6 hrs continuous operation. One thing I guessed, battery is consumed during off condition also. Because after full charge, I shut down the laptop. After 4 days when I opened, it was 80 %. I used Tab mode only once. It is advisable not to go for tab mode frequently because hinge problem may happen. In fact, u will feel nice in laptop mode. Life time MS office is activated. McAfee Antivirus live safe was for 1 month. I renewed it for Rs. 399 valid for 1 year. Blindly go for this dude."
1,Overall product is good..but there is no inking pen given with it..Battery 🔋 life is maximum 3hrs...which is not worth of money.
5,Laptop has shut down after using only 1 hour.Screen totally blue after switched on .But Amazon replaced with new working laptop one .Replaced laptop is fantastic in look and have  high  performance processor.Totally aluminium body .Backlit keyboard.Touchscreen display.Can use as a Tab .Microsoft Office included.One disappointing part in this package is without inking pen.
3,"Built in Alexa. No Alexa on this PC, inking pen"
1,"Its actual screen size is 12 inch approx 324 mm but 14 inch 355 mm mentioned in specifications , why false information about this product"
1,"I will strongly recommend to buy this from store as you will get extra bag for free and if any problem persists atleast u can get immediate help.Secondly,it has software issues.it hangs almost every 10 min.battery life is worst.It only works for 2 3 hours with full charging.Third one is  sound quality,not good enough to watch movies or listen to songs.Fourth is in picture it shows stylus pen but kindly don't forget to see Astrid mark which says,it supports it and the same is not included with the purchase.Overall I am not satisfied with its performance"
5,"The laptop is very nice, compact, has an amazing touch screen and good configuration.My daughter has been using this laptop for the last 2 months and she is very happy with all the features.It has a pretty decent battery life, good screen, above average speakers and decent front camera.The touchscreen is an added luxury but it is pretty amazing and a very nice feature for a new laptop.This laptop has the superb flexibility of using it in various modes - my favourite is the Tent mode.The tablet mode is also good for drawing, reading etc.I feel this laptop is economical, good for students and value for money product.Also, you get all preinstalled softwares like Office, Antivirus etc.Overall I would definitely refer this product to buy, if you have the budget."
4,"Good product. I bought this for home purpose and so far it has performed well after one month of use. Using it for school zoom meeting, Netflix and some excel work.Pros -1. Battery back up is 6+ hrs.2. Does not heat up even after 5+ hrs of continuous movie watching3. Touch screen is good. Adds advantage when explaining presentations over conf call, we can easily draw with fingers n explain.4. Fast boot up <5 seconds.5. Recent and best configuration i3 10th gen, 8gb, wifi6 n bluetooth 5.6. Decent display7. Backlit keyboardCons1. Doesn't have LAN port2. The tablet mode user interface is still not very stable, hangs like windows 98.3. Front camera quality is ok but could have been better at this price point.4. No bag( mentioned in description)5. Should be priced around 45K"
5,"Its that perfect laptop for the Study and Home purpose.Delivered precisely by Amazon agents, it has all the features listed, though I had my doubts on the keyboard color and backlit feature. Both doubts settled once I received the item.Go for it if you just intend to have a real portable one for those Zoom meets and Home office purpose."
4,It's same as written in the description.If you want you can buy.Why you should not buy-Storage is not 1tbSize is too small.. Quite less than 14inchNot i5 it's i3Why should u butNice working screen touchFast.. Booting speedNice lookingStrong easily portableLed keyboard
2,"Purchased this a couple of months back to use it for my everyday work. While the laptop is good in terms of speed, display and battery life the audio quality is very poor. And if you are someone who has to take multiple calls a day using the laptop or if you are looking for a laptop to binge watch shows without headphones avoid this one. Even with headphones the audio isn’t that great. It works properly only sometimes and only with specific headphones. The lack of audio quality defeats the purpose of the foldable screen. The sound is dismal as soon as you fold the laptop since the speakers are placed in such a way.TL;DR - Don’t buy this laptop for work if you are someone who has to take multiple calls for virtual meetings"
5,"Great product, I have been taking my CA classes on this (as visible in the picture attached). Good screen touch, keyboard lights make it a delight. Camera is also good. RAM and i3 software is great for normal tasks that does not involve huge amount of data.Good work HP and Amazon :)Thanks!"
5,"Initially a defective product was delivered to me, but Amazon team took the initiative to replace the same within 48hours. This shows the proactiveness of the seller and of course Amazon.The performance of this laptop is very good.Any one looking for this laptop can go ahead and can purchase it through Amazon’s portal."
3,"Value for the money with respect to latest features like touch, finger print ,keypad back light.Remaining all features are much better in that price range."
3,"A good product with enough audio quality. However, Video camera quality is very poor.Also Please note - I received the laptop without alexa inbuilt and there's no way to install alexa in it now."
4,"A high-priced laptop and battery work until your warranty period expires, isn't it pathetic and at the same time shameful on part of HP for providing low quality for high cost... May be main motive is to just earn earn earn"
5,Screen quality as u can see is very good.camera quality is also good. Sound quality is quite good.touch screen works perfectly.one thing I Need to mention is the fan volume was high at first.but u can fix it's settings. It doesn't get too much heat. Perfect for students and daily office use
5,There are No inking pan
4,Good product.. first time confirguration need technical knowledge. Battery life is very good.Brought for my daughter and so far it serves the purpose.
5,"i3 10th gen is adequate, not amazing.Setup was easy - both Windows and OfficeDisplay is vibrant, sound is rich, build quality is lovely - sturdy and light.Keyboard is enjoyable to type on.Would have appreciated a stylus but it's alright."
4,"Good value for money product.positives - touch is excellent,the 360 degree transition between laptop to Tab is seamless.Video quality and sound is good.Negative - slightly heavy and thick"
4,Bought this laptop in Oct-20. Nice keypad and bright back light. Battery power quite good so far. Touchscreen is smooth. Think Rs. 52000 was a bit more expensive than compared to normal times.
3,Laptop seems fine but no HP Stylus as shown in thr description.
4,"The product was promptly delivered by Amazon. I was impressed by the features 16GB-i7-10th Gen-512GB SSD and 4GB NVIDIA card. It may be great for the gamers, but to be frank I did not buy it for gaming nor I tried it, hence can not make any review on that part. But it must be reasonably great for that. The system comes with Win10.Cons noticed : 1.No Preinstalled Office, one has to separately buy it spending another 5K to 7K. Anti Virus also for 1 month Only.2. But the worst thing I experienced was that the system do not allow LINUX dual booting. I tried with latest Ubuntu and Debian distros. But totally disappointed. This system has UEFI and no BIOS Legacy support. Because of this, even though I followed all the installation instruction carefully with the expert help mentioned for UEFI , could not be successful. Installation may go alright, but system wont reboot in LINUX. Even WSL 2 did not become successful, finally I landed up with boot failure/OS failure. Now the system is given for service, just within 7 days of arrival. So every one - Professionals and Students be aware that THIS SYSTEM IS ONLY FOR WINDOWS USERS. NEVER TRY YOUR LUCK GOING FOR ANYTHING EXTRA.3. Battery life also not that great, even without gaming, approximately 3 hrs only."
1,Please Don’t buy this laptop from Amazon it’s better buy it from HP official website they are claiming to send bag with laptop in question & answer column but I didn’t get the same along with my laptop which HP official website are providing overall laptop is good.
5,"Gaming is good no lags, camera is wide angle but not great, the battery backup is okayish do not expect much.I tried building up an Android Studio project from Scratch, took me less than a 5 mins in setting up entire project and building it on an emulator in parallel with vs code web app, multiple chrome tabs and CS:GO.A little heavy on weight and the screen is 60HZ, display is good and keyboard is purple, I recommend you to use an external keyboard."
1,Battery dry in 3 hours only ..worst battery laptop ever ..dont buy this..
1,Keyboard light was not working. Returned item.
5,So far good. Ubuntu as well works
4,"This is my fifth HP laptop. I bought it because I've always been satisfied with HP quality. The second one I had bought back in 2011 still works completely fine. To be honest, I am not a gamer but I love buying high spec products so that no matter what my usage is, I never fall short of performance.When I recieved this laptop, I found it to be extremely powerful, after all, it was my first laptop with 16 GB RAM. It's a delight to use it. My problem arose when, after taking a windows update a couple of weeks after purchase, I experienced blue screen of death. I thought it is probably due to some update issue with Windows but it was impossible to format the laptop and I had to contact HP Service.My experience with HP Service had been pleasant until now, having used HP products since 2004. However this time, due to Covid, they couldn't send a technician to have a look at the laptop. It's true that HP technical team did try to help me a lot over the call but they were unable to figure out actual issue.I found a local HP Service center and personally went to get the laptop repaired. It was found that there was a hardware issue and motherboard needed to be replaced. Hard luck I suppose, but it took almost a month for the new motherboard to be sent to HP Service center from HP. Anyways, I recieved the laptop back from service yesterday and it seems to work fine. While repairing, it got slightly damaged (see second image) and while it doesn't affect any operations of the device, it just pains a bit.I am still a fan of HP and this specific laptop works just fine now but I did go through emotional roller coaster and thought to share my experience in case it helps someone."
5,"A beast at a much better value, it's a damn good finished gaming machine and I love it's thermal coolers😳🎉."
1,Purchased from local hp store.. received faulty product. Battery failed within 5 days. service center only provides assurance for within 48 hr service but have not received any. it's 15 days now and I am still waiting.Don't buy if you want quality product with quality service.
4,Performance is satisfied.
5,"I was planning to buy different ryzen5 laptops for work from home, light gaming, but most of the laptop was out of stock then i choose this. boot speed is very fast it can boot up in 5 to 10 sec.you can easily play 4k videoI played pubg mobile by emulator it was running fine in medium settingonce while doing research i also opened 40 tabs in 4 chrome windows and many other windows without lagyes it has MS office home and student lifetime version includedcamera quality is okit also have fast chargingbattery life is more than 6 hour in battery saving modeno noise you will hear while doingSoftwares that I used successfully on this device1 pycharm2 apache server2 adobe illustrator4 Autocad5 auto desk eagle PCB designer6 innovusif you hide the hp logo it will look like macbookoverall nice in look and beast in performancedon't buy this laptop for hardcore gaming and for professional video editing bcz the fan vents are very small so it can heat up easily .  so you will face some lag because of decrease in the output of PLL"
5,Fabulous laptop ......🤩🤩I purchased it from hp store and got this in only ₹40kBest laptop in this rangeCompletely satisfied with this laptop !!!!!!
1,Within two weeks started getting spots on screen while browsing the web. Happened intermittently several times in the day and the audio too stopped working.
5,"So I am a Macbook Air user, bought this one for family. So benchmarking against Macbook Air which is double the price of this one.Pros -1) Screen - Amazing2) Build Quality - You will feel confident3) Touchpad & Keyboard - No complaints4) Weight - Perfect5) Storage - 256 gb SSD (Windows 10 is installed on SSD) + 1 Tb storage. Lol. That's insanely amazing a thing.6) Ram - 8gb - Usable approx 6 gb - Smooth experience7) Battery - Okayish8) MS Office comes free!!Cons-1) Camera - Don't know what was the Product Manager smoking when he designed this one. 2/52) Backlit Keyboard - Should have been there.3) Fingerprint sensor - Could have been there.Overall - If camera is not The Most Important thing you want to have in your laptop, blindly opt for it. You can treat me virtually! ;)"
5,Let me tell you the pros of this laptop:1. Thin and light2. FHD display3. Ryzen 5 processor (note: cannot be overclocked) which is much better than itel i54.Amazing speakers5. Good quality webcam6. Expandable memory7. Expandable storage8. Includes office 3659. Display size is perfect.10. Screen hinges are strong11. Small bezels12. Booting and power delay time is extremely short.Cons:1. Not so good battery life2. The screen hinges cannot bend upto 180 far less than 180 but perfect for sitting position.3. The touchpad buttons are hard and not so appealing while using4. Does not support 5g wifi connection5. No built in fans (but it doesn't run that hot too).
4,"Premium lookOkayish battery lifeFast chargingGood screen qualityNice keyboard10 seconds start upComes with lifetime windows 10 and office 365Good for light gamingHave player Asphalt 9 and ValorantNo lagGreat speakerCamera is okayish1.5 kg weightComes with lot of HP unnecessary softwaresAs you all know , 1 + 256 gb , 8 gb , Amd ryzen 5 quad coreRyzen products are rarely available at market.. high demand. Because of vega 8 graphics.One big con - vega 8 graphics takes 2 gb out from RAM.So the solution is buying a 8 Gb RAM stick of 2400 megahertz. It cost around 3k. Laptop have one extra RAM slot so there will be no problem. I have this plan in mind.Little bit of heating issues also while gaming. Place in on a flat surface for ventilation. I have a plan to buy a laptop stand with cooling fans for that purpose.I bought it at Rs 45 573 from Amazon. Got in 3 days.Nice packaging also"
1,"Please don't buy this pc. Though it has all features battery life is too poor. It lasts only for two and half to three and half hours that's it.Even if you turn on battery saver mode ,same is observed.....You will definitely feel regret after sometime of your purchase. Please don't waste your money plz🙏.I didn't expected this battery performance from hp pc."
3,I purchased this laptop after lot of comparison and when I received I was disappointed to know the product is made in China. It would be helpful for buyers to decide if the manufacturer information provided.It looked like I paid 4000/- more than the actual price.
5,"Writing this review after one month of usage.Perfectly suits for tasks other than gaming.Pros.,Compact, Light weight, Full HD display, AMD Ryzen 5 processor, 8GB ram with 2GB radeon vega 8 graphics all combinely gives the best experience ever.cons.,non antiglare display, non backlit keyboard, no optical disc drive(not a big deal though)"
3,"I must start by saying that the product is good every way, except one.Good:- Product built, looks and the keyboard feel while typing.- sensibility in providing memory; 256 for applications and 1 TB for data- Fast processing, fast boot, fast close- Battery life is reasonable- Bright imagesBAD- This one is a very bad feature that the wi-fi card supports only 2.4 Ghz, and it does not support 5Ghz. This means that you will not get 100mbps speed on your wireless connection. This is a damning installation; akin to putting a ferrari on a very narrow potholed road. As this is a product/ manufacturer feature, Amazon will not accept return. At the time of buying, for a layman like myself, it would be difficult to understand and check if a latest product will come bundled with a card that is not in line with the current technology advancements in data speed, after having spend 53K to buy this product.The 3 star rating is for this reason.This has been a huge disappointment for me."
1,"I had very high expectations on this PC and they turned out to be worst. Packaging is neat and there is no damage on the box.Immediately after receiving the package, I opened with lot of hope and once I configured my account - noticed the issues with the screen and its not at all acceptable for the price we pay as customers to what we get.After discussion with Amazon support team, they scheduled a technician visit after 4 days for inspection even after sending pictures of screen damage within 1hr of product delivery !! I'm really disappointed with amazon support on how they treat the customers.Eagerly Waiting for technician visit and replacement.."
1,Its showing that Battery is not from HP while you are starting the PC.May be so duplicate stuffs added!!!
4,Good for personal use
3,"First impressions: I have used Sony Vaio for 11 long years not with single complaint with very rough usage. Infact my Sony Vaio fell down once from 5 feet height, nothing happened. Tno w I bought this laptop because my kids damaged my Vaio, otherwise it would have lasted more and more. Sony is durability, the say I cannot say about this laptop, however it may be unfair to compare. Performance wise so far everything seems good. The keyboard and touch pad is very delicate I feel, I am afraid to type little harder. Buying extra keyboard may solve my problem. I don't understand why Sony closed laptop business, their laptops are durable, sturdy, the same cannot be true for other brands.. will miss my Vaio always, will try to adjust with HP."
5,"All good so far. Good screen quality, fast boot up due to the OS on SSD. Comes with MS Office that you will need to activate. The only thing I dont like is the ‘made in China’ tag. I went for HP thinking it would be made in India."
4,"1. Received the laptop in good condition.2. Its is beautiful.3. Processor speed is decent. Takes around 10 seconds to boot.4. Decent battery backup for around 4-5 hours.5. Light and slim. Makes easy to handle.6. Wonderful and crisp display.7. Good camera.8. Moon light white keyboad backlight would have enhanced the look even more.9. I bought it for 49000. Bit expensive.Used it only for a week. I will update on the review after a few months use.Thank you.Update: I am facing problem in presenting whiteboard during my online classes.  The moment I begin writing, it freezes. I have to restart the pc then."
5,"Brilliant laptop under 45k.Pros:1.256gb SSD+ 1tb hdd2. rysen 5 3500U 3rd generation processor which is equal to i5 10 gen on the benchmark.3. Its is good for programmers as I am a CS student i also runs the Autocad 2020,20201 it runs smoothly.4. Battery backup is 5-6hrs when i used it for browsing,programming, online classes,and making projects. It get increased to 7-8 hrs when I watch movies.5.Boot sec is 4-5 secs.6.Screen quality is brilliant  i also watching1080p movies with best quality.7.Ms office 2019 version with lifetime is best part in it.8.Sound quality is loud which is best when we watch movies.Cons:1. No backlit keyboard but i don't think it is a bigger problem.Don't worry just go for it ."
5,"I have seen many reviews on this product, and some of them are written clearly and to the points. I got this product at around 42.2k after waiting to reduce the price for about few months. I will give my review point wise:1. The size is very compact and good for travelling.2. Great screen quality but less than 14'', however it's described as 14''  (actually its about 13.8'').3. Many people are commenting on the camera quality but we shouldn't expect more because it is to  reduce the MB size of any video calls for fast communications.4. The windows was installed if SSD, which makes the booting and shutting down very fast. booting time is about 5-8 Secs and shut down is about 5Sec. Restart will also take about 5-6Sec.5. The keyboard is also good, not very soft but its will be ok for everyone.6. In one review there was a comment that it has no cooling fan, but this is wrong. It has a cooling fan at  the left front were we can see opening windows and you can feeling the exhausted hot air with your  hand. I have run youtube while installing Mathematica and Latex but not much heating effect.7. The 8 GB ram is usable only about 6 GB and this is because of the Vega 8 graphic uses about 2GB. This  you can confirmed by looking through the taskbar. So, 6GB is still good but for betterness one can also  install extra 4GB or 8GB.9. People also commenting about the less loudness of the speaker, but as per me it is loud enough to  listen to a big hall.8. The battery life is very good. Dont see any other comments. With browsing, installing softwares and  listening music for about half an hour reduces the battery percent by about 2% only. So, for regular  uses it can hold at least 5 hrs and more. So its good enough for a laptop.9. The touch pad is very sensitive and has multi sensers.10. Finally, the look is good. But, I think the cabinet is not metallic."
5,"This is the rookie writing who knows nothing literally about the laptop.everything is good except that it has only two USB ports(product description in the seller page says otherwise). go for it. best laptop ever. highly portable(i used 15.6 inch laptops before-HP pavilion notebook n15). for education, entertainment 14 inch laptops are not inferior to 15 inch laptops. no dvd drives, but who needs dvd drive these days. also no seperate numerical keypad(only one enter key).i feel so much comfortable with this keyboard type.MAKE SURE TO BUY ACCESSORIES WHILE BUYING LAPTOP ITSELF like-keyboard protector,touchpad protector,screen guard etc. accessories are worth it in the long run (my 7 year old laptop has so many smudge,impressions tht nvr go even after intensive cleaning and touchpad weared down). so to enhance the durability of new laptops go for protective covers.Dont buy extra keyboard. HP laptops has excellent place for sturdy and long life keyboard,even then its easy to replace the buttons rather than carrying an extra keyboard.ALL THE BEST..."
4,Not the best one for gaming but screen quality and keypad are good. Preinstalled Ms office home and student is very useful. Decent battery life. Lightweight and goodlooking too.
4,"It's been 1 week since i have been using this laptop and i feel the laptop serves me perfect . I will be writing few major points which may help you while buying it.1)DISPLAY- The display is really good for this price segment . Its an ips hd(1920*1080) antiglare display  which definitely feed good for your eyes ,also colours are adequate . I played a 4k video on youtube and it played flawlessly,so i guess it supports 4k.2)Design- It's a very thin and sleek laptop . Also the grey colours adds to its charm  . Though all the ports are placed on the right side very close to each other .3) Speakers- It has speakers on its front and i must say it is quiet loud4) Performance - The AMD ryzen5 processor works great plus the 256 gb ssd adds to its processing speed. The laptop turn on and off very quickly and also the app opening time is very less (thanks to ssd) . I have not tried any hard core game on it but i have played need for speed and asphalt and it worked flawlessly . I feel it can handle most of the famous games like gta and pubg in low go medium setting with good frame rates . Amd ryzen 5 is quite a capable processor5) Ram and Storage - The ryzen processor occupies 2 gb of your ram to use it as a graphic card function leaving you with 6 gb ram . So if you are a hardcore user i would recommend you to upgrade it to 12 gb . It has 256gb ssd +1 tb hdd which is more than enough6)Battery- I tested the battery with the wifi  on all the time . I did online classes on a stretch and it lasted a little more than 4 hours . Though i found it less but whats good is that it has a 65 watt charger which charges the laptop really quickly.7) Camera - The camera is not the best but still will serve the purpose if you use it in a well lighted space8) Connectivity - It has bluetooth , 2 usb port , a hdmi port , a lan port , a sd card reader , and usb type c port . What was dissappointing was the wifi . It only support 2.5 ghz wifi band not the 5ghz wifi band9) Other stuffs- The touchpad is good although not the best in sensitivity . The keybad is really good with all necessary keys available . The laptop doesnot overheat , It comes with lifetime ms office student edition and 1 month mcaffe antivirus trial"
5,"The configuration is one of the best in this price. I got it for 43500 during the sale, clubbed with bank offers. The laptop is sturdy and has a bright and vivid display, the keyboard is comfortable to use. SSD makes it blazingly fast. However the battery could have been better.Initially I got a piece with slight cut mark/ kind of dent in the frame, got it replaced. The one I currently have is perfect. Both the boxes were sealed and brand new."
4,"Amazing product worth buying. It has all the specification one would ideally ask for for basic home use. I had got this for home use and studies for children.Camera quality is not upto the mark and only major problem is is the 5 GHz Wi-Fi not been supported on this model. Luckily I was able to initiate a return and refund from Amazon on the 6th day after delivery, just because this relevant specification of 5 GHz Wi-Fi support was not mentioned on the product page.Customer service support from Amazon was outstanding."
5,"Best product I am 100% satisfiedFantastic screen. 10/10Very fast and quick working.10/10Start and log out in 5 sec only.10/10Looks like Apple product so look wise also 10/10Sound quality is superb 10/10Connectivity also good as compared to I5 10/9Space and storage 10/10 as OS is in SDD and other stuff we can save in 1TB HDDVery lightweight 10/10Camera quality is average 10/7 but better than other product.Battery backup : Okay okay not bad not good 10/8But overall really nice product highly recommended if u r looking for Coding,  Multitasking,  Video editing, gaming too but use external gadgets as keyboard is not that much good. if have a budget in between 40-45 go for it"
5,"For mid range game it is fine and as I am not much game lover, for me it is ok. The screen quality and keyboard touch feeling is simplya awesome..Biooting time is first for because of SSD .The outer look is gorgeous and battery backup is praise worthy."
4,"Very much satisfied with the product. The SSD makes the laptop very fast, although it would have been better with 512GB SSD than 128GB SSD + 1TB HDD. You can't really play modern games because of integrated graphics.Battery life is not really great.Note that the RAM is not 8GB as integrated graphics reserve some memory, making it around 6GB to be usable.Unfriendly if you want to dual boot with Linux. Intel works fine. (If you use Linux)Overall it's a pretty decent laptop!"
3,well i have purchased the product recently and i have been using it since a week.  price is RS 46500/- on the amazon prime day (including the bank offer). same is the price in hp site.( you have to wait for the stock to replenish).  well the downside is there is no finger print sensor for quick login and no backlit keypad. it is little bit slow (might be due to the antivirus software). but over all satisfactory.
1,Waste laptopDon't have keyboard lightsLow battery backupHigh price in Amazon has compare with flipkart nearly 8k to 6kI request don't buy
5,"It's been long time after my 15 years old Lenovo laptop usage. Now when I looked at my HP surprise to see the built in quality. Amazing speed especially boot in and out. Qualitative screen resolution, quick charging post one week of usage. Need to use with caution the keyboard. Worth buying for 47K. Lifetime free for Microsoft office. Excellent features worth. No back thought"
4,"I am writing this review after using it for almost 3 months.First of all the delivery time was only one day😀All the features are good.Battery life : 4-5 hrs maximum battery lifeDisplay is also good.>>The most important thing to note is RAM is 5.92 usable rest is reserved for graphics>> I installed so many apps still the system works fluent, no hang ons>> best part - 2 seconds shutdown and 1min restart time>>The only bad feature or I will say irritating feature, specially when you are working professional is frequent chrome /edge blackouts, you need to restart your system multiple times> I have not tried for gaming yetAt this price, this product is worth and must to buy"
4,"The specs are good for the price but some cons are1) Laptop chassis is not sturdy and strong.2) Camera quality is not that great3) Battery life is around 4 hours for normal browsing and video calls..4)The hinge bends only 130 degree which is not mentioned in the spec.5) The keyboard is delicate and can get damaged within 6 months of use..6) The price keeps varying between 40k to 49k and i booked this @45k..There is only replacement option available on amazon..Other than above points, laptop is good and needs to be used carefully for longevity.."
1,"Hangs quite often (both Windows and Ubuntu)Terrible WiFi interface. Poor signal strength, Unstable connectionsOverall it's just useless !!Never ever buy this crappy laptop from HP !!"
4,Battery life is amazing! Can't decide if the best thing about the laptop is the SSD or the free microsoft office subscription.... It's an amazing laptop... But not for heavy games... Will update it later.... I've used it just for a month.
5,Go for it if you want mid-budget non-gaming and office work purpose portable and stylish (macbook like) laptop. Camera is sufficiently okay for video conferencing. Battery backup is almost 4 hours. Total charging taking around 2 hours. Copying files from ssd C drive of laptop to external ssd drive is superfast. Only issue may be the keyboard. Keys are delicate. Handle with care or use an external keyboard for long run. Video quality is excellent. Also ryzen 5 cpu is better for multitasking than intel one.
5,Good quality laptop for all usage.  I'm not a gamer so do not know whether it fits a gamers requirement.  It is very good product.  It does not have touch screen.  In the US you can get the latest product with touch screen and back lit at less than this price.  Better to buy it with HP after sales support for atleadt 2 years.
4,I love it. The over all design is slim and elegant. Light weight and portable but the build is at all not flimsy. The performance is good enough for normal daily life applications like work and browsing. The start up time is excellent due to the SSD which houses the OS and other applications. I use the second hard drive just for storage. The screen is excellent.Would have preferred the battery life to be a tad bit better. I wouldn't have mind having a VGA port as well but the HDMI port will suffice although I need to carry a converter around.
4,"I have been using this laptop for a month now. I got this for 45k and looks to be a decent enough device in this range and segment. It's a compact laptop that would fulfil all your daily needs which might include working from home, or playing games, or watching videos. The screen is wonderful, you can watch it from all the angles and works well. The sound is pretty crisp and loud. It's not a Dolby one but does sound like one. The keyboard is more like any other HP laptop, easy to use. The TouchPad is also easy to use. Webcam is a bit okay but guess that works.Only a couple of limitations I would say after using it for a while. The screen flap only opens to a certain  extent, and sometimes that's annoying from working perspective. Also the ethernet doesn't support 5 GHz wifi, so that becomes a problem sometimes when your wifi isn't performing well.Otherwise a decent enough buy in this range. Will post more findings as I keep using it."
4,"Good, Ryzen 5, 3500 cpu,Hp brand brilliant alwaysGood performance1TB HDD +256 SSD,Boot Time 4 sec only"
1,Worst quality .... faulty machine delivered and now waiting for their agent will come and verify then they will decide my fate
4,"Excellent performance and light weight laptop,Ram usable 6 GB out of 8gb ,As it's AMD processor and sdd & HDD haedrive is good part in this price.Camera quality is worst part and battery life is average. Bit of heating issue if you use more brightness.Overall, it's value for money, good for office use and lite entertainment.I haven't used for gaming so far ..."
1,I rec'd Lenovo E15 on 03 Jun 2021. Warrenty shows its valid for 9 months instead of 12. I am very unhappy with the reseller and Amazon.
1,Hi - The system is getting turned off automatically. Please resolve.
1,"Pathetic, pls don't go for it, no return pilicy available wd this product.No free MS office, only a 1 month trial version loaded which is slow too"
1,"Worst product from dell and worst customer support of Amazon... Have lost trust on this company... Within 2 days of delivery.. The system is not working properly.. Its taking more than 20 mins to open Google chrome from start... And I am being told by Amazon team that its driver issue and I need to update drivers... How will one reach dell website when the Web browser is taking 20-25mins to open... And now amazon tells me that neither I can replace or return until and unless their technician looks into it, tries to resolve it and post that they will look into the matter to see what can be done...."
1,New laptop since one week freezes during basic stuff.  Reinstalled OS three times. Tried all steps given by Dell. Extremely slow and sluggish.Dell giving all useless solutions.
1,Worst product from dell which is very slow and ms office is an trial  version  bad product and bad service and after sale service from Amazon Amazon cheats customers like this type of product
4,HiProduct received on time but one thing was the MS Office was given only for 1 month on trial basis after that need to purchase. it's not mentioned anywhere in laptop details.
5,"Excellent laptop. Sturdy, with lifetime Windows and MS Office, is value for money. I got it with exchange of my Lenovo's I-3 (purchased in 2012) 15.5"" laptop. That was also working but with Windows 7 so I changed it. I am fully satisfied with Dell Inspiron 3493, mainly it has preloaded Windows 10 as well as MS office."
1,"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT...In the era of 2020, it works with pace of computers of 1990s. Really upset with the performance of the Laptop. Though some pluses are there... Comes with inbuilt Windows 10 & Office 2019 but can’t use these to their optimum due to poor processor speed.. Display is pathetic... Even Alphabets break leave alone Photos and Videos... Something seriously wrong with Dell..."
4,As described :1. Windows 10 home : preloaded and pre-activated2. MS Office is 30 days trial only. One need to activate it manually. Afterwards it will be activated and licensed lifetime.3. McAfee antivirus is also licensed valid for 15 months.Outer body is of silver colour.Keyboard and screen border is of black colour.Keyboard keys are soft.Touch pad is also good.Weight is bit high.Sound quality is good.Display is normal HD so don't expect Full HDOverall good product in this price.
5,Awsome Product ....All is good
1,The laptop showed a blank screen and cursor when turned on. Seems to be a defective product. Amazon call centre is not agreeing for a return.
1,"The product is worst. Looks like they are selling defective products by making sure customer neither can refund nor can replace. The laptop I received has seroius performance problems(just browsing for 2 hrs gets hanged and have to forcefully reboot), when contacted Amazon customer care they send a person for inspection who either  doesn't have knowledge/ they just visit and favour amazon as they are getting paid by Amazon I think.Now have to spend hours and hours with dell customer care to make it correct, that to not sure if this would work or not."
1,The laptop is SUPER SLOW even for checking emails and working on Microsoft Word. I submitted the laptop to Dell Service Center within a month for the issue of slow speed and hanging issue and I was told that they will have to change the Motherboard of the Laptop. Even after a month of submission the motherboard is not available and the laptop is lying at the service center. I was informed by the senior manager of the service center that this particular model will not perform well until I get an addition 120 GB SSD installed additionally.I will never recommend a Dell Laptop
1,"I received defective product where some keys were not working and screen was blinking. As per the promise of Amazon for free replacement, no replacement was done. I sent it back to Amazon, it was received on 24th November by Amazon but till date i.e. 22nd December, I have been calling for refund. But over a month no refund has been made. Its ridiculous. I would suggest not to buy this kind of products."
1,"DONT BUY THIS PRODUCTAFTER RECEIVING THE LAPTOP WE START USINGBTHIS LAPTOP BUT IT WAS HANGING OPEN WHITE WINDOWS.WE HAVE CONTACTED DELL CUSTOMER CARE EXECUTIVE AND INFORMED THE SAME THEY TOLD THAT PLEAAE UPDATE ALL THE DRIVERS. WE HAVE FACED SAME PROBLEM. WE HAVE PURCHASED FOR MY SONE ONLINE CLASSES. NOT A SINGLE DAY HE HAS USED THIS LAPTOP. TODAY I HAVE DELL CALLED CUSTOMER CARE EXECUTIVE THEY TOLD US THAT ISSUE IS WITH LOW CAPACITY RAM FOR WINDOW 10 WHICH DOES NOT SUPPORT.WE HAVE ASKED DELL CUSTOMER CARE EXECUTIVE WHY YOU HAVE DESIGNED SUCH AN ITEM WITH NO COMPATIBILITY OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE.NOW DELL SUGGESTED US TO INCREASE THE RAM AT MY COST.REQUEST ALL OF YOU PLEASE DONT BUY SUCH WORST PRODUCT EVER. DELL CUSTOMER CARE EXECUTIVE SPEAKING LIKE ""TRAINED POPPET"".SUGGEST ALL OF YOU DONT BUY DELL PRODUCTS"
3,"Lookwise it was good, but when I talk about performance I am little bit disappointed as the bettery backup is not as mentioned after full charge it only run 4-5 hour & in starting you find the processor is slow. So if u want to buy laptop this is not as good as we think it."
4,"I do like Dell's laptop, before also purchased. Build quality, color, memory is good, but I feel performance is little low. I recommend this product.I'm sharing some buying tips, NEVER go for No Cost EMI option, there is hidden interest charges which you never been informed while purchasing. The word is ""No Cost"" but no, when you receive EMI statement from Bank you get to know extra cost applied. I fall in this situation, so take my advice."
5,It is of very good quality Dell I3 is best for students use both for college and school it's fast not that super fast either according to your want you can buy i3 or i7 but this laptop is giving excellent service and it includes everything Ms word according to your convinence you can install it's not free it's included in the laptop though so you can subscribe for later use 🐱
5,Worth buying as long as u know how to operate on Windows 10 and you should always vigilant for the windows updates & dell support assist notifications..if u will pay due attention to it you will have most pleasing experience to use this new generation laptop...price wise I still feel that it is on higher side due pandemic and demand due to online classes and work from home ..in normal course this could have Been cost you around 28k-30k.
3,"I am reviewing the laptop (Dell i3 10th Gen) after about a month's usage. This definitely isnt one for IT professionals or professionals dependant on software. The speed of processor is slow, takes abt 15-20 secs time to open a file or app. Switching from one window to another, also requires patience. As for battery life, if u have charged it fully, the laptop runs for 3.30-4 hrs without dying down. The exterior body of the laptop looks great but key settings may have been more modern.Overall, if u are a student or use more of word doc and less of internet, then this is a fine product. Else, spend a little extra and buy i5 or i7 processor."
1,"This is one of the worst product being supplied by Amazon.This laptop takes 15 minutes to boot up, 10 minutes to open chrome.. I can go on..Showing lesser price on amazon. Now I understood why it was showing lesser price.I want to return this but my window for return is over.So now I have see this useless thing daily without using it.Please it's a scam of dell with amazon included in itDo not buy itThank you"
1,REPLACE MY LAPTOP. SOME ISSUES WITH THE DISPLAY.WHILE BROWSING ONLINE IN ANY WEBSITE THE DISPLAY GOES BLANK.DARK DISPLAY FOR SOMETIME.CHECKED THE SLEEP MODE ALSO . INCREASE IT TO 10MINS .STILL NOT SUCCESSFUL.PLS REPLACED IT
1,"Bought two Dell Inspiron laptops in August 2020. Both the laptops had problems within the first week with slow response. Now two months down, the screen freezes constantly making it impossible to work. Since both the laptops are exhibiting the same problems this seems to be an inherent issue."
1,"Amazon is degrading it's standards and services day by day. This is the worst product I ever purchased. I got this laptop in exchange of my old Dell laptop which I was using for 7 years now. In comparison, my old laptop worked 80% better than this one! Everytime I click on Chrome/Microsoft Edge, it doesn't respond and crashes. I am not at all able to work and all these JUST ON THE SECOND DAY! Disastrous! I want to exchange this product for new and completely working laptop. Total waste of money."
1,"I recently purchased Dell laptop, the performance was really worst and the product is not up to the mark of Dell. I've been using Dell laptops for more than 8 years now and didn't see such worst product. very slow and while opening a application or browser it take too long to open. I never recommend this product. not worth the money spent."
1,This is the most pathetic and annoying laptop I have ever purchased and experienced. You would want to hit it on the wall for being so slow. I started my own law practice and purchased this laptop with all the  excitement and the moment I started working on it shattered into the pieces. I made a complaint to Amazon and they replaced the laptop however the replaced one is one step ahead in being slow to the previous one. Again I have made a complaint for the replaced product.
1,"The battery life is poor. Also often after going into the sleep mode, it takes 15-20 mins to starting. Sometimes online meeting completes but the laptop don't start.Really horrible experience. I have visited service centre as well, but they told that Warranty do not include software.To make this laptop work normally, u have to increase RAM or change HDD to SSD which will cost min. 6-7k.Plz be careful during the purchase of this product.Since day 1 of purchase, I have tried to get the service from Amazon as well, but no service representative supported, the reason was lockdown. Surprise....they can deliver product but cannot provide service.Plz don't purchase."
1,"THE LAPTOP KEEPS HANGING EVERY 5 MINUTES. I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON FOR HIS ONLINE CLASSES BUT TOTALLY USELESS. DELL CUSTOMER CARE ARE PATHETIC ASSES. THEY HAVE NO SENSE OF BASIC CURTESEY. AMAZON IS ONLY TRYING TO WASH ITS HANDS OF EVERYTIME YOU SPEAK TO THEM . I HAVE LOST ALL MY FAITH IN AMAZON . I WILL NEVER BUY ANY ELECTRONIC ITEMS FROM THEM EVER , EVEN IF I HAVE TO PAY MORE OR TRAVEL 100 KMS TO GET THE SAME  . THESE ARE JUST BIG NAMES DELL AND AMAZON . WE TEND TO HAVE SO MUCH TRUST IN THEM BUT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE GUYS ARE UN-ETHICAL AND ONLY HERE TO CHEAT YOU . . PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY ANY DELL PRODUCT .  SUPPORT THE SMALL BUSINESS MAN WHO WILL GO OUT OF HIS WAY TO GIVE YOU THE BEST CUSTOMER CARE . THESE GUYS ARE JUST CORPORATE DOLLS WHO WORK WITHOUT ANY EMOTIONS. I GOT CARRIED AWAY AS THIS WAS AN AMAZON RECOMENDED PRODUCT ."
3,Delivery was good but windows 10 is to heavy and it makes this laptop slow even opening a world document takes time and it's quite frustrating it should have SSD on which the OS and other software should be loaded and 1 TB harddisk should be seperate. I am disappointed with performance
5,Order was delivered on time good performance
1,"It is dead slow, booting taking 10 mins, for opening a folder also it take time and keep on hanging. I am working with Excel and browser when i switch windows it strucks , Even Govt Free laptop works faster then this, This is worst model of dell, it looks Amazon also tied with this worst model , now I feel why exchanged my old laptop it was faster 10 times compare with this muck Laptop"
3,Please note a per Dell support team there is no LED indicator light on the power on switch which allows one to understand Power ON state of the laptop. There no proper clarity given in product details. The Laptop is very slow. Be careful if you intend to purchase. This product is not even average.
4,As described :1. Windows 10 home : preloaded and pre-activated2. MS Office is 30 days trial only. One need to activate it manually. Afterwards it will be activated and licensed lifetime.3. McAfee antivirus is also licensed valid for 15 months.4.

1,"This laptop is too too slow. It takes about 5 minutes to open a simple 1-2 mb pdf file. Contacted Dell Customer Care, they advised me to install addtional RAM and SSD ! Why are they selling such a useless laptop? For selling additional accessories?? This laptop can't work with its factory installed hardware ! You will have to instalp additional RAM and SSD !"
1,"I have purchased it for my office use which includes just outlook and 2-3 excel spreadsheet.  But even it consists of 4gb ram,  it is too slow. Takes very long time to start, and gets hanged very frequently.  Processor speed of 1.2 ghz don't support windows 10. At least 2ghz is required for windows 10. So in nutshell,  it's waste of money ."
1,Friends i want to let you know that don't purchase this product as the performance is extremely slow. To open any application it takes 1 minute to open and 90% it will stuck. The speed is like i am using Intel Pentium iv processor. In Google Chrome i browsed YouTube and you will be shocked to know music starts first and after 30 second video play and extreme lagging.
2,"Just a vostro laptop in 14', only top and bottom skin is changed to silver.Very slow, getting hang even in opening a website,Good thing is it has MS Office. And display is good.In Dell website only 15' available with i3 and that is votro only no inspiron. Inspiron are only available with i5 nad i7. So i3 Inspiron is low grade vostro for online sale only.But overall, very poor performance, too slow."
1,Dear viewers please don't buy this system I am suffering from performance issue. When ever i am trying to open system it is taking 1 minutes to open a windows and the system always slow and I am not even work properly with this system I am trying to get support fro. Amazon and dell no response  now I am suffering a lot hence please stay away from this product.
1,"Friends, this laptop is dead slow. Just to load windows and start, it takes minutes together.I would have returned it but I could not use it due to Diwali festival season and by the time I realized the fault, the return period was over. Don't buy this at all from Dell, go for a better one which would cost around 40K."
2,"Didn't recommend anyone to choose this product,  because you can get much better laptop in the same range. I buy this for my online classes but it got too much heated in just 1 hour and got hang after using it more than 2 hours,  make me not able to use. If you want to take online classes of more than 3-4 hours,  than you shouldn't buy this."
4,Guys initially the Laptop May seem little slow... but try to get the best settings and install a 4/8 GB RAM. The Laptop will be superfast
4,"Tecno spark 7 is best mobile ,this price renge ,awesome performance ,,and look like very good  Thnku techno ....."
4,In this range this phone is very good.
5,I receive today so looking good I using some day after written any author
5,"Writing the review after roughly 2-3 weeks of usage.First, the colour is unique which makes it stand out of the other phones in this segment. The rough contour at the back helps to solidify the grip. So seems to be quite suitable for rough users.Secondly, the battery backup is pretty huge despite the screen and ability to multitask.Apps run smoothly, and camera quality is excellent during day, and decent during the night. Network and storage is another USP, as my primary usage is to make calls.The big screen and RAM let's you enjoy netflix, games, and youtube all the the same time, in super HD quality. And not to forget the face unlock feature!Turned out to be a great buy, extremely value for money with the variety of features provided!"
5,"It's almost a week I am using this phone. First of all, really loved the colour. Wasn't sure if it would be as good as shown in picture but it is. Ordered the green one. Second, the battery surprisingly lasts for a long time. It takes a little time for phone to get fully charged, but once it is, I can get a lot of work done. If you are looking for screen size and battery you can go for this. To top that there's an amazing camera. Loved the filters in the AI Camera and the portrait mode."
5,I have been using the phone for 1 week now. The phone is very smooth and you can multi-task easily.The camera (both rear and front) are really good. The pictures and videos are very sharp and well lit. I experimented with both Macro and low light photography. The results are quite good. Highlight: The AI feature automatically switches to the mode.Battery is good. 6000mAh.  I charge it once a day and easily watch movies and play games.Overall a very good buy.
4,"Requirents were : good front and back camera with flash on both sides, decent storage , quality display for good browsing and multimedia playing experience. So I  was waiting for micromax in 1b 4gb version which comes rarely in stock  when I came across review of this mobile . Firstly was hesistant since  I never heard of this brand but since it was exactly suiting my requirements and strict budget and after going through review decided to take a chance and I will say I am happy that I purchased it .Camera : goodFeatures in camera : greatUser experience : goodDisplay and brightness : greatBattery : huge ."
5,"Back panel and design are great. Strong and handy phone with decent performance. Network availability is good, and easy to carry. Camera works fine, but the screen size, brightness and battery are top class.Ideal for the first time smartphone users."
5,Really impressed with the design of the phone. The design is premium and classy especially for this range.Most satisfied with the battery backup as it easily lasts a day and a half on heavy use.Camera and screen are excellent as well for the budget.
5,"Have added photos after a month use.I am a moderate user who does everything except gaming. That said, the battery lasts up to 1 and half daysDecent cameras for the price. Pictures are satisfactory but could be better.Very responsive fingerprint sensor and good sound quality."
5,"Excellent entry level phone with premium phone features. Battery backup is really good, network availability is good, the phone is light and handy. Check out pictures clicked using the phone."
5,"More than 10 days of using phone.Very happy with big screen and battery backup. Good for watching youtube videos, facebook videos and pictures.Looking also very smart. Stylish and nice color.Android 11 is available which is latest. Good phone with nice features in this price."
5,Battery backup and screen size are strong- making video watching experience smooth. Design is catchy with good feel.Extremely good camera and picture quality
5,"Superb mobile with frent selfi flash light. Image quality is great charging is also great, but slightly speaker noise while talking and listining music, greater look , simply wow"
4,"Nice phone just like any other budget Smart phone  This phone had a serious problem of Charging ..it was very slow and took hours to charge the phone . Later after may attempts I realized that the Adapter was not working , the charging cable was working fine .I  replaced the adapter with an Adapter of Redmi5 phone and now its charging Fast ..Better the company check the Adapter as there are several complaints here of Slow Charging .Overall a Good Phone"
1,"Bro I can't believe, while starting only it get hanged... After that without putting much app or data it's responding very poorly late. For giving so much qntity, they comprise qlty.  Not good for normal use also. Camera also like vga. Apps taking seconds to tk open. Voice quality is poor, voice hears different while talking and also sound is very very low. Not up to the mark for 2021 phones."
5,Recently I purchased Tecno Spark 7 (2/32)I very happy with this phone. In this price segment no other band provide these features.1.Big bettery 6000 MAH2.Fingerprint sensor3.Front dual and back 4 flash4.16 MP rear camara
1,Mobile too waste. Mobile specification is good but not good at all for the use. mobile getting heat in the few days. i'm unable to return the mobile as return window was closed in 7 days. please please don't buy the mobile.
4,Initially I was very skeptical to buy this mobile or not. But somehow made up my mind to give it a try. After using it for almost 1 week I can say this is the best mobile in this price range. Camera quality and Battery life is superb. Did not observe any slowness or hang while opening the apps. Overall very satisfied with the product.
1,Mbil was good but.. Amazon ne used mbile de diya mujhe jo pehle se koi chala raha tha. Jiska temrpar laga hua tha with scress and mbil ka seal nhi tha
5,"This product is made in India, has amazingly good quality, it lets you import everything from your old phone through google, you won't even lose your apps.

4,"Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps."
5,Awesome
5,Best buy at this price! The display quality is amazing and I do not have any complaint with the camera too. There is no other phone available at this price which comes with 4GB ram. You should go ahead with this.
1,"Very bad experience from Amazon. Very bad camera quality of the phone. I want to return the phone, but amazon is not taking back the phone. I don't want to purchase any product from amazon further. Leaving amazon app permanently"
4,i didn't upload photo ....for any reason but it is not up to the mark .1.display 4/52.cam 3/53.fing sens.. 4.5/54.processor 3/55.build quality 3.75/5back panel is not good looking coz some self design as per my opinionin this price segment rs 9000 is good enough
5,Good product value for money but ordering is too difficult within one minute soldout
1,This phone is not value for moneyIts a downgraded phone of earlier phone launched in india.The camera is worst i ever seen in any redmi phone.Battery is ok.The display quality is very bad not hd. Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.Dot notch display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera.Recently i am using redmi note 5 pro. And this phone is just downgraded phone by redmi .you cannot imagine low light photography in this phone.The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.If you really need a phone there are many options in the market.If you are taking phone for the first and a beginner you can go for redmi 9 prime.
5,Good mobile
3,"Processor is bit slow, camera is below average except that everthing works fine. I personally don't like MIUI because of lots of ads and bloatwares. But, good budget range phone if you ignore/adjust this issues."
4,Overall its good and satisfied for the price.Pros:1. Good Battery.2. Best budget phone for 8999 with 4GB RAM and 64GB Internal Memory.The only drawback i felt is Camera.If you are looking for a better camera I would suggest to pick some other model.
5,best good product prive battry camera all very good
5,Nice PerformanceCamera quality goodlight in weightmultifeatures are excellentgood gaming purpose#Mi
1,Very very Poor Mobile. If you have used any FHD mobile phones then I bet you that you can't use this phone for more than a Hour.PROSBattery. 👍🏻👍🏻Sleek design. 👍🏻Call quality 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻CONSWorst Display ever seen. YouTube videos👎🏻👎🏻Processor is Pathetic. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻Camera Front is just okay. Back total failure.👎🏻Poor Internet connectivity. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻Nothing inside the box. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻Please don't think of buy this phone. 100% you will regret. MADE IN CHINA product. They mentioned as INDIA everywhere but the Mobile. Soft cover shows MADE IN CHINA. Rs.8998 is wasted..You can buy for a elderly person who use only for Call purpose. Better Don't Buy 😂😂😂
4,Product is best at this price but charging speed is very slow but we cannot accept more then this at this price
3,"It got so many bugs, the screen turned completely blank when i clicked on 'update system app', surprisingly NO heating issues, brightness is lowFor camera the rear is okay but front lacks details"
1,Auto response start problem with start mobile
4,It is  a good phone which is orange a nice colour I love it it features are better than other phones
3,good
5,Good product. Value for money phone. Everything is average. Display is good. Battery life is also good. I bought it for a employee of mine. Overall a good phone. 4/64 combo is hard to  find in this price range. Exceeded my expectations.
5,GOOD
1,Worst product ever as the camera quality is very poort rear as well as front. Amazon was not ready to take the return as they have a new policy now which is replacement policy so they will get you a replacement but won't take it back. Bought that in sale as had heard from friends that redmi phones are good but it ain't. Will suggest not to buy at all from Amazon as it's better to go and buy from the store atleast they take 500rs and will exchange the product. Speaker is poor you can not hear properly on speaker at all. Product is not worth in this price range as one can get better options by payin 1000-2000 bucks extra.
3,G35 is ok for day to day usage not highly capable..
1,"It is a just ok kind of phone. Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use. It is completely waste of money. Do not buy this mobile."
4,Good
2,I was having Samsung before same 4gb ram and battery back was very good but in redmi with out much of space or app ram speed is very very slow and battery back up draing with a day so not happy with the redmi product .I can return to Amazon with in 7 days but unfortunately our building is effected with covid possiitive so totally issulated no one should have contact with us so can't able to send the return mobile
4,Overall good mobile...But Camera not good as expected.Overall Performance is good .Value For Money
1,"Redmi9Too many disadvantagesCamera quality is worst:both front and rear.Processor is very slow.Body is plastic and which is uselessDisplay quality is very badMicro usb charger: this wonder, since all model new phones are coming with c-port, but this phone with old model micro usb port.Video calling is issue.Heating issue during charge aswell as during the call,You can't video call and many more issue.And you can't return the phone in Amazon.Totally this phone is gutterchap quality."

3,Charging Adapter came with phone turned out to be defective. stopped working after 2 weeks of purchase.Don't know how to return the adapter or how to claim the warranty on adapter alone.Phone is working fine so far and looks good
3,"Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3. Under 9000 INR4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)5. Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5. Building quality is poor. As well as camera are very dissatisfied.6. Useless camera bump for 2 poor camera only just for marketing showing 3 circles.7. Loaded with bloatware and adware. Unauthorised data transfer to China.If possible go for Motorola E7 around the same price and you will have great experience with Snapdragon and clean android experience."
1,"My suggestion for everyone who is thinking to buy redmi 9, please don't buy.Redmi is a very trust brand but not redmi 9.I purchased this phone 3weeks ago, first it was in good condition, after 3 week it started to hang every morning, after 4 days the phone completely shutdown.I don't know what to do, before getting one month this happened.It's getting really hurt to use this phone."
5,"Very good product for the budget  My honest review after 5 days of usageDisplay 4/5Camera 3.8/5 it is good for the budgetAudio quality 5/5Finger print sensor 5/5Face I'd 5/5It has good processor hello g35 which is good even redmi gave  hyper engine technology which is good for playing mild games and surprisingly sar value is too low which is awesome , dont try to play heavy  games it will sometime get hang , battery life is awesome it will get upto max 2 days battery backup with mild usageThe only problem they did not give usb type c cable but for the budget it is not a big issueMainly I will recommend this product who love to study in online platform"
1,Very very poor camera.its look like jio 1500/- camera and supplier not responded regarding this issue
1,Battery performance is not good camera quality is not good also there is no brightness in my device I don't want this mobile
2,"Phone is only for Calling, Whats App and Youtube.I gifted this phone to my mother, so as per her usage i felt its okay.Worst part is camera.... I even had Redmi Note 4.... I seriously felt Note 4  camera is much better that redmi 9.I got this phone in 7500/-"
5,Best
1,The phone is very hang and some application doesn't work properly....Pls don't buy this ....If you are try to return it will having lots of stages and procedures.The performance of this phone is very bad...Redmi provide 4gb ram but it having Below 2 gb experience...Poor network connectivity and some times it showing blank screen...Very waste products...and big lose of money.........
1,Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
4,If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
1,Camera quality is not good. It is mentioned as 13mp but the motion of the camera is like 2mp. Phone is very slow in operation even though it is 3gb RAM . More over it is MADE IN CHINA.
5,"Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."
5,"If I started to rating it's all features, it will as followed (Out of 5 🌟):Processor ⭐⭐⭐⭐Display ⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐Battery ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Sound in loud ⭐⭐⭐Sound in 3.5 mm cord ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Camera Selfie ⭐⭐⭐Camera Back ⭐⭐⭐⭐Networking ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Lack:There is no Fingers print sensor locked.There is no Back cover in the box.Camera quality not so good."
4,"I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
1,Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!
3,"Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other"
5,Worst phone.. overall performance is just bakwaz....don't buy...always hangs
3,"COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"
1,"Compass is not working, showing error as required sensor are not available,And everything is fine."
1,"Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. 😞. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone 📱, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% 😀. The phone is too lightweight ☺️ and very handy😄 Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. 😃.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. 😭GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. 😠😠.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. 😥. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good 👍But it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. 😠Display quality is too poor. 😫 Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. 🥺  No led in front of the display.😰Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection 😥If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or above🤗 with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy."
5,Cheap & Best phone in this range
3,Made in China product
1,Made in china...The country of origin should be mentioned in the description...Returning the Chinese crap
1,1. Very bad quality mobile2. Poor display quality(looks very cheap)3. Sound is very low4. Cmaera is like 2mp camera5. Performance is very slow(lag while using phone)6. Will get better mobiles with this price.7. Think 100 times before wasting your money on crap8. No pros at all
1,Redmi 9A launched useless phone everTotally waste moneySo please not buying this phone
3,REALME batter than redmi now
5,"1. Display is excellent. Colors and sharpness is good.2. Descent cameras according to price.3. In hand feel of phone is good. It's slim and despite 5000 Mah battery, it feels light.4. Battery backup is good. Easily last one day.5. Performance is good according to price. Mediatek G25 does it job well. You can play COD and FREE FIRE easily at low settings.6. Speaker loudness is average but quality is good.7. MIUI 12 experience is amazing. No ads and reduced bloatware."
5,Awesome product at low price.Compatible productFast and best batteryLess time more battery chargeAnd does not drain battery.Amazing product
4,"Advantage :3GB+32 For Rs. 7498/-With 6.5 Inch & 5000 mah Battery Acceptable.Disadvantage :*No Finger Print Sensor*Front Camera is 5 MP Only, if it's 8 MP & Rear Side 13+5 MP means little acceptable.Over all Ok."
3,No finger print....there is vast color difference in picture & actual . there is no matching in SEA BLUE color. piece received with DARK Blue colorotherwise good gadget at this price.
4,Quite goodBattery and build quality is betterBut camera and speakers are okok.
5,Screen is big and crisp battery backup is great. You can find lag here and there but manageable don't expect gaming in this phone. Camera is below average. All together phone feels premium in look with below average performance. If tou are planning to buy in this budget no phone will beat this phone.
5,"Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
3,Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
5,It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
5,"Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"
2,Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
3,"This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked priceMi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.Need Improvement.Processor is best for browsering , social networkingThis processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.Battery capacity is awesome ♥️ no need to say. brightness level is good and it also handle with sun. Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses"
3,Weary good product  very fast delivery
3,"Points to be noted:👉 The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.👉 This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.👉 Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.👉 Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.👉 After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone."
5,"Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best. Display is huge(20:9).Camera is above par.Performance is good.Overall best package.5/5 for Rs.6800."
5,Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
2,Phone is good. But it is made in China
5,Wow
1,"I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available. You can replace only. So, please don't buy this worst product. Even for first time im facing that amazon support also not supporting in this issue. I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon."
4,"Good mobile,in this corona times if we want quality product for basic regular usage,this Redmi 9a 3 gb /32 bestCamera is average like all entry-level mobiles,Redmi might send an update for small big fixes like every new mobile launch,gcam till now not available,with that quality of camera increasesDesign display very good,slim tall mobileBattery very good,takes 2.5 hours for full charge,so better charge when 40 % battery left.People who are planning to buy 4 gb /64 gb Redmi 9a,don't take it ,best to go for Redmi 9 as we get finger print scanner, slightly better speed,camera and build quality for just 700rs moreSpeed of Redmi 9a is good for 3- 4 appsCons:No gorilla glass protectionNo Secondary noise cancelling mic,this is big mistake by redmi as they give in every mobileNo Finger print scannerFinally under 10,000 rs all Redmi 9 series mobiles are very best as they provide 4 gb ram variant in very price segment,only option we have"
2,Worst camera ever...both front & back... & Screen resolution is not good.
4,"So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5⭐ for thatPros-•Low price, wont get any other phones in this range• Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.•Good for basic usage.•Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:•camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)•Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use⭐"

1,Worst mobile . I never expect from oppo such a low grade mobile. Touch is not working. Phone hanging. No return and replacement option.  From Amazon I got bad experience. Don't buy this mobile. Waste of money.
5,"Nice mobile prices 12,450"
1,"Body sensor not working. Was late by 2 days to find out this defect and so could not use ""return"" option.Due to body sensor problem, phone display never gets off while talking and so when brought close to ear, buttons like mute, hold gets activated while speaking.The basic function, which is to talk to others on phone becomes troublesome. Everytime have to very careful of holding position to make sure phone is not touched on body. Hate this and feel cheated/dejected.Cannot return as well."
1,It is roadside product with dusty display. When called Amazon customer care she deny to replace item. Don't buy anything from Amazon. Amazon only sells defective items. I returned many items and this was very useless response. She also disconnected call.USELESS AMAZON
1,This mobile was used by someone else.I have got someone else's mobile.I am not happy for this mobile.I will not do return this mobile.Because the reason of I give gift for other person.
4,"Better to value for money , quality is as per shown ..And fast delivered by amazon."

Let there be no such features like other mobile but i phone also doesn't export such features at high price, then?I have attached some pictures also you can check them incase you wanna see the picture quality.Hence you can buy this without any tension.Amazing mobile's camera and body quality and display is also good.Go for it I suggest. 😃"
5,Fantastic
5,The phone is excellent but if the front and rear camara should be high and should be their dark mode compalsary but it should be added fastly and should give ear phonesonly main default is not nice camara should be high because the less cost mobiles will take more tean agers so they do moor selfies so it should increase and oppo is the selfie expert but this phone no selfie expert camara for next phone it should increase .Imay think I will increase

3,"I like the product. But as compared to my other phone Realme X2. I found the lag in processing in some of minor things also. It is having 6GB RAM then also the having some processing issue. I don;t like the product. Even after this specs, the things are getting lag."
4,Nice mobile in this Price 👌👌👌👌..
5,Very nice phone for Rs.12500/-
4,Nice product...but there is no C pin charger  thts only one prob in this product...
3,Headsets are missing in the phone box...where are the original headsets...its normally included in phonebox??
1,The phone lags a lot right from the box. You have to swipe 3-4 times. Apps get hung. Never seen such a pathetic phone.
4,"Good product  but as compared to Mi note 8 its not Good . If you want to rought use for bussiness purchase.. Provessor is slow , not for gaming. But want you tube and surffing it's usefull. Another all thing is good .I don't have time for upload pics , but this review is enought.Product is same as photos."
1,"i have received the waste and damaged products and i chasing the customer support from last 10 days no solution upto now waste of money on  amazon ,waste of time on amazon ,and i customer of amzaon from last 5 years and i am a prime member this is the services i am getting"
5,For the money an excellent phone. My usage is mostly for mail and messaging. Bit of browsing and reading. The battery lasts for two days in my use. I bought one and then I was very happy with it and I bought another of the same.
1,"Screen quality is very poor , camera is also nearly poor, all over the phone is worst. I ordered this phone by choosing the no cost emi option of Bajaj , but they are also taking the processing charges of Rs.174 on every instalment.So please don’t use Bajaj’s emi option for ordering this phone. Thanks"
3,Updating after 4month :-screen recorder not available..which is default function of every android now a days..-Charging draining faster but charging gaining very slower.-its not a 21st century phone .. so many basic features missing Day 1: experience:-Most important : it will not redirect the link into the present app in mobile .... It will open link every times in default browser..Eg: if I got any Facebook /insta /Twitter link and I already have installed these app then it will not asking me to get open with app instead it will redirect to browser and again I need to login... So so poor technology1.processor looks slow while setup and configuration my account data restoration as compare to redmi note 7 (same price older version phone than this)2. Camera quality is very low both back and front ...capture blurred images..not focusing the face even after setup manually.3.  Not value for money.. I think I made mistake to choose oppo brand .. I compare all the feature with redmi.. redmi looks far better than this..4. No front flash light available to click in night5. Looks slow to handle multiple apps compare to redmi6. Please don't buy this phone..this is so poor technology phone..
5,I have been an user of nokia 6.1 as it started to face issues I have opted for this one. After using premium phones like Xperia and Nokia I feel the fabrication is not upto to the standards. Helios processing a little slow.Banking apps a little stretched due to the size of the screen. Rest all a good buy.
1,"I couldn't like it bcoz of its poor water resistence quality.I bought it on Dec.2020 but the working system of this disturbed on March 2021,within a period of 2-3 months.It is great loss .It mars  the Credibility of the Company also.I wanted to purchase one more but the damage has spoiled my mood n faith.I want compansation for the loss.It would be of great support n credibility of the company if it exchangeg the mobile OppoA31,Mystery or mend it properly without my loss.If the company do this favour,it would be a gentl step towatds customer care n service as well as the establishment of strong credibility n capabilitu of the Company."

1,There is no headphone in the box... unsatisfied 😟 disappointed ☹️
2,"It's an average phone. Quite on the pretty side. ONLY those who are looking for a budget phone can think of purchasing this one. The camera is very average, but the functions & controls of the phone are smooth. It's very lightweight - that's a plus!"

4,Nice phone value for money but in inbox there is no earphone and screen protector receive being a regular customer of Amazon i am  unhappy there was  clearly written that these items are included in inbox.
1,"when i ordered this phone , headphone is free with phone but received order without headphone"
3,i have recently bought this phone..on 18 may 2020.. delivery is good but there was no headphones in a box.features r awesome nd phone is working gud.but camera quality is bit bad.
1,Worst mobile . I never expect from oppo such a low grade mobile. Touch is not working. Phone hanging. No return and replacement option.  From Amazon I got bad experience. Don't buy this mobile. Waste of money.
5,"Nice mobile prices 12,450"
1,"Body sensor not working. Was late by 2 days to find out this defect and so could not use ""return"" option.Due to body sensor problem, phone display never gets off while talking and so when brought close to ear, buttons like mute, hold gets activated while speaking.The basic function, which is to talk to others on phone becomes troublesome. Everytime have to very careful of holding position to make sure phone is not touched on body. Hate this and feel cheated/dejected.Cannot return as well."
1,It is roadside product with dusty display. When called Amazon customer care she deny to replace item. Don't buy anything from Amazon. Amazon only sells defective items. I returned many items and this was very useless response. She also disconnected call.USELESS AMAZON
1,This mobile was used by someone else.I have got someone else's mobile.I am not happy for this mobile.I will not do return this mobile.Because the reason of I give gift for other person.

1,What !!! 13k priced phone with Snapdragon 450 processor is just a Worst thing. Second thing is it's front camera ... Which is Average... Guys you should go for Samsung M30 rather than this device... Because they have sold a old phone with new outer body... Phone performance is very low... This phone is not at all good for gaming and for photography ... A simple use of this phone ... But Battery is WATTA MONTSER !!!You will be loving battery of this device with 15W fast charging ... And no other good thing in this phone... Your mobile will hang during heavy multitasking because of very average processor Snapdragon 450 ...I recommend you should go for SAMSUNG M21 or SAMSUNG M30 or Samsung M31... They are incredible !!! Samsung phones are long lasting workable ... Phone will not get any problem for 1 to 2 years ... EAST OR WEST ... SAMSUNG IS THE BEST (expect Samsung M11😂) 😋  - Real Fact
5,"Pro -1. Huge battery - 5000mah Hustle free usage for 48 hours +2. Huge display - 6.4-inch infinity-O display, HD+ capacitive multi-touch touchscreen Adds an immense  experience.3. Goodness of SAMSUNG GALAXY M11 still have 3.5 mm headphone jack. It is easy to connect with our current headset4. Best camera for this price range - 13 MP f/1.8 for standard wide + 5 MP f/2.2 for Ultrawide + 2 MP f/2.4 for DOF5. Comes with Android 10.0 . the 4GB RAM adds quick and smooth usage of appsCons -1. Face ID does not all the time2. Could have add headphones"
4,"The phone comes with a 6.40-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 720x1560 pixels. Samsung Galaxy M11 is powered by a 1.8GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 processor. It comes with 4GB of RAM. The Samsung Galaxy M11 runs Android and is powered by a 5000mAh non-removable battery. The Samsung Galaxy M11 supports fast charging.As far as the cameras are concerned, the Samsung Galaxy M11 on the rear packs a 13-megapixel primary camera with an f/1.8 aperture; a second 5-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture and a third 2-megapixel camera with an f/2.4 aperture.The rear camera setup has autofocus. It sports a 8-megapixel camera on the front for selfies, with an f/2.0 aperture.Samsung Galaxy M11 based on Android and packs 64GB of inbuilt storage that can be expanded via microSD card (up to 512GB) with a dedicated slot. The Samsung Galaxy M11 is a dual-SIM smartphoneConnectivity options on the Samsung Galaxy M11 include Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, Bluetooth v4.20, USB Type-C, FM radio, 3G, and 4G with active 4G on both SIM cards.Sensors on the phone include accelerometer, ambient light sensor, compass/ magnetometer, gyroscope, proximity sensor, and fingerprint sensor."
3,Samsung M11 Pros- 1) Display--  Nice but of course FHD displays are always catchy.2) Network speed good.3) Nice call quality.4) Camera not bad comparing ti the specification and should get greater than 2.5 marks  .  But still5) Does not feel heavy. That is very nice.PhoneCons-- 1)Samsung displays  are always harmful to sensitive  eyes.Samsung M11 I am not sure but does not uses PWM controlled brightness.  But the blue light filter opacity/opaqueness/yellow tiny cannot be increased beyond default and most probably that s hurting to sensitive  eyes. Those who uses samoled displays with no eye trouble  I think shouldn't  suffer from this. But others may. I have complained to the company to update and look after the matter.  They should  also give LCD displays .Micromax  has always given displays  good for eye. To me that is the most important rather than other features.2) Speaker sound may be little louder though not bad.
5,"The battery life is promising, UI is great, also the phone an apt weight so that you are aware of holding a phone. Processor is judged old outdated in most comparison websites. After using it I must say it does a fine job. Hence I would say this choice is good for Parents, or people who are focused on having a smartphone because of its necessity. Then hands down this is a good buy!"
1,"Got a defect piece, mobile got switched off, pickup team is not picking up as they are not able to check IMEI number in the phone and Amazon is not refunding the money as it is not reached them, Almost a month now, still issue is not resolved"
5,"I love this product. Best android phone I've ever seen in this price range! Battery life is pretty great although, screen quality is pretty nice as well. Samsung M-series is the best for students and people who can't afford expensive phones because, it provides the same features as those so called- expensive phones! Camera quality is pretty good with a triple-rear camera and a real cool front camera. Best affordable phone with all features you could get!"
1,"Very slow incoming call volume/ringtones even after adjusting all advanced settings. Switched from Nokia for the first time to Samsung, thinking it has bigger Ram/storage and better battery, but discovered that this new Samsung is not much of a smartphone, it feels more of a basic phone being forced to do the job of a pro. Lags, jams, drags at every button, online shopping has become a headache. Most frustrating mobile experience. And I don't care about taking pictures on mobiles, but yes, camera is absolutely dull/primitive. Never saw so many lame things in any of my old Nokia phones."
1,"I have bought this phone (4GB ram version) with Moto G8 power lite on same time.I bought this for my Father as gift & Moto for my mother.Within few days my father was so fed up with this phone because of its made & features. He just makes calls & runs basic application.This phone is not even worth for it.""battery life"" - that's ok ok. ""camera quality"" - the worst easily.and ""screen quality"" - thats an ok ok too."
2,Pros -Battery lifeLarge screenCons-Phone freezes sometimestouch screen not responsive enough. Scrolling is a big pain on thisfingerprint sensor sometimes does not workoverall not a good phone at this price range. u will be irritated because touchscreen is really bad. even if u type very fast it will not catch up
1,"I bought this phone as as temporary one to use as my Samsung M31 screen stopped working (broken). Due to lockdown I could not get it replaced, that is still in warranty though.Please avoid buying this phone. It has all problems that you can think of.1. Screen hangs too frequently, becomes unresponsive, sometimes unable to take calls. I. only have regular apps and that too minimal. , no games.2. Clicks work improperly.3. The calculator and many other apps like samsung notes do not open at all (App not responding error).4. Sometimes become very hot during charging.5. Phone response to clicks is slow.Not worth it for the price being paid. I am disappointed."
5,Awesome  in this price range. Good features and moreover its made in India. Very sturdy display with IPS panel. If you are looking for a phone in this price range go for it. Fast charger is awesome.  1.5 Hr for full charging a 5000 MAH battery. The Battery backup is also very Good. Battery back up is good for 2 days. It also comes with lovely features. Loved itThis is my first impression
5,"If your budget is strictly restricted up to Rs.15K and you're not willing to buy any Chinese brand, then M11 is unanimously a smart choice. Build and aesthetics are really impressive, none less than a higher end model. Battery supports fast charging giving you 100% charge in 2.5hrs. Picture clarity and sharpness is quite good as well. Although Samsung could have provided bigger camera in the price range like other smartphones does, but still 13MP is more than sufficient unless you're into professional photography. Response and Touch-Sensitivity is amazing, no lag or hang problem till now. Packaging was really good, no damage to the box as well"
4,"The phone isn't that good looking, no premium vibes, just a budget phone, display is awesome, after opening 5 apps.....stuck lag hang ....camera isn't that good, look likes my 5 years old phone, at this price range better to go with redmi note 9 pro"
2,THE DELIVERY OF THE ITEM WAS IN RIGHT CONDITION YESTERDAY AND THERE WAS  NO VISIBLE DAMAGE IN THE EXTERNAL  PACKAGE . BUT ON OPENEING THE PACKAGE I FOUND THE SCREEN OF THE MOBILE HANDSET  IN DAMAGED CONDITION . OBVIOUSLY I WOULD NOT LIKE TO USE THIS PHONE AND SO  TAKEN  UP THE ISSUE WITH AMAZON FOR REPLACEMENT  OF THE ITEM . BEING A PRIME MEMBER I WOULD EXPECT THEM TO DO IT
1,"PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS. Shell out some more money and go for A30 or A50. A50 is the best phone I have used till date.M11 is easily one of the worst Samsung Galaxy phones I have ever used.The phone keeps freezing frequently.Your fingerprint reader will suddenly stop recognizing your fingerprint. You need to remove and re-add biometrics.Samsung is known for pathetic battery life, but M11 is worse!A week back somehow my phone password changed from PIN to alphanumeric by itself. I had never set an alphanumeric password so I got locked out of my phone. Had to do the hard reset. Lost all my data.Camera quality is bad as well. You need to tap on the screen 3-4 times for the camera to get focus.Not only does the phone freeze, the touch stops working randomly in between for a couple of seconds."
4,आप बेशक एक जानदार और टिकाऊ फोन की तलाश में है तो आप की तलाश पूरी हो गई समझिए वह सारी खूब इस फोन में है जैसे बैटरी लाइफ और फिंगरप्रिंट एवरेज कैमरा क्वालिटी
5,"Nice display also that phone for all Normal user play any type of game, Use any Normal apps. This phone has simplistic OneUI based on Android 10. Brightness light is good for your eyes. This has no unnecessary apps. This has October Security Patch. No Ads No Recommendation. 5000mAh Battery takes time to 1% - 100% - 3h max and Use 1.5 days max to max 2 days. Camera Quality is Good.  Signal Strength is Good."
1,"Battery backup is not upto the mark. There is no screen protector or back cover provided with the handset. Then the worst thing is the camera, especially the back camera! What the hell! Overall experience is not satisfactory!Very poor device."
3,"Samsung galaxy store installs all nuisance apps (you cant uninstall neither disable this app, in this model), I bought this for my mom, an unschooled, old lady, who used to have another great android phone, that never did this kind of spam installations. I had given 3 for not being able to disable the app atleast"
5,Overall satisfied with the product. Gadget justifies the price . but camera could be more better in terms of mega pixels . better life if okay. But finger print is little slow. Otherwise operating speed is all good at this price.
1,VERY BAD PHONE DON'T BUY ITNO FEATURESBATTRY WORKS FOR 1 HOUR EVEN AFTER 100 PERCENTAGE CHARAGESLOWNO SOFTWARE UPDATESSERVICE FROM SAMSUNG ALSO BADVERY BAD PHONE DON'T BUY I ALSO BOUGHT THINKING GOOD AND IGNORED OTHER PEOPLE'S COMMENT ON THIS PHONEDON'T BUT YOU WILL REGRET
5,Best quality display with a good processor. Camera quality is also good. Battery life is amazing. One of the features I like is digital well being. It's best for student. The hole notch makes it perfect.
4,"If you are buying this product for camera then i recommend you to not buy this. Worst camera ever. If feels like I'm in year 2010. When you click a pic you need to be still in that position for 1-2 sec, else pic will get blur. Quality of camera is not good. Rest i guess it's working fine as of now. Do not buy if you love to click pic's."
1,"Camera is not good as expected this device click selfie like painting. Remember when we click picture in micromax or spice phone what we see its like painting no detailing in photo no saturation, no defination, no stability. I mean please dont buy this phone if you are looking for good camera phone, but if you want monstet battery bavkup in this price segment then please buy it, it give you more then one day of battery backup with heavy use"
5,I have been using this phone for about a month now. It's indeed best in its class. So many features are available at this price. Samsung has indeed  found its way to the budget phone series through this model. Battery lasts a lot. Typical 100% charge  lasts for about 30-36 hours as per average usage. Camera quality is quite good. Multi tasking ( operating different apps) is seamless and the phone has not hanged even once. Sound quality is Ok.Snapdragon processor is too good. Though a higher version would be certainly desirable. Overall one of the best in business.
1,>Primary Camera quality is bad Front Camera quality is worst not even worth 1 star>Battery life is well and good>Was very Heart Broken when seen the camera quality. It was a gift for my Papa it was his first android phone but was ruined as I was not able to return it ( No blame just T&C issues )
3,"Liked the design, good battery performance. (I  am not a gamer or heavy user.) However the sound clarity when on call is not very good. Neither it is loud enough. The most disappointing thing is when I am playing any music via built-in speaker. Have to keep it at max volume to hear music even when I am at a close range. The sound quality is good via headphones though."
4,"1. slow charging, but battery is good.2. camera is also good.3. I think, if the screen size of the phone  would be something more wider than  length then it would be much  better...thank u.."
4,"Best for basic user.I bought this phone for my mom. And used for 7 days. As of now no complaint.I have Samsung M21, everything is same  as M21, only camera quality is not as expected. But at this price it's really okay to buy."
5,I used this product for YouTube gaming and its battery life is endless and also it's screen touch is very smooth I have used many phones but this is just awesome and I think this is best phones for who's looking in low cost and best performance its feature like camera quality is competitive to other high cost phones
4,Samsung Galaxy S7 has a good battery life and it's also fast charging but its camera quality could be made a little better it runs smoothly and functions very well and has good screen quality but I am little disappointed with its sound quality as its low pitched so it can also be made a little better
5,Looks great.. camera avarage.. delivery in time.
4,अगर आप चाइनीज़ फोन नहीं लेना चाहते तो अच्छा फोन है 10000 के अंदर । अच्छी स्पेसिफिकेशन के साथ आता है कैमरा क्वालिटी थोड़ा न्याय नहीं करती फोन के साथ बाकी अच्छा है। आप इसे अपने बच्चों के पहले फोन के रूप में या अपने माता पिता को दे सकते हैं।
4,"Exchange of the old phone was rejected due to scratches on the back of the phone on metal surface. The site had mentioned that the exchange will happen if the screen does not have scratches and the phone is in working condition, but this does not seem to be the case. Please update the exchange requirements properly on the site"
3,So many inbuilt app in mobile so above 16 GB is used by those app..which is not useful for common people.so please not give too many inbuilt app it is my recommendation as well as opinion...
5,"I m using the phone n it's so good , battery life is gud go for it"
5,Its very good phone and swadesi phone.Got 64 Rom in low budget 8999.Thanx Amazon. U r best.
5,"First of all awesome work by Amazon, I ordered in evening and next day morning i got the delivery.About product, It is a overall good oroduct in this price range. The most important thing about this mobile is look and feel very premium.In this price range a must by product."
5,big punch hole disply from samsumg in 9000 budget and 5000 mah battery life with 15watt fast charger inbox.  it can be upgrade android  11 one ui 3.0 via system updater.overall good phone in 9000 budget from Samsung
1,Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
4,If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
1,Camera quality is not good. It is mentioned as 13mp but the motion of the camera is like 2mp. Phone is very slow in operation even though it is 3gb RAM . More over it is MADE IN CHINA.
5,"Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."

4,"I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
1,Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!
3,"Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other"
5,Worst phone.. overall performance is just bakwaz....don't buy...always hangs
3,"COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"
1,"Compass is not working, showing error as required sensor are not available,And everything is fine."
1,"Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. 😞. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone 📱, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% 😀. The phone is too lightweight ☺️ and very handy😄 Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. 😃.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. 😭GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. 😠😠.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. 😥. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good 👍But it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. 😠Display quality is too poor. 😫 Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. 🥺  No led in front of the display.😰Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection 😥If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or above🤗 with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy."
5,Cheap & Best phone in this range
3,Made in China product
1,Made in china...The country of origin should be mentioned in the description...Returning the Chinese crap
1,1. Very bad quality mobile2. Poor display quality(looks very cheap)3. Sound is very low4. Cmaera is like 2mp camera5. Performance is very slow(lag while using phone)6. Will get better mobiles with this price.7. Think 100 times before wasting your money on crap8. No pros at all
1,Redmi 9A launched useless phone everTotally waste moneySo please not buying this phone
3,REALME batter than redmi now
5,"1. Display is excellent. Colors and sharpness is good.2. Descent cameras according to price.3. In hand feel of phone is good. It's slim and despite 5000 Mah battery, it feels light.4. Battery backup is good. Easily last one day.5. Performance is good according to price. Mediatek G25 does it job well. You can play COD and FREE FIRE easily at low settings.6. Speaker loudness is average but quality is good.7. MIUI 12 experience is amazing. No ads and reduced bloatware."
5,Awesome product at low price.Compatible productFast and best batteryLess time more battery chargeAnd does not drain battery.Amazing product
4,"Advantage :3GB+32 For Rs. 7498/-With 6.5 Inch & 5000 mah Battery Acceptable.Disadvantage :*No Finger Print Sensor*Front Camera is 5 MP Only, if it's 8 MP & Rear Side 13+5 MP means little acceptable.Over all Ok."
3,No finger print....there is vast color difference in picture & actual . there is no matching in SEA BLUE color. piece received with DARK Blue colorotherwise good gadget at this price.
4,Quite goodBattery and build quality is betterBut camera and speakers are okok.
5,Screen is big and crisp battery backup is great. You can find lag here and there but manageable don't expect gaming in this phone. Camera is below average. All together phone feels premium in look with below average performance. If tou are planning to buy in this budget no phone will beat this phone.
5,"Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
3,Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
5,It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
5,"Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"
2,Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
3,"This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked priceMi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.Need Improvement.Processor is best for browsering , social networkingThis processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.Battery capacity is awesome ♥️ no need to say. brightness level is good and it also handle with sun. Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses"
3,Weary good product  very fast delivery
3,"Points to be noted:👉 The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.👉 This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.👉 Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.👉 Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.👉 After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone."
5,"Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best. Display is huge(20:9).Camera is above par.Performance is good.Overall best package.5/5 for Rs.6800."
5,Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
2,Phone is good. But it is made in China
5,Wow
1,"I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available. You can replace only. So, please don't buy this worst product. Even for first time im facing that amazon support also not supporting in this issue. I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon."
4,"Good mobile,in this corona times if we want quality product for basic regular usage,this Redmi 9a 3 gb /32 bestCamera is average like all entry-level mobiles,Redmi might send an update for small big fixes like every new mobile launch,gcam till now not available,with that quality of camera increasesDesign display very good,slim tall mobileBattery very good,takes 2.5 hours for full charge,so better charge when 40 % battery left.People who are planning to buy 4 gb /64 gb Redmi 9a,don't take it ,best to go for Redmi 9 as we get finger print scanner, slightly better speed,camera and build quality for just 700rs moreSpeed of Redmi 9a is good for 3- 4 appsCons:No gorilla glass protectionNo Secondary noise cancelling mic,this is big mistake by redmi as they give in every mobileNo Finger print scannerFinally under 10,000 rs all Redmi 9 series mobiles are very best as they provide 4 gb ram variant in very price segment,only option we have"
2,Worst camera ever...both front & back... & Screen resolution is not good.
4,"So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5⭐ for thatPros-•Low price, wont get any other phones in this range• Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.•Good for basic usage.•Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:•camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)•Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use⭐"
5,Good phoneDecent look and looks stylishCamera and battery quality are super goodGood phone in this range 👍But delivery service is not good
1,Dont buy.. after 10 to.15 mins gaming phone lagging too much
2,Not good phone stopped working after some time so i didn't suggest you this...
2,"Worst product, not as expected its not even a month and ut hangs so much! Its front camera is just worst, only it's first look is good nothing else. Don't go for it!! Redmi note 8 and even note 5 is much better than it!😤 Completely disappointed 😤😤😤"
2,Here my product review after usage of 3 months.Cons:If you bought this mobile you can't exchange. I have tried but not able to exchange my device.Please check by clicking the exchange option and you can take the decision.Now you can understand why you should not by this mobile.Gaming - Mobile heating and lagging when you playing high graphics gameBattery - 5020mAh battery. Moderate performFor charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100.Macro camera - useless featureFront and Rear camera - Not good compare with realme 6000rs mobile camera.UI is fine but consuming more ramMany pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app).I suggest please buy some other brand don't waste your money like me.
5,Totally impressed by the built and looks. For 13k I thought of getting realme 6i but the stocks barely last..!So I decided to get this phone. The phone is great and smooth. Gaming experience is also good but not as good as g90t.G85 is a decent processor with great daily life performance!If 12k is your budget go for it..Or 13k..realme 6i and 14k... Go for poco m2. Scarlet red looks stunning!!
5,Awesome product 💎Value for money 💵Best in segment📱For normal usage this one is the best 🙌Long battery life 🤳 when compared to other smartphones.Camera is ok for this price📸Charging is comparitively slow it takes 2 - 2 and half hrs or more to get full charged.🕕 Overall its best for the price  👍
5,"Hi I am writing this review post usage of 7 days,1. The Dsiplay is perfect better than Samsung M21 in the similar price range. The display is Full HD+ whereas its counter parts are not offering that.2. The camera scores over its counter parts whereas not much variations available in Selfie but fantastic at this price.3. The specifications are more or less similar to Mi Note 8 except the processor, it's Helios G85 in this one whereas its Qualcomm in Note 8 i.e 625.4. Note 8 had 4K video capture option but not with the latest  Note 9.5. The battery stays long as promised as I am not a gamer the battery lasts for over a day and half.6. This had P2i protection towards splash but not with Note 8.7. To conclude I shall recommend this phone as no brands available at such good price.Thanks for reading god bless . Enjoy"
3,"My Mobile phone has some screen issue. On completely black wall paper or black background there's a permanent white dot (like screen is defective) on the screen but i requested for the replacement soon device will be replaced. Although device is preety average, ram management is not that good.go for the snapdragon rather than mediatek.Pubg lags sometimes on medium settings and there's a ton of preloaded apps from which some apps you cannot uninstall.there are several options in the market other than xiaomi. So,choose your device wisely."
4,Very nice Phone.. smooth performance.. charge service decent.. screen quality superb.. sound ok.. but body vibration issue is here.. in speaker mode or at time of calling body vibration present.. no notification light.. overall decent performance at this price.. phone support only 18 watt fast charge. But charger support 22.5 watt..
4,Ultra wide shots
5,Nice color as of now working fine no hang or lag front camera is awesome sound loud and clearNetwork connectivity is also strong .......Go for it if you have budget of 12000 if you can add more 2000 then go for redmi note 9 proCHARGER NOT WORKING AFTER 20 MIN OF CHARGING ORDER FOR REPLACEMENT ..THANKS AMAZON FOR REPLACEMENT

4,Nice phone
1,I brought this phone. Flash is not working properly. No intensification in flash. It working like touch is on. I complained to customer care. They sent AC repairman. I said he is AC repairman they said he is all in one. He just reset the phone and said now it works well but there is no change in previous result and the one after reset.
1,"Misguiding information!!!!!!In the banner it says ""Made in India"". But in reality it is ""Made in China"". It is a blatant attack on trust. This can't be tolerated!!Beware of misguiding information...."
1,Price is too high compared to specsShould have gone for m21
5,Awesome mobile
5,Ultimate 📷..... 🔋 backup is very good.....👌
5,Awesome product..go for it guys..delevery and packing is also good..i got it only in two days
2,Looks premium and mi claims that it has quite a lot of features. Has a better IR blaster for remote accessibility. Only the camera is the best in the price range and other aspects it’s a Piece of shit.Kindly don’t buy Becoz it’s worth only for 8-9k Move to Samsung or any other phone. Fedup with the performance of the phone in the very first day. The 2stars are only for the camera Quality and IR blaster. Phone lags much and Gaming performance is too poor and way of handling this phone requires a lot of patience as it loads for longer time for some of the app details. Battery last better and Camera quality is good that’s all. Not worthy for 13.5k.Pls don’t buy it if you expect performance from this phone or if you think you can have better features phone.
4,Good for this price range..
5,"I brought this phone for my youtube channel review,I thinks that it's a great part product for me because it's Four cameras on the back, punch-hole on the front , camera is perfect, It's me changed my status and one of the best phone i ever had review in last few days  phone capacity 128GB killer memory, Good battery it last 1 to 2 days with normal used. However, Mobile legend has a lot of frame drop when you set it into High Graphic but still manageable when you set to medium graphic. So sad, I thought this is much better compared to lasted redmi phones,The quad-camera setup is almost the same as on the Note 9S but with one small difference - the 5MP f/2.4 camera has been swapped for a 2MP f/2.4 one with autofocus, which is a very welcome feature because it makes macro photography that much easier.The main camera has been borrowed - 48MP with f/1.8 aperture as well as the ultra-wide unit - 8MP with f/2.2 aperture. The ultra-wide's sensor is quite small measuring at 1/4.0"" with 1.12µm. And, of course, the 2MP depth sensor, which serves more of an aesthetic purpose than functional one.Ｖｉｄｅｏ ｒｅｃｏｒｄｉｎｇUnfortunately, the phone supports video recording only up to 1080p at 30 fps. There aren't many modes in which you can shoot in either. A cinematic aspect ratio is available to add some dramatic effect to the video, but that's pretty much it.The Full HD video itself is a bit on the soft side and the dynamic range seems a bit too narrow. You can't see anything in the shadows and clouds in the sky are just a tad brighter than they should."

Back panel plastic quality not so good.Camera perform great in daylight condition and ok in low light.I have also note 9 Pro I think that is super value for money under 14000 if you budget permit then go for it. By paying extra 2000 rupees for redmi note 9 Pro you got great build quality with back side glass, UFS 2.1 rom for storage and to great camera."

4,Thank you samsung and Amazon for timely rakshabandhan delivery.Now for readers this is a review unbiased and written after testing and continuous usage :-Pro's1.Screen ppi is great as entry level device✌2.Battery backup is awesome thanks to samsungs R&D even with .7mamp charger.👀3.Android go version 10 is cute without craps4.Reading pdfs is easy and comfort for eyes atleast samsung has guts to say the truth.5.No lag till now because i dont need gaming other than that all regular even without go apps are nicely running.6.fingerprint and face lock i dont need so good they are not provided.7.Call quality is okay.Speaker is normal.8.For music lovers dowload any music app with equilizer will be fine.9.16gb/32gb and sd card is okay.10.Auto smart memory cleaner(use smart manager in settings once a day) for smooth RAM functioning and ROM cleaning🤗11. Supports OTG as well.Cons1. Camera below average still expected but samsung should work more on this front if they wanna beat chinese phones.2.Not for gamers and thats expected buy a 4gb Ram 🤔 based phone why reading me?😉3.finger print and face lock missing I Can manage but most indians can't.4.Battery takes 3.15 hours to charge to work for 12 hours of calling and surfing and thats not bad at all but can be issue for chinese phone lovers who have habit of charging again and again to play pubg.Overall out of 5.Camera-2  Gui-4  Screen ppi-5  speed-4  android-4Don't buy a phone only because of specifications must see integration and longevity overall a nice secondary option and primary for featured phone switchers.
5,Very smooth UI latest M series .Battery is good. 3000mahIt has dark mode.Apps run smoothly.Camera is average.Best for secondary phone.Apps are of GO versionWiFi calling feature.
5,I free of cost taken this phone for I show my friends in WhatsApp & facebook this phone a budget phone and full specification and more sell for samsung smartphones.
4,"After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced."
1,I am writing this review after the usage of 15 days. It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues. Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.
1,"The bad part of this mobile was that it lasted only half day. Next morning it did not work even after charging and trying everything possible, but what's WORST IS AMAZON RETURN PROCESS. Highly disappointed with Amazon process it took me approx 4 days and 2 hours of phone calls to get the defective product returned."
3,"Not bad....can suggest this mbl for normal users.... charging speed is very much disappointed , taking lot of time to charge up ....basic charger type not even USB cable....this suits for parents only ....not for youngsters, gamers etc."
5,"I have recieved this phone on 14th of August 2020 and today is 24th of August 2020.So After 10 Days i am reviewing this phone because i have seen many negative reviews on amazon review portal so now my true experience is about this phone following.1:- Processor Media tek Quad core Is best because quad core take less power from battry than the octa core processor. and i purchased this phone for my mom so quad core porcessor is sufficient to my mom.2:- Battry life is good because of Quad Core Processor.3:- Ram is 2Gb that is also sufficient4:- Display as always awesome as samsung provide.5:- Mike and Speaker's quality is too good as always samsung provide.6:- Many People said in the review that the mobile is automatically swiched off and on automatically. yes i have seen this my own only one time. but its not the problem. every new phone have done this one time because of system works smoothly. and after one time switch off on things happen then never repeated till my 10 days of use this phone. so you people who is taking switch off on problem very seriously ,you should not. this is one time process when phone is new sometimes phone may swich off and on automatically. so dont panik at all for this.7:- most of the people want to replace the phone because of one time switch off on problem then i have to say one thing that your first phone is the only phone who is brand new and the replaced phone never be a new phone at all . so never replace your new phone. this is my own experience.8:- I am fully satisfied from this phone in this price of 6499.9:-This is all the reason that is why i am giving 5 star this phone.Thank U Samsung."
5,"Thanks Amazon for delivering the product as mentioned in the product description. It was well packed and delivered.By the way, A Special Thanks to SAMSUNG for stepping up to INDIA's needs and introducing a new Line of Phones for taking on the Chinese Incursions in Indian Mobile Phone Market.We ordered ""Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage)"" and thrown away the chinese phone Salomi as it had 100 other Apps Pre-Installed without our information and heating phone and draining battery. Had a tough times using that 'Salomi' phone. Now with a GOOD / BETTER Phone from GOOD Company Samsung, happy to own this ""Little Cute Phone"".Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) -- is a small enough to keep in pockets and has all the Latest Android 10 OS with a Good Display.  -- All latest version of Apps in a lite mode which means what we need only will be loaded and given instead of ""loading all forever"" and wasting our Precious Data.-- A good Camera with Samsung Reliability is known for its Crisp Camera and Displays.What else needed in a phone. Thanks SAMSUNG for bringing a new Affordable Range with Latest Android 10 OS.Way to go SAMSUNG. Surely we INDIANS will support SAMSUNG and make it to No.1 Company by replacing the Chinese Mobile Companies in INDIA."
1,Poor Quality. Phone is not functional after 2 days of use. I bought it as a spare phone and didn't use much or neither downloaded any big apps. Phone is not getting on. It has happened under 7 days of delivery and I made a return on Amazon but it's not showing any confirmation or clarity. Waste of money.
1,"Update 16 Oct 20Samsung service is trying to push manufacturing defects as my fault. They are playing with small users. Please be careful buying any Samsung product as they are operating like a fly-by-night company.I've already spent Rs. 3,000 for a Rs. 6,000 phone without a working phone for the last 1 month.Update on 29 Sep 20.Reducing status to 1 star.The phone is increasingly giving problems.a) The screen responsiveness is getting worse.b)  The SD card is always giving error.c) Taking lots of time to load Apps.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I exchanged my Samsung On5 for Samsung M01 Core mainly because of the lack of internal memory. Good sturdy experience of On5 let me to buy this phone. I have no complaints about the hardware though many of the software have regressed from On5. Let me write them down:1. Samsung On5 running on Android 6 was more stable than current Android 10. It has rebooted atleast twice on it's own.2. Camera has no panorama and other mode which was there in On5.3. Chrome hanged twice during this period.4. SD card stopped reading once. Had to push it back again to work. Never happened in On5.5. Do Not Disturb can't be customized. Samsung On5 had it.6. Unread SMS not highlighted.Go version shouldn't mean regression. I'll be happy to discuss with the architects who would want genuine op"
1,Writing review after 6 month Samsung is loting money by giving worst product I am using this phone after 6 month it started and stop working saying overheating if I watch movie for half an hour of video call for half an hour
3,"#Very poor camera.#Battery ok but slow charging.#I got this in exchange for 3.8k ,  So , I am satisfied.# M10 was far far better.#gaming ok#worst part is camera.dont expect any nice  pics.#small screen so easy to handle.#overall 3.9star I'll give,coz you own samsung at such cost.# may be bigger M01 is better."
2,"Major issue with this phone is slow charging and quick battery draining. Look of handset is sleek and smart but charer is Normal(Non-USB). To connect with other devices like laptop, PC, you will need to purchase extra USB cable. Backside of phone get heated if using for long time like an hour or more. I was recording video on 14.08.2020 and in 15-20 minutes, phone get overheated and I stopped video recording."
1,"I wud have given no star but unfortunately there's no such option. The mobile stops reading the sim card often on the second day of use. When tried to replace the item quoting defective product, they ask me to install an app to solve the problem and the app itself doesn't work. IT SUCKS. My money got wasted."
1,"Samsung didn't meet my expectations this time. I had been a big fan of Samsung products and this product of theirs disappointed me. Battery gets hot while watching videos, playing games and when connected to the net. Battery drains fast. Not suitable for video calls. Although I bought a 2GB RAM version, video and voice keeps cutting in and out. Tried different networks. No earphones. Cheap looking charger. Samsung should not compromise on quality. If they cannot afford to release a budget phone, they should not. Instead, continue with their mid and high range phones."
5,Product is good in that budgetAnd performance is excellent
1,"This mobile is giving very poor quality of audio with breaking voice in zoom video call. I applied for return policy, but they did not accepting for return. I was shocked due to this kind of behaviour from Amazon. I will put a case through online , if they will not take return."
1,The battery 🔋 is totally worst and touch is very bad charging is also not proper.
1,"since day one sim slot is not properly working, some times it is showing ""insert sim"" error. Then again i have to restart the phone or reinsert the sim to connect the phone. I changed the sim card, then also same problem is continuing and it is clear that there is problem in sim slot. hence pl arrange to replace the phone at the earliest."
1,First time in life I dared to purchase a phone from Amazon. First time a Samsung phone I bought stopped working went dead within a few hours.  Later Amazon agents kept on visiting but deny to pick up the product saying it is dead.. 4 times. I kept on calling customer care in 6 or 7 calls the phone is not picked up by return agent in 15 days. Money is with Amazon. Which means Amazon is using the money. Not sure how many escalations i have to make replace the productThe product might be good but buying it from Amazon iz a pain.If you are unlucky and phone is dead you will keep begging for return. Your money will be stuck with Amazon.WORST way Amazon India treats the Customer. Better use Amazon not cheap products
5,It has all the basic features and the interface is quite smooth. It has support to wi-fi calling also. Overall the phone is good value for the money spent on it.
3,"I recieved this  item on 9this August, it was working fine. But just after 9 days, this  phone not  charging.  I  try  with  two  other charger. The  phone also  get  discharged. It is not  going  on. Also  if it is put for  charging,  the  charging icon  not on and  this phone  not  charging."
5,"I do not understand why other reviews mention disappointment with performance. This is a BASIC BUDGET SMARTPHONE! Don't expect SD865 perf.Whom this phone caters to:1) Parents/Grandparents who have basic needs such as Whatsapp and YouTube2) People migrating from feature (button) phones3) Pre-teens' first phoneThe phone is preloaded with Google Go Apps, which are lighter versions of the regular apps.There is no bloatware, and the UI is optimised for the processor.Battery life is decent. Don't expect much. Charging is not fast at all. It takes around 2.5hr for 0-100. But again, this is not a complaint!Screen is 720p. Has a special 'Outdoor Brightness' mode for extra brightness.Speakers are decent. You can hear the ringtone!No face unlock/fingerprint scanner.I bought this phone for my grandmother who is migrating from a Samsung Guru button phone. It is perfect for her usage.Only complaint: This phone is missing a clock widget on the Home Screen!"
1,Too much lagging as like there is only 250 MB RAM.Disappointed with the slowness of the device (I have already updated the software to latest version).
1,"The mobile contains  poor battery quality. 80% of charge has been drained in 3 hours with average use. Do not buy it to waste your money.Amazon will mention to return or replace product within 7 days, at the time of purchase .But in actual they will delay unnecessarily and will pass the time frame , by different protocols, as nobody can return it . Even if it is  a faulty set and there is a chance to return it."
5,"It's really value for money 💰🙂...The phone comes with a 5.30-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 720x1480 pixels and an aspect ratio of 18.5:9. Samsung Galaxy M01 Core is powered by a 1.5GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6739 processor. It comes with 1GB of RAM. The Samsung Galaxy M01 Core runs Android Go Edition and is powered by a 3000mAh battery.As far as the cameras are concerned, the Samsung Galaxy M01 Core on the rear packs 8-megapixel camera. The rear camera setup has autofocus. It sports a 5-megapixel camera on the front for selfies."
1,Worst product never ever try to take this product... All of sudden stopped charging and not working after 12 days.... Need to replace this but no source to do... Please don't buy this kind of worst products when ppl are unable to spend much money... Try to take good reviews mobiles
4,"It's a 2GB phone, you can't expect much, even Facebook lags while going through lots of browsing. The camera is Ok. The build is not good, you must use a rubber cover and temper protection. It has a 3000mah battery that's why discharges quickly and doesn't support fast charging which creates more problems. Overall what you can expect at such a cost?Analyze your needs before purchasing it. The phone is decent for household usage with few apps, but if you want to have multiple apps then don't go for it.."
1,"Touch screen not working from first day of use. I requested for replace the mobile after few days delivery boy says Amazon app should have the Amazon app, the problem is I can't install the app without screen function. Still waiting Amazon to solve the problem"
1,"This review is solely for the seller who sold a faulty phone with a huge black spot on the screen. It is so obvious that proper quality check was not done before delivery. This can happen only in case of a used phond being sold as new. Will have to think twice before ordering costly things online, especially in Amazon because as the eshop, Amazon also cannot deny responsibility for this. The headache that I am going through now to return the faulty item is a complete nightmare."
1,"True Reviews,Worst phone in the world. Don’t see the YouTube reviews and buy this phone they are just lying. I wanted to give it less than one star but there was no option. I looks good in photos but is very very small phone. It lags and sticks a lot even in 2GB ram. A never buy product. Camera is freakin’ waste. They say it has 12MP camera but actually is like 2MP. The apps keep exiting themselves.And says app not responding. The WORST PHONE. Don’t buy this is my honest review. I bought it today and returned the phone on the same day it self within hours . If you wanna waste your money then invest in this phone . The packing and everything is rather soo good but phone does not function good at all.Thank You."
5,Loved this peice best phone at this price. Samsung always worth every penny. Needed phone for onliy class of my son and this is best.
5,Nice product
4,"I've been using this as my Official mobile... Apps like WhatsApp, fb lite, cricbuzz, playmusic, YouTube, Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Intelligent Hub, Hrms, Bankings apps like YONO, Paytm, gpayWith these apps it's running smoothly...A bit of lag, but for this proce range acceptable..Pros:Decent Camera at this proce rangeAverage specs at this price rangeSamsung Brand ValueAndroid Go OSSamsung skin over this OS was decentCons:Below average battery life, anyhow it lasts for a dayPathetic charging speed (more than 4hrs)Charger provided with box is 5V 1A at least 10W charger they could have added"
1,"The mobile Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Black, 1GB RAM, 16GB , received could not be charged, after battery was low.  Now new phone battery uncharged what do I do, Amazon delivered defective product. This is worst phone"
1,Product is fine but has limitations to function only in india. And it doesn't work well for my Mom cause she keeps travelling abroad frequently.Why wasn't I informed by Amazon about the restrictions that the phone can't function in other countries? There are other countries in the world too where they've been using mobile phones even before India.Misleading the customers shouldn't be the priority of Amazon
3,Everything is good as per phone price but only one thing I don’t like in this phone that is when u continues use it for 25-30 minutes it start getting heat which is not good
5,"Gr8 phone at the price of 6,500 from Samsung. As of now everything looks fine."
1,"Don't buy this mobile, it's totally waste.. Camera quality is too bad and battery backup also very slow it takes more than 3 hours to charge fully.. And battery was drained point by point suddenly in the normal usage also.. And heating issue also in this mobile.. Better go with any other brands in this budget..*Return procedure to get refund*In Amazon they say it's a electronic product we can't provide you a refund only we can able to provide you replacement only.. Just accept that they'll send one mobile service field agent to check whether the product is defective or not.. After they approved, they replace the old one and provide you a new one in that same product..In that replacement product also surely you'll face some defects so just ask for an refund directly through the options showing in that order page.. They immediately approve that and within few working days they'll provide you a refund..These kind of electronic product's first time they'll provide replacement offer and second time they'll provide direct refund.."
5,"It's been 50 days of continuous usage of this flagship. If you are confused between which one to buy(Mi 11x Or IQOO 7), let my review helps you well because I tested both the phones.*** After MIUI 12.5 update there is no touch issues ***1. Display - We can buy this phone mainly for its display. Amazing display with amazing touch response. 120Hz refresh rate will make you not to stop browsing the mobile definitely.2. Processor - Legendary processor Snapdragon 870. I used Snapdragon 888 earlier, I can't find any difference between 870 and 888. Both feels same to me for daliy usage and lite games. Definitely go for 870 if you want to same money. It is even better for gaming. You will get the flagship experience.3. Battery- 4520MAH battery stands upto 1day for medium usage such as whole day 4g data on and continous usage of YouTube, whatapp, insta and fb. I regularly charged the device when it is below 25 and it will 45-50 minutes for full charging.4. Camera - Camera is really awesome in good lighting conditions. Low light camera has to be improved. Different types of modes in camera helps for creative photography. Kudos to the different modes.5. Sound - 4 out of 5. Really loud. Dolby atmos is doing it's duty very much loudly.6. Charging - Should definitely speak about charging speed. As of my view, 33W charging is enough. Because it is good to maintain the phones battery in the range of 20-85%. Considering that this phone charges 25 to 90 in 30 mins or even sooner. However you should not use the phone while charging for getting the better charging speed. If we load heavy apps while charging, charging time increases. I got 12.5miui update and noted that the charging speed is improved slightly. So kindly update the system.7. Finally - If you are buying the mobile mainly for gaming then go for IQOO 7. If you are high multimedia consumer and also a part time gamer, then prefer 11x. Cameras quality are similar in both the mobiles and selfie shooters are better in 11x.If you are icici user and If you can buy the iqoo 7 for 28k, then go for it without any questions.If you are hdfc user and if you can buy the mi 11x for 26.5k(6Gb) or 28.5k(8gb), then go for 11x without any doubt.***After the MIUI 12.5 update, mobile become really awesome.***Cons in Mi 11x:1. Charging speed should be high in this price range.2. Very minute bugs in user interface, which is ignorable.3. Low light camera might be better.I will update my comments for camera and if issues faced from now. Hope this will help you😊."
1,"Very bad experience, i am going to return it, i am facing touch issue very much"
4,"Pros: 120hz, Slim design, sd870, ufs3.1, lpddr5ram, solid tactile, stereo speakers, 360hz touch sampling, oleddisplay, gorilla glass 5 protection, Best macro camera.Cons: green tint on display in darkmode at lowest brightness present in most units,Average cameras"
1,"I have noticed so many bugs on the first day itself. Worst software experience. Even the update did not solve any of the issues. I will only mention the Cons because you can find the Pros of this device all around the internet because of paid reviews. These paid reviewers never spoke about any of the issues.Note : I DON'T hate Xiaomi or MIUI, infact I am using MIUI since last 5 years and I love it's customisation. I am aware of the bugs that MIUI brings with it and I used to adjust as none of them affected my experience but this time I couldn't bear it because of too many issues.Here is the list of issues -1 - Gestures doesn't work with third party launchers. They wantedly disabled it. And many bugs when you use third party launchers like cannot access ap info. You will be forced to use stock Miui launcher.2 - Camera quality is below average. My 3 year old poco F1 takes better images and videos. By biggest issue is the camera quality. But Macro sensor is amazing. It is almost like a Microscope.3 - Green tint issue is still not fixed and you can notice it everytime an app shows grey colours. Some people say it's not a big issue but believe me once you notice that green tint you cannot ignore it.4 - Display lags and jitters in 60hz refresh rate and it is quite annoying. You will be forced to 120hz all the time which drains battery really fast.5 - Fast charging is not at all fast. My poco F1 charges equally fast with its 18W charging.6 - Recents menu has too many issues when you select horizontal mode.7 - Battery drains very fast even with normal usage.8 - Heats up very easily. It went to 43c while setting up the device and imagine the temperature while gaming.9 - Display has very weird colour tuning. It strains your eyes only in few minutes. I have tried various colour pre - sets but nothing was able to produce pleasing colours. I had severe headache after using the phone for couple of hours on the first day itself . Maybe it is because of absence of DC dimming or anti Flicker.10 - No 4k 60 fps recording for a phone priced at 30k. Even though 870 can do till 8k recording, Sony IMX582( primary sensor) doesn't even support 4k 60 fps recording.11 - What more reasons do you need to understand that buying this phone is a very stupid decision.This device could be so good but Xiaomi messed up in terms of software. If you are expecting Xiaomi to acknowledge these issues and fix them in the future updates, you are mistaken. Just see the history of Xiaomi updates.Maybe this is the reason why Amazon and Xiaomi are providing so many offers and discounts on this phone so that they can attract more customers to buy this garbage.And if you still do not believe me after all this, you can buy the phone and try for yourself."
5,"Great phone with killer performance due to powerful Snapdragon 870 chip. Multitasking, photos + videos and gaming all quite good due to the strong cpu, gpu and image processor of 870.Coming to build quality, it is quite comfortable to hold due to curved design and yet sturdyand weighs less than 200 grams.Coming to MIUI, it takes time getting used to... Coming from One Plus but it has a lot more options and there are no ads / bloateare that people complain about.Scrolling and watching movies is quite good becauss of the smooth 120 hz amoled panel.Camera while being a 48MP sensor is much better than my previous One Plus 7 camera in terms of color accuracy and details.  Possibly due to the better processor 870 vs 855Coming to Cons - it is not built for small hands and will require 2 hand operation.  It does get hot during summers but that's common to all phones with high end processors."
5,"Nice smartphonePros1. excellent display.very smooth experience2. Excellent performance3. Sound quality is good4. Internet speed is best even in rural area.5.look wise this is better than average..Cons1. Slightly camera should be better. Camera is not good nor bad it is average. If someone is not camera lover then it is good for him2. Rear side finger print magnet3. Bugs in UI. Due to that video toolbox is not working properly.4.with its cover , phone gets warm when playing games or watching videos ..Not so much but it's warming..Overall ,phone is good . It is good option for gamers, social media users,and good choice for regular customers.. but may be this Phone is not made for camera lovers.."
5,"Best phone for 30000rs1)Screen is top notch from colors to 120 hz refresh rate amoled screen will want you to look at all the time2)sound from stereo speakers is greatalthough ram is 6 gb but coupled with snapdragon 870 keeps app in background running smoothly3)Don't believe people saying camera is it's weak point with snapdragon 870's ISP it performs well and as usual there is always option to install gcam you will find 3 of camera's working in most gcam ports even macro so don't worry about camera4)Even though charging supports only 33 watts it's more than enough and I'm a person who uses phone to it's maximum potential from gaming to camera all the time5) gaming is super smooth with 120hz and 360 hz touch sample rate although it heats not as some people claim but a little usual as other phones only thing you will miss here is 3.5 mm jack but you can't blame xiaomi here every one is following the trend6) currently running on miui 12 I can from samsung one ui but miui has more features and it also depends on people's personal choice but I quite like it till now hasn't seen any bugs7)build quality great glass front and back with metal body,camera module design,matte finish and the shifting colors look premium and no where does look like phone costs only 30kFor it's price it offers more than"
1,The only issue I am facing is over heating on normal use. Not satisfied. Thinking about replacing
5,"This is my first Xiaomi device and I have to say I'm truly impressed. The phone looked stunning right from unboxing, the design looked fresh and gave a flagship experience. Finally, I have a phone that feels comfortable in my hand and doesn't feel like I'm holding a heavy brick. Must say the real MVP is the display on the phone, this has to be the best display that you can find in this price segment, I have tried a lot of so-called flagships and their screens looked so dull as compared to the Mi 11x. I watch a lot of TV shows and anime on my phone and this has completely changed my experience, hats off to Xiaomi for pulling this one. First impression of using MIUI has been amazing till now, it's crisp, filled with so many functionalities and customizable in almost every aspect.Next would be the camera, I had seen a lot of youtube reviews before buying it and have to say that the device is bang-on, just loving the macro photos. One unique feature is the audio zoom, that combined with video zoom takes videos to the next level."
1,"Alright, most disappointing Mi Phone yet of over 15 xiaomi phones I've bought, including the Mi 3.What's good?- Screen- Color (Siver is interesting; adds colors to life)What's not!- Heats up emoygh to poach eggs, under normal use of even 2 to 3 minites- Battery lasts barely a day of average use- Camera is the most disappointing camera yet (hope some fixes come in)- stereo speakers (the top speaker is insufficient; atmos just a gimmic)- Disproportionately large screen, can't use with single hand and I have large hands, and yet need to use 2 hands to operate. Let alone carrying in pocketComing from K20, regretting 'upgrading'; so not worth it!"
1,Very worst experience.Lot of issues facing with this mobile MI 11x. The MIUI not at all sync with 870 processor. Touch not worked and claimed exchange of same phone...with new phone also touch not working randomly.hence claimed the refund.Not expected from MI.
5,"I know you might find other so called budget friendly flagship smartphones under 30K. But believe me this one is the best!!It's been a while since I'm using Xiaomi smartphones. No doubt they make quality & premium smartphones also they provide good after sales service.Been using redmi note 10 pro for couples of weeks but as I prefer performance over other things, I choose this one and I don't have any regret for that..Battery backup is great.Performance 👌🏻Overall experience 9/10 😍"
3,"I ordered the phone during the pre-orders. I was excited about SD870 and Amoled screen but in the end, the phone, bought for my sister, was a disappointment for her. This phone has heating issues. Regular charging of the phone heats it up to degrees where the phone is rendered untouchable. Also, often on a call, the other person complaints of break in voice. The camera isn't very good. Some users argue that the performance is great enough for the cameras to be not good but that is no excuse for a ₹32000 to have such bad cameras. Overall, the phone is good enough for power users who want to game and like extra features."
5,"Sharing my honest experience with an Android device for the first timePros:Amazing Display: One of the best phones i have used so far. After using iPhone for a long time moving into android with Mi 11X was the best decision. The colours just seem so real and life like.Processor: Never though a phone at this price can be so smooth, just amazing. After a long time started playing games on the phone and the experience is better than playing on the laptop.Camera: Have to say that the camera is just top class. So many features which i had never though would be there by default.Design: Feels so much better that i am very hesitant of using a cover over it.OS: The OS is smooth, intrusive and easy to understand. So many people told about android being very cluttered but its nothing like that.(At least with Mi)Amazon was great to deliver the product within a day. They never fail to Amaze you.Cons:None so far"
1,"Don't go For Xiaomi if you are going for above 25k segments. I had very bad experience. My handset got some scratches at the time it was delivered but i noticed a day after. Coming to the user experience now. I am a Xiaomi fan, i have used  almost redmi note series. I have used poco f1 as well. Believe me guys MIUI makes the whole device very buggy and laggy. Display is good but it's definitely not upto the mark. I didn't notice much difference between an LCD panel and an LED panel. 120 hz & 360 hz TSR is not correctly implemented. Sound via external stereo is average. But sound via the earphone was excellent. Battery drains very fast even if you are using it on 60 hz and device heats a lot even on normal usage. Don't go for it guys. You'll regret Buying This."
5,"1. Super Exceptional display:• Unparalled display , unseen in the industry at this price band ??? ; my friends having One Plus are now regretting• after having a look at the display one question that came to my find - is it really a 30K phone or am I missing anything?• Colors on display are of the next level- very vivid and bright yet natural• Latest E4 Amoled is magical – vivid colors, 1300 nits brightness, beyond comparison.

2,"Phone looks cool and it is very smooth, thanks to Snapdragon 870 processor and 120Hz.Camera could have been a bit better and, No ads that is the main reason why I bought this Phone.Cons1. (Biggest con) The sensor is not working properly, at the end of the call when I tried to move the phone from my ear to end a call and at this point the mobile light doesn't turn on and sometimes get's on mute.2. Another small Con, which i had faced until today was with the battery. I had set it to 120hz and I am a medium user, I use social media a lot. I charge it up in the morning like 8 am and the battery get's drained by evening like 5 pm, I had expected to stay for complete day. Battery could have been better."
5,"Gorgeous display perfect for gaming. Punch hole is literally invisible my friends having One Plus are now regretting. Optimization is done very well no heating at all while gaming & watching videos. Xiaomi has just nailed the camera tuning on the device to get the perfect shots on the device. Audio zoom with camera zoom is a master stroke. Somebody really thought about video making on this phone. Beats any other phone in the segment. No Bloatware, finally Xiaomi has heard its consumers. MIUI on this device is pleasure to use"
4,"Overall a Premium Phone. Delivery was fast.Pros1. Display is really nice at 1300 peak brightness2. Design (Silver and White, Dont buy black)3. Performance at some other level. Can play any game. PUBG can be played at HDR. Genshin impact ran smooth. No major hitting issue4. Media consumption is really nice. You can feel the Dolby atmos effect paired with Stereo speakers. online streaming is really good5. Haptic feedback is there6. MIUI has improvedCons1. Camera could have been better at this price.2. No 3.5 mm headphone jack.3. System AdsSuggestionif you don't have any problem with FunTouch OS, then go for Iqoo 7 instead. but Iqoo 7 service centre are less. I bought Mi 11x maily because I don't like Funtouch OS. also I don't take much pics."
1,Why the phone gone in to black and white mode
5,"I been using Redminote 5 pro for the past 3 years without any issues, however  i started getting headache often because of the older mobile screen, i was looking for a perfect alternate and found MI11X.. I made a good choice,Pros1) Display is Superb!!!.. 3D corning gorilla glass with Amoled display taking the viewing experience to the next level. My cousin is using VIVO, after he looking at this phone display, he was surprised a lot and he compared the display with an IPHONE, he said its better than IPHONE. I was setting up the phone yesterday for more than 6 hours and didn't feel any eye pain or irritation. when i unboxed the mobile, it was charged around 67 %, after 6 hours of continuous usage the charging went down to 33%. Finally I am relieved from eye pain. Thanks to DisplayMate A+ rated E4 AMOLED display.2) Faster charging experience is awesome3) MEMC technology with enhanced contours  are the best features4) Side finger print is lightning fast5)If you are a movie freak then this is the best phone for you6) Netflix with HDR support7)IR Blaster8)No Heating issue9) Butter smooth display10) New MIUI update is coming up with dolby atoms feature11) Battery life is excellent..12) MIUIOverall I am 100% satisfied with this mobile :)ConsNever find oneWill come up with an update after a week.Super phone ..close your eyes, go for it.UpdateWifi signal observation is great.. When my ipad 6th generation struggling to receive 1 signal, mi11x is observing 4 signal's from a far away wifi dongleSuperb speakersAfter the MIUI 12.5 update the device is much faster than before..MIUI 12.5 is lighter and fasterThere are plenty of features available in Camera like vlog, dual video, movie effects, long exposure, slow motion, time lapse, macro many moreUpdate again :Only Con is camera is not up to the mark..low light photographs needs lot of improvements.Over all Value for Money .."
5,"• Performance: I downloaded COD Mobile and Asphalt 9 and maxed out the graphics and refresh rate. I played them for 6 hrs and there was no lag at all.• Display: Display is great, I watched HDR movies and i am satisfied with the quality.• Battery & Charging: Battery capacity is another great thing in this smartphone. For normal usage it lasts around 1 day. With games at maxed out graphics and refresh rate, it lasted around 6-7 hrs but with 33W charger you can charge it within 1 hr.• Build quality: I bought celestial silver model and this looks premium af and feels great.• Camera: Camera is sub-par but i found GCam for Mi 11x and it is just awesome, so that is not an issue.• Size: This is a big phone with 6.67"" display and it took me some time to adjust because previously i was using a smartphone with 5.99"" but most of phones with these specs are atleast 6.5"" in size keeping price of this phone in mind.• Audio Quality: First thing i did with this phone was updating it because new version of MIUI had fixes for dolby atmos. Stereo Speakers are just awesome and it also gives great audio output too on my BoAt Airdopes 461.• OS: Not a huge fan of MIUI because of ads but xiaomi made some changes this time and you can disable ads and there are only 6-7 miui apps that you can't uninstall or disable but those doesn't bother me because of everything else is great about this phone and you can install any launcher you like, i personally use Nova Launcher in almost every phone i use. However you cannot use navigation gestures in third party launchers and i thought that xiaomi did this intentionally to force customers to use MIUI but then i found out that this is a bug with Android 11, and google will fix this because same thing happened when Android 10 was released."
5,"Excellent display with gorgeous look,very bright and beautiful.This phone comes with latest E4 Amoled which is magical and it has 1300 nits brightness..Very smooth display with 120 Hz refreshing rate perfect for gaming which is clearly supported by Snapdragon 870 which is unbeatable.Wow cameras with fantastic features likeTime freeze motion mode, clone mode photos and videos, AI Skyscaping and with lot more cool features.Perfect design with glossy black finish andmore over its thin, light, and feel great in hand.Others feature like  Audio Zoom, IP-53,Gorilla glass 5 on front and back is really amazing.Over all a perfect all rounder and I would say this is perfect phone I was looking for and thanks Xiaomi for making it happen."

5,Value for moneyPros: 1.) Display( display is superb viewing angles are top notch)2.) Gaming( even this can handle pubg at hdr extreme graphics and low battery consumption)3.) Fast charging( it can full charge in 45mns)4.) Haptic feedback ( flagship grade haptics)5.) Audio ( stereo speakers along with dobly atmos it is simply superb best audio and stereo speakers5.) Sensors ( all sensors are working perfect)6.) Built quality ( built quality is awesome font and back gg5 matt finish looks premium)7.) Ram management ( excellent in this price range)8.) Software( all wer saying miui has bugs but i didnt notice in this as per my usage and no ads and no lags ui is simple and smart)CONS:1.) Camera ( camera is average not up to mark camera is equivalant to 15k phone camera👎)2.) Network ( signal strength shows full but u cant recieve any call poor network connectivity)3.) Powerbutton location( power button which can also act as fingerprint sensor placement is very bad coz the phone is bulky and they gave it below so u will be little confuse while unlocking and power button is very hard)
5,"Firstly, I must admit that I was blown away by the display on this phone. It's super bright and super smooth. I haven't seen a better display on any phone yet. 120 Hz refresh rate with 360 Hz touch sampling rate is a dream come true for any gamer like me.Secondly, the Snapdragon 870 processor make the phone usage experience extremely smooth and delightful.Coming to camera, the phone doesn't disappoint at all. With so many cool shooting modes like clone mode and the time freeze mode with AI skyscaping, I can now proudly flaunt my photography skills with ease.The phone fits perfectly in your hand and is super light and slim even after having so many flagship hardware and specs. The frosted glass back make the phone look extremely gorgeous.The MIUI on this phone is the claenest I have seen. No bloatware on the UI accentuates the experience even more.Camera zoom coupled with audio Zoom seemed to be a little too much to ask for but when I really tried this on my phone, I was pleasantly surprised and this cool feature could prove to be of fantastic use in adverse shooting conditions.Overall a 10 on 10 to the phone and Xiaomi has really proved that when it comes to technology, they are the best in the industry."

1,Not worth cash back too not receivedAmazon customer care don't have any idea about cash backMobile too expensive not value for moneyThey are showing some other versions available outside IndiaHere selling cheap rated mobileHighly disappointed don't buy
5,"I purchased this phone for its processor Snapdragon 870 (because who has phones which this processor in less than 30k segment.. awesome right?). But to be honest the best part now seems the display. It is so bright, colours are so vivid and gorgeous. You have to see it to believe it. Only after the purchase I read about its DisplayMate A+ certification and figured out that the display is one of the key features. Lucky Me :D.Cameras in all Xiaomi devices are good but what I loved in Mi11X is Time freeze motion mode. Device is super thin and very light and haven’t faced any heating issues which is very difficult to achieve for a heavy battery phone. Purchased the celestial silver and what a gorgeous colour. Definitely the go to colour if you are looking to change your usual black phone. Also, I thought Audio zoom was a gimmick, but that actually works. Great job Xiaomi on the device!"
1,"Waste of money phone has lot of issues camera touch screen connectivity problems like wifi Bluetooth hotspot etc., 29999/- not worth of money it has to be less than 5000/-"
4,Review after 11 days of use.I bought this on 7 may in exchange offer.  I wanted to buy one plus 9r but some of said it had heating issue. So i went to mi 11x PROS1. SNAP DRAGON 870 processor It works very smooth. U can play PUBG without any lags. I am game lover i actually brought this for pubg 😉. I am  5 star satisfied with this work2. Mine is 8 gb ram. U can open as many apps as u wish like 30 + app it still opens the first app in faction of seconds. 5 star for ram3. 3d speakers. It first didnt give me dolby but after update it got dolby atmos. U can play pubg without hearphones cause u can hear seperatly the left and right speakers sounds when enemy in pubg move around. 3 dimensional sound i can say 4 star to speakers4 Charging was very quick it gets chargee with 33 w charger. It charges to 100 % in less than hour 4 satr to charge5 camera better finger print side scanner is ver quick 4 star There are still good features i have to explore them CONS1. HEATING WHILE CHARGING or when hot spot is on around camera(no heating while u playing intense pubg game)2 battery drains moderate way. If  u play pubg for 30 mts it gets drained from100% to 65% around but quick charge can take care of this not issue3 no 3.5 mm jackbut they provide u connect cable4. Finger print scanner sometimes lagsOverall i suggest u take it with exchange if u have old phone so that u get one plus 9r like phone in less budget.
4,"I have switched from samsung galaxy s7 to mi 11x. I am sharing my experience.1. Battery: It is like heaven for me. S7 has 3000mah battery which used to drain very quickly. No matter even if you are using it or not, you'll have to charge by end of the day. This device is much better... lasting for two days with regular usage.2. Camera: I feel camera quality is excellent for this price range. Competitive with S7.3. Performance: Obviously better than S7. I feel like I got freedom from the old mobile. No lag, no hang using multiple applications.(I have gone through performance differences between snapdragon 870 and 880 in YT and preferred to buy this device) I feel there is much difference in speed and processing while playing games compared to S7.4. Display: Obviously better. But S7 had blue ray filter. So, I am little disappointed since 11x don't have it.5. Design: Look wise good, gorilla glass 5, not waterproof but scratch and water resistant. S7 is waterproof.Overall(after 15 days of usage): I feel like I made a good decision buying this device."
3,"Touch problem on second day. At some places of screen the touch is not working properly.  At first, I thought I'd the page loading issue. But realised, when I could not swipe certain words like ""Terry, the, they, ? Etc..."" Basically the zones having this touch issue, you cant swipe, or scroll. Please check your phone properly. 2* less for this issue.This is 4th Xiaomi phone in the family. Never had such issue. Mi1S is even working now properly.Received phone on time. When reported the issue, Amazon tech team connected on same day, validated and agreed for refund.After lockdown, I'll order another 11x or one plus 9R. Now I'm reading reviews online"
5,"Pros-Vibration-flagship haptic feedback,Sound- speaker (with Dolby Atmos also HI-res audio), Display-samsung E4 amoled display with 120HZ refresh rate,MEMC technologyPerformance- is killer with SD870 same as SD888,LPDDR5 ram,3.1 UFS storageI can't explain mi 11x Cons.Thank you..."
4,"Pro:Excellent display, charging is quick, smooth speed, excellent performanceCon:  heat issue while charging and playing games,ear phone speaker is loud so others can hear your talk, battery drain 15% while sleeping (not used)"
3,"I expected a lot from this mobile,I sold my k20 pro for this mobile and make a big mistake.this mobile just a showcase but nothing.total bugs in it not,every app working like hell.i never expected this type of mobile for xiaomi.automatic low light in pubg gameing really disappointed.cameracis like 10k mobile,totally I wasted my money.hope they will fix all bugs in future updates..."
5,"Hi!I bought it at 28k(during the coupon offer period) and it's been 1 week sincce i bought it and now i have discovered many things about this phone, so read below for the full review...👇PROS:-1) It's design- i bought the silver one and believe me it's the best among the all colours (becoz black is glossy and fingerprints are easily visible and white is very decent not much attractive) it is very light but it feels a little bigger in hand and it is slim too.2) Performance:- it can handle normal tasks without a single issue, it is very responsive, i compared it with oneplus 7pro side by side and it was more responsive than the 1+.Display:-it is very smooth and the quality is awesome. NOT a single issue till now (except two i will talk about it in cons section)Speakers:- they are very loud even louder than the oneplus 7 pro and have good base too. Haptics:-they are good but on the first day it was making a sparkling sound but that got fixed by their own.Selfie camera:- it performs very good in daylight and when their is enough light but it sucks in low light. I would prefer to use the gcam.Macro camera:- it isn't like the 2mp camera which brands give just for numbers. It's a true macro camera, it can go very close and gives a clear photosCamera options:- they have given a lot of options in the camera app. Video recording option is available in every camera lens on this phone.Gcam photos- I didn't like the stock camera but the images on the gcam are really different, they have better dynamic range , better resolution and so on...low light photos are also better in gcam CONS:-Low light photography:- the camera doesn't performs well in low light, ut performs like a 15k deviceMiui:- this is the main thing which is holding it back to become the true flagship killer. It isn't optimised completely, i found bugs on the second of usage only...Gaming:- though it can handle pubg in smooth+extreme very easily but if you are buying it for competitive then it will not met your expectationsBut Yeah Xiaomi can fix theses issue by improving their ui.Overall camera:- they are not as good as other 30k phone(it doesn't have 4k 60 and ois too) but in daylight or in some condition it performs very very goodFingerprint reader:- it has the side mounted fingerprint sensor I don't like it, i was expecting an in display fingerprint sensor, it looks vey premium! as compared to side mountedSo the verdict is that if you need a decent camera, great performance for casual gaming and a very great quality display then you can go for itMany people are going for iqoo 7,It's a very good device but still I won't prefer you to buy (it's my personal opinion don't take it seriously)I will upload some sample shots later soonThanks!And wear a mask✌️🤘"
1,"Cons :If any one is buying for camera than it has one of the worst camera even than redmi note 10 i have compare them.Screen not so bright you can get more brighter screen on note 10 proSometime you see patchy colour in screen during playing video.Battery is not so good on average usage you have to charge it by 8 or 9 pm. As it has no 3.5 mm jack if you thinking about some multimedia or playing games in the evening in offtime tha you have to do it without earphone.During gaming it heats mire than my pocof1.MUI is still lagging don't know why they not provide cleaner MUI as they provide in Chinese variant.Sound is also not so good as in full volume, clarity is gone. Even I tried it with JBL  and sony earphones  which are above priced Rs 2500.Network reception on my airtel network never shows full tower in my room same sim in earlier Pocco F1 shows full network even I tried same sim on different phone like note10 or vivo all shows full network same with wifiPurchase only if you want 870 processor NOT ANY EXPECTATIONS.All these issues are sent via Xiaomi feedback to them no reply got , call center they just told me if you facing issue regarding patchy  screen than go to service center as in lockdown all are closed how any one can go there. For other issues they give me no any solution whether they solve theses problem with OTA software or not .There are many options available in less than this even mi10i much better than this, which my friend is using for last 4 months.Final verdict waste of Rs 27kOne more problem is noticed in this PhoneIn wifi calling when you receives calll you are not able to hear caller or you dailed number receiver wil not hear you. When you off WiFi calling option from network settings then it work properly."
1,"I just received my Oneplus Pro 9 12Gb/256GB Model, guess what I dint even finish setting up the phone the Phone is OVERHEATING and showing a message that Phone is Overheated. Oneplus is this your premium Phone??? COMMON... I am very disappointed buying this. I initially thought my phone might be defective, but i researched more about this, I found a Forum Thread in Oneplus Website where everyone is complaining of Over Heating issues. You cannot even record a 4k video for 60 sec, phone overheats and stops the recording. Forget 8K recording.. Just read the thread in OnePlus Forum, others cannot even click photo, phone overheats and stops the camera... What is this ONEPLUS? You better release an software update and fix this mess. This is not expected from premium phone like this. I will not change One Star until you fix this Over Heating issue. VERY MUCH DISSAPOINTED."
1,Completely I didn't like this mobile and waste of my money. Please guys don't buy this mobile and don't waste your money.
1,Worst battery
1,Got the product with link line on display.. dont but this product .. waste of money
1,The back looks very cheesy. Made of tin.It gets heated too frequently.Battery backup is too less.
1,"I know that with so much competition, its more about marketing than actual product. My only expectations were a good camera, high performance processor and a long battery life.Since I was switching from Oneplus 5, the camera system and the performance was a good upgrade for me. BUT unfortunately the battery was way out of expectation.Fully charged at 09.25am, it died at 16:49pm under low usage. I didn't install any demanding apps or games. Also the back side was pretty warm all of the time, even when not doing anything.Before that day I left the phone at 50% while going to sleep and in the morning it was 38%. Its definitely a defect with such a low standby time for a new device. There's no point in 30 minutes fast charge if the drain is that fast.In two days of using the device I had to charge it 3 times. It could be a defect on my unit only but unfortunately I had to return it. I could have waited to see if an update could solve it but just didn't want to end up in the service center fiasco. Everybody knows how after sales service works in India.Lets wait more to see if others complain about the same too."
1,It is a phone which does not had cooling system its heat too much in even simple use .wasted 65k rs for such thing
1,"I have been using this phone from 3 days . I have found 3 major issues with the phone1.Auto call recording option is absent in thsi version2.heating issue, by  using the phone continuously for 3 hrs it's getting heat and displaying heat warning.3.The watermark on the camera is aligned at the center of the iamge which should be aligned either left corner or right corner which makes the watermark valuable."
1,"Im using OnePlus since 5t and then 6, 6t, 7 pro, 7T pro maclaren, 8 pro and now 9 pro. OnePlus 9 Pro is worst phone. Heats too much. And what about most hyped HASSELBLAD cameras? Check out the picture which i attached with my review. Even 10k range phone captured great pic like this but OnePlus 9 pro is struggling with depth and bokeh effect. And 2Mp camera in 70k range phone..?? Big middle finger to OnePlus. Not done this time. Huge disappointment..Guys please font waste your valuable money on this phone just go with Mi 11 ultra or any other phone."
1,The phone is getting heated during normal use. Really disappointed. Never faced this with my one plus 3 which I used for 4+ year's.
2,"Disappointment continues with OnePlus 9 pro too. Phones made after OnePlus 5T are simply not worth the cost.1. Very poor quality camera. Samsung camera is way way better than this one. Camera hype is all fake and useless. There is no hardware improvement in camera since OnePlus 5t. Colors are a bit richer, but that is not what we wanted. We wanted better resolution nad zooming capacity, which is absolutely not there. Hasselblad partnership is useless.2. Extreme Overheating issues. I cannot take a video more than 1 min in 4k 120 fps & more than 2-2.5 mins. In 4k 60 fps or 2k 60/120 fps. Phone immediately heats up and tells you that temperature is very high and screen goes dark. India is a country where temperatures go close to 50 degrees in summers in many areas. This just won't work in india this way. After 1 min the recording stops and phone shuts down.3. Pictures are like what I could take back in 2015 with OnePlus 5T. The only improvement is contrast and nothing else.4. Battery is also not good. It drains from 100 % to 57 % in just 1 hour of watching videos on you tube. And if you play any games on it, it will die and also phone will hear up very badly.Go for samsung phones instead. There is no returning this phone once purchased. So be careful."
2,"The phone hangs and there is No back button in this. So, the apps do not close properly. The battery backup is not good at all if you are constantly on net. You play a you tube video and sometimes, even you close the video, the music keeps on running in the backend till you have to switch off the phone to stop that music. When you wake up the phone, the light flickering issue is there. Video call experience is not that great. Not happy with it's performance. Too much of money ..."
1,Very disappointed at the heating issues. Wouldn't recommend buying this. I bought this on the first release date itself and was super excited to get my hands on it.Phone gets heated a lot even with basic operations and battery gets drained quickly too.Same issue is being experienced by everyone else too.. just google oneplus9 heating issues!Don't buy until they address this issue. Go for better alternatives at this price
2,After using 3 days I am writing this review briefly.Pros: Sound quality is good and 65w warp charge is marvelous and camera is good but not too good.Cons:Battery draining very fast whether using or not using the mobile.Mobile heating is very high in normal usage and mid day condition and also due to whether Mobile heating is very high and if we keep idle also mobile not gets cool.This is biggest disappointment.Some time gets over heat we cannot Take photos and its shows warning message.Conclusion: I am totally disappointed this onePlus 9pro mobile and its not worth for 70k bugs.
1,Heating up like hell within few minutes of usage. Worst ever phone I have used in my life!! DONT EVER BUY THIS PHONE.  Photos are of bad quality. Not worth the hype and price given.  I have clicked better pics in earlier models.  I request ONE PLUS to take this model back from the market. Don’t ruin your reputation and don’t fool the customers. World is going through hell already 😡😡😡
3,"Really happy about this purchase. Camera is really amazing. So much options to choose. The display is also smooth and satisfying to use. (I wrote this on the day I received the phone)Edits: (after 3 days of using it)I have been using this phone for 3 days. I am changing my rating from 5 to 3 for the following reasons.1. Heating issue: it heats very fast and when it's heated, camera doesn't work. This happened when I tried to take some clicks outdoors in the morning.2. Front camera is not worth for this money. Any regular mobile can have the same quality.3. No 3.5mm port which was kind of disappointing.4. They said camera's quality is close to human eye. But the photos are far from reality. The photos have more colours than in real and gives a more brighter picture. I don't hate it but they shouldn't have given false advertising.Apart from this, the pros I found are•Fast charging•More display options including Screen off Gestures which is very helpful.•Smooth display•Gaming mode is good. Performance wise is also good.From three days use, I conclude that this phone is overpriced. This can be sold for maximum 50k. Anyhow,most problems can be solved with software updates. I will change my ratings once they release any such update."
1,VERY VERY CHEAP QUALITY MOBILE AM EVER SEEN BEFORE.. DON'T BUY ITS NOT WORTH OF 7K ALSO..  #OVERHEATING #WORREST EVER CAMERA #OVER PRICED#STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE.
1,Cons: Intense heat Worst battery  Limited 5g bandsNo wireless chargingUseless marketing of cameraExtremely overpricedPros:Probably display of qhd+And that's a wrapThanks to amazon's return service
1,Only 2 5G bands compared to international variant has got 13 5G bands. No Wireless Charging. Handset Heating Issues. Okayish camera quality no where close compared to the Hassleblad hype. Overall not satisfied.
5,"I am a iPhone user, this time I decided to purchase Oneplus 9 pro as my new mobile. Really it’s beautiful and handy device. Camera is too good and I am very satisfied having this as an alternate of iPhone."
4,"I feel like early buyers are essentially being used as beta testers by OnePlus. And I will explain why.When you look at the specs this phone is no doubt a flagship. They have also improved the cameras, where they were previously lacking. Even with all the bugs on launch, the photos taken on this phone are just delicious! Low light photography is mind-blowing. The custom sensor they made with Sony is doing its job. The ""natural color science"" that they worked on with Hasselblad is also showing some results... skin tones in photos taken with this look much more realistic compared to other phones at this range (S21 or iPhone). So its definitely not just for marketing.So why did I give it such a low rating? I would have given it 4/5 stars, if it weren't for the insane overheating issues. On the first day, it got really hot (almost 50 degrees) while setting it up. I thought this might have been just because of all the data restoration that was taking place. But afterwards, while I was checking out the camera, it started overheating again and I got a warning within 5 minutes! The phone blocked me from taking any more photos till it had cooled down again. Keep in mind I was not even taking 4k videos, just some casual photos. I tried this after removing the case but it was still happening.Because of this reason alone I have given 2 stars, since there's no point of such amazing cameras if you can't use them for more than 5 mins straight!I have raised this issue to OnePlus, following which they replied with lengthy steps to collect logs from my device while it was overheating. So now I feel like I have unwittingly become a beta tester just for buying it early. Hopefully they can fix this with a software update (I believe one good thing about OnePlus is they always listen to their users). If they do I will increase my rating.EDIT: There has been multiple software updates since my last review, and I'm glad to say that the issues have been mostly fixed! It still warms up slightly when using camera, but I guess this is the case with all devices using Snapdragon 888 chip. However, there has not been an incident of the phone blocking me from using camera, so that's great! Currently I'm on OS version 11.2.4.4.I have increased the rating from 2 to 4 :)"
1,It takes 5-8 seconds to display contact names when incoming calls come..... Phone is getting overheated when using over 10 mins constantly.... Bad experience overall. Just missed the last date of return. Might just be the end of oneplus brand name @ Indian market which was created so well & organically. Huge huge disappointment.
1,"Battery consumption is very high..all other one plus phones which I have used..have to charge them every after. 2 days . But the 9pro have to charge twice in a day. Heating problem, company is claiming they have used advanced cooling system but it is not working.."
5,"Phone is fabulous, don't go with YouTube reviews..point that this phone is compared to s21 ultra and iphone 12pro max itseft makes it value for money.Only downside I ubserved after using for 3 days is, it's gets heated up while I shoot videos in 4k 120 fps and 8k 60 fps for more than 4 mins."
1,"I received my Oneplus Pro 9 12Gb/256GB Model at 6 march, guess what Phone is OVERHEATING and showing a message that Phone is Overheated during setup. Also phone is heat during charging. And Battery Drains very fast... Also battery Drains very fast when phone is lock screen state or not using..I am very disappointed buying this.I thought my phone might be defective, then i researched more about this, I found a Forum Thread in Oneplus Website where everyone is complaining of Over Heating issues. You cannot even record a 4k video for 60 sec, phone overheats and stops the recording. Forget 8K recording..

This is not expected from premium phone. fix this Over Heating and Battery Drains issues.VERY MUCH DISSAPOINTED."
1,"Order carefully this phone is heating like hell , when you use this in outdoor then phone is in continuously heating . If you kept it in your pocket then too tou can feel that is phone heating . You have to use it inside the freezer to avoid heating. I have dropped returns request thanks to amazon service"
1,Worst phone to buy. I had OnePlus 7T and I regret I spend my money over this phone. Donot waste your money
1,"Very disappointed as it didn't reach my expectations. Need to charge twice to thrice a day with basic usage. Also it is overheating like hell. Even contacted with OnePlus customer care, they say don't use more apps, off your wifi or bluetooth when not in use. I thought what is the use of purchasing a phone with investing this much amount."
5,"Ordered on 30th March at 23:41 and got it on 1st April at 10:24am, so it was fast enough kudos to Amazon. I was using OnePlus 3T Midnight Black for 4 years now, even though that phone was working without any issues I ordered the 9 pro Pine Green just to upgrade the camera setup. I don't shuffle phones so I went with the top most configuration and I must say I'm fully satisfied with 9 Pro.My suggestion would be to opt for Pine Green color as it looks beautiful in person, you can't judge that color in photos.Camera quality is very good specifically for the wide angle camera as I've used my friend's iphone 12's camera and I liked 9 Pro's wide angle camera as it's much better to that of iPhone's.Adding few photos I shot of the phone. I will update this review after using it for few more days with some photos.Update after using the phone for 11 days (11 Apr 2021):Phone is working very smoothly, no overheating issues in gaming or regular usage. First few days I noticed that it was overheating during camera use under harsh sunlight and stopping camera from shooting photo/videos.But from last update I'm yet to encounter that issue again. Looks like they have fixed it already.Battery life is average...not bad...not good. But works for me for full day use.12 Bit raw file out of this phone's camera is amazing with full of details. Use it to understand it. It is any day better compared to iPhone 12 or 12 pro's camera in term of colour accuracy and details. Not to forget about huge price difference between these phones. At 70k OnePlus 9 Pro is worth every rupee.Update: 26th April 2021After the latest update battery performance is improved. 5 days with this new update 11.2.4.4 and I'm getting 7+ hrs most of the time, sometime 8+ hrs. Adding a screenshot for the same.Over sharpening in the photos taken with cameras now sorted. Photos look beautiful."
5,"Just recieved my oneplus and honestly speaking the colour pops out dominantly. i order the steller black colour n i liked the colour so much ... now talking about performance and all, then this just killed everything. yes it got a bit hot while i was setting this device for me but after i was done n keeping this phone idle it went down on hotness. now i am using it continusly since then n i am experiencing 0 issues....i am in love with this phone...go n buy it if 70k bucks doesn't loose your pocket.I DON'T CARE ANYMORE ABOUT THIS PHONES PROS N CONS coz i wanted this phone after using oneplus 3 for more than 4.5 yrs...i trust oneplus n they will surely solve issues in upcoming updates if there are any....SO HAVE FAITH N GRAB IT....THANK YOU.HAR HAR MAHADEV....🙏"
1,Same thing heating issuePlease don't buy this phoneI just switched on my phone and it started heating up and if you take photos or videos the camera side gets heated up
1,Pathetic phone!!! Goes hot within minutes of regular activities.Initiating return process not worth anyone's hard earned cash.
2,"Final verdict after few months: Its not worth the price, choose differently.One month update: Battery is now much improved after few OS updates and I am changing the rating from 1 to 3. Still my trusted battery app is showing 45% effeciency which is disturbing. The much advertised camera is very average. So not really a flagship killer.OLD REVIEW: I love Oneplus but this time it's been a shock. The most expensive flagship killer is almost dead on arrival. Overheating with normal use. Battery stats are very poor. And phone slows down for no reason. Even home page takes a splt second to load the apps after the background image. It's big and bright and fast but these are basic everyday problems. When first received, battery was being used very fast. After two updates its better but inconsistent, sometimes it's very good and sometimes battery consumption is as fast as its charging speed. Charging speed is fantastic. So beware of spending 69k, think of other options. Oneplus better do something for existing owners or else people will shift to other brands. See battery health is showing 45%. On my 3.5 year old oneplus 5 it shows 83% even now. So something is wrong with the battery management."
1,It has very poor quality camera. I really surprised to see Picture quality of this phone. It is not understood why they hv cheated over camera quality. Not value for money. It is just equivalent to a  Rs 10000 mobile. Battery is also decline very fast. Don't buy. I feel cheated this time.
1,Very very disappointed.camera is very poor.hasselbled partnership failed.dosto mat Lena.money waist ho jyegi.camera k liye toh bilkul mat Lena Bhai.very bad camera in this price range.
1,Heats so much
1,Worst one plus mobile till date. I am a one plus enthusiast since oneplusone launched many years back. But buying this phone is the biggest mistake anyone can do. Battery drains in 12 hours. Over heating happens every now and then restricting the user to click pictures or videos. Phone charges in 30 mins to full but also disappoints when it goes down to 20% in a few hours. Please don't buy this phone unless reviews improve over a period of time. For now I would say that this is the worst flag ship in the market. My current OnePlus phone I have used for 3 years without any issues. Got 2 more to family. But this I am returning immediately.
5,Absolute beast. Apple iPhone can kiss oneplus's a$$
1,I have started using this phone on wednesday evening and on thrusday morning the line in display appers  I need replacement of this phone not repair as it is only some hours used one
3,"Used this for about a week. Everything about this phone is great, except that it has some severe overheating problems. Once this heating problem gets fixed, it will be a totally awesome phone that gives any ultra flagship a run for its money, a great 5/5, but for now I am going to give it a mediocre 3/5 at best.I've reached out to Oneplus for a resolution, maybe they'll fix it over time with software updates (if it's fixable), but its unsure. At the moment, the battery stays in a constant state of overheat, the phone feels hot in my hands even during normal/light use, and when I use the camera (the photos are great by the way) for a few minutes it shuts down the camera due to overheating. So much for Hasselblad marketing when you can't even use the camera, lol. Bad photos > No photos 😅This problem is not unique to me, there is a large number of people facing the same issue with this phone and a lot of chatter on Oneplus forums on the same.I am going to look for a replacement device or get a return if that's not possible."
5,"This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt."
5,"Best camera, very good battery life, eat body material, average weight, best performance,  best display."
1,3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera. In very disappointed  with this kind of front camera. Need refund.
1,"Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom."
1,"The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller."
1,"I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.Face unlock very slow.Heat issue which charging and heavy usageFull charge takes more than 3 hrsWould not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phonego with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality"
1,"Software is no working. No sounds in media, cant attend calls, every 5 mints phone gone to switched off and even though no retraining option."
2,"Phone camera is not good , samsung says it's 64 mega pixel but its photos like 8 megapixels .photo detailing are not good  . Also processor is not Upton the mark it's some time slow and hang in multi function use . While using keyboard , keyboard hide automatically for 1 second . My mobile variant is 6 GB 128 GB. Don't waste your time and money ."
1,"Camera front is worst, not up to the mark. Waste of money. ,"
3,Not a Samsung performance. It seems it was launched without proper test n trials. I already had M30 so decided to buy M31 (6GB). But got shocked to see the poor performance n battery life. The 64MP images can't be sent easily to someone on WhatsApp. Camera give errors now n then. Battery life worst then M30 which has 5000mh. Mobile heats on charging.
5,Mind blowing  camera real monster battery look awesome and fist first launch first hand
1,I purchased this phone by seeing 64 MP for camera usage but M31 was the worst phone with camera quality.. Front camera is 8 and back camera was 16 MP not more that that.. there is no return option only replacement(Good game was playing by samsung &Amazon) please dont buy this mobile and dont waste your money... Heating problem while charging.. etc  i am really  very frustrated with this phone quality.. i lost my money by buying this phone..😔😔😪
5,"1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍"
4,"HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks."
1,"Not satisfied with the qualityDisplay quality is no adequateBody is made of plastic like materialI was using MI like 6 plus pro then 7 plus proFor a change I have purchased this product, the quality is not up to the mark when comparing to my old redmi note seriesThe sound quality is very worst.While making call with full volume it is not clear from the day of purchase.I am planning to go back to MI againWorst phone pls don't buyNot value for money"
1,Phone is very slow my opinion is west ur money
1,Average
1,"I purchased this as soon as it was launched and its one of the worst decision that i made. Selfie camera is blurry and clicks yellow pictures, phone lags in playback video, all of a sudden, video will disappear and only sound continues to play, back camera isn't that great as hyped, its very low in quality, body of the phone is more like a plastic and very low quality material, overall very dis-satisfied with the product. Amazon has agreed post diagnosis saying its a faulty piece  but does not give refund"
1,One of worst mobile and one of the worst brand. Better to purchase any other brand except Samsung.1. Heating issue2. Second sim works on 3g.3. Even its 6Gb ram works like 2gb ram phone.When I called amazon customer care they said I have to go to service center for this and they are telling to check through app.Its a f***ing phone please please please don't waste your money.And this is my last ever purchase from amazon.
2,"Cons:Button position (power& volume) too highFingerprint reader too highHeats up a lot.Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours & 28 minutesSpeaker volume low.The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls.Pros:Feels lightweightNice display.The camera is decent.Update 1:Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer.Update 2:Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement.Update 3:Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality. I have to put the call on 100% volume to be able to hear at least a bit."

1,"I bought this mobile in last Friday , it is not working from 6th day.  Unable to receive calls and if unexpectedly I received a call not getting  sound and I can't here the opposite person voice or my voice to them. When I try to call someone automatically network is getting disconnected and it's reconnecting automatically in few minutes. I expect this might be  software issue , I have gone through lot of reviews ,maximum number of people who buyed this mobile facing this issue.Unable to replace the mobile also as it is not showing any option to me."
1,"Worst mobile was I got , Samsung m31 taking more time for charging 100% , it's almost 4 hours for charging , and after that 20 hours battery I'll train 0% its waste of time compare to other fast charging mobile , and camera worst"
2,"I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed!I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung!I so miss my POCOFirst the pros1. The brand name - if you think it is one!2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos4. Build - seems decentCons:1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates meAnyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me nowWhat a waste of Money this has been"
5,Received it on time within 24 hours thumps up to amazon. Now Product. Done all the settings. I am using samsung after a long gap of 8-10 years. After Samsung Grand I had stopped using. So setting done now data transfer Samsung's smart switch option is fantastic. Everything I wanted to transfer got it. No problem at all .Now SIM transferred. Done OK it is dual 4G VOLTE and above all it is having separate slot for micro sd card. Effortless working.Now Camera. It has got lot of options. All I have not yet tried but for sure I have checked the quality of the photograph and the night mode is superb. What else you want to know rest of the things are written in detail and is true. Working very fine. Proud to won it. Nice Product. Samsung should keep competing iPhone
1,"What is this samsung,i didn't expect from you.plastic body is ok we can use cover.Corning gorella glass 3 is ok we can use tempered protection.Even 3 hr charging time is ok we can charge during night.But Overheating how can we deal with them !this price range other companies providing super fast , cool processor like snapdragon 730G.& What you do fooling customers."
5,Nice phone in this price range
2,"Cons:1. RAM. Claims to be 6GB, whereas my 2year old phone with 4GB RAM has much smoother display2. Battery Charging. Claims 15W fast charging. Takes more than 2 hours to charge the phone.Pros:1. Good cameras2. Perfect screen sizeI bought it as a great deal from Samsung, but it is a BIG dissappointment. And they say it cannot be returned. Total waste of money for me. Redmi Note pro 8 is much better than this at same price."
2,"1) claims 21 hour of internet usage timing, i started using it after 100charged  but it barely last for 24 hour with 5 hour of heavy usage and even turned mobile in bettery saving mode.  so what is the point of carry that much heavy 191gm device all around.2) phone heats a lot while its charging ,like you can't even touch it at some point.3)internet bandwith speed in mobile as well as in wifi is not good. i had a samsung galaxy note3 where i get fast internet with same network. wanted to return this device but they had a very strict policy so you cannot return, you can only replace it.  even i am trying it for replacement it wont let me as i have to download balencco app and this app never say your phone is not working fine. i could have spend my money in buying other phone.bought on very first minute of release but al excitment turned down after seeing actual performance."
1,"i am a Big fan of Samsung products, but today i got a dead phone, first i thought it don't have charging so try to charge the phone but no response,i am really really disappointed today. but thanks to amazon the responded quickly and ordered a replacement. but now i am worried about phone performance now. how i am going to handle if future same problem arises. before buy think again."
1,"Worst experience ever, camera quality not better 5out of 2, battery down very fast, max 3 hours taken charging 100% ,sometime WhatsApp hangups.108 gp free storage but mobile heating high, fingerprints only 3 finger available,  not better fingerprints,  I am the first buyer before launching. Over all don't buy this m 31. No extra protection, no additional option,  very simple mobile,not worthiness of money,"
1,"First time met very bad experience from Samsung phone, camera quality is very poor. Front facing camera not good at all. Not comfortable with 6000mahbattery life.Amazon.india  just destroyed their Goodwill by selling this product.I purchased this phone for my friend. And now he is angry on me....Dear customer please avoid to buy this product."
1,Very poor performance.. camera is ok not bad . But very slow net speed .. opening app time is relatively fast but after internet is very slow .... my old mobile Samsung on max is much faster performance for loading web page than Samsung m31 .. this phone taking much more time to open any web site ... remaining everything is ok ..Fast changing is not far like they said .. 30 mins charging it charging 20% but my old Samsung is 30% charged at same time . I have found this two major drawback.
4,I ordered in first sale after comparing all the phones at this range and i am satisfied with this phone but want to discuss some pros and consPros:1. Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also.2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️)3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex
5,"Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device. You can always drop them on the comment)"
1,"Dear Amazon Team,I have been delivered faulty product from UP. It is just 15 days from buying the product and it was showing hang issue. and now this phone is dead and restart itself. No customer care is replying. Very poor service. Need replacement of the phone immediately."
5,"Delivery was fast, packing was good, phone started quite unusual that applications were not even downloading on wifi, later after a couple of restarts it's good now. So thumps up , happy so far ."
3,It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display & mammoth battery.Pros :1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself )2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.3. SAR rating - lowest one4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )Cons :1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet )2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great3. Not so great processorWho can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery & Samsung branding.
3,"I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.Pros:1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.Cons:1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better."
5,"The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screenIf you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colorsI am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos. I am hoping battery performance wl improve in few daysCamera pictures are goodLots of bloatware come with Samsung so had to uninstall/ disable them manually"
2,Hanging sometime
4,First i need to thanks Amazon to deliver me the product with a very safety process. Overally its a very well defined product with a good speakers and amoled display providing a 60hz of refresh rate.There is not much difference between note 10 pro max and note 10s.
3,"All is well but photo quality is very bad. Note 7,9 series is better than note 10s. It's camera need to work on it. It is not capture the details of the photo like previous model of redmi. 48mp camera of Redmi note 9 is very very good than 64mp camera of Redmi note 10s"
1,Worst Phone I have seen specs amd buyed it but not satisfied I have samsung m21 mobile which has amoled screen and always on display same they mentioned in this Redmi Note 10s but display clarity is worst than LCD and always on display stays only for 10 sec  .Worst Camera Performnace wise ok Didnt liked this phone and dont trap for technical gimmiks.
1,Camera quality is very Poor and Display it was saying that Super AMOLED display but it was not worth for it
5,"After using it for a week,The build and design quality of the product is perfectly fine (5/5)Battery is having no issue even after playing games for 5-6 hours (4.5/5)UI experience is amazing (5/5)Camera quality is superb and beyond the expectations (5/5)Refresh rate is reasonably good at this price range (4/5)Overall 4.5/5 and you can consider this phone in this budget. I am happy to have this!"
5,"It's simply superb don't trust any other comments do trust my comment and its genuine comment ,in this price it's best best phone I ever seen"
1,"This is the worst phone from Amazon  and redmi 15000 waste no camera quality, too much heat, it is not amoled screen total waste"
4,1. While playing free fire the phone is getting heated but you can play smoothly in ultra high res and high fps mode2. Slow charge (not according to 33 watt just like 22.5 watt charging)4. Very poor performance according to this price range because of miui12.5 I'd not optimised5. Camera is just OK super night mode is worst and there is no detailing in ultra wide angle and 2x zoom6. In full volume the phone is getting vibrated7. 64 mp mode is stunning.There is no detailing in ultra wide angle mode.Macro mode is just OK.The camera is descent not too bad not too good8. Miui 12.5 is worstWhile opening and closing apps there is extra animation9. 3 GB of ram is occupied out of 6GB and there is not actually 64 GB of storage there is only 52 GB of storageThe security app of this phone takes permissions like sms call contacts but not camera and microphoneAnd the settings takes camera permission10. At last but not the least the phone is just OK but it could have been at the price of 14000 not 15000 of its base varient
1,Don't buy. First ever Redmi product and it's disappointing. Screen doesn't light up when someone calls. (Check attached picture).Fingerprint scanner takes ages and many attempts to respond.Front camera is one of the worst that I have seen in recent times.I don't understand how come such a big company can release a product without proper R&D.
1,"I ordered this phone, Redmi note 10s has network signal problem. the voice will break always. I contacted the customer support, i had bought this using 10% off. they are not replacing the phone and asking me to order the phone which is at higher price now. they are saying you can give the review whereever you want. they dont even care about the customer. dont order this product. its waste of money"
1,"First time i bought redmi after using oneplus. Looking wise it's good but Full of network issues  basic phone is better than this and camera and video quality was damn poor, never expected such quality 😞 even watching videos in youtube also terrible experience"
3,Google Play store not working. Took one whole day for all the apps and info to be downloaded and finally had to do it through GET APPS option of MI phone. Had to transfer data thru MI MOVER.FABULOUS camera.
1,"Bad choice , camera not good youtube videos play like kids toy videos very disappointed"
5,"The phone is overall very impressive. After my first few days of basic usage, I can that it is smooth and fast with no lag. The camera is impressive in this price range. The UI is also nice and easy to use. Battery is good but not amazing. The sleek and lightweight build adds on to the value. On the whole I would say Redmi Note 10S is worth the penny.Review is based on first week of usage only."
5,"Very impressed with when using this Mobile no Heating issue . Amazing experience with playing free fire . Brightness levels also good using in sunlight. Camera quality natural colour. Soft touch. Redmi mobile all in one for gamer good processer , for selfie lover good camera ,and for daily use good battery backup.#pyara_note10s"
5,"I bought for my younger brother and he was so happy.. Battery backup was awsome charging was fast and display is crisp and clear although there is super amoled so have no complaint about display,Camera was not superb but it's above average in this price segment. Overall value for money phone..#NOTE10s"
3,"Really amazing product with great hardware delievered by redmi, but in the three days since purchased i have encountered few problems that are software ended.The clipboard does not work sometimes and won't let you copy paste.The icons in the notification tray are very buggy, it won't work sometimes and if it does it won't let you Toggle it off like power saving mode.Its impossible to uninstall apps from home screen and need to do from settings only.Some icon animations stutter very badly.The low light camera performance is terrible, images turn out very grainyThe double tap home screen to lock does not workVolume control is bad, on YouTube i have to max out volume to hear anything properlyThese are the problems I've noticed, hope xiaomi will patch it with an update"
2,"Loved this phone a lot but from the day one it has some issues1) poor voice quality2) little bit of heating3) bluetooth device not connectingI don't find any lag. Camera was good, display was good, sound was fantastic.Anyhow I returned the phone. Had some Hassel with Amazon during the return schedule but amazon resolved it smoothly.No point in blaming amazon if you purchase this phone and found some issues. Redmi has to release the update to fix these issues."
5,"Yes, this is the top model of Redmi."
5,Value for money
1,"Phone is getting ""HANG"" 😡😡 for everyone 2 to 3 days I am supposed to Reboot the phone because of this Hanging problem, you can get another nice phone in this price segment 😡😡😠😠😠"
1,No any front light (indicator) for charging miss call or massage battery life not good medium use one day life back side is  vary slippy display is ok ok
5,Experience is going through. Almost good 😊
4,Using for 2 days.. No negative review till now.. Best display and camera.Unable to uninstall some apps...1 day charge backup for contious useAwesome class phone from redmiNo lag
4,"It is an initial review after using for just 6 days.Pros : sAmoled Display is bright and vibrant, UI is good obviously with bloatwares, RAM optimisation is fine.Battery is great. Phone is slim and lightweight. Camera does work nice in natural light. Gaming is enjoyable.Cons : Selfie cam over exposes. Night mode isn't upto the mark. Softaware update may fix it.Dual Speakers are hi-res but isn't loud enough. Processor does the task but keep in mind that it isn't battery efficient.Overall it's a decent phone at this price range."
5,"Camera and display performace is superb of this #NOTE10s, Apart from it, i really likes it processer performance, no hanging and heating issues, go for it👍"
1,Call quality is not good..Some time call drops..Worst
1,Very poor software experience .display shows double image as in video.call audio is very poor like cheap hardware..I will never buy redmi phones
2,Battery backup is not good. When i use my phone battery percent will decrease very fast than normal. 5-6 minutes of use lead to decrease 1 % of battery parameter. But one thing is when you keep your phone idle battery will decrease normally and backup will be very good if you keep your idle.Review for remaining.1 speed is good.2 when you play game device will be heat.3 camera is good.4. Build quality is good.5 Hd display6. No screen guard was available with phone.When i started to write this review. I had 46 % battery but when i am completing this line i have 45 % now you can estimate With this line....
1,Worst Phone it is getting strucked Continuously and Battery was heating up
5,Awesome mobile within budgetCamera is best than other models in same price rangeThe display quality vis 5/5The sound is also goodFront camera is nice#NOTE10s
5,Very good phone in this range killers miler phone no compitier in range relame lol against note 10s  l'll give uh
4,Back frosted glass Looks and Spec wise phone is great. Actual Product is ok at the price. Display is a bit on darker side looks slight greyish. I also have used  an samsung m21 and m31 and would say samsung scores heavily with display quality of similat specs. Afterall display is what we all see and use through and the difference is clearly visible. Will prefer and recommend to blindly go for samsung. Overall Redmi disappoints this time.
5,"After using it for a week,The build and design quality of the product is perfectly fine (5/5)Battery is having no issue even after playing games for 5-6 hours (4.5/5)UI experience is amazing (5/5)Camera quality is superb and beyond the expectations (5/5)Refresh rate is great at this price range (5/5)Overall 5/5 and you can consider this phone in this budget. I am happy to have this!"
3,"Mobile is not recommended for heavy gaming. For general usage like calling, browsing and any normal usage it's good but call speaker is below average, camera clarity is just average, operating signal receiving is very poor. I recommend to go for redmi note 10 or note 10 pro rather then note 10s."
2,"As compare to MI MAX2, AM DISSATISFIED 😒 with features and as recording on other person who is on call know that call is reacording and others problems is also like you have to entered proper name to display your contact...Battry Backup capability is low not good."
5,after snapping 10photos with mobile cam geeting message like your phone getting heating automactiaclly closed
5,#note10s#note10slub#pyara_note10sphone is best under this price range super emoled display best processer slim design love the phone
2,Network and wiFi connectivity is poor
4,Okk I am writing a review after using one day ..I gifted this mobile to my mother and she liked a lot ..First of all I let you know this is an updated version of Eluga I7..as you can check on the pictures posted by me ..it's Eluga I7 Enterprise Edition..And this is updated to Android 9.0 pie..Whereas the Normal Version is only Android 7 version( which is available on Flipkart).This mobile does not have tray SIM slot..rather you can open the back cover and easily insert both the SIM and Memory card..and  has Non Hybrid Sim Slots..But point to note here is SIM 1 is Micro and SIM 2 Nano ..Camera quality is gud not so gorgeous with 8MP for both Front and Back ..with Flash Led lights on both sides..you can't expect more in this price range .The best thing is it's Battery Back up of 4000 MAH..Videos run smooth you tube and all.You can increase the Storage space .. accordingly.Doesn't support quick charging so it takes time for charging but the battery backup is worth .My Verdict would be if you are getting so many features fr a price of 6499 ..it's worth buying ..A thumbs up from me.👍👍👍
2,Phone Hangs even during playing YouTube. Hangs even during using camera. Update worsen the situation.Finger Touch unlock is not working after one month.
4,good
1,"Had purchased an older model of Panasonic Eluga a couple of years ago for a family member. Still working well. Based on that experience I purchased this newer model i7, but it was such a big disappointment. Phone was excruciatingly slow, photos were grainy and many more issues. Didn't expect such low quality from a well known brand. Fortunately I was able to return it."
1,After using three days  mobile getting haggedAnd getting switch off automatically.Charging was 80%  while on call switched off automatically when power on it shows battery charging 20 %
3,Phone has a awesome look and very handy best for senior citizen. Ok i write this review after 1 days as they are lying at so many things1.st the phone doesn't even support 32 gb of memory card and they have written 256 gb expandable2. And it can support a 2 or 4 gb memory card but if u use them u can only keep them in 1st sim as the 2nd sim is nano sim and u can't be able to use jio sim if we use memory cardSo there u will have only one thing to choose 4g or a memory cardSo very disappointingU should not lie to customerOverall the device is good just it don't support memory is bad :-(:-(
1,I have purchased this mobile first time on 21 August then it was working fine but then i have gifted to someone else then i have purchased this for myself now i have got the product whose earphone it not working and what was disappointing more was its microphone its not working in whatsapp n duo's vedio calls. So i am returning this item.. but this is the first time Amazon disappointed me...n when i was opening its cover it has 2 seals i didn't get the logic behind this at that time but not i got to know that k why it has 2 seal in its box
2,"I gifted this phone for my mom. This phone is suitable for senior people, if u r looking for gaming or multi-tasking, it's no use.What I liked:1. It's a complete package, you get charger, backcase, screen protector and earphones.2. Android 9 with decent battery backup.3. I got it for ₹6180 so worth money.I disliked:1. Phone is very laggy and apps crashes.2. Touch screen works slow. Even while receiving calls, if u swipe up to answer, it won't respond.3. Thanks to cheap quality earphones.4. Overall I'm really frustrated by this phone, never gonna buy any panasonic brand from now."
1,Phone is not working
5,"First of all this is the best value for money . For 5000rs I got decent smartphone, good headphones, cover, screen guard. The phone is having reasonably fast response (maybe not the best in class but decent).  I have installed about 20 apps like whatsapp, gpay, paytm, adobe reader, facebook, gaana etc and I didnot face any hanging issues, no battry heatings even after prolonged use. The battery itself last for 2 days of intense use. Cant ask more for the money. It maynot handle games but for the rest you cannot beat this. All the criticism here is from the chinese chamchas. Made in india for me always over some cheap chinese crap."
3,"The phone is an alternative to chinese companies flooding the market. Display is very dull, fingerprint sensor at times doesnt work, but not a deal breaker, can live with it. Low quality screen guard already stuck when delivered makes the display worse. There was an extra screen guard, wondering if I got a returned product, box seemed sealed and all though.Apart from that, its a good VFM (< ₹7000) phone with a lot of features some of its competitors dont have. Its a functional smartphone without the unnecessary apps (data stealing ones) which comes loaded with other phones. Battery backup is good. Overall good for a senior citizen or users who dont waste their lives staring at cellphone screens and use it for communicating and a bit of internet usage."
4,"Fair product at this price. But disappointed me for rough performance. It's processor is quite slow and have a worst camera, specially the front camera. It's display brightness is just fair. Fingerprint sensor is good. It can be buyed for general usage like phone calls, social media and light games. Overall a good product"
1,I buyed on dateb06.11.20 .It has hanging for past 2 day from date 17.11.20 it has severe problem the touch not working properly due to hanging problem  pls find video .IPanasonic authorised service centre in trichy they servised and update software on 18.11.20 but same problem occurs on after 2 hours.I request panasonic company to replace at new one since I mainly purchased for my kid online classes since it is a budgetary phone. I used at only two day only but made problem  iam going to service mobile on chennai service centre.
1,Worst phone phone is hanging form the first day phone is so slow not working from the first  first impressions id very bad dont buy this phone it is not value for money and phone is also not returning  amazon this is not aspected from you
5,"For 5k ...you can get more. ANDROID 9 , finger print scanner, stock Android no advert like MI. Dual Sim, expandable storage,and decent 8mp camera,4000ma battery ..smaller screen for easy use for elderly people"
3,"It is the enterprise version I bought on 14 aug ,2020 for my father. After using the phone I think the phone is bit slower. This phone is not recommended for young generation. The click response time is bit slow. When I was first time setting up the phone and it was updating all the apps and the system update was running at the same time, the phone was very slow. But after all updation done it is working fine . If you want to buy it for parent or any old person with basic smartphone feature then go for it. This is a better phone than other phone brands available in this price range."
1,This is the worst possible phone. First of all it is not Eluga I7 it is Eluga I7 ENTERPISE EDITION and that makes all the trouble. Since it is the so called Enterprise Edition you don't get and accessories which fits this useless phone. Neither a good screen guard nor a proper flip cover. Lot of issues cloning data from another phone. In all a horrible experience with this phone. This is even before I actually start using the phone. Fingers crossed hoping I don't meet with any more troubles. But don't reccomend this phone to anyone.
1,I really dislikeWithin 2 days phone stop workingVideo call not workingPhone switch off again n againI was fool to buy thisPls aware of this fake product
1,very worst product i never seen .since during video call we are not able to hear anything.......(no audio)very worst product i never seen .since during video call we are not able to hear anythingvery worst product i never seen .since during video call we are not able to hear anythingvery worst product i never seen .since during video call we are not able to hear anythingvery worst product i never seen .since during video call we are not able to hear anythingvery worst product i never seen .since during video call we are not able to hear anythingvery worst product i never seen .since during video call we are not able to hear anythingvery worst product i never seen .since during video call we are not able to hear anythingvery worst product i never seen .since during video call we are not able to hear anythingvery worst product i never seen .since during video call we are not able to hear anythingvery worst product i never seen .since during video call we are not able to hear anythingvery worst product i never seen .since during video call we are not able to hear anythingvery worst product i never seen .since during video call we are not able to hear anythingvery worst product i never seen .since during video call we are not able to hear anythingvery worst product i never seen .since during video call we are not able to hear anything
4,"Value for money. It's hard to get branded phone with good specifications for this price. Build quality is good. Specifications are good. Display is vivid & touch responsiveness is good. Camera is not great, but not bad either. It's OK. Speaker volume is a bit low. I like that Panasonic sends a complete package including back cover, screen protector and headphones along with phone and charger."
1,Worst experience iwant to give 0stars 1) hanging problem 2) heating problem3)some times finger print stops workingI have called to customer Amazon customer care told the problem he said their is no replacement and he will the technician he will the problem and he will replace it but till now there is no technician came.dont buy go for any other
5,"Almost everything is fine. At times becomes slow when mulitasking is done. Else perfect for average use. I generally use for my official works like checking mails, whatsapp messages and attending online meetings in zoom, Google meet, microsoft teams, etc. Camera good type. Battery is also good as I get almost 36 hrs retention for average use. Charges fully within 150 minutes nearly. Provided with screen guard and back cover. Nice mobile for average users as I bought it for ₹6500."
4,"I recently bought this for my father.Pros: 4000mAh battery under 6.5KNon Chinese companyBest Mobile under 6500Cons:Bad rear camera,Apps automatically exiting, ie, performance lags,Therefore I returned this mobile. I got my refund. For better mobile you have to spend 1 to 2k more. Please don't buy any Chinese brand u can go for Asus, samsung..."
2,"Phone has good looks, sufficient specs but works very slow and somewhat equivalent to 512 mb ram old phone, after touching any icon when no app running in background takes 3 seconds min to respond. And this is after updating it to latest. Customer care not responded to email even after asking for any update which can solve this problem. Quality that has been delivered was not expected from brand like panansonic."
3,"कैमरा 8mp का बिल्कुल नहीं है ,कंपास भी नहीं है कंपनी ने झूठ बोला है कि कंपास इनबिल्ट है।प्रोसेसर भी sam on5 , sam j2 से भी स्लो है। मैं अपने पुराने sam on 7 pro व sam on5 से ही खुश हूं।कोई मतलब नहीं है अपने 5000 रुपये बर्बाद करने में ,samsung बहुत बढ़िया विकल्प है इस फोन का ।"
1,Waste of money and time don’t buy itThey said it’s 2gb phone but the speed is like 512mb bony but itI called the customer service and explained the problem hey sent a technician and he said the problem is solved but the problem continues and for the second time I called for the customer cate and explained the issue iam facing now they arranged other technician he didn’t came to me and closed the call I just called the customer care they asked me install an app in the phone and check the phone by hearing this word I took a decision to leave the phoneI lost my money and timeThe customer care service is waste Amazon is waste it sells defective phoneSo don’t buy in amazon
5,I would really like this product.  I gifted it to my mom and she likes too. She don’t have to play any gaming so this is best and cheap product. For YouTube surfing it’s best.So I will give 5**** to this.
1,"This product was not up to the expectations. As it was new product but I faced so many problems like-1- Phone was hanging2- Sound quality was not good.3- Not getting proper voice during voice call.4- Battery was draining so fast.5- I believe there was no speaker inside, only micro phone was available.6- When I received my phone, battery was in deep drainage condition. It took too much time for restart the phone.7- Touch sensor was also not good in same price compare to different brands.8- Ear Phone material quality was also not good."
3,Camera is not good. This phone is not a new era phone. Phone function make this phone is old era phone. No sim tray available in phone. One sim is nano sim and other is Micro sim. No place to insert SD Card. Back camera works like a 2MP camera. Picture quality is very bed. Not a good phone. Phone voice is not loud.  This is only basic phone. In this budget can be buy a good phone.
1,"Not a good product. I feel Volume control button is at wrong place. Due to which when we receive call if our finger touches it ring volume will go to mute. Screen hangs often. Unlocking won't happen. We need to press power button three or four times to get response. Charging port was very tight, because of this it got broken slightly  within a week. Charging has become an issue. Service centers are only two in big city like Bengaluru. Imagine about other places. Very bad product by a great company.  They have failed to deliver a product with minimum qualities."
1,"There are multiple issues with this product. Earphone jack is not good leading to issues with volume control.Display is not good - Flickering issueCharging is too slow; Even after charging for more than 4 hours, it charged by only 50 percentOpted to return the product, but there is no response even after 4 days.Specs look good, but, the overall product didn't live up to the expectations."
1,Touchscreen doesn't response as required.Fingerprint reader is quite good but the value for money is badI recommended you to not buy this product
5,In terms of everything (each and every aspect mentioned in its description and features in Amazon page) it is a highly beneficial product for Students in need of a smartphone.
1,Worst experience phone is slow touch screen not working properly..Trying to replace but amazon not giving any response only auto generated msgs...Dont buy this phone and disappointed  with amazon first tym aftr shopping from past 4 yrs..
1,"It's just 2 month old phone. This phone has issues of overheating. I was using it for online video calling and meeting on Google meet. After overheating it hangs or either turn off. Some times I have also seen lines on screen. Issues are, ""hanging and overheating"". My phone is in warranty period of 1 year can anyone help me to exchange. Plz buy this phone by checking policy of exchange otherwise your situation will be like me. Thank you."
2,"It’s very very slow, gets heat up soon, major problem I faced was it was system software update, and inspite of updating it was showing again and again update and to reboot, dailyI got fed up with speed and screen problem that if u open one app it’s suddenly goes off screen and comes to home pageI used it for 10 days and sold it in exchange of Samsung galaxy M01"
4,"This mobile is good for senior citizens who don't have to use mobile much...this is good for calls, chatting, paytm, apps that don't require much space. While charging, there is a green light which is helpful for them as sometimes it is hard to understand the mobile is getting charged or not. To put the sim card there is no need of sim ejector as the back panel can be removed"
1,Worst product I have seen ever in my life. such a worst product and worst service from the Amazon too. I have never expected such a service from Amazon. Hereafter I have to think twice to buy any mobiles in online especially in Amazon. Mobile is hanging not able to reboot. Suddenly opens in  operating system like in computer like MS-DOS. Now they're saying u can't return the product.  Very very worst by Amazon & seller.
5,Excellent phone .Good display and battery life.comes with protection cover and good quality earphones is iceing on cake.By ByChinese phones.
2,The phone I recieved was having bad screen quality and battery was given 4000mph bt it behaves as 1000mph .. phone was overheating after 1hr..as if 2/3rd hand mobile... installation of apps becoming damn slow or stuck... a bit difficult for those who use more apps or play in it... just a basic mobile for calls and text msgs like wtsp and cam ...that’s it... don’t buy mobile who use phone much
1,Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
4,If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
1,Camera quality is not good. It is mentioned as 13mp but the motion of the camera is like 2mp. Phone is very slow in operation even though it is 3gb RAM . More over it is MADE IN CHINA.
5,"Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."
5,"If I started to rating it's all features, it will as followed (Out of 5 🌟):Processor ⭐⭐⭐⭐Display ⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐Battery ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Sound in loud ⭐⭐⭐Sound in 3.5 mm cord ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Camera Selfie ⭐⭐⭐Camera Back ⭐⭐⭐⭐Networking ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Lack:There is no Fingers print sensor locked.There is no Back cover in the box.Camera quality not so good."
4,"I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
1,Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!
3,"Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other"
5,Worst phone.. overall performance is just bakwaz....don't buy...always hangs
3,"COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"
1,"Compass is not working, showing error as required sensor are not available,And everything is fine."
1,"Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. 😞. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone 📱, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% 😀. The phone is too lightweight ☺️ and very handy😄 Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. 😃.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. 😭GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. 😠😠.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. 😥. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good 👍But it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. 😠Display quality is too poor. 😫 Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. 🥺  No led in front of the display.😰Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection 😥If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or above🤗 with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy."
5,Cheap & Best phone in this range
3,Made in China product
1,Made in china...The country of origin should be mentioned in the description...Returning the Chinese crap
1,1. Very bad quality mobile2. Poor display quality(looks very cheap)3. Sound is very low4. Cmaera is like 2mp camera5. Performance is very slow(lag while using phone)6. Will get better mobiles with this price.7. Think 100 times before wasting your money on crap8. No pros at all
1,Redmi 9A launched useless phone everTotally waste moneySo please not buying this phone
3,REALME batter than redmi now
5,"1. Display is excellent. Colors and sharpness is good.2. Descent cameras according to price.3. In hand feel of phone is good. It's slim and despite 5000 Mah battery, it feels light.4. Battery backup is good. Easily last one day.5. Performance is good according to price. Mediatek G25 does it job well. You can play COD and FREE FIRE easily at low settings.6. Speaker loudness is average but quality is good.7. MIUI 12 experience is amazing. No ads and reduced bloatware."
5,Awesome product at low price.Compatible productFast and best batteryLess time more battery chargeAnd does not drain battery.Amazing product
4,"Advantage :3GB+32 For Rs. 7498/-With 6.5 Inch & 5000 mah Battery Acceptable.Disadvantage :*No Finger Print Sensor*Front Camera is 5 MP Only, if it's 8 MP & Rear Side 13+5 MP means little acceptable.Over all Ok."
3,No finger print....there is vast color difference in picture & actual . there is no matching in SEA BLUE color. piece received with DARK Blue colorotherwise good gadget at this price.
4,Quite goodBattery and build quality is betterBut camera and speakers are okok.
5,Screen is big and crisp battery backup is great. You can find lag here and there but manageable don't expect gaming in this phone. Camera is below average. All together phone feels premium in look with below average performance. If tou are planning to buy in this budget no phone will beat this phone.
5,"Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
3,Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
5,It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
5,"Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"
2,Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
3,"This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked priceMi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.Need Improvement.Processor is best for browsering , social networkingThis processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.Battery capacity is awesome ♥️ no need to say. brightness level is good and it also handle with sun. Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses"
3,Weary good product  very fast delivery
3,"Points to be noted:👉 The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.👉 This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.👉 Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.👉 Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.👉 After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone."
5,"Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best. Display is huge(20:9).Camera is above par.Performance is good.Overall best package.5/5 for Rs.6800."
5,Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
2,Phone is good. But it is made in China
5,Wow
1,"I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available. You can replace only. So, please don't buy this worst product. Even for first time im facing that amazon support also not supporting in this issue. I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon."
4,"Good mobile,in this corona times if we want quality product for basic regular usage,this Redmi 9a 3 gb /32 bestCamera is average like all entry-level mobiles,Redmi might send an update for small big fixes like every new mobile launch,gcam till now not available,with that quality of camera increasesDesign display very good,slim tall mobileBattery very good,takes 2.5 hours for full charge,so better charge when 40 % battery left.People who are planning to buy 4 gb /64 gb Redmi 9a,don't take it ,best to go for Redmi 9 as we get finger print scanner, slightly better speed,camera and build quality for just 700rs moreSpeed of Redmi 9a is good for 3- 4 appsCons:No gorilla glass protectionNo Secondary noise cancelling mic,this is big mistake by redmi as they give in every mobileNo Finger print scannerFinally under 10,000 rs all Redmi 9 series mobiles are very best as they provide 4 gb ram variant in very price segment,only option we have"
2,Worst camera ever...both front & back... & Screen resolution is not good.
4,"So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5⭐ for thatPros-•Low price, wont get any other phones in this range• Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.•Good for basic usage.•Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:•camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)•Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use⭐"
3,"For your low budget, simple mobile but i recommend you to invest 2k or 3k more and buy a better mobile."
5,Overall nice phone for people who need a basic smartphone experience.Use nova launcher for better UI. Default launcher is not that much good.I'm happy with the purchase..!!!
5,Very satisfactory with the features under 7K and happy with the quick delivery in lockdown time ny amazon.budget friendly phone.
2,There  is a bulge in white cover area and back cover shaped like a lump got opened when trying to use mobile. Also volume buttons and power on off button did not function. I am it as a manufacturer defect. Please consider replacement.
1,"I had purchased this phone for my dad , and as he is not that tech guy so i thought not to purchase a high range phone instead of that to buy a simple economic smartphone, however once my dad received the product , He was not happy at all and he mentioned to me that he feels that this phone is to complicated for him and so his old phone is much better, so it's a terrible feeling as when gift someone something and he/,she doesn't like it then it's simply a wastage of money"
3,Price of Rs 6500 is not justified. Display is very poor. Only Stock android apps. No dedicated apps for music or file manager etc. But you can use google play music and google files for that.Phone is narrower than redmi phones in similar price bracket.The only reason I bought this phone is the unavailability of other well known brands on Amazon in this price range. Jusk ok phone.
5,"Pros-Price, stock android, battery backup, fluid ui, no 3rd part app, easy to use, android pie9, more space on rom, small form factor for a 5.5inch display device,made in india, non-chines phone, runs smoothly.Cons-Display quality is ok ok but could be a bit better, processor runs smoothly but could be a bit better, loud speaker sound is ok ok but not so sweet.Overall in my opinion the phone is value for money. It is very useful for elder persons who don't have much knowledge about technology. It is also small sized fits in hand and can be operated by one hand easily. It also give protective transparent back cover and screen protective film with it."
2,"Got screen protector headset,back coverBut the performance of the phone is not good enoughReally slow,for a company like Panasonic it's a shame"
1,"Panasonic Eluga I6 is a very bad phone. It was purchased in June 2020 and had stopped working in only 3 months time. Service Centres in a big city like Kolkata are on the fringes, 20-30 kms. away from city centre. Very Bad experience with this phone. My recommendation - Do not buy."
4,Not a phone for high end users....the best thing about this phone is that it will offer you all the necessary features of a smartphone without the bloatware crap...Camera is pretty basic....and needs good lighting....do not install lots of apps....will slow down ram...sound quality is good...quite strong also...will survive 1-2ft fall easily..battery lasts over 13-14 hrs after full charge....for this price it a very good phone...
5,Best phone in the budget specially for the online classes and it also has dual 4g there is a screen guard already installed in the phone and the battery stand by is just amazing if the charging is 100 in night the battery is 99 or 98% in morning it's amazing and we can play games to but not pubg it also comes with a back cover and a earphones the phone is the best in this range of price
1,This mobile have many problem s & seems to be total waste of money. Received on 10th Jun & after 10 days auto rotate not working. Today automatically switched off and not working. really fed up with the quality.Need complete replacement for the same.
1,"Both the mobile  is having  problems  like camera,  speak  call and video  call voice  is not clearly  heard  , so pls let  me know  how to complain  now"
4,"This product is very wonderful for the people who want a basic smartphone with most of the features. It can be used for taking very nice selfies in dim light. However, its rear camera gives out photos which are very bright, but it is satisfactory. It has a very good receiver speaker. It also gets charged just in 100 to 130 minutes. Just one thing is not good that the adapter gets heated quickly. If we compare this smartphone with non- Chinese smartphones, then I advice you to buy this smartphone."
2,Arrived today and checked volume too low
1,"Very bad,Mic doesn't work in what's video call.Returned 1st order and placed 2nd order, same problem"
5,Good
4,"As usual Amazon deliverd late.Don't know if a prime member get a product so lately,what happens to non Prime membersPhoneRemembering the price the phone's display is ok,but brightness is low.speaker is good.you have to download high bit rate songs.easy in hands.3000 mah battery runs for a day.this phone is meant for old.so they are not heavy user to be kept in mind.cameravis really bad.8mp camera works like vga. Front camera is not usable.overall only for normal use.some fb,wa,vcall. Thats it."
1,It's too thick and heavy weight. Phone was getting hanged on the very first day of use. Worst battery backup. Totally disappointed ☹️. Wouldn't suggest you to go for it.on charging it started heating up. Touch was not working properly.
1,"Bought on 9th Jun 2020... It stopped working on 28th Aug 2020Phone is extremely slow and gets heated up...since return window has closed, now I need to get it repaired at service centre and I have discarded the bill already."
4,"For 6500 rs it's OK, an average phone.Not able to turn off camera shutter sound.Battery is average."
4,"Good price, comes with case and screen protector as well as headset, so very good value. Otherwise, very basic phone."
5,Worthy... User free... Great Amazone & Panasonic.. Purchased two times for me and wife. Thanks
5,"Considering the price, this Indian smartphone is a good buy. The quality is good, got a pretty decent speed and screen size. In this price, this is definitely worth the buy. I bought this for someone in my family who needed a basic smartphone and it does fulfill all the conditions with it's features and performance."
1,Mic of the phone stopped working within a month. Now can talk to anyone only through speaker. Very poor phone by Panasonic. Won't suggest anyone to buy it.Panasonic should stop making phones if they are not good at it.
1,"This phone is not working properly,  getting stuck, touch screen hardly working and speaker not working..  I want to return this and purchase other one.  Please help return this and take another company phone"
3,Not good.Not worth for that cost. Photos and videos are not clear. I have given gift to other friends. I enquired they informed me  why you have prefered this company mobile they are questioning me. I am not able to answer to them. Better go for other good company to choose. Thanq
3,Product is good based on price. But one defect is unable to hear clear voice on video call. Remaining all ok
1,"This device stops working after a few days of operation ... Mobile screes completely blank now.. not getting powered on ... Please advise..how to get a warranty replacement. We did not anticipate such poor quality products will be supplied, which did not work for 30days .. Need your immediate action."
1,The performance of this phone is very poor. It hangs everytime when you install something from play store. The batter drowning very fast.I suggest every person who's saw this review please don't buy this phone because if u do then you can't get back your money.
5,I bought dis fr my business superbbb mbl I'm so happy thankoo amazon😍😍😍😍
1,Unable to touch screen properly.worst battery .when we make full charge within 10 minutes it will get down by 0% and get switch off.showing storage full nothing we download.
1,Phone went to Reboot Factory setting own it own and Charger stopped working with in 15 Day of Purchase.Very low level service centers and take a long time for replacement of charger. What is the use of a phone without a charger.Very Sad.
2,Problem with battery and sound of the mobile is not good and without touching mobile also battery getting down and airphone or headphone sound spoiled only one speaker little working so this are the reasons i don't like
5,Panasonic packing so bad that I faced a difficulty to get it out from the box.
1,It is a very slow phone especially for internet and apps like YouTube and WhatsApp. It’s Chinese rivals are ten times faster and better in performance. Unfortunately the phone does not live up to the Japanese iconic brand - Panasonic.
1,"Worst product, after 7 months,showing as IMEI Number not working, barcode invalied, repaired but showing same error. Don't buy and  exchange is also not available. I was lost my money."
5,"Dont expect or compare the camera clarity with other high end phones,  Its just okay.Sound quality is good, no lagging, powerful torch, good battery capacity,  design is compact to fit-in the pocket."
3,"Good one..., you can consider this if you looking for low budget non Chinese owned Smartphones. Sometimes while using 4G it get hangs. But recovers quickly. If you beginner with smartphones and have moderate usage then good choice."
1,"Very bad experience. On the 4th day after purchase, phone got switched off and stopped working. As it was a gift for someone, we couldnt return within 7 days. Worst experience. Please stop selling defective products! Very much dissatisfied!!!"
5,Charger and speaker 🤷
5,Good
5,Good..but no music player!!! Lots of app.
5,Charger and speaker 🤷
5,Good
5,Good..but no music player!!! Lots of app.
1,As soon as u open the camera phones heats up. Waste of money. Even this phone hangs.
2,"Not worth it. On paper the phone is a beast but in real life you can hardly do anything without making a BBQ grill out of it. The metal frame gets so hot, you cannot even hold it.It gets hot while using only a single app let alone handling multiple apps at once. It is capable of many things but not at once. I don't know if the reviews were paid or what but the product received by me was so bad, I can't even express my disappointment here in words."
5,"Pre-ordered this phone on 20th January and received on the date of release on 29th January. I am using this phone for last one week. It is a fantastic phone with a major upgrade in camera system. I would like to add my initial review after using it for 1 week.1. Display: I would say this is one of the best smartphone display I have ever seen. QHD at 120Hz looks amazing and gives a nice feel to it.2. Performance: Exynos Octacore 2100 with 12GB RAM with UFS 3.1 storage performs solid and ultra fast. I have never faced any issues yet while using apps or games.3. Media: Along with display, I would like to add improvement of sound quality. Dolby Atmos even without headphone is simply amazing. Even it has no 3.5mm jack, recently purchased Galaxy Buds Pro will take you to a different level of entertainment.4. Battery: With a massive 5000mah battery, it allows me a full day of moderate usage.5. Design: Pro grade design with rock solid Gorilla Glass Victus will give you peace of mind. As Samsung advertised, Phantom Black (which I had) feels good in hand. Though it feels bulky but I will be getting used to it. Side aluminum frame could have been replaced to stainless steel (I really wished for it). Camera bump looks professional to me.6. Camera: This is the area where S21 Ultra is different from rest of S21 line up. With 108MP main sensor, picture looks ultra sharp. Macro shot is also greatly improved. 3x and 10x telephoto in mobile device is simply amazing.Along with my review, I would like to add few things:1. Wifi 5GHz with 80MHz channel not supported I believe. When I am setting this in router it is not picking up. Only working with 20MHz/40MHz channel.2. Portrait mode is working with main 108MP camera. Samsung could have used 3x telephoto for Portrait.3. Night Mode could have been improved.4. S-Pen from my Note 8 is working fine but observing minor lags while opening air command.5. Looks like recording with HDR10 in 4k60p not supported.I will explore more on the device and update soon.Overall, Samsung has done great work in S21 Ultra."
1,THERE IS NO USE OF PRE ORDERING I HAVE PREORDERED IT ON 16TH JANUARY AND TO MY SURPRISE OT WAS DELIVERED 2 DAYS LATE DONT KNOW WHY AND MY PREBOOKING OFFER ALSO I AM NOT GETTING ON ENTERING IMEI NO IN SAMSUNG SHOP. Amazon and seller have some issues they are doing fraud. Neither a watch was showing there to add to cart that time nor i got any offer after 72 hours of activation... No body is helping amd samsung customer care says talk to amazon.....and amazon says talk to samsung... overall the crux is seller has manipulated the scheme and kept watch with him that shud have been given to me as a prebooking offer. So plz dont prebook anything if there are offers ...purchase offline only.
2,"Multiple issues, but biggest of all is heating issue, phone heats up a lot, I have added a video which I took after 5mins of camera use. The temp is so high that you can't hold it in hand. Though photo quality is great but with such heat it's useless. Phone heats up during video calls as well, like Google meeting, WhatsApp and zoom calls. Also, I purchased the phone during pre order period, but I haven't received watch yet, Samsung denying it as i purchased from Amazon and Amazon is stating you are eligible you have to wait until 28th Feb 2021.With so much of heating issue I would not recommend anyone to invest so much in it, unless Samsung takes the responsibility and fix the issues."
1,Getting too much hot like extreamly hot. I am waiting for support to get back to me. But this is not acceptable for such flag ship phone. Worse from samsung. I will 100% return this if the technitian doest have solution for this.
5,Everything is awesome except it's weight.But it's manageble because I am upgrading from my five year old galaxy s6.
5,Camera is outstandingDisplay is amazingBattery life is superFingerprint is very responsiveSound and processer is so touchyLoved the phoneBetter than apple iphons
1,"Worst phone ever when you take the value for money aspect, with respect to overall features, I am greatly disappointed with the real deal once I had it in my hand after the hype and the ads for this ;  I feel no real upgrade from the phone which I exchanged the “One Plus 7 pro” this one plus was from 2019 but still felt so good from a performance perspective. Unnecessary exchange experience I would say, please stick with the Snap Dragon 850 -865 if you have one, you will not enjoy this exynos at all. The camera is also shabby and can’t be compared with its peers in this price range; the only saving grace is the display which is in par with its competitors at this price point.Overall please do not waste your hard earned money on this; not worth it, you have better options at half the price ."
1,I am unable to claim the pre booking offer i.e samsung smart watch which comes with the phone for 990₹
1,"horrible. Wanted to return in half an hour of service, amazon did not allow,  very bad customer service by amazon.Camera gets heated up and does not allow to take photos outdoor"
5,Shifting from iPhone 11 and couldn't be happier. Does everything so gracefully.The display is jaw dropping. Wish it came with the 25w charger.
4,Phone is very good...but not worth of 97k(After 10k discount from HDFC Card)Biggest disappointment is atleast charging adapter not included in the box for this price... Samsung should rethink on this...I'm switching from OnePlus to Samsung...I'm more happy with OnePlus rather than Samsung
1,"No justification for the heating issue. The phone gets heated up very quickly while using the camera. The phone is superb in all other aspects, but the heating issue spoils everything."
5,"Phone look was good and rich, with all flagship features. Mainly Samsung apps integration was good and Knox firewall security inbuilt. The phone is awesome, and never expected this from exynos chipset. Exynos 2100 was fast enough for our daily task.Will update camera review after some days but initial impressions were good and nice to use Samsung after a decade**Spoiler alert - people who speaks about heating, im asking them is there any ideal device on earth which gives high performance and zero heat. So stop making unusual comments and spoil the right to express rule 😜People should understand some logic before yelling about heating issues. Just imagine dumbell press with 5kg and 20kg are same ? The same way handling 12mp camera and 108 mp camera are not same. So when processing such a bigger image processor needs to work 10x more than processing a 12mp image."
1,Camera quality super but  mobile veryy heating
3,"Exceptional Adaptive DisplayTop notch screen and brightnessThe latest ui is greatSuperb sound quality from both the speakersCamera is good not the best100 x zoom is nothing great. Even 10x optical zoom is not that great.Heating problem. No excuse.. This is the worst experience using this phone. The camera panel heats within couple of clicks, forget about taking video.Battery back up is not good too inspite of having 5000 mah battery. Can't survive the day.Also, received 2 times faulty smartphone.Quality check is an issue..Had the problem with finger print sensorSound quality during calls to the ear piece is not good.. May be a defect.. The second piece had good sound but the power button was pressed inside when I opened the box..Overall a good phone, nonpardonable heating issues not worth the money...whosoever is looking to buy samsung hold on.. There are other good smartphones going to be launched.."
1,"This phone heatsup very quickly and if we dont have a panel we cannot even hold it in our hand.And some apps were also not installing, saying that the country i am staying doesn’t support, which is too funny as i am staying in India and couldn’t even download the apps."
2,"Most of the features that we have seen or have heard about this phone are true. It  has a awesome screen, best in class camera, great resolution, powerful processer, good battery life. A truly flagship kinda Premium Phone. You just cannot challenge about the content the Samsung guys have added to this phone... But.....The Cons...This phone has heating problem. It is even after April-21 software update. Clicking the pictures has been an issues for now. I have tried almost multiple times at different times be it morning or night you can feel the phone getting heated a lot. 10 mins of operations today and the screen was unable capture any further and gave warning mgs. The heat was such that you will have a question about this phone is it a phone or an iron? The camera gets shut post that and you will ruin all the moments being able to capture. It taken very long time to comeback to normal (15 to 20mis). It a Ultra Premium Phone and Its a completely waste of money and hardware. Infact none of the so called reviewers did mention about this issue.This has been a very big disappointment and I feel I was cheated buying this ""Premium flagship Phone"". I am truly thinking about my dissision of buying. This phone is not worthy of a 1 lakhs rupees tag. Feeling hopeless with this phone now. I wish I could have a different phone..."
5,"The Galaxy S21 ultra features Samsung’s new Exynos 2100 5G SoC. Telephoto performance is impressive, and it can shoot 8K videoBattery life, performance, and the display are all very good.Initially i have received a defective piece.because of heating issue i have replaced that got the perfect one.. now there is no heating issue. Thanks to amazon service."
5,"I had pre-ordered this phone on 21st January 2021 and received the same on 5th February 2021 (I was a little late in pre-ordering. Believe me it takes a lot to consider for such amount of investment and the returns we get). And Yes, I have got all the pre order offers and accessories. Please keep in mind Amazon & Samsung Shop are different online portals, and although pre order offers are the same, but the applicability and the processes to claim them, are different. Samsung Shop itself have some bugs, they are late in activating all the IMEIs on time, but you have to deal with it and be assured you will get those finally. I have personally pre-ordered the Galaxy Buds Pro from Samsung Shop, and availed all the offers and off course as I said they were late to activate the offer claiming process.So, now I am using this phone for a month and half. I have tested it a lot to provide my opinions. Although its a phone which will cost you more than 1 lakh, its not a magic wand, you have to keep your expectations practical.1. Display: The color calibration is perfect with this new Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, even while comparing to other Samsung mid-range phones with sAMOLED I can see the difference. WQHD at 120Hz is just another level of experience, once you get it in the hands you can feel that. Please enable eye comfort shield for nights, its good. Max brightness in daylight will not be an issue with this one.2. Camera: This the where the phone takes the limelight. 108MP shots, night mode, 10x & 3x optical zoom coupled with macro mode, the detailed Pro mode, makes it competitive with Semi-DSLRs (Personally Tested with Cannon SX520HS model with 42x optical zoom). Yes it will get heated up with continuous camera usage and its normal. Heat dissipation is necessary.3. Battery & Power Consumption: The phone has a typical (please search google what ""typical"" actually means) 5000mah battery which will last a day with moderate usage. This is with WQHD enabled, Always on Display enabled and the Screen On Time I was getting around 5 Hours. With FHD it can last more but certainly not 2 days. A 25 Watt Samsung charger will take exactly 1 hour and 30 minutes to charge it fully from zero to 100% while the super fast charging is enabled.4. Processor & Performance: Exynos Octacore 2100 + 16GB RAM + UFS 3.1 storage performs really fast. Don't get confused with the numbers from SD888 comparisons, it won't matter in daily life.5. Sound and Media: Dual stereo speakers are loud enough with Dolby Atmos capability. No 3.5mm jack, but again it's a flagship, it is expected. And sadly Samsung flagship will never offer FM radio. Its a con personally to me, but I have accepted it knowing the fact. Experience with Galaxy Buds Pro is amazing, but you have to properly choose the provided tips for a snug fit and then only you will get the true experience. (I did a mistake for a week to use the tip it was packed with by default, but then I saw some genuine reviews and corrected my fault).6. Extras: S Pen support, reverse wireless charging support, inbuilt pro level photo editing, custom notification alerts with side glow; there are many features to explore. Some of them are not enabled by default, so look out for some YouTube videos to explore all. You will not get disappointed!7. Updates: Samsung will provide 4 years of OS upgrade and rest be assured you will get the monthly security updates as soon as possible. They will provide feature upgrades too which will enhance the experience and fix the bugs you have. Be a member of the Samsung community, and report what you don't like or what you need. They will definitely take a note, even if you don't get the feature very quickly.The Phone will get heated up while applying the updates(because of re-indexing), while doing fast charging, and with extended CPU & GPU hungry gaming, it's natural, and do not worry. Sadly the charger or headphones or even a dongle is not part of the retail unit, but all flagships are doing the same. As a smartphone user I do not support this. At least they should give us an option to choose if you want them as part of the retail packaging or not. Not everyone has the proper charger or headphones already.Attaching the unboxed components photo along with a night mode shot  (where a significant portion of the captured photo was pitch black to naked eye) from my S21 Ultra for reference. Thank You!"
5,"The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra packs in tons of features that make it the best Android phone right now. With improved cameras, super performance, amazing display, and more it has safely attained the 'best' mark in reality too.Samsung is in a league where no one currently is and is doing things to justify the pricing it chooses.Galaxy S21 Ultra has managed to work its 'Ultra' charm this time and if you have the money and the urge to buy it, you won't be making a bad choice!"
5,I am usung this phone from 2 weeks and i have to say this is the best samsung phone till now the processor is to good on paper and using also finger print is to fast also the camera isthe best tiil now. Also the frame rate drop during game is also less the clearity and the features are best all this is because of new. Camera clearity is superb and the content captures by cam is like unbelievable. If you have this phone you dont have to buy DSLR. Although the usa version got prise drop compare to s20 but worth buying for those who have been waiting  for good processor camera 120hz displays  and more.. its all in a single phone a complete  package...
5,"People complaining about the battery life please let it at least learn your usage patterns for the first two weeks (I hope you at least know this before going out and buying a 1 lakh rs phone). Well, I got the active watch 2 today as a part of the offer and having used the phone for a month now, it's simply a sweetheart. For people complaining about overheating maybe you should do enough research how much these new chips are heating, even the camera on snapdragon models shuts down due to heating, don't dump the fault on exynos will ya. I haven't faced these issues yet and the camera is simply wow. And anyone with right set of mind won't be buying a exynos phone just to play pubg come on, even snapdragon won't cut it as much as a iPhone would, go get yourselves some iphone please. The screen, the dex, the dolby, the smart watch, the camera and what not, never had I hoped I would be enjoying the phone this much. Every phone needs tweaking and for gamers let me tell you if you don't already know, you need to disable the Samsung game optimizing service to get the optimum gaming performance. This phone is a beast and is a king even with that inferior exynos under the hood. I have held phones hotter than this while gaming so maybe I don't feel it, but all I know is that it provides what it needs to, that wonderful user experience under a sexy design."
4,"Decent phone with marvelous display . Camera is good in outdoor condition, noise is present in indoor pics.Could feel heavy to some ,but not that much weighted.Overall a decent purchase but price should have been in range or 70K."
5,"Absolutely powerful, superb display quality... finger print reader and facial recognition is a bit off but not by a lot..camera quality and image processing is insane"
5,I got this in 90k with hdfc offer and a extra watch active 2. So effective price will be around 75k.Camera quality is better than iPhone max pro.. My brother is using it so compared.Battery life is 1.5 days.No lagGood feel in hands.Cons -Its slippery in hand so buy a rubber case for better hold.Bit feel heavy as previously i was using one plus 5.
5,"This is truly the best smartphone money can buy right now.The screen at 120Hz is so smooth.Display is so vibrant.Camera system with the 100x zoom and 8k recording is just out of this world.Charges amazingly fast with the 25W charger, which I wish came included with the phone."
4,Pre-ordered this my most expensive Phone so far. Had couple of issues availing pre order benefits coz of Amazon but they got resolved now.I was frustrated and irritated by the pricing of this phone in India.. and also NO CHARGER I had to pay extra bucks to let samsung save our environment and also No head phone jack cable.. with a phone at this price range atleast they should have provided a head phone jack cable and btw that extra cable also costed some extra bucks and had to check lot of shops to get a compatible one. Didnt wanted to buy the one from Samsung shop as it is priced ridiculously for a cableCamera is great no issues so farPhone Heats a lot biggest drawbackPlayed COD like continuously for a month.. phone heats a lot and frame drops are there on heavy usage but enjoyed playing it.. gives decent gaming performanceBattery: on regular usage can come up to 8 hours.. but to fully charge it takes 1.5 hoursAfter 2 months of usage I can see battery backup is decreasing and charging also takes hell lot of time if you are using your phone when its plugged inDisplay.. OMG i love this display.. you just cant take your eyes off itSoftware performance is also goodSo far loved ghis phone.. but please Samsung match the prices with international prices for future versions
1,Writing this review just after 2 months of use. The display suddenly just got black . Service center told me that it's display is dead and needs to be REPLACED ?? Can you imagine it's their FLAGSHIP PHONE?? dead in just 2 months without any physical damage . They should hv replace it piece to piece but they refused and now onwords it will be called a repaired one . Sure I'll never go for any of samsung in future.6th June -- worst service from Samsung . Diaplay Still not replaced by service center despite numerous emails and calls to service center . It's almost 2months my so called flagship is out of order . Now switching to apple
3,"Pre ordered the phone on 16 Jan and got it delivered on 08 Feb 21 only.Was very excited to open box to see the new phone but to my nightmare saw the brand new phone inside the box having chip on the edge where lamination ends.Rather unusual the box had some dust as well and the lamination on front and back were smudged.Immediately called Amazon customer care who sent me link to send the images to assess.  They verified Immediately and initiated replacement. All this happened in 20 mins after me receiving the phone.5 stars to Amazon customer care  and appreciate the way the issue was addressed which gives confidence  and removes any fear in buying  phone through them.It is advised to record video the phone unboxing if you are buying any costly phone to save you any trouble even if customer care did not belive your version.Received the replacement new phone next day and phone physically was ok. The phone is heavy compared to my old s10+. Display looks amazing but I can feel the phone getting hot often near the areas of the camera in the back and side frames. The phone is super fast and camera is really good, but heating issue is a concern which Samsung should address.Also Samsung should improve their quality check."
4,"It is a good phone with a major upgrade in camera system.1. Display: one of the best smartphone display I have used. QHD at 120Hz looks amazing2. Performance: Exynos Octacore 2100 with 12GB RAM with UFS 3.1 storage performs good and no lags seen as of now3. Audio:Dolby Atmos even is awesome.4. Battery: With a  5000mah battery, it allows  a full day of moderate usage.5. Design: Design with rock solid Gorilla Glass Victus has good results in online drop tests6. Camera: With 108MP main sensor, picture looks ultra sharp. Macro shot is also greatly improved. Moon shot with 72x zoom is amazing (max 100x) with good stability and ease of captureWarmth:Only concern I see the heating up part which heats up real bad especially using camera.I am assuming it is an exynos issue."
1,My phone Has a lot of heating issues so much so that i am unable to place it on my ear while talking rather i i speak on loud speaker.On calling up Amazon they tested the software part and said it to be clear..  who is going to be responsible for the hardware...The phone is of above 1 lac which is very unsatisfactory and Amazon isn't ready to return  or refund my money.Had it been a shop where I had this purchase I bet sure they are extremely cooperative unlike Amazon.Kindly do the needful.Your hopeful customer.
5,"Pros -Massive massive battery life! I was using the s20FE prior to this whose battery life was just atrocious. This one though, gives me peace of mind. SOT easily 6 hours plus (I’m a hardcore user). If you use it just for mails,WhatsApp,occasional YouTube videos in HD, streaming music over Bluetooth in your car and regular phone calls, this thing is a beast, battery wise.Throttling does not seem to be happening much, but I do not play games on this phone, so my opinion might be biased. Regardless it never feels like it gets warm despite heavy usage.LOVE the screen!! I think they finally got the glass curves right. And the screen is just such a pleasure to look at. I mean you do after all spent like 99% of your time interacting with your phone through your screen. A+. Sunlight legibility harkens back to the LCD days, super easy easy to read under harsh sunlight.Audio is ok for me. I mean it is plenty loud. It could have been better. Although I’m usually on Bluetooth anyways so personally it doesn’t matter much for me.Camera - they have “almost” fixed that beauty mode selfie thingy, overall I’m quite happy with the selfies, could have had a wider selfie option IMHO. The wide angle option right now just feels a tad narrow. The rear camera, OMG!! Nothing else to say, I just LOVE it!!! All the lenses lol, even the ridiculous space zoom one. Don’t take much videos so cannot comment on it.Cons :-Night mode camera does lag a bit. Perhaps could be fixed thru a software update. Not sure. But the quality is top notch.Design wise, yes it is huge, but I like big phones. Regardless it’s quite uncomfortable to put in your pant pockets or even your shirt pocket for that matter. It does feel top heavy due to the camera bump. Aesthetically speaking I really don’t care as I always put a case on.Lack of charger in the box (c’est la vie). Also, I’m not sure but it seems like it doesn’t support fast charging above 25 watts. Full charge usually takes about 70 to 90 mins. O to a 100%.Lack of the snapdragon version. This Exynos chip even though much improved compared to previous versions still does lag behind the snapdragon versions. Again, such is life.Overall, if u r looking for an android flagship phone, this is it!! I put on money on it, which I have."
5,Reading all the reviews I was very skeptical to buy this phone given the price. It's been 2 days that I have been using the phone rigorously and I can say I'm impressed.Battery lasts for a day easily even with moderate to heavy usageNo heating issue seenCamera is very good.Display and Sound are awesome
1,Phone is heating
5,"Really awesome experience with  my S21 Ultra. Actually planned for IPhone 12 Pro Max  but  luckily changed mind to go for  Samsung S21 Ultra. Awesome  Camera,  Excellent  network reception,  super battery backup"
5,The best flagship of the year with a lot of powerful features packed in the phone.1 Love the e-sim2 powerful processor3 awesome quality display4 Camera specially 10x optical zoom5 very good macro photo capabilities6 got buds pro at rs990 was really good complement.7 faster fingerprint reader secure ultrasonic and many more daily useful features.I see a lot of overheating complaints but never had any issues after I updated the firmware immediately and cleared cache partition. Though first setup will heat a bit but thats not an issue. After update and calibration and usage of 7 days the battery adapted well and learned usage patern and now backup is awesome with everything turned on lasts 1 day with about 6 hrs of sot.So overall I am very satisfied with this phone.
5,Excellent flagship phone that meets your's expectations.... a lil heavy to hold but its ok.. u get used to it... but u will end up spending approx 3k on charger / akg headphones from samsung online store / service centre but both r reqd to complete the experience... Just been to a family wedding where pics shot on this were appreciated over those shot on I-12..  Zoom is exceptional... satisfied after more than a month of using it...🙂
5,"S21 Ultra with Exynos is really fast, smooth and for the first time almost equal to its Qualcomm counter part, the display and the cameras are amazing. The phone gives an amazing luxury feel, partly due to slick nature, a fact that was kind of missed out on the Galaxy Note9 that I owned prior to this phone. Do not hesitate to buy on account of the Exynos chip. All of the rest of the specs and features of this phone make it worthwhile"
5,"One of the best Samsung phones so farBut you have to very careful using this device..But one cons is there,while charging hefty amount they should provide atleast Samsung Buds 😞Multitasking and Flex Mode are great..Samsung Z Fold 2 is Beast"
5,Product was excellent.if you can use the mobile with little care and you can shell the asking price this was the best mobile you can buy at any price point.but the the shipping was slow even if i had prebooked the product.
5,"Great Premium Phone. The concept is great and it is a huge improvement over Fold1.Some Cons/shortcomings - Storage should have been 512GB, No Micro SD Card, should have got free Buds as being given in western countries, feels a bit heavier, no S Pen."
5,"For 1.5 lac rupees I could have booked a flight to travel to the relatives house and talk with them,for the same amount I could have bought a scooty and visited the near and dear ones to communicate,and could watch movies in theatres with the money to spare. since this covid has not allowed to do all that ,I am grateful for Samsung to launch such phone so that I can experience the movies the chats without the need to step outside.only downside is now o don't have money to eat.but I love the amoled"
5,"I have been a long time iphone user, but due to the delay in this year's iphone 12 launch and the innovation shown by Samsung with this phone, I made the jump to the Fold 2 this time. I must say that the premium build, large screen and awesome camera has made it truly worth it. Kudos to Samsung for the competitive pricing as well, was expecting this to be launched at ~1.7-1.8 Lakhs. Wherever I take this phone, this turns heads for sure. The large OLED screen is perfect for watching content and it supports HDR on netflix as well. Overall, an awesome product and am loving it!"
5,"Two weeks with this phone, i am not sure if it is ok to call it a phone. It’s a performance powerhouse, i can do all my daily tasks on this phone and i barely feel the need to go back to my laptop wven for processing a document or write a big email.This has really made my day to day working seamless"
5,I upgraded from samsung fold to samsung z fold 2...its really a better experience to use this gadget.
5,"This phone does pretty well to justify its pricetag. The display, cameras, build quality, it's all great.Though there is currently a lack of proper cases for it. That is necessary given how expensive this is."
1,"Under two weeks of usage not able to install sim/esim.Not charging Kindly replace the item,It was with Samsung service service center on November 8"
5,Awesome phone .....too good and thank god for samsung providing the exonys chipset.A beast phone and one of the best.
5,Amazing phone very good got delivery within 12 hours in good condition with sealed box
1,"Except satisfying one's vanity, this phone is UNUSABLE in facility, highly DROPPABLE, CLUNKY.A White Elephant. The unfolded quality DISPLAY is the saving grace...Please list your scenarios of usage before sinking your money here.And I am a Galaxy fan and users incentive, since the S7 stole the show in Barcelona with its ALWAYS ON display."
4,First review after using the phone for 2 to 3 hours:Very excited to use the phone and eager how it looks till I get the phone from the time of order.Pros:If you are gamer then you will enjoy the big screen and resolution.Both the Cameras are just awesome ( best in market)Looks and feels premium when you hold it in your handComes with dual battery which last for 2 days for heavy usersPerformance of the phone is expected to be great due to its price and is up to mark till now.Comes with 25w charger and supports wireless charging.Cons:Main problem to buy the phone is its price.. which I feel it's over priced.Feels bit heavier.As I like using slim phones.. felt bit uncomfortable in holding the phone.Nothing much different from other samsung phones.. only the fold is exciting.Overall rating considering the price and specification of the product: 3/5.
1,Bubbles formed in the middle of the phone after just 1 month. Would not recommend this phone
5,"After a few days usage I must say, shockingly great device.Call, sms, WhatsApp, facebook, office, pdf do whatever... At the ease of this device.ONLY THING YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THE MIDDLE SCREEN... THE FOLDABLE SCREEN.Snapdragon 865+,12GB RAM, 256GB ROM, 4500 BATTERY, SAMSUNG PAY!!!You name it, Samsung has given it!"
3,It's not easy to carry  And operate .front screen is small. Not fit for insurance
3,"The phone is fine. Except a bit small to type with closed screen and a bit large to type with open screen. What is unfair is that you can get this phone for INR 140, 000 with watch and headphones in the market. they are selling it for INR 150, 000 without headphone and the watch. What kind of system is that? Where is my watch and headphones????"
5,"Samsung delivers again with their newest flagship in foldable smartphones. The Galaxy Fold 2 has fixed perhaps a lot of the pressing issues with the Fold 1 and made it faster and better.The hinge is perhaps the most important piece of any foldable tech and Samsung definitely delivers in this regard. Initially I was very worried about opening and closing my phone but the transition is pretty smooth and within five minutes of holding this device you will get used it it. (Tip: Don't press the screen when folding but using the bottom-middle area of the hinge and fold your phone it will protect the screen longer)Whilst many people have concerns with the durability of the phone, I have already dropped it twice (both when it was closed thankfully) and so far it has survived but I don't recommend you doing it.Performance is excellent with 12 gigs of ram, latest processor from snapdragon and am excellent GPU. Games and applications run smoothly without any lag. Sound is excellent with dual speakers! Multiple apps can also run simultaneously without issues. Recommend getting the goodlock app to unlock several features of the phone and customize them further.Price is sadly very very steep though I couldn't resist and bought it anyway but I feel like it should have atleast provided the galaxy buds live or pro along with the phone. But at least you do get the wired AKG earbuds which are excellent. No case is provided which is another downer. Samsung if you are selling a phone at a premium price you should atleast provide a premium accessory!Overall I'm definitely loving this phone."
4,"I was so skeptical before buying this since I couldn't try this in person in any of the physical shops. After changing phones for many years, never found a big jump in usage. This phone was a big leap. Only disadvantage is that it's a bit heavy to use. Other than that I don't have any issues. Looking forward for future fold 3 as well"
4,"Review after first few days of use.Camera par excellence. Folda le screen AWESOME. Multimedia experience super.Backup from old pnone(1+) not so easy.Android system- average customization could have been friendlierAccessories- freebies given are not great. Cabled data transfer was very poor.I bought buds which are AWESOME.Samsung should provide buds and wireless charger, case for free."
5,"Amazing phone. Just wish it was not so heavy. Great buy, Super delivery by Amazon.Update after 10 days of usage :Simply superb performance. You can fill the video to full screen by just zooming with your fingers. Audio is excellent and the AKG headphones are brilliant as well. Just wish it was not this heavy. Its Ok and manageable though."
5,Pros : large screen is Great for movies and official mails. Head turner when you open it in front of others. Loud speakers and awesome speed.Cons : Messaging keypad is too small when closed and too large when opened. Opening needs to be simplified. If it falls you are done with 1.5 lacs. This price would get you 2 high end Models of Microsoft surface pro with all accessories.
5,"Good battery life , it’s a good phone and a great tablet ! I finished three books since I brought it . Email interface is good as well . Samsung has to come out with a good cover for this phone . What is being sold for 5999 is not good enough for the most expensive phone . But I will give it 5 stars for its functionality"
5,This is the best Phone of 2020No comparison
5,It's an awesome product by samsung.. I am ever using. I am loving it. Totally awesome
1,over heating issues and low battery back up.
5,It's awesome. It's fantastic. Just go for it 👍You will love it.You will admire it.Just sell your kidneys and get it 😂
5,Amazing Smartphone. Just Awesome. Nice Battery backup. Camera and Display is just mind blowing. You guys should go for this.
5,The best phone with good features. Looks like the extra advanced edition of nokia commutator which was once a boom in the market
5,I have seen many viedios on it so why not give a try it's great I loved it anyways I buyed it for my son he loves it
3,"Finally a flagship Qualcomm processor in samsung mobile,great👏👏👏 sd 865+ at a price tag of 1 human kidney Excellent mobile(1.5 lacs)."
5,"Once you hold this in your hand, believe me a regular slab phone will feel like a monolith. I went to Samsung Cafe to purchase the S21 Ultra but the demo piece of this one changed my mind in a second. Upon using for a week, the inner screen does not feel as fragile as I had expected. Stopped babying this one.However, one problem that you may have is getting a case for this one. Most cases don't fit properly and the ones that do change it from a sleek beauty to a literal brick. So case lovers stay away.Overall, the performance and battery life has been exceptional. The cover screen feels like an elongated IPhone 5s, quite useful for quick tasks.  I own a Tab S7+ and really don't feel like using that nowadays. If you have the cash to afford this one, go spoil yourself right away."
5,"At the start, let me say that I am a 'regular' use of a smartphone - I want my screen bright, fast, responsive, good camera, good network latching services, great battery et, - so I don't care if the screen, for example,  is AMOLED or whatever, if it is big & beautiful, here's my money. I don't do professional photography with my smartphones but do expect them to have fabulous cameras when I cannot lug my Panasonic out!Anyway, my husband gifted me the Samsung Z Fold 2 (256 GB) in Mystic Bronze for my birthday this Jan. I was quite happy with my OnePlus 6T that had an amazing camera and all the other features. However, the Samsung Z Fold 2 is one of those gadgets that you didn't even know you needed till you get your hands on one. It's a true marvel of technology! I am treating it gingerly that I still haven't installed my SIM card in it - it's like a new friend, and we are just getting to know each other.Here's what I LOVE about it:1. I think I'm going to go back to reading! E-reading apps like Kindle and Aldiko look great and the dual screen is almost the same size as the physical Kindle.2. Multi-tasking rocks and is so so easy to master. I opened up an e-book on one window and the other window I opened up Goodreads on Google to read the book reviews. I can see myself doing that for news, dictionaries, etc of even reading product reviews on one window and shopping online on the other.3. Good cameras - many of them! Selfie mode with rear cameras is a cool thing.What I DON'T LIKE1. The wires earphones that come with the phone seem a little tacky.. for the price they charge, they could have added Samsung Buds or some wireless option.2. There is no case so I had to buy the Spigen case in Mystic Bronze for added protection.The bigger screen definitely needs some getting used to... Some may say that the front screen is to narrow and the unfolded screen is too wide! However, it's a true joy to watch video and multimedia with Fold 2."
5,"I used to think that why should someone spend such a huge amount for a phone.  But then I realized, we are spending most of our time on phone for various tasks. Using super speed phones not only improve your productivity, but it also gives you confidence.I was using Moto G5 plus for last 4 years.  Phone was decent, but it started getting hung when I used multiple apps. Then, I took risk and went for Fold 2. Believe me, this is the best phone with almost all the features. Phone is designed so smartly and this feature of using tab and phone simultaneously is really very useful. There is no problem of hung phone, slow speed etc. Overall, a must buy if your budget permits.And yes, it stands you out from the crowd. Whenever you open it, believe me, almost everyone will start asking you about this phone."
5,Best foldable phone ever but I don't have that much money to buy thisVery sad..You can go for it....
4,"Rich kids toys . It's a good phone, better than iphone and any other phones in the market. So go for it if you r a rich kid."
5,"Superb phone in all respects , Snapdragon 865+ rocks , which is world's first mobile chipset. No heating problems. Mystic bronze is a Fantastic colour. Excellent resolution. In short its a fantabulous phone ."
5,The phone has an excellent form factor and cameraReally love using it...the Accidental damage that comes with it is just awesome
5,Its very good phone from samsung and its folding option in realy great nice it is very cool to use
5,"Great in every sense awesome, splenddid as per dance mata splenidfantabulaoslyawsome great awwome great awsome awsome great and great and great"
5,Charger and speaker 🤷
5,Good
5,Good..but no music player!!! Lots of app.
5,"Pretty Happy. It has everything I wished for.Upgrading from an S9 after 3 years.A good camera, waterproofing, strong processor, high battery life and headphone jack 3.5mm were my basic requirements.It has everything except the 3.5 mm jack. Compromised on that because I was getting rest.I do not play games but WiFi for majority of hours, 99+ tabs on Firefox and Chrome, many vudeo callings on 4G network (Jio) and heavy PDF files are operating simultaneously on my phone. Along with occasional YT Video.Earlier, S9's (Exynos 9810, 4GB RAM) never lagged on this routine and after 3 years, now it started to.Initially, was considering the A52 as it also had all needs. It had the 3.5 mm jack in it, but the compromise there was the Camera and processor.Went through the details of the Snapdragon processor on A52, and realized that procoessor is not even close to the flagship processor, received earlier on S9. (Exynos 9810). That was the deal breaker for me as A52 will not be even able to handle current requirements, let alone future ones. I think A52 has SD730G or 720G. S9 with Exynos 9810 is faster than that chipset. The A52 5G may or may not be launched and even that has 750G which is not equal to S9's old one. These are facts available online. After paying 30-35k for A52/A72, one is getting a processor that was not even equal to the 3 year old Samsung Flagship of S9 (9810).People would be suprised to know that pairing 8GB or 12 GB RAM with low-mid/mid processors will give you *less* performance than having lesser RAM on Top End processors.It is with this need, kade the decision to purchase S20 FE 5G. It has a better camera. and the Snapdragon 865 is future proof and will take care of my needs for 3 years comfortably without lags.Other phone that was considered was Asus ROG 5, It has everything needed at nearly same price point. Mainly, the 6,000 Mah battery. There the compromise was on Camera and Waterproofing. Was also concerned about Asus after sales support. Samsung after sales support is best in India as I have witnessed it my self. People should also consider this. That how good the company is in After sales support.5G was not a concern. Satisfied with 4G speeds and where heavy speeds are needed, prefer to use WiFi fiber based. Also, no phone currently sold in India is 5G proof, as it is not known which 5G bands will be brought to India by Government.The Camera is great and have put a 512GB Sandisk Ultra Card inside.This is the best phone available from Samsung right now and the definitely among the top 3 by any standards in the whole market. One cannot go wrong with this.ChargerIt has a 15W inside while phone supports 25W. Personally I am not bothered because 15W is good for battery life and health. Fast Charging reduces it. The difference is also small. Difference would be great if phone supported 65W and then we were given a 15W one. 15W will improve your battery life.Never considered the OnePlus as it's a Chinese brand. I try to avoid Chinese one as much as possible. Also the S20 FE 5G is assembled in India in Noida, U.P. OP9 is full direct import, even the box. It has been 10 months since Galwan, but we must never forgetEdits1) DisplayPhone supports 120Hz. Looks Beautiful. But I do not use it. Battery difference is significant. Around 1-2  hours. 60Hz lasts longer. So...2) Camera - I am happy. Photos look even better on laptop (after transfer) :D.3) Battery Life- takes 2 hours 13 minutes for full charge with 15W charger. Battery is 4,500 Mah. First 50-60% were very fast. After that charge happens slowly- lasts 1 and a half day with my normal use, which is heavy. (see above). 1st day ended with 36% :D- Woke up next morning to find it at 27%.- Lasted till around 3 p.m.- Make your own conclusions4) I do not play games. No comments on how battery is affected when we play games5) What's in the Box?- no silicone cover, no earphones- charger you get is 15W. *It is Type C to Type C Charger* (You cannot use old chargers with normal USB port)- SIM ToolWhat I do not like/A bit surprised- Phone is *Heavy*- If you are those who like to read/browse on phone for extended hours (I use Kindle often), you will feel real strain within 15 minutes. (At least I do) Maybe, because last phone was very light. Hopefully, arms adjust soon.This comparison is not meant to denigrate A52/A72's processors. They just do not fit the use patternDo not buy 3rd party Type C to 3.5mm jacks available on Amazon. From Samsung Shop, purchased the original Samsung supported jack available for 699. Good 3rd party ones on Amazon are selling fro 999/899. Their compatibility is suspect. Jacks are beneficial over Bluetooth based ones because jacks reduce the battery charge. Using 3.5mm jack easily saves 10-12% over 2-3 hours.I have not experienced luckily any heating till now from phone.Edit 2 - Pics- butterfly pics. Please Note, I am no professional photographer. But this butterfly pic is at very high zoom. It is taken from good distance. Could not go near it. I am happy with the camera's zoom capabilities.Thanks for reading till here"
5,"Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store:1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option.2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers.3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good.4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging.5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well.6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9.7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch.8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9.9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9.10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger.Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences."
3,"no sim card pin, there was no headphone. packing was not up to the mark ,with respect to the price of the productThe product heats up very fast"
1,"Received a defective product, same was verified by Amazon customer care, but they have refused to replace.Please don't buy mobile phone from Amazon instead go for authorised mobile stores.Huge disappointment.Will never ever buy electronics from Amazon."
5,"For the price of 48k, I see this device as the perfect balance between performance, value and future proof. I bought this instead of OnePlus 9 and 9R and do not regret this decision at all."
1,"Would have given 5 stars if not for camera,camera app is shutting on its own,if fixed will give five stars,will update.20/04/21Returned product as faulty."
5,"I was using OnePlus 5t for last 3 years. Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone.Pros:1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above.2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want.3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers..4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though.Cons:1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal.2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though.3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better.4. Fingerprint reader could have been better."
2,Bought this a day backAt this price range I felt this phone is a crap.Here are the reasons why1) Terrible heating issue near to the camera with moderate usage - Might be from the processor2) Battery optimization  sucks - with moderate usage it dint lasted for 7 hours3)Only 15W Charger will be in the box3) At this price range competitors provide better finger print reader4) cheaper corilla glass 3 is used5) Snapdragon  860 and 865 has some heating issues  and other issues6)Back design makes this phone less premiumOverall at 40k price - This phone in not woth for the money 😑 ...if you're looking for mid flagship camera..then you can go for this phone.Considering  the heating issue this phone rate will drop further.. When it drops to 30k you can buy this phone
1,Everything was good but I found a manufacture defect it it. A click sound was coming from the back side whenever a put the phone on any surface. While slowly shaking the phone the sound frequency increased.I talked to customer support for replacement and they did it successfully.Received the new phone but truly disappointed.Found same issue like the 1st one.Placed a return request for it.🙏
5,"The best among the budget flagship smartphones in the market. I am extremely satisfied with this.If you can compromise without a 3.5mm headphone jack and a physical proximity sensor (although there is a virtual proximity sensor to compensate but it doesn't work like the physical one), then this will be a better choice than One Plus 9."
5,"Got it recently and playing with it for a while, I can tell you I am quite satisfied  with  it and it's features😄. I can tell quite a lot of good things but I'll stop it's already  listed in the description.😉Display is very good 👍, Battery backup is good.But I should have 0.5 star as my only complaint is it gets warm way to early while doing things, normal people shouldn't worry about it only little warm in intensive tasks like games and heavymultitasking. Hope things get better after an update. 😀"

5,"Just loved it. It offers unbelievably everything what you could wish for. Writing this review after around 20 days of use.Well the major pros:1. Look wise the phone is awesome.2. Ultra Smooth UI, loved the One UI 3.1 (first time using Samsung ).  A combination of 120 Hz, Super AMOLED and Snapdragon 865 makes it awesome3. Camera is exceptional. OIS works great which is missing in OP. I have attached images for references:  a. Moon Image is taken at 30X Zoom just with hands without tripod, see how stabilised that is.  b. Night mode is ultimate, believe me it can capture what eyes can't see  c. Day light, colour reproduction is great. Loved the Ultra Wide and Zoom cameras, both do the job with perfection.  d. Videos are very smooth, and it supports 4K upto 60fps. Slow motion and Ultra slow motion both work great.4. 5G support is there with 9 bands, although couldn't test anything in India.5. Fingerprint, Face recognition works pretty fast.6. Used Samsung Pay for the first time, it is awesome and something missing in all others. Just added my card it that, and tapped phone to pay directly. It authenticates using Fingerprint.7. It supports 15W Fast Wireless charging, which works flawless.8. Battery life is great, When I am not using it much, easily gives 2 days (46 hours) at 60Hz display. There are multiple ways to save battery. Initially battery consumption was more. It takes i think 6-7 days to learn the usage pattern by Android 11. After that it puts the un-used apps to sleep and deep sleep. Battery life increases to almost double after this9. Feature I loved the most - the phone is IP68, I have tested it multiple times, putting under Tap water and rain. Just don't charge when port is wet. Phone will warn itself with a notification.10. Supports upto 1 TB micro SD through hybrid SIM slot, so 2nd SIM has to be compromised, so I am not using it.Cons:1. Charging is bit slow, not like dash charge.2. Wireless charging is also not that fast.3. Screen brightness is a bit low, compared to higher end phones, but perfect when compared to lower ends.I recommend this over OP, until you are only into Gaming. It is not jack of all, its actually a king, with just a compromise from Snapdragon 888 to 865."
4,"I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly.1) DisplayDisplay is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed.2) Battery lifeAt 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this.The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too.3) CameraCamera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that.4) SoftwareYou can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years.5) ProcessorI bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya.Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others.My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace."
1,"Thank you so much samsung for sending a defective phone. You made the first impression to last for very long. What happened to Good old fashion of testing the product before packaging. You have started making phones costlier and costlier for Indian market (even if it is made in India). The quality level, and amount of h/w features have gone down over the years.Thanks to amazon for prompt response for replacing the product. Hope, this time i will get a working phone."
5,"Bought on 25th Apr. Have been using samsung since ages and was looking for a decent phone with good camera, screen and battery life. This phone covers all.While initiating and data transfer, did get a little hot but nothing post that. Most of the time is spent on calling including Whatsapp (3-4 hours) and watching serials (5-6) hours and general net surfing (2-3 hours). Once charged in the morning, till night still 30% battery is left. No heating issues at all.The 120Hz refresh rate makes the viewing experience really smooth especially as compared to 60hz in the previous phone.The sound quality is good, speakers produce enough loud sound and movies and videos can be watched easily.Overall, a very good experience so far."
2,"Edit: May 22, after a month of use : Amazon providing 6K off now, no wonder whyCons:1. Finger scanner is works only 6/10 times. May 22: Little better after the recent software upgrade2. Felt heat in the back even with very less usage. Understand that the phone have SD 865 and a external modem which means heat will be continued issue for this phone.3. Face reorganization will not work in low light (iPhone 11 unlocks very smooth in the same lighting condition)4. It felt like a very old model phone5. Volume and power button are in the same side (very hard to use)6. Low light photos are horrible7. Take ~5 hours for full charge. Battery discharge very fast if you have any peripheral connected to it.8. Videos will not play in full screen because of screen bezel in the top.Pros:1. Good for basic photo2. Phone is not large but heavy with 4500 mah battery3. Sound and voice call quality is good4. 120 Hz refresh rate is buttery smoothWith my one month observation, I will not recommend S20 FE 5G, recommends iPhone 11 128GB based on my usage of both phones."
5,Good choice over other phones in same price segment.Fingerprint is average. Better to use face its very good.Battery life is nice.And camera is superb. Far better than oneplus 9 series.Overall good product.
5,"1st of all  Amazing design easy to holdPremium feel and well balanced deviceProsBuilt is good well balanced weight all overNice body to screen ratioAll flagship features water proof  wireless charging and reverse chargingFlagship grade camera took moon shots and i was amazed images also attachedSpeakers are awesome with balance loud and bass with clear audioSnapdragon 865 is very powerful and plays every game at 60 fps at high or ultra settings and sd 870 and 888 are not a big leap as i checked and 865 wont be outdated 3-4 years easilyWifi with both 2.4 and 5 ghz bandsBluetooth output is amazingOne ui makes it a whole package the experience and smoothness of it with all Samsung only features like samsung pay, wireless dex and knox security which is military grade protection for your device and offered by none in android marketEdge panel and edge lighting many moreDisplay is good and very good color accuracy as its Samsung display it will not disappoint you and you will enjoy any movie or game in this display better than any mid range phone  and120hz is so smooth you can feel and see the difference just by enabling it and with  one ui its music to your eyesBattery life is good i would say its  decent with 120hz enabled and much better with 60hz also lasts a day with any refresh rate and 4500mah is sufficient for any 1 with moderate usageThese are not Cons but area for improvement for Samsung for future fan editionsAs its a fan edition they have balanced it between a mid range and a flagshipEverything mentioned in pros are truly flagship and in this area were they have done cost cuttingDisplay is brilliant but can be better it might be that i have  used  qhd before and its full hd so it  can be  a personal preference not a conDesign Can  be more slim with better curves in behindPlastic back is fine as it wont break like my s9 glass back even with a cover so not a glass back fanMore colors should be available in indian marketBack finish is good like  mattefront camera is a balance of both mid range and flagship camera but still better than any Chinese brand as Samsung cameras are best in the worldBut they can improve it for next feThey Should've given  ear phones in box or atleast 3.5 mm aux dongle instead of 15w chargerIn the end its a perfect phone with negligible cons with Samsung brand value and after sales service go for it at this price point and with this brand value either buy this or apple dont waste your money in Chinese brands"
5,"A good phone at this price point. The only drawbacks are charging (15w is way too slow, also fast charging is only displayed when u plug in the phone and later it charges the battery at a normal speed) and 3.5mm audio jack. Observed heating while playing cod but it's not that bad. Camera quality is good and gives you OK shots at night. Gives you 6-8 hrs screen time depending on the apps u r using & battery is k k .other than above exceptions everything looks good."
4,"I just bought this phone, used it for 20days.Here's my review for the same -1. Camera is really good 9/102. Audio quality is good, thougha little on the lower side 8/103. Battery life is bad, doesn't even last a day for me 2/104. Charging is too slow, like the older generation phones without any fast charging. Takes 2hrs for my phone to charge fully 2/105. Display is good and smooth 9/106. OneUI. This is my first samsung phone and I loved the software's look and feel, how the notifications and app drawer have amazing blur effects in the background. 8/107. Fingerprint reader is slow but accurate 7/108. Face recognition fails most of the time 3/109. Call quality and audio is amazing on this phone. It is very loud and crispy clear 10/1010. The phone gets heat up a lot, on the upper side of the body and screen, while charging as well as gaming. I'm actually scared to buy the 25w charger thinking that it might make the phone heat up even more 1/10"
5,"I have used for 3 days. I love its blazing fast performance. Display is crispy & vivid color it is the main attraction. Camera is mindblowing. Nightmode feature surprised me. Gaming performance is also awesome. This phone has also Dolby sound system that amaze me. Both side has speaker so its produces 3d like sound. It has Bixby assistant. Google assistantand bixby assistant both are very accurate to capture my voice commands. Fingerprint sensor is also fast and accurate. Ui experience is so cool. I personally like samsung keyboard. This phone has AR zone app. You can play with augmented reality models. And much more.Only one cons - Battery life is average.Samsung is popular for their brand value, reliability and customer support.I will never blame my decision to chose between oneplus 9/9R and this phone. Finally I can say, I am fully satisfied with this phone."
5,"Very good all round device from Samsung in this price bracket, bought it at just 42.5k during offer period. Upgraded from OP5T and SD835 to SD865, although OneUI lags behind Oxygen OS but knox is at it's best.Overall SD865 Performance 9/10Display 9/10UI 8/10 still missing oxygen OSSecurity and updates 10/10Battery 8/10Build quality 8/10 due to glastic backCharging support 7/10 due to 15W chargerMedia consumption experience 9/10Call quality and connectivity 9/10Rear camera 9/10Front camera 7/10Overall value for money 8.5/10Revision 1 after 10 days of usageWhoever are facing battery drain and overheating issues, please go and change battery settings and background app battery usage put all the apps either on ""sleep"" or ""deep sleep"" mode and your problem will be eliminated. I always get more than 7 hours of screen on time and battery lasts up to 36 hours."
5,"I purchased this phone after extensive research (~5 months) of YouTube reviews as well as real ownership experience from family and friends of many phones in the 25k to 40k INR price bracket.I was able to get this one at 38k after exchange of my existing phone.Have to say that this is the best one in this price range and even under 50k.All flagship features that a person would want are available at this price.And I'm speaking from experience of having used iPhone XS and OnePlus 7T Pro of my own parents.Haven't faced any heating (or even warming) issue except during initial setup.For people who still aren't convinced, I will update my review after using for 2 weeks and then again after a month if needed."
5,"In this era of 2MP macro-mono-depth stupidity in midrangers and budget-flagships, this device stands out with its pure functional and flagship-like camera setup. DEX is another amazing functionality, i wonder why people are not mentioning it in reviews. Samsung has promised 4 years of security updates and 3 android major updates. There are 9 5G bands, so i assume this phone is truly 5G-ready in India. These points were enough for me to shift to this phone. I read some reviews complaining heating issues and ordinary design of this phone. Though I am not a heavy gamer, I use my phone for a long consecutive times. It only got warm during initial setup. But there was NO heating issue otherwise. About design, it is a personal choice. I am not a fan of glass backs (am i the only one on this planet?) Phone still looks very premium in my opinion.I switched from OP5 after almost 4 years. OP5 was one-of-its-kind, and was ahead of its time. Sadly oneplus is no more the enthusiast brand that it was some years ago. Single band 5g, shady updates (i heard op7, op7t got slower with the updates), and i just hate that 2/5 MP mono camera  that op is standardizing these days. Concluding, Samsun S20 FE 5G is a perfect choice for someone who is looking for non flashy, simple design yet truly functional and non-gimmicky experience in a device that can be used for around 3-3.5 years."
5,"Can be a direct competition to iPhone 12 but at a much cheaper price as iPhone 12 128 GB costs ₹84,900 meanwhile Samsung S20 FE 5G costs ₹47,900. I binged watched YouTube videos about S20 FE 5G and comparisons with other phones such as the OnePlus 9 and iPhone 12. Also, this phone is MKBHD’s phone of the year for 2020.Software:- One UI is amazing and Samsung has promised 3 years of updates for this phone and have been regularly delivering on that promise by providing regular security updates since the last 6 months, according to my research through its reviews on YouTube. Regular updates haven’t been offered on OnePlus 9 as they tend to be half-baked and buggy updates since the last 2 years. Plus, additional Samsung features like Samsung Pay, Secure Photos, Samsung Dex, etc. are also very useful.- Samsung and Windows partnership has made it easy to use phone with your windows laptop. Works fine and is helpful. I guess it’s the closest it can get to iPhone Airdrop and sync feature with MacBook.- 60Hz and 120Hz works greats and keeps the phone smooth. iPhone 12 only has 60Hz but it runs as smooth due to its powerful Apple chip.Hardware:- Glass + plastic back which feels amazing to touch and doesn’t feel cheap to look or feel.- Great cameras which correct colour balance, and sharpness- much better than OnePlus 9. Videos are also sharp.- Mic and Front Facing stereo features are loud and clear. No call drops or cell tower problems on using Airtel and Vodafone. Dual sim works fine.- Includes a charger unlike iPhone 12.- IP68 water resistant and dust resistant rating which is missing on OnePlus 9.- Wireless charging and reverse charging works great to charge wireless earphones and wireless charging mobiles. Meanwhile wireless charging is missing on OnePlus 9.- Phone gets slightly hot when intense gaming is done on it. But it’s not unbearably hot and doesn’t throttle.- GeekyRanjit confirmed from Samsung that it has 9 bands of 5G as compared to Oppo or OnePlus phones in this range which only offer 2 or 3 bands of 5G hence this is more future ready for any 5G band that comes to India in the future.Battery Life:- With the in box charger, phone takes about 2 hours to charge from 0-100% and lasts all day depending on normal usage of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and some light gaming.Price:- While a 128 iPhone 12 costs ₹84,900, the same 128 GB Samsung S20 FE 5G variant costs lesser at ₹47,700 and also has additional micro-SD card slot which can expand the storage upto 1 TB. There is no such option on the iPhone.- Hybrid sim slot can be used with 1 sim + 1 SD card or with 2 sims instead.Final Verdict:It’s the best phone to get in this range. Has a balance of features - much more than a typical midrange phone and also gets some features from its flagship series S20. It also has a bigger battery than its elder brother - S20. It has all the features to make a good all rounder phone and should be able to last 3-4 years with regular updates and 9 5G bands making it more versatile to be compatible with all Indian 5G telecom providers whenever they launch 5G service in India."
4,"Initial impression in one dayPros1. Display2. Back camera3. Sound4. Ip68 protectionand many moreCons1. Slow charging with 15w. If you are even upgrading from any phones with 30w charger, you would notice big difference2. Front camera is good. But, not that great3. Important point to note: type c to 3.5 mm connector won't work in this phone. Tried 3 connectors. None worked. Then after searching got to know that it will support only samsung connector. Get a Bluetooth headset if you're planning to buy"
2,"Beautiful product with some flaws in execution.I have browsed several reddit forums and samsung members community app only to find that issues around display are recurring in this device.1. Ghost touches - this I didn't face. Some people had reported that screen takes touch inputs on its own.2. Brightness banding - this is what happens when you are looking at a phone in a dark room (like I did before sleeping, scrolling through social media). If a background is grey, it is very uneven, with some portions of screen dimly lit and others brightly lit. It becomes very irritating since we use dark mode to conserve battery. Whatsapp looked brighter in the upper half, so did chrome when all tabs were closed and any grey/greyish tone for that matter didn't look perfect. What's worse is that samsung in India says this is a characteristic of the display and therefore, it cannot be repaired/replaced. I saw enough red flags and just returned it within 7 day window to get full refund. You can refer to the first pic, this is how my display was. Search on google - ""Samsung S20 FE banding"" to see more such cases.3. Green tint - again related to grey background in a dark room with low brightness, where grey can look green. I have uploaded this, refer to 2nd image. Not my unit but someone received it with that issue.Search on google - ""Samsung S20 FE Green Tint"" to see more such cases.While the device offers a lot at such a compelling price, it's futile if faulty units in large quantities have been manufactured. Sours the user experience - samsung giving a snapdragon phone in India was the only reason I bought it, and now had to return an otherwise perfect device marred with display issues."
5,I have used Samsung phones with its Stock exnos processor but believe me Snapdragon in Samsung is simply awesome.
5,"I have personally got the cloud mint color, guys it's just amazing and a real treat to the eyes, it's so refreshing and calming plus the feel of the entire device is very good.Pros:>Display>Battery>Speakers>Camera (Front & Rear)>Weight is also okayHave been using for a month now, till not found any con as such, charger could have a little better,  but again the one provided in the box charges decently well without any issue.If you are planning to buy, go for it.In 50k range, the best device you can get.Value for money."
5,"This is easily one of the best phone Samsung has ever made. The overall specs and performance matches that of flagships with a price that is substantially less. It's an easy recommendation and the best smartphone available in its sub Rs 50,000 segment.Samsung's build quality, design and display beats other brands and it also comes with a great camera setup. Smooth 120Hz AMOLED display with a powerful Snapdragon chip gives crazy fast performance on Android 11. It has LPDDR4X RAM and fast UFS 3.1 storage and there are no lags at all even when playing demanding games.Lastly, you get wireless charging with reverse charging support. I have not had any issues with battery so far and it lasts a full day for me. Some might complain that the bundled charger does not give you fast charging. At least you get a charger, and fast charging almost always results in battery degradation over time.To summarize, if you want a feature packed phone with flagship performance at a great price, go for it. I personally avoid buying Chinese brands and have been a Samsung user for many years now. My previous phone was Samsung A50 which lasted for more than 3 years. You don't get the software support, build quality and peace of mind with similar phones by Chinese brands."
5,"After researching for months to replace my old workhorse MotoZ2force, I zeroed in samsung s20fe(exonys). But was vary of the processor.So when they launched the SD one I was Intrigued.However a price difference of 10k was something I didn't want to afford.So one day I got a 400p rs coupon on Amazon so I bought it instantly.After cashback etc I got it for 41773, which is a steal. I would repeat, unless S21Fe is launched this phone is a steal anywhere under 45k.I lost my last phone due to water damage so IP68 protection was must which only A72 was offering.It also have many 5G bands but that should not be the reason to buy a phone at this time.The camera quality is good, see some samples.The image stabilization is great(see the moonshot.The sensor is not that great as my older motoz2force, but the software makes up for it.Also the 3x zoom lens comes handy in many situations.Display is great 120HZ is great but even 60hz(which automatically switches to 60hz in battery saver mode) is good and a normal user won't pick a difference.Fingerprints reader is great. In last 15 days I have not encountered any issues at all.I mainly use the face unlock which works most of the time.Finally, we Indians should start recognizing the value of software also and only the hardware specs. The UI is simple on one hand and highly customizable on the other.If you explore a bit then you can automate many tasks and increase the battery life also.Many people complain about only 15 watt charger in box. Well fast charging is good in many cases, but it reduces your battery life. And the 65 watt charging advertisement by chinese ones may see like wow but in a few months you will see how this fast charging reduces your battery backup and life. Call me old fashioned buy I am more than Ok with slow charging."
4,"One of the best alternative to One Plus and iphone 11. Camera is good. The phone looks Premium . Gaming is smooth. The only drawback is 4500 mah battery and the 15watt charger in the box. However, it supports  upto 25 watt."
5,Decent phone. All flagship galaxy features includedCharging speed is very slow. Not recommended for gaming

5,"I had Samsung s8 2 years back and had been using pixel 3a for 1.5 years and that has been a awesome experience. So, when I had to choose a new phone, I had double thoughts of going to Samsung as I had liked the UI before one UI. After, research, I reluctantly, went ahead and bought this beauty. Experience using this phone has been great, liked the smoothness of the display and camera app. has lot of options which help in enhancing the limitations of the camera compared to pixel phones.Battery could have been better and charger should have been 25W instead 15W.Over-all,  very happy to have this phone!!! Go for it!!!"
4,"Its a good mid price range phone.1.

1,Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
4,If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
1,Camera quality is not good. It is mentioned as 13mp but the motion of the camera is like 2mp. Phone is very slow in operation even though it is 3gb RAM . More over it is MADE IN CHINA.
5,"Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."
5,"If I started to rating it's all features, it will as followed (Out of 5 🌟):Processor ⭐⭐⭐⭐Display ⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐Battery ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Sound in loud ⭐⭐⭐Sound in 3.5 mm cord ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Camera Selfie ⭐⭐⭐Camera Back ⭐⭐⭐⭐Networking ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Lack:There is no Fingers print sensor locked.There is no Back cover in the box.Camera quality not so good."
4,"I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
1,Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!
3,"Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other"
5,Worst phone.. overall performance is just bakwaz....don't buy...always hangs
3,"COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"
1,"Compass is not working, showing error as required sensor are not available,And everything is fine."
1,"Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. 😞. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone 📱, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% 😀. The phone is too lightweight ☺️ and very handy😄 Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. 😃.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. 😭GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. 😠😠.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. 😥. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good 👍But it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. 😠Display quality is too poor. 😫 Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. 🥺  No led in front of the display.😰Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection 😥If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or above🤗 with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy."

5,Awesome product at low price.Compatible productFast and best batteryLess time more battery chargeAnd does not drain battery.Amazing product
4,"Advantage :3GB+32 For Rs. 7498/-With 6.5 Inch & 5000 mah Battery Acceptable.Disadvantage :*No Finger Print Sensor*Front Camera is 5 MP Only, if it's 8 MP & Rear Side 13+5 MP means little acceptable.Over all Ok."
3,No finger print....there is vast color difference in picture & actual . there is no matching in SEA BLUE color. piece received with DARK Blue colorotherwise good gadget at this price.
4,Quite goodBattery and build quality is betterBut camera and speakers are okok.
5,Screen is big and crisp battery backup is great. You can find lag here and there but manageable don't expect gaming in this phone. Camera is below average. All together phone feels premium in look with below average performance. If tou are planning to buy in this budget no phone will beat this phone.
5,"Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
3,Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
5,It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
5,"Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"
2,Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
3,"This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked priceMi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.Need Improvement.Processor is best for browsering , social networkingThis processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.Battery capacity is awesome ♥️ no need to say. brightness level is good and it also handle with sun. Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses"
3,Weary good product  very fast delivery
3,"Points to be noted:👉 The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.👉 This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.👉 Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.👉 Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.👉 After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone."
5,"Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best. Display is huge(20:9).Camera is above par.Performance is good.Overall best package.5/5 for Rs.6800."
5,Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
2,Phone is good. But it is made in China
5,Wow
1,"I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available. You can replace only. So, please don't buy this worst product. Even for first time im facing that amazon support also not supporting in this issue. I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon."
4,"Good mobile,in this corona times if we want quality product for basic regular usage,this Redmi 9a 3 gb /32 bestCamera is average like all entry-level mobiles,Redmi might send an update for small big fixes like every new mobile launch,gcam till now not available,with that quality of camera increasesDesign display very good,slim tall mobileBattery very good,takes 2.5 hours for full charge,so better charge when 40 % battery left.People who are planning to buy 4 gb /64 gb Redmi 9a,don't take it ,best to go for Redmi 9 as we get finger print scanner, slightly better speed,camera and build quality for just 700rs moreSpeed of Redmi 9a is good for 3- 4 appsCons:No gorilla glass protectionNo Secondary noise cancelling mic,this is big mistake by redmi as they give in every mobileNo Finger print scannerFinally under 10,000 rs all Redmi 9 series mobiles are very best as they provide 4 gb ram variant in very price segment,only option we have"
2,Worst camera ever...both front & back... & Screen resolution is not good.
4,"So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5⭐ for thatPros-•Low price, wont get any other phones in this range• Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.•Good for basic usage.•Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:•camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)•Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use⭐"
5,Awesome camera Awesome battery Awesome display  ....Super clear ZoomSuper Macro sensorSuper ultrawide angleAtlast Thanks Samsung for 730G
1,"My review after three months use:I am reducing it to one stars after three months use. Initially I gave five star. Reasons of giving one star is:1) the phone is over priced and it's actual price should be not more than 13-14K.2) occassionally it's back panel heats up.3) design is poor, especially at the back camera panel space above the flashlight is unutilized and don't look premium. Much cheaper mobile phones have better design.3) the whole body including screen, back panel and camera panel is very sensitive to scratches. You have to cover with phone case and screen guard immediately otherwise your phone will give a dirty look full if scrates after one week use.3) no IP rating. Forget water proofing, not a trace of water resistance. You have to prevent it from humidity and sweating.4) screen refresh rate is poor in comparison to other phones available below 10K range.Following was my review after almost one week use. __________________________________At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory. Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced."
1,"Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000. I have  doubt  its not 7000 man battery its like 2000 or 2500mah. Heating  issue also faced during  charging."
1,"Genuine Feedback to samsung and all buyersNot Upto the Mark..Battery is good, but mobile is very heavy.. not handy for one hand operation.. if you use it continuously then you feel pain in your  hand, designed is out dated, poor quality material.. camera is just okay..I am not happy overall performance of this phone at this price band...Mobile should be perfect for 15-16k price band..Lookwise not goodDisplay qaulity is just good not bestSound quality is goodCamera not much good that I am expecting.Big screen which perfect for movie watcher.. but after 30 minutes you feel pain in your hands.I bought Electric blue colour, it's look like samsung old samrt phone .My request to Amazon, is it possible to return this mobile. Then help me for return...I am not happy with overall performance of the phone..."
5,"Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage"
1,"There's something wrong with the new Samsung M51 mobile. Many other users are also facing the same issue. We are unable to connect through Wi-Fi on Samsung M51.Meanest Monster Ever ... HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi.Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says ""Incorrect Password"".I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1. Forget the connection and reconnect again.2. Update the phone s/w to latest version.3. Reset Settings4. Reset Network Settings5. Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened. Instead a replacement of this phone should be there, I have not even used it for more than an hour.Last year I ordered an MI phone from Flipkart, the battery was getting drained very fast. Within the next day, the phone was replaced without questions asked.Dissappointed by Amazon, the way they are handling this issue.Don't spend your hard-earned money on this phone. Unfortunately, if your phone turns-out to be faulty, then there is a never ending process to take care of issue."
1,"Usually I don't write the reviews, but this time I couldn't resist myself from doing so.First of all, I am a Samsung hater, but my wife didn't want a chinese brand phone, so I had no option than to go with Samsung. Therefore, this review may look like bias, but believe me, it's not.Doesn't look like a 27K phone. Screen looks so dull compared to my 3 years old one plus 5t phone. UI is boring. Stock android would have been appreciated. 3 finger screenshot feature is not available (though there are other ways, this one is easiest). Out of 8Gb 3.2Gb RAM was showing as used out of the box. Out of 128Gb , 32Gb was showing as used. Neither of the camera was impressive. There are some default apps (bloatware) which are absolutely useless. They didn't even provide the silicon transparent cover with the phone. The only good thing about this phone is - it is very bulky (this is not the sarcasm, I really like bulky phones)Anyway, I won't be using this phone, but feeling very bad that I spent this much of money for such a cheap phone 😥"
1,"Call quality is poor. When loud speaker is on, Cannot hear properly on the other side, call is muffled or breaking. Do someone else face this similar issue ? Is there any way to fix. I could not raise a ticket to contact either Amazon or samsung. Camera quality is also average.  Hated it.Updated review after 20 daysStarted facing charging issuesStopped charging suddenly, don't know what to doNo more replacement from AmazonNice lesson learnt:1. Don't fall into the trap of extensive hype of a product2. Don't believe youtubers reviews just before experiencing atleast 30 days of usage.3. Don't buy a product on its first day of launch4. Read the return and replacement policy thoroughly before buying."
2,"I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6. Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7. When Sealed Package open then phone display contain so much dust. Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8. Gorila Glass 3 protection under 25k i.e out dated glass protection after using 2 days with full care i got one scratch mark on display.9. NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10. Audio output in my boat rockers bluetooth headset with this phone is not as much as lound as compare to my previous phone Redmi Note 7 pro.11. Without using phone it take 2 hour to charge but when you use it frequently then it take 2.30-3 hour to charged it full from 0-100%.12. Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13. No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good. When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4. Till now Ram management is goodTo much hype created every where for this phone and due to this many user like me has purchased this phone but this phone under 25k is really not value for money. I am going to resale this phone. There are so many phone below 25k with best facilities as compare to this Samsung m51.Conclusion : Phone is overpriced and performance is average"
1,"1.On playing games, sound is too too less.2.Flash light too dull3. 7000Mah battery, all fake battery only last one day or one and a half day max4. There is no Broadband speed  indicator5.live wallpaper option not goodBetter avoid this phone, dont fall for advertisements"
5,"This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8. If you need all trending features to be covered in non Chinese mobile,THEN GO FOR IT... ALSO TRY TO UPDATE TO LATEST SOFTWARE ONCE AFTER SETTING UP YOUR MOBILE, OTHERWISE HEATING ISSUE WILL BE THERE."
5,"After using for more than 2 day's I must say, snapdragon 730g works wonderful .CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mega Pixcel and more feature in selfie camera.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also."
5,"My take after using the handset for 4 days:1. Display: Superb. Big, crystal clear, bright and everything you can expect from a samsung super amoled plus screen.2. Camera: Very good. Night mode could have been better.3. Sound: Speakers: Better than average, earphones: good4. Battery: Very good. But expected more backup from a 7000 mah battery. Had to charge it once a day for the last 4 days.5. UI: The one-ui provided here is different from the one provided in A series. The one that comes with A series phones like A50 etc is more user friendly and has more features like Secure folder, timer etc. Also, the Samsung notes app in A series is far better than the one provided here. In this price, an UI at par with the leading A series phones is expected.6. Processor: Good for normal use.7. Finger print unlock is fast and smooth.8. No case/ back cover and no earphone.9. A bit overpriced."
2,"It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos. When photo is clicked with lens covered completely,  it shows hundreds of white spots in image, same happens with pro mode too. (This is not regular image noise)"
1,"I have been using this from starting. Ordered on 18th sep and get this phone very next day 19th. Here is my overall review.1. Battery - tremendous and optimization is on next level2. Display - It's great display ever.3. Speed - faster then ever ( compared to my other phones )4. Gaming - Very powerful no laging ( played COD, Hitman Sniper, Asphalt 9)But wait, in the meantime I've faced some issues on the phone as well.1. Voice call - call is fine but when call is placed on speaker children voice could not be heard by other. On normal call it's perfect but on speaker it's not. Adult voice can be heard from a distance but children voice can't. even the phone is just near the face. This issue can lead you the problem while you're on whatsapp video call as well. First I thought it was just whatsapp issue but after certain test it's major issue on voice call. Tested with safe mode and also after factory reset (without any other third party applications)2. Fingerprint sensor - It's fine and fast. But wait. you need to setup both hands fingers so it's easy to use. Maybe if the finger print sensor placed on in-display then it's better than this but if you map with both hand fingers and thumb then it's easy. Other wise you've to wait for 30 seconds if the finger not matched for 5 times.3. Galaxy Apps - Disable it otherwise unnecessary apps and bloatware will be install automatically.4. Knox - It's displaying secured by Knox but secure folder is not there. Which should be.I have replaced the product but still the microphone issue is there so plz be carefull with this."
3,"1. NO secure folder option, This phone SUCKS.2.Processor is old same as A80 (launched in April 19)2. Display is Good3. Back Panel (it's plastic wanna be glass;) , watch it on the first and last time at unboxing cause it won't be same anymore)4. Not Camera monster it's a camera average, they show 64 MP its 64 MP, which takes 3-6 seconds for one snap. Till then moment is already gone.5. Battery works only for a day.For 27K it doesn't worth it.Don't buy it, seriously."
4,"Initial experiences:- Adaptive brightness/ Ambient Display: Frequent screen flickering and unstable; had to disable.- Fingerprint Scanner: Poor quality, frequently asks you to wipe..- No preapplied screen film or back-case supplied.+ Nice AMOLED panel and crisp viewing experience.+ Not bulky or uneasy to hold contrary to common perception.+ Biiig battery which lasts looong.+ Good reception and call quality.+ Not Chinese+ Better than Oneplus Nord (don't look at 5G, let our 4Gs work efficiently as of now!)+ Top notch performance."
5,"First impressions: the celestial black colour looks really good and elegant. Looks better than in pics or videos. The phone feels solid in hand. The screen is large and great quality punchy colors. The screen is also very bright.Performance too seems good except that the real performance will be known a while later as Samsung mobile tend to slow down with time. The back is a fingerprint magnet, so a case is a must.The battery is really a beast and charger is decent too. Battery easily lasts 2 days with average use, even with heavy use it lasts one and a half days.Camera Performance is great at this price. The pictures and videos come out great.I got the 6gb variant with hdfc offer and with HDFC smart buy, the price should come down to 22000. Its a great phone at this price. Most of the cons mentioned in online reviews are not for me. I am happy with this phone.Why I preferred M51 over Nord? M51 ticks all the right boxes for me. A great screen for watching videos, good casual gaming, a great battery lasting at least 2 days, a better camera, 128 gb storage with microsd card support  and at a price which is Rs. 3000  cheaper. I already have Samsung and Oneplus phones at home. So I can say with confidence that you won't go wrong with any of the brand.My overall first impression is that its a great phone with almost all things that one may need at this price. Will keep updating."
3,"Camera - GoodFast charge - GoodDisplay - AwesomePerformance - GreatBattery Backup - It's Not Like 7000mah, Average ( Like 4000mah ) Need Optimization2-3 times Play Store Getting Crashed....Otherwise Good to Buy.......Amazon very good Delivery.......NoEarphone And Softcase"
1,"I have ordered this mobile on the first day of the sale at 12 o clock sharp. Yes there are some good features, But let's talk only about the CONS. The reason for talking about the CONS as the PROS are talked by other friends.  1) Vibration of the mobile is more and can't hold the mobile for longer time.  2) Mobile is higher priced compared to other same configuration devices and no tempered glass or case has been provided.  3) Guys Please check the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR Value) before buy any mobile and in this its more which affects Head and Body and not good for health.  4) Weight of the mobile is MORE and finally I won't recommend this."
1,I received the phone on the very next day of the sale.Unfortunately I am facing issue with loudspeaker and mic. So the primary thing of a phone (calling) is not working properly.Even after replacement facing the same issue.
4,"Charging and display quality is good..No hangsHeating is not obsereved during charging or using mobile.Diasble galaxy store otherwise bloatware is installed continuously.I didn't find mobile is heavy , weight management is excellent. Otherwise it's as usual normal android.. phone.. camera I didn't like much both front and back useless. I purchased this phone esp for display and battery. For small hands mobile is bit tall not width wise..Macro photo lots of granules seeing.. I think in my phone macro lens is defective.. speaker output is not good. 3.2 gb ram used out of 8 gb by default .."
5,Great phone with good battery life the battery usually lasts for 2 days on light usage and charges super quick
5,"Pros:1. Value for money buy at 23k considering the offers.Try to get it at this price range by bank offers being offered.2. Camera is brilliant.Compared to OnePlus Nord and others in this price range.3. Snapdragon 730G optimized very well.Processor is snappy.Compared to other brands (realme 7 pro, one plus nord), it gives faster perfomance as it has been properly optimized.4. Battery is the top selling point for this phone.I have to take office calls for 5/6 hours a day, including webex meetings with wifi always on.It still last me 1.5 days.5. Display is excellent even though it is providing 60 hz refresh rate.Amoled display of samsung is brilliant as always.Cons:1. Back is plastic. Does feeling like a 25k phone.But as 7000mah battery had to be adjusted in a compact way, samsung had to compromise  with the design.2. 4k/1080p videos can't  record in 60fps.Doesn't  bother me much, it depends on your preference."
1,"Samsung delivered defective piece and had to gone through replacement cycle. Believe me, on Amazon getting replacement is not easy.  It was a manufacturing defect.Do see your phone thoroughly, as soon as you receive to check for defect.*** Amazon has no return policy on electronic items, even if product is damaged. They dont care. ***Finally after getting product :Camera, User Interface : GoodHeavy (because of mega battery). Its a big phone, so personally I am not finding it handy.Battery life : still need to find."
5,"This is the best phone in 25000 segment  730G processor with 7000 mah battery with 25w fast chargingThe display quality is amazing as it is S amoled panelThe 64 mp camera captures amazing details it also has night mode and slowmo, hyperlapse, one take, macro camera is not good tho . It tried fortnite it can run on medium graphics with 30fps limit and its pretty smooth thanks to 730G . The front facing camera quality is very good  i have attached pic of  ram usuage with no background app running one thing i didnt like was u cannot zoom in when u set to 64mp camera mode and it is filled with unnecessary apps like daily hunt and many others"
3,"Well, as compared to the same feature range phones. The price seems to be 2-3k high. But if you are bored of charging your phone every 6 hours, you have a relief here with 7000 mAh battery, which doesn't  disappoint you.  I choose primarily for the battery and it lived up to the point that it stated. With playing 1 hour of playing COD, using hotspot for a full day and browsing it lasted for more then 40 hours and there is a battery saver mode too, which will last for a week if you are travelling out and need to use phone for only call and minimum usage.But, if you are a non-stop gamer it will last a day depending on the usage.Pros:Display is good, performance is fine, battery is stand out. The camera is also good and bixby vision is cool. Many edited features come with the camera, that is added advantage. Sensors are good and fast too. The weight is well balanced, you won't feel the weight after a day's usage. Charging is quite quick. Rest of phone's features are fine.Cons:Plastic built body, no tempered glass or case is provided within the box. The speakers are located at the bottom which is uncomfortable if we hold the phone in two hands and watch videos or play games. In dark, the screen display may cause some burden to the eyes, which I did not face earlier. The background apps keeps running until you close them or optimize the battery which will automatically close all the background running appVerdict:Little high-priced, very good battery and a satisfactory performance."
3,"Awesome phone..all good reviews..1.definitely heavy, what else u can expect with huge 7000 battery, yet manageable.. u cant hold and watch movies or matches for long u need a stand..have to use Bluetooth or wired headset while talking as its heavy, u feel it slips off2. Stunning display amoled at its best..watched Enola holmes3. need back cover else scratches will be evident glaringly and lose its premium feelMost important worrying fact is SAR value at 1.3, the only fact I am disappointed with samsung..u can check dailling *#07#..ps samsung are valued for low sarAudio loud speaker I am not satisfied"
1,"Ibought it for 24,999 but now it's 19,499. Cheap phone but samsung looted me. Be aware of foreign countries. Either is Chinese or any other."
1,"I have been using Samsung Phones ever since they ventured into Smart Phones. I had privilege of using majority of Samsung Phones like Galaxy S2, Samsung Grand, Samsung S6, Samsung S9+, Samsung Note 3 and Samsung S10.When Samsung launched M51, like many I think I am also fooled by aggressive marketing campaign and youtube reviews by youtubers like Technical Guruji (I unsubscribed his channel due to fraud review)Why I purchased this phone because ofBrand SamsungExpected Good Camera SetupExpected Good Build QualityExpected Good PackagingAnd for this I have paid good price of INR 25KWhy I am disappointedBuild quality is quite inferior it's cheap plastic that use to come in phones like Karbon or Lava in 2012-2013.Camera setup is quite average, they say it's triple camera but picture quality is not so great, night shots are average, I think if you buy brands like Xiaomi you get better pictures by spending less amount. Probably that's why Samsung is marketing Single Take feature, which I think won't work if camera is average.Packaging, after paying INR 25K one expects box to include stuff like Phone Cover as these days majority of manufacturers, but here it comes with cheap quality of Box, that has nothing but a cheap charger with very poor quality of packaging, now a days many manufacturers are also putting the screen protectors at cheap cost, Samsung should take a note.Phone weighs quite heavy and is not easy to use with one hand, this is something nobody is telling, probably thats the only reason Samsung has degraded the build quality.What is good about this phoneBattery - Certainly that's the only feature for which I paid INR 25K. But are you willing to pay this much for a phone that's more of power bank.Headphone Jack - Samsung has retained it, and it's output is pretty good.Apart from that phone has same processor like Samsung A80, which comes with better camera setup and better build quality.Therefore I feel Samsung is over charging customers for this device and it should not cost more then INR 15K - 18K.So if you are only looking for battery and headphone jack then spend money on this one and If anyone wants to contact me I am ready to resell mine at 20%  discount.I wish they had option of giving zero stars.Amazon I am sorry this is my worst ever Amazon shopping experience which I regret everyday when I see what I got."
5,"EDIT : I have added 7 days battery usage video, please use that as new reference for battery usage.Original :Before you read the review, please know that I mainly use my phone for productivity and social media. I do not game heavily or photograph heavily.To me the best part about it is the display. I've never used an OLED display and moving from standard LCD to OLED is magical. The system wide dark mode support makes everything look sexy black!The battery is super powerful, although I've to use it for more days to give a better review. From what I experienced, you can easily get 12-15 hours of screentime at least, spanning over 2 days. The charging is as advertised, taking around 2 hours for a full charge.I'm not a camera enthusiast beyond some selfies and occasional landscape photography when I travel. The camera provided satisfied my expectations. Please look at same photographs attached, bearing in mind that light conditions were not optimal and I'm not an expert at the art. Also, it has Cam2 API support, so you can install a Google Camera mod and tweak the settings to your liking.This phone is worth it for the display and battery for me. It has everything I expected. Only disappointment is that it doesn't come with a cover or screenguard, while other manufacturers provide that even at this range."
3,"After 48 hours of usageVery much excited when I saw the specs. but!!!!Pros:1. Display2. Procesor  SD730G3. Camera4. Fast chargingCons:1. audio not loud getting crack sound in speaker mode2. Battery (it's 7000Mah) but discharging quickly(I didn't play games, I used it only calls, and YouTube). I felt like its a 4000Mah.3. Backside material looks very cheap. attracts lots of fingerprints4. Price is very high.5. Back case is not provided. (Phone is slippery need to handle with care or buy back case).After all, I feel this phone average for this price. (*** stars)if the price is 19999/- with this specs my price is (***** stars)"
1,Phone heats up while using camera for few minutes.Writing this just in one day of usageOther feedbacks in few daysHeating a lot.. worst ever experience  with Amazon
1,"I bought Samsung M51 on launch day itself! Within 2 days of usage, screen started flickering. Even Samsung customer care said that it's faulty screen"
1,"This mobile phone have many problems such as WiFi  issues  , Bluetooth issues,  saving pdf issues , sometimes light sensors not works , app is not working  ( showing many times) .This OS is CORE version  not as A series galaxy smartphones.I think in m51 is a experimental device by Samsung  .Samsung  inserted many apps from A series  maybe  this creates  problems  , because  its OS is core .Before purchasing M51 keep this things in mind  .I recognized after 17 days of using this .I mean to say , it creates problems after 17 days of using  .And now I am unable to return this mobile M51 .Service center told me this , its a OS problem  , after few days all m51 smartphone will get Software updates  .  Or to submit M51 to Service center  to get value of this smartphone  as a coupon,  which I will redeem coupon in exclusive Samsung showrooms  ."
5,GOOD OVERALL PHONEBATTERY IS HUGE USING PHONE FROM 7 AM ( 100% ) BATTERYPLAYED GAME FOR 50 MINUTEINSTAGRAM FOR 40 MINUTEMANY CALLS TOODID MAILING & TEXTING ALSO IN WHATSAPPWEBWHATSAPP IS ON FROM 9 AMWORKING FINE TILL NOWCAMERA IS WONDERFUL & WILL TRY ASPHALT 9 & THAN EDIT THIS REVIEWAT 5.20 PM ITS 76% BATTERYNow after use of many daysPhone works the same just one problem some time phone get disconnected automatically i don't  know if it is problem of phone or something else overallMust buy product for sure
5,Straight to the point :Purchased in first saleReceived : 20sep2020- Really heavy can start wrist pain if not used properly (but including 7000mah in this weight is surprisingly excellent. Kudos to samsung)- Headphone jack is a boon ...although I use TWS but a headphone jack is a must.- Battery can be stretched more than 1.5 days with normal usage. But initially need to disable every background app to get optimized battery life.- Glastic back panel is shiny but will not give premium feel.- Fingerprint is decent but getting used to side mount will take time.- Not for osmo mobile 3 (which I have tested and also try to upload video) uncomfortable to load and unload.- Excellent camera and video esp macro- Selfie cam is also good- Requires some adaptor to charge old phones. Mi cable is good converter & charging cable for usb mini- Speaker is average- Bloatware is there but can be disabled ...- 6gm ram and snapdragon processor does the job efficiently.- No hapticsA nice decent phone from Samsung.Pro Tip : Never buy a phone on the basis of whats new always buy on the basis of what you need. You can if you've extra bucks ;)Unboxing will be soon available on YouTube : IemMihir.Don't know but my initial review was deleted and I had to write this again.
1,"As mentioned by Samsung 7000 mh battery but battery drains very fast at the end of day when I am using internet,watching videos. Battery needs to carry for two days at 7000mh but it is not carry one day also. Please do not buy this product. Display is also very bad super amoliad  Display is fake some times video shows red faces. It is not zero edge after full Display video get cutted from the edges of phone display. Speaker sound is third class not upto the mark what we expect from Samsung. Handset provided doubly atmos but when I use headphones also can't find atmos experience. Very bad handset on this range better you can buy Samsung m31s for that.I provide 1 out of 10 ratings for this set. Its a garbage set."
5,"I purchased it on 18 September on 12:01 pm with no delay as I wanted to buy this amazing phone by Samsung. Surprisingly  it was delivered on the same day within 6 hrs. Now I have used it for almost a week and can give my overview about the phone. I will provide you the main pros and cons of Samsung M51PROS:#SuperAmoledPLUSdisplay believe me it is one of the best display I have ever seen on mobiles. You will love the premium quality while watching video and seeing photographs infact reading on this mobile feels great.#Camera: Amazing camera quality it gives natural colors, dynamic contrast ratio is better than the phones come between the price range of 30 to 40 thousand. Daylight images are just magical. 64mp camera is just awesome. 12mp macro lense gives you amazing details. Wide angle for selfish lovers where you will get most of the function get works automatically. One take picture is just amazing too. I can say you will not get such camera performance  in other phones even if you choose any phone having price beyond 40000.#Battery: Believe me if you are a normal user your battery will not get ended before the third day. If you are moderate users of phone it will give you atleast 2 days of battery backup. And if you are a hard-core mobile user you will not able to drain this battery in one single day.#UserfriendlyOneUI: what a lovely UI, very smooth , no confusing icons, better placement of folders in my files. Categorization of items by samsung is awesome anyone can use this with no difficulty. Your pics, videos, recordings, documents  everything will be kept in right place and believe me it will make you so happy as you don't have to find anything here and there.#Snapdragon730G: what a great thing to have both thing in your phone one the brand Samsung and another the processor snapdragon. Yes this processor  made M51 a great choice. Snapdragon helps to improve your gaming performance plus it also helps in smooth functioning  of different apps. No lag while viewing videos, playing games and making calls.CONSLook these are my point of views may be the cons don't have any value for most of the users.#Size: The size of phone is 6.7inch which can be a bit big for many users especially having small hands. Besides, bike riders who use to go offices daily may find this phone challenging while keeping inside the jeans pocket.#Body: the body of phone is glastik and it is so scratchable that means you have to buy the backcover as soon as possible. Using backcover and tempered  glass is advisable. This is not a big cons as now a days we all use back cover in all phones so don't take it as negative one.Hope you will like the review and it will help you give you idea of purchasing the phone."
1,Battery Backup not seems to be 7000mAh.Whatsapp video call getting disconnected mentioning some error in microphone.Phone started hanging on normal usages..
4,"I've been using this phone for 4days now.I will share my review with pros and cons:cons:1.It feel like a cheap phone idk why,there are some phones in this price segment ""looks"" premium.2.No LED notification,a major missing.3.Rear Camera is not that good in default,but when we changed to 48MP it looks ""kinda"" good.It seems like good in this price segment.4.Its little bit getting Hot while charging and I feel some Hottnes while taking photos(maybe coz of outside temperature)5.It takes quite a bit to get fully charged,yah the battery is 6000 but its fast charging with 18W.6.so much pre installed apps(we can uninstall it) and also like previously,we have to go through each app to disable ""Recommendations""Pros:1.Very light weight and it doesn't feel a massive 6000 is inside2.Front camera is Superb! good detailed pics in portrait.3.Battery is so good.I use the phone to take a lot of pictures and use it for 1 hr swiping through Instagram,the battery doesn't notice that at all lol(its pretty good)4.Stereo speaker does that job GOOD5.For games,ya with a medium settings it is good for 1hr continuous gaming after that it gets little hot but there is no overheating like that issue till now.This is all I can remember,I will try to update if I notice it afterwards."
3,"Redmi 9 Power Electric Green (4+128)(FIRST 24-HOURS REVIEW)• A phone with Superb Design and unique colours• I have purchased electric green colour and believe it is really superB in looks• Heavy in weight but its okey as it looks fine in hands• Dual stereo speakers with ultimate sound quality!! BUT BUT BUT !!• Redmi claimed 6000mAh Battery, means we think that it will go through atlest ""1 & Half day to 2 days"" of battery backup in one charge, But there is nothing like that.• The Battery will Last go to 1 day of maximum backup only if limited use.(I charged the phone full in last evening by 7pm and its 1 pm today righ now and it is 55% left with no use as i am using it as a secondary phone, means the Remaining 55% battery will last longer to 11pm. The total battery backup without use of phone will go to 28 Hours, as i am using it as a secondary phone with no whatsapp, youtube or any kind of internet surfing with this phone)• It means if u want to use it as a primary phone with whatsapp, youtube, and other internet features then i dont think so that it can give 1 day backup• Redmi claimed 22W Fast Charger with it, apart from it while using its own 22W fast charger it takes more then enough time to charge(It takes time to Charge full)• Camera quality is like hell, specially the front camera, Don't buy if u wants a Camera Quality in Mid Range phoneSummary:-Purchase it if u want as a secondary phonePurchase it if u want super outer looks with ultimate colour optionsPurchase it if u dont want good selfie camera quality (According to price range)Purchase it if u want a Good Looking Attractive Phone"
1,"Very Disappointed by the product. Camera quality is too bad. The only one thing is in phone is it has 6000mah Battery. Overall this product is very worst. Don't buy if you are looking it as a primary phone which has best camera, Storage & massive battery."
1,"Honest review after a week of usage -Do not make the mistake of buying this mobile. While the price point is competitive, it would make lot of sense to pay an extra 1000 and go for the Redmi Note 9 instead of Redmi 9 Power.This mobile has pathetic camera quality. It says 48 MP camera, but the quality is as good as 8 or 13 MP camera. Redmi note 9 having the same camera gives far better quality images. I am truly disappointed with the camera quality.So do not go on the Megapixels. This mobile honestly has very bad camera quality.The performance is OK. A snapdragon octacore processor does not do any justice as I have experienced good amount of lags while opening basic apps.The battery back up is good, but apart from that, there is nothing special about this phone.I regret buying this in the flash sale."
4,Ok Product
1,"Camera is very worst, In indoor lighting pictures are getting blurred, Front camera is something like 4 years back quality because it has only 8MP.When coming to back camera even with 48MP, photos are not clear.My suggestion is not to purchase this mobile, if you can bare 1000/- more, best choice is Redmi note9 or you can purchase realme phones with in this budget.I tried to return the product due to camera quality not expected, but return will not take return back due to quality issue for mobile phone.I purchased many Mobiles, but this is my first worst experience.So please don't by this mobile 🙏🙏🙏🙏"
1,"I bought Redmi 9 power blue (128 GB) in the first sale on 22nd Dec 2020.Amazon delivered it very speedy on 23rd Dec 2020.Reviews:1) Camera: Average for both front and back cameras.2) Sound: Good3) Battery: Drained very fastly, even charging is a bit slower, not looks like 6000 mah.4) Processor: slow processing and sometimes hang also. And touch is also responding slow.5) Games: I didn't try much yet.6) Weight: BulkyI bought it because of the camera but a little bit disappointed with it."

3,"I bought this mobile on the first sale 22 Dec 128 gb version, coming to the phone the miui is the same we find in other mi devices which is the reason I bought the phone but one this which I miss the most in MIUI 12 is the absence of second space(why Mi ❓)Pros: Good battery, 48MP back camera and MIUi 12cons: front camera(my redmi note 5 does a better job), no second space, a bit bulky when you hold the phone"
1,"Battery do`t work as specified 6000 mah. worst camera result ever. even new theme or fonts don't work. battery drain to fast. very chip on weight,look,speaker,display many more, friends first time a request you to please do not buy this phone. company try to achieve their position high that's why they start to deliver this type of chip product to customer.  In my home 7 mobile is redmi but i never seen this type of chip mobile ever. i am so sad after purchase this mobile. I need to my money Back."
1,"Firstly got too late delivery from amazon, no response from customer care representative. The product is now totaly different like stock Android and cheap like oppo, Vivo Xiaomi lossing his market. Quality also not upto the mark. It gives low performance even many times the miui stop the apps. Very very bad feeling to order this mobile.On second day of delivery it stuck on bootAnd keep restarting again & again.lastly i had to format it and i lost my data of year &year.Shamfull xiaomi. DONT BUY xiaomi phone with MIUI 12 it is worst than worst"
5,Redmi mobile is having features what we essential requitred.I m very happy with the new model.So far it's very nice and value for my.Wil review after couple of days usage.
4,Its value for money but if you are a selfie person than no pictures are ok but not too good I love everything about it
3,"Average performanceEdit (after 1 year usage): no issues in daily tasks,While playing pubg and some calls it freezes and swithes off."
5,Awesome product. Like it❤️ 12k under best phone.Dual stereo speakers.Good camBattery backup ❤️💯Build quality 💯Design 💯Best choice 👍
1,Front facing camera is too bad....
1,Front camera on video call is showung dark face. Screen goes white like hanging problem.Battery goes 20%to 80% automatically.Its camera performance is very low.You can choose other option in same price like vivo.
2,"Front camera is third class. Rear camera's quality  is average.  Battary like  4000 mah. Wi fi, Hotspot,  Bluetooth touch key does not work properly.  There are no auto call record option and notification receive indicating  led. Only sound quality is very good. No return policy only replacement, so I am hopeless."
4,"Primary usage Suitable for battery, videos watching, storage 128GB like songs backup listening music offline with speaker HiRes 2 speakers one in top and one at bottom, splash resistant.If ur requirement is secondary like Camera 48mp camera with Snapdragon 662.Not for heavy games.Then its suits me well. 5 star.No phone for these specs at this price point."
2,"After a month use....Phone is just ordinary.  No effects of the memory options are noticed.  In fact it takes roughly 2 minutes to get to the main screen after power on.  Preloaded with 13-15 gb of system files and bloatware.  So you get to use only 49 GB effective storage place.The phone is like paying for our dish TV, you will be forced to watch a lot of advertising apps.A lot of personal information may be used, your mi id will be linked to phone, email, ip address, location etc.Earlier I used Lenovo p2 nothing of this, and was a great phone.Having said all bad things, the phone is good for sound, visual, and battery.  Camera is the worst part.If you are buying for a camera then this one is a bad choice.  Battery 🔋 and the sound is great.Too many bloatware, I suppose Redmi should pay attention.  Or we all should avoid the phone and the brand.Repair would be easy as Redmi has many service centers around the country.  Except battery and music I don't see any difference or advantage over other phones for routine activities.Overall very average phone 📱 which is priced on higher side."
1,The product is not upto the mark.It gives low performance even many times the miui  stop the apps and camera quality is also poor.
3,The product is very disappointed in the camera segment. Front and back both camera is worst. It is not as 48 mp camera .Battery backup is well as 6000 mah.only vedio can play up to 13 hours after that phone is dead.if you bye for a big battery only then you can bye this product.all so processor is not as helio g85.
4,"I have ordered blazing blue colur but i have recived black colour instead of blue,But still it is a wonderful phone at reasonable cost.Battery backup is awesome and camera is amazing.I highly recommend to buy this phone from these seller"
5,Chief and best
5,Nice phone
4,"The pros of this smartphone are1. fhd+ display2. good battery life ( 2.5 days+ if only used for calling and light use,  1.5 days for overall usage like YouTube, watsapp, google meet, music, calling and gaming)3. 18w fast charge and 22.5w charger in box ( 19 - 96% in 2 hours)4. less bloatware5. ufs storage6. Stereo speakersAnd cons are1) average processor.2) average camera. (Steady photos are very good but low light needs improvement)3) MIUI 12 is little laggy.4) little heavy.5) Speakers are not that loud but works very well.So only buy if you want good viewing experience, battery life , fast charging and 22.5 w charger."
1,Front camera 3rd class.
3,Just got the phone in hand and the phone started lagging the next day.1- Performance average.2- Camera Average.3- Bit heavy and bulky too u can feel that.4- Design poor or should i say worse.5- MIUI is worst.
5,"Value For money, Sound quality is Superb, display clarity nice, overall worth for it."
1,Friends don't buy redmi 9 power smart phone.Don't waste your hard earned money to buy such disgusting phone.Performance very badBattery life very badFast charging not at allCamera quality v v poor.User friendly not at all.This is my genuine review after using it.My had wasted my money you all plz don't waste your money buying this phone.
1,"After using for 10 days My genuine review.1.Mobile always hanging.If you open camera it will hanging automatically.If you open 2 tabs,it will hanging.2. Cameras response time is too late.3. Front camera waste. It's shows you black only.4. Battery performance gud.My old Redmi note 4 is best to compare this Redmi 9 power.""My biggest mistake buying this redmi 9 power""We need a solution from mi and Amazon."
2,It's a MARKETING TRAP...IT CLAIMS to have all the best feature but they performance is below average... it's has all the features but no quality....Only Pros1.Good quality FHD screen2.Battery backup is okay.3. Speaker quality.Cons1. Below Avg camera.2. It HANGS3. NOT A SMOOTH TOUCH.4. TOUCH LAGS need to tap button multiple times one gets irritate.5 . One feels cheated because we have better option in the same price range.Worst use experience. I feel my older 3 GB ram redmi 8a is more smooth than this.My recommendation always give priority to a better Processor.
1,"Please don't buy this go for redmi note 9 pro.Camera is very bad .I seriously suggest not to manufacture redmi products in India ,all the made in India of redmi is worst ..."
4,"Stock Android Experience, 2 years of Major OS updates, 3 years of Security updates, Punch-hole display which looks quite impressive.Things which could have been better: Nokia's pricing of this phone could be around 10k,cameras could have been better, Battery is okayish for moderate use so a good wattage charging brick could have been added in the box. But I guess the SOC on board doesn't support above 10w charging.Bought this for my mom as I was fed-up of bloatwares in last Mi phone; who has general usage of whatsapp/calls/minor songs/little YouTube and occasional usage of camera. So people with moderate usage can definitely go for this phone. Yes this is not a hardcore gamer phone but you surely can play easy-on-graphics game given the 4000mah battery.Update 1: After using the phone for 1.5 months- The 4000mah battery does last for 2 days on a single charge. But since the in-box charger is just 5W, it takes more than 2 hours to charge from 10% to 100%. Not sure why Nokia did this. Coz other brands did provide upto 18W fast charging with same SD460 chipset."
1,I have brought the product only on the brand name...i.e Nokia but when I got the product and after that I get to know that this is the worst mobile. That’s why I returned the product and wanted my refund back but they are taking too much time to refund my amount..So I suggest don’t ever buy this product guy’s...Waste of money+ Waste of time.
4,"So far so good, but the charger provided is only 5W, otherwise iam loving this phone."
5,Phone is absolutely perfect as a daily driver.It suits the best to people who want to use the phone as a phone but not as a flagship product..Battery life is no doubt beyond perfect.Everything is much better..Nokia is FINLAND company so anyone don't want to get trapped in high end spec sheet and want to experience pure stock android in such a price.You should go for it
4,"There was no wrapper plastic on the box, and the seal was definitely broken. I could see some dust on the screen. The headphone was definitely opened. But nothing seem to be used as such. So, not returning the phone. Amazon is losing professionalism with its products for sure. Not sure why the seals should be broken. Bad experience for the first time with Amazon.Coming to the phone itself. It is actually very good with android one to boot. The display is a bit low res, but not a problem for users like me. The call quality, which matters the most for me, is excellent. I struggled to hear anything on my Redmi Note 7 (rest of the phone is a gem). This one solves the problem of call quality for me.The phone operates fast, smooth, and the battery backup is surprisingly good. Good speaker too, the fingerprint scanner is a bit slow. No issue with SD 460 for people like us for whom the phone is a means for productivity and not business. Good purchase, but removed one star because of the broken seal.Alternate mobile: Motorola is the only competitor in terms of stock android, and marginally better too! But Moto phones are bulkier, which I don't like much."
4,"This phone is really far better than redmi, realme, poco, oppo, vivo etc.. NOKIA may be a step behind in camera, sound, display. But for the ones who want to gift their parents or anyone who doesn’t need the above specs much, NOKIA 3.4 Does the job.. I am impressed of the build quality, Touch, screen size, speed, and mainly durability. I don’t know why people are so facinated about china phones..which gets retired so soo. Nokia is definitely underrated."
5,"This phone is a classy worth for its money and I did not find much negatives abt this nokia 3.4 and it's brilliant, but camera could have been even better and overall iam satisfied customer buying this phone and u will feel that brand quality 😀😎"
4,"Good for the price.Speaker is just ok. Slightly higher volume will be better.Doesn't connect 5Ghz WiFis..This is a bummer but not end of the world.For regular use, the experience is great. No lags or slowness. Comfortable on the fingers and eyes.Absolutely NO BLOATWARE. 5 STARS FOR THAT."
4,"Nokia being a Android One device, has the best of android built in. There’s no bloatware & Ads like in any other Chinese or Korean phones. It’s perfect for Parents/Grandparents & those who need a simple device for daily tasks like Calling, chat, Video Streaming & occasional gaming. Get it without any hesitation. Has a great built quality too. Nokia has promised 2 years of upgrades which simply makes this a device worth owning."
5,Handy to operate
3,Normal phone for normal peopleBut most amazing thing is it's software updates and no nautanki by adding junks . And for this thing it should get 6 out of 5 .
2,"A phone where you pay a big price for the name Nokia. It's slow, with a very unresponsive kind of finger print sensor that takes a couple of seconds to recognise and turn on. I didn't like the stock Android interface either. An ordinary looking phone that just does the job. 👎"
2,The product seal was broken or opened once.
5,"Features of the phone more than complement the price.The Nokia trade mark of ""user friendly"" is synonymous with the features and ease of use is evident while using the phone."
2,I HAVE A BLIND BELIVE ON NOKIA BRAND . BUT ITS BATTERY DRAINS FASTER THAN YOU THINK. HAVE SOME LAGGING ISSUE. ALSO HAVE TOUCH ISSUE. FINGERPRINT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY
4,User friendly. (Used by 70+ Yr old person)Extended charge lasts for 26+ Hours.Camera clarity worths like other android even better to b said.
3,Phon is good but Amazon packeg  in Nokia packing box is opened.
3,"If you are not into games and full hd video contents over the web,surely this will satisfy your needs!"

1,There is no headphone in the box... unsatisfied 😟 disappointed ☹️
2,"It's an average phone. Quite on the pretty side. ONLY those who are looking for a budget phone can think of purchasing this one. The camera is very average, but the functions & controls of the phone are smooth. It's very lightweight - that's a plus!"
5,Its a really very amazing and a nicely working phone..the camera quality and battery is also very good🤩😊.liked the product very much
4,Nice phone value for money but in inbox there is no earphone and screen protector receive being a regular customer of Amazon i am  unhappy there was  clearly written that these items are included in inbox.
1,"when i ordered this phone , headphone is free with phone but received order without headphone"
3,i have recently bought this phone..on 18 may 2020.. delivery is good but there was no headphones in a box.features r awesome nd phone is working gud.but camera quality is bit bad.
1,Worst mobile . I never expect from oppo such a low grade mobile. Touch is not working. Phone hanging. No return and replacement option.  From Amazon I got bad experience. Don't buy this mobile. Waste of money.
5,"Nice mobile prices 12,450"
1,"Body sensor not working. Was late by 2 days to find out this defect and so could not use ""return"" option.Due to body sensor problem, phone display never gets off while talking and so when brought close to ear, buttons like mute, hold gets activated while speaking.The basic function, which is to talk to others on phone becomes troublesome. Everytime have to very careful of holding position to make sure phone is not touched on body. Hate this and feel cheated/dejected.Cannot return as well."
1,It is roadside product with dusty display. When called Amazon customer care she deny to replace item. Don't buy anything from Amazon. Amazon only sells defective items. I returned many items and this was very useless response. She also disconnected call.USELESS AMAZON
1,This mobile was used by someone else.I have got someone else's mobile.I am not happy for this mobile.I will not do return this mobile.Because the reason of I give gift for other person.
4,"Better to value for money , quality is as per shown ..And fast delivered by amazon."
1,Earphones not received in a phone box
5,"Oppo always exports premium quality mobiles. Let there be no such features like other mobile but i phone also doesn't export such features at high price, then?I have attached some pictures also you can check them incase you wanna see the picture quality.Hence you can buy this without any tension.Amazing mobile's camera and body quality and display is also good.Go for it I suggest. 😃"
5,Fantastic
5,The phone is excellent but if the front and rear camara should be high and should be their dark mode compalsary but it should be added fastly and should give ear phonesonly main default is not nice camara should be high because the less cost mobiles will take more tean agers so they do moor selfies so it should increase and oppo is the selfie expert but this phone no selfie expert camara for next phone it should increase .Imay think I will increase
1,This product received wrost.. In this item some useful applications not run..Order canceled but no cancelation status and pick up status updating by Amazon..No any contact provided by Amazon..Realy disappoint..
2,This product details said there is a earphone and screen protector.  But i didnt get that
1,Don't buy it from Amazon the return service of Amazon is very bad..disgusting they never think customer problem no one in call centre never call you return policy and service is very poor only benefit looking cite ... don't buy anything from amazon.. in future I never buy electronics items from Amazon... flipcart is most trusted than amazon
3,"I like the product. But as compared to my other phone Realme X2. I found the lag in processing in some of minor things also. It is having 6GB RAM then also the having some processing issue. I don;t like the product. Even after this specs, the things are getting lag."
4,Nice mobile in this Price 👌👌👌👌..
5,Very nice phone for Rs.12500/-
4,Nice product...but there is no C pin charger  thts only one prob in this product...
3,Headsets are missing in the phone box...where are the original headsets...its normally included in phonebox??
1,The phone lags a lot right from the box. You have to swipe 3-4 times. Apps get hung. Never seen such a pathetic phone.
4,"Good product  but as compared to Mi note 8 its not Good . If you want to rought use for bussiness purchase.. Provessor is slow , not for gaming. But want you tube and surffing it's usefull. Another all thing is good .I don't have time for upload pics , but this review is enought.Product is same as photos."
1,"i have received the waste and damaged products and i chasing the customer support from last 10 days no solution upto now waste of money on  amazon ,waste of time on amazon ,and i customer of amzaon from last 5 years and i am a prime member this is the services i am getting"
5,For the money an excellent phone. My usage is mostly for mail and messaging. Bit of browsing and reading. The battery lasts for two days in my use. I bought one and then I was very happy with it and I bought another of the same.
1,"Screen quality is very poor , camera is also nearly poor, all over the phone is worst. I ordered this phone by choosing the no cost emi option of Bajaj , but they are also taking the processing charges of Rs.174 on every instalment.So please don’t use Bajaj’s emi option for ordering this phone. Thanks"
3,Updating after 4month :-screen recorder not available..which is default function of every android now a days..-Charging draining faster but charging gaining very slower.-its not a 21st century phone .. so many basic features missing Day 1: experience:-Most important : it will not redirect the link into the present app in mobile .... It will open link every times in default browser..Eg: if I got any Facebook /insta /Twitter link and I already have installed these app then it will not asking me to get open with app instead it will redirect to browser and again I need to login... So so poor technology1.processor looks slow while setup and configuration my account data restoration as compare to redmi note 7 (same price older version phone than this)2. Camera quality is very low both back and front ...capture blurred images..not focusing the face even after setup manually.3.  Not value for money.. I think I made mistake to choose oppo brand .. I compare all the feature with redmi.. redmi looks far better than this..4. No front flash light available to click in night5. Looks slow to handle multiple apps compare to redmi6. Please don't buy this phone..this is so poor technology phone..
5,I have been an user of nokia 6.1 as it started to face issues I have opted for this one. After using premium phones like Xperia and Nokia I feel the fabrication is not upto to the standards. Helios processing a little slow.Banking apps a little stretched due to the size of the screen. Rest all a good buy.
1,"I couldn't like it bcoz of its poor water resistence quality.I bought it on Dec.2020 but the working system of this disturbed on March 2021,within a period of 2-3 months.It is great loss .It mars  the Credibility of the Company also.I wanted to purchase one more but the damage has spoiled my mood n faith.I want compansation for the loss.It would be of great support n credibility of the company if it exchangeg the mobile OppoA31,Mystery or mend it properly without my loss.If the company do this favour,it would be a gentl step towatds customer care n service as well as the establishment of strong credibility n capabilitu of the Company."
1,"1. Phone don't have type C charging2. Dual app not possible for all app like redmi phones3. Charger is normal 5v 2 Amp so no fast charging.4. Not for multi tasking people.5. Camera and sound average6. Processor and touch very slow7. Only 6GB RAM AND 128 GB ROM is good  in this phone.8. Also it's not showing dual 4G9. Battery is only 1 day at normal uses.10. Display dpi is also very low.11. Can be treated as entry level phone.12. WhatsApp Camera function is abnormal, don't waste money on OPPO A31"
4,"Tecno spark 7 is best mobile ,this price renge ,awesome performance ,,and look like very good  Thnku techno ....."
4,In this range this phone is very good.
5,I receive today so looking good I using some day after written any author
5,"Writing the review after roughly 2-3 weeks of usage.First, the colour is unique which makes it stand out of the other phones in this segment. The rough contour at the back helps to solidify the grip. So seems to be quite suitable for rough users.Secondly, the battery backup is pretty huge despite the screen and ability to multitask.Apps run smoothly, and camera quality is excellent during day, and decent during the night. Network and storage is another USP, as my primary usage is to make calls.The big screen and RAM let's you enjoy netflix, games, and youtube all the the same time, in super HD quality. And not to forget the face unlock feature!Turned out to be a great buy, extremely value for money with the variety of features provided!"
5,"It's almost a week I am using this phone. First of all, really loved the colour. Wasn't sure if it would be as good as shown in picture but it is. Ordered the green one. Second, the battery surprisingly lasts for a long time. It takes a little time for phone to get fully charged, but once it is, I can get a lot of work done. If you are looking for screen size and battery you can go for this. To top that there's an amazing camera. Loved the filters in the AI Camera and the portrait mode."
5,I have been using the phone for 1 week now. The phone is very smooth and you can multi-task easily.The camera (both rear and front) are really good. The pictures and videos are very sharp and well lit. I experimented with both Macro and low light photography. The results are quite good. Highlight: The AI feature automatically switches to the mode.Battery is good. 6000mAh.  I charge it once a day and easily watch movies and play games.Overall a very good buy.
4,"Requirents were : good front and back camera with flash on both sides, decent storage , quality display for good browsing and multimedia playing experience. So I  was waiting for micromax in 1b 4gb version which comes rarely in stock  when I came across review of this mobile . Firstly was hesistant since  I never heard of this brand but since it was exactly suiting my requirements and strict budget and after going through review decided to take a chance and I will say I am happy that I purchased it .Camera : goodFeatures in camera : greatUser experience : goodDisplay and brightness : greatBattery : huge ."
5,"Back panel and design are great. Strong and handy phone with decent performance. Network availability is good, and easy to carry. Camera works fine, but the screen size, brightness and battery are top class.Ideal for the first time smartphone users."
5,Really impressed with the design of the phone. The design is premium and classy especially for this range.Most satisfied with the battery backup as it easily lasts a day and a half on heavy use.Camera and screen are excellent as well for the budget.
5,"Have added photos after a month use.I am a moderate user who does everything except gaming. That said, the battery lasts up to 1 and half daysDecent cameras for the price. Pictures are satisfactory but could be better.Very responsive fingerprint sensor and good sound quality."
5,"Excellent entry level phone with premium phone features. Battery backup is really good, network availability is good, the phone is light and handy. Check out pictures clicked using the phone."
5,"More than 10 days of using phone.Very happy with big screen and battery backup. Good for watching youtube videos, facebook videos and pictures.Looking also very smart. Stylish and nice color.Android 11 is available which is latest. Good phone with nice features in this price."
5,Battery backup and screen size are strong- making video watching experience smooth. Design is catchy with good feel.Extremely good camera and picture quality
5,"Superb mobile with frent selfi flash light. Image quality is great charging is also great, but slightly speaker noise while talking and listining music, greater look , simply wow"
4,"Nice phone just like any other budget Smart phone  This phone had a serious problem of Charging ..it was very slow and took hours to charge the phone . Later after may attempts I realized that the Adapter was not working , the charging cable was working fine .I  replaced the adapter with an Adapter of Redmi5 phone and now its charging Fast ..Better the company check the Adapter as there are several complaints here of Slow Charging .Overall a Good Phone"
1,"Bro I can't believe, while starting only it get hanged... After that without putting much app or data it's responding very poorly late. For giving so much qntity, they comprise qlty.  Not good for normal use also. Camera also like vga. Apps taking seconds to tk open. Voice quality is poor, voice hears different while talking and also sound is very very low. Not up to the mark for 2021 phones."
5,Recently I purchased Tecno Spark 7 (2/32)I very happy with this phone. In this price segment no other band provide these features.1.Big bettery 6000 MAH2.Fingerprint sensor3.Front dual and back 4 flash4.16 MP rear camara
1,Mobile too waste. Mobile specification is good but not good at all for the use. mobile getting heat in the few days. i'm unable to return the mobile as return window was closed in 7 days. please please don't buy the mobile.
4,Initially I was very skeptical to buy this mobile or not. But somehow made up my mind to give it a try. After using it for almost 1 week I can say this is the best mobile in this price range. Camera quality and Battery life is superb. Did not observe any slowness or hang while opening the apps. Overall very satisfied with the product.
1,Mbil was good but.. Amazon ne used mbile de diya mujhe jo pehle se koi chala raha tha. Jiska temrpar laga hua tha with scress and mbil ka seal nhi tha
5,"This product is made in India, has amazingly good quality, it lets you import everything from your old phone through google, you won't even lose your apps. Camera quality, screen size, sleek and lightweight, has everything that you need. You can't need more than what it has to offer at this price, there's n AI lens too Go for it, its a good quality phone that's also Indian made."
2,"Some software issues incurred within one week, alarm stopped working in spite of several resets."

1,Mobile software are very good.. But charging 🔋⚡ is very late... For 1 hour only 5% will charge.... Totally bakwas mobile. Pls don't buy.
1,Very disappointed with the overall performance from Samsung
4,"Got the mobile on the launch date,Battery must be appreciatedCamera is just averageMobile performance is above average90hz refresh rate? If u r buying the mobile for this feature then I'm afraid u may get disappointed, it's just normal.The USB cable is too small in lengthIt's a good mobile in this budget, there are no returns for this,  only replacement is available, hence choose wisely before buying"
3,Camera quality is low
5,"In this budget, it has exceeded all expectations .. I have primarily taken this phone for the battery and so far not disappointed"
1,"1. It doesn't work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.2. Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one.3. Amazon didn't allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.4. No return policy, you will have to live with the phone you didn't like. Now you decide."
1,"Not worth buying....faulty software, poor display quality, single band wifi doesn't support  5ghz WIFI band. Gyro sensor missing and many more. DONT GO BY PAID REVIEWS IN YOU TUBE"
1,I will never purchase Samsung phones. Phone is lagging too much and slow. Waste of hard earning money.
1,This is worst samsung mobile I have seen from samsung. It's sceen quality and colors are trash. Even a old 5000 rs phone can beat it's quality. Please never ever buy this product.
1,मोबाइल का कैमरा बिल्कुल भी सही नही है 48 PM बताया और क्लियरिटी 5 मेगा पिक्सल का भी नही है ।मोबाइल भी पुराना सा दिखता है ।इसको नही खरीदे
1,The phone hangs a lot and is very slow. I received a replacement which continues to hang
5,Just unboxed the phone.Seems to be a better one in this price segment as of now.Just checked with the camera & voice it seems good but one thing it's very heavy in weight may be due to battery.Hope samsung lives upto expectation.
1,"Worst camera quality. It is like 2 megapixel camera. Photos are very worst. If you slightly zoom the photo,  you can see blurry...Previously I used 13 megapixel amera phone. Those photos are very good."
1,Don't received  handset ejection  pin  and manual.
1,"No 5Ghz wifi band on this mobile, miserable in 2021 , even my previous mobile of Samsung which I bought in 2017 have 5Ghz wifi , it's a big comedy"
1,Very poor quality camera .Found box seal damage still Amazon not taking it back.waste of money.Phone very slow.Don’t buy from Amazon.Now Amazon started cheating customers to make profits.
1,Hitting issue
1,very poor build qualityvery poor camera piclow quality phoneno return policyvery worst mobilejust making fool to customer by samsung m12 and Amazon
1,"Good battery. Heating while charging and using mobile data, camera below average with 48 mp true, looks like 13 mp. Heavy in weight and thickness (okay that 6000 mah) display is not good as other phones in this rage in terms of technology and display ratio. Overall below average in this price."
1,Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it's having high end config. It doesn't look that way.Camera utterly disappointed. Never seen this kind of mobile in the recent past and more over if you buy this product you have to bare with it because no return/refund option according to return policy only replacement that disappoints even more. Advising don't waste money on this product.
5,"This is perfect phone, good speed, decent specs and outstanding battery life. The look of the device is also attractive. Above all, the trust of company."
1,"PHONE IS TOTAL RUBBISH.  Slowest to respond, Camera not at all good, abruptly closes down youtube and other applications on itself....AND THIS PHONE IS UTTER WASTE. CAMERA QUALITY IS BAD.Not at all happy with the product.I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
2,"Product specifications are not at par..Display is below average.Camera quality is just okay..It doesnt support 5ghz wifi, which is not mentioned anywhere so please make sure before buying.."
1,Dislike
1,Self camera is just like 2 mega pixels.
1,"Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost. Newer days below 10000 value mobiles also supporting dual band.I have purchased samsung mobile in 2018 will support 5ghz band, 2021 manufactured mobile will not support dual band  very shameful.This is cheating of amazon not mentioned same in details about the product. I am suggesting don't buy those who are using Jiofiber WIFI."
1,"The user experience is pathetic on these cheap phones. Its filled to the brim with bloatware that you can't remove.You're better off getting the Mi phones as they have a far better UIAlso, I can't return this garbage of a phone as Samsung don't list this as a software issue.I'll have to look into installing lineage os and de-google this phone before using it but that's easier said than done."
5,"A very satisfying  experience with the device so  far.Pros:1. Long battery life-  I am a moderate  user who does everything  except gaming. That said , the battery lasts up to 2 full days.2. Decent cameras for the price. Pictures are satisfactory but could be better.3. Very responsive finger print sensor.4. Good sound quality, although dolby's impact  is not much pronounced5. UI is great and snappy. Lots of customization options.6. The display is good and smooth with 90hz refresh rate. It does make the difference.7. Fast charging works fine.Cons:1. The weight of the phone is on the heavier side @ 220 gms2. The display could have been a full HD+ @ 1080p3. No led notification light. All though there are apps that can do the job on an AMOLED screen.Overall, a good package."
1,Horrible product
1,Just for name sake Cam & Battery are 48mp & 6000mah. But coming to reality it is poor. The weight of the phone also almost 250gm so it is not a smart phone it is a hard phone. And the top menu bar beside front cam is not responding sometimes.
1,"Not a good mobile.Quite heavy in weight, you will obviously feel it. Weight is 220 gms which is far exceeding acceptable range. Can definitely be used as paperweight.Nothing special in screen, processor or camera also.Just a marketing gimmick by samsung.Stay away.. At 13.5k we deserve far better than this."
4,I am giving this review after usage of 2 daysI bought this phone only for two req 1. Battery and Camera.1. BatteryBang on it lasted for 1 and half days there are unnecessary apps pre installed please remove those one of them is Takatak and Snapchat those are  absolutely non sense.I played Call Of Duty for straight 3 hours non stop battery drained from 98% to 80 %2. Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in India!!If anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this
1,Camera is very poor.. though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp
3,"This phone has 90hz display, but I see a lag while browing or navigating in apps, doesn't feel like 90hz at all48MP true cam when option selected gives noisy images , otherwise in normal mode works above averageBattery is excellent works for 2 daysHeating issues occur on heavy usage, in normal mode you won't notice itFront cam 8 mp just averageOverall I took 6gb 128 gb version for 13k and doesn't seem as good.Above average phone for the price...."
2,"The phone is good looking, but it doesn't support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .No handsfree in the box"
5,"It's a real monster. Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING. Fingerprint works very fast. Battery life is also really huge. Those who are not in favour of camera quality they're wrong camera quality is just awesome, size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera. Must buy product. Really happy from it 😌. Once again no complains regarding anything."
4,"Changing my review on this device after 2 month usage .  I finally have to say that this is the bang for the buck .Awesome battery life , and that's what I want . I am just using it for basic social media and calls .. rest of my heavy work is done on my primary device .CAMERA is average , My ipad's 5 MP camera shoots better than the so called ""true"" 48MP.My advice-- go for 6gb variant as 2.5 gb is acquired by the system .Overall - 4☆"
5,Very good phone. Camera display speed very good. Weight is little heavy.  But worth compare to the price
3,Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn’t give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you’re choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you’ll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review
1,"This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information."
5,Good- got it for 9999- decent phone for this cost with all the necessary gizmos and bling- finger print sensor is good. fast and sensitive. Haven't tried the face unlock.- display is top notch on any good Samsung phone for this price- quality pics/ decent ( note - I'm a normal user of camera )- battery is very good. its really a monsterBad ( depends on perspective )- slightly big for small hands- it has all the dumb samsung apps inbuilt ( you can uninstall a few )- slightly heavier when you have a good solid case ( read as spigen branded )Overall very happy to have a good ( more than decent ) phone for the initial offer price.
5,Really a good product that I have purchased in a long time. My long-time desire of owning a Flip phone finally happened because of this.  I sold my Smartphone and bought this. So for the product is so good. I Recommend
3,"Overall, good build quality, battery life 🔋,  easy to use, flip phone, if you are fan of these types, however, the clarity in the earpiece is not at all upto the mark as I expected.I bought this for sheer flip phone experience,  which means not to browse the internet, social media due to 2g aspect of it and camera, but, mainly for a good one to one calling experience which would take a hit if you are switching from a smart phone aspect of premium phones.Even samsung guru and Nokia button phones have good calling experience that this phone..."
5,"Large Button Letter size, light in weight, in budget good looking nice battery life"
5,Convenient to carryCan Stay away from internet 😊

1,Very disappointed with the overall performance from Samsung
4,"Got the mobile on the launch date,Battery must be appreciatedCamera is just averageMobile performance is above average90hz refresh rate? If u r buying the mobile for this feature then I'm afraid u may get disappointed, it's just normal.The USB cable is too small in lengthIt's a good mobile in this budget, there are no returns for this,  only replacement is available, hence choose wisely before buying"
3,Camera quality is low
5,"In this budget, it has exceeded all expectations .. I have primarily taken this phone for the battery and so far not disappointed"
1,"1. It doesn't work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.2. Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one.3. Amazon didn't allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.4. No return policy, you will have to live with the phone you didn't like. Now you decide."
1,"Not worth buying....faulty software, poor display quality, single band wifi doesn't support  5ghz WIFI band. Gyro sensor missing and many more. DONT GO BY PAID REVIEWS IN YOU TUBE"
1,I will never purchase Samsung phones. Phone is lagging too much and slow. Waste of hard earning money.
1,This is worst samsung mobile I have seen from samsung. It's sceen quality and colors are trash. Even a old 5000 rs phone can beat it's quality. Please never ever buy this product.
1,मोबाइल का कैमरा बिल्कुल भी सही नही है 48 PM बताया और क्लियरिटी 5 मेगा पिक्सल का भी नही है ।मोबाइल भी पुराना सा दिखता है ।इसको नही खरीदे
1,The phone hangs a lot and is very slow. I received a replacement which continues to hang
5,Just unboxed the phone.Seems to be a better one in this price segment as of now.Just checked with the camera & voice it seems good but one thing it's very heavy in weight may be due to battery.Hope samsung lives upto expectation.
1,"Worst camera quality. It is like 2 megapixel camera. Photos are very worst. If you slightly zoom the photo,  you can see blurry...Previously I used 13 megapixel amera phone. Those photos are very good."
1,Don't received  handset ejection  pin  and manual.
1,"No 5Ghz wifi band on this mobile, miserable in 2021 , even my previous mobile of Samsung which I bought in 2017 have 5Ghz wifi , it's a big comedy"
1,Very poor quality camera .Found box seal damage still Amazon not taking it back.waste of money.Phone very slow.Don’t buy from Amazon.Now Amazon started cheating customers to make profits.
1,Hitting issue
1,very poor build qualityvery poor camera piclow quality phoneno return policyvery worst mobilejust making fool to customer by samsung m12 and Amazon
1,"Good battery. Heating while charging and using mobile data, camera below average with 48 mp true, looks like 13 mp. Heavy in weight and thickness (okay that 6000 mah) display is not good as other phones in this rage in terms of technology and display ratio. Overall below average in this price."
1,Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it's having high end config. It doesn't look that way.Camera utterly disappointed. Never seen this kind of mobile in the recent past and more over if you buy this product you have to bare with it because no return/refund option according to return policy only replacement that disappoints even more. Advising don't waste money on this product.
5,"This is perfect phone, good speed, decent specs and outstanding battery life. The look of the device is also attractive. Above all, the trust of company."
1,"PHONE IS TOTAL RUBBISH.  Slowest to respond, Camera not at all good, abruptly closes down youtube and other applications on itself....AND THIS PHONE IS UTTER WASTE. CAMERA QUALITY IS BAD.Not at all happy with the product.I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
2,"Product specifications are not at par..Display is below average.Camera quality is just okay..It doesnt support 5ghz wifi, which is not mentioned anywhere so please make sure before buying.."
1,Dislike
1,Self camera is just like 2 mega pixels.
1,"Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost. Newer days below 10000 value mobiles also supporting dual band.I have purchased samsung mobile in 2018 will support 5ghz band, 2021 manufactured mobile will not support dual band  very shameful.This is cheating of amazon not mentioned same in details about the product. I am suggesting don't buy those who are using Jiofiber WIFI."
1,"The user experience is pathetic on these cheap phones. Its filled to the brim with bloatware that you can't remove.You're better off getting the Mi phones as they have a far better UIAlso, I can't return this garbage of a phone as Samsung don't list this as a software issue.I'll have to look into installing lineage os and de-google this phone before using it but that's easier said than done."
5,"A very satisfying  experience with the device so  far.Pros:1. Long battery life-  I am a moderate  user who does everything  except gaming. That said , the battery lasts up to 2 full days.2. Decent cameras for the price. Pictures are satisfactory but could be better.3. Very responsive finger print sensor.4. Good sound quality, although dolby's impact  is not much pronounced5. UI is great and snappy. Lots of customization options.6. The display is good and smooth with 90hz refresh rate. It does make the difference.7. Fast charging works fine.Cons:1. The weight of the phone is on the heavier side @ 220 gms2. The display could have been a full HD+ @ 1080p3. No led notification light. All though there are apps that can do the job on an AMOLED screen.Overall, a good package."
1,Horrible product
1,Just for name sake Cam & Battery are 48mp & 6000mah. But coming to reality it is poor. The weight of the phone also almost 250gm so it is not a smart phone it is a hard phone. And the top menu bar beside front cam is not responding sometimes.
1,"Not a good mobile.Quite heavy in weight, you will obviously feel it. Weight is 220 gms which is far exceeding acceptable range. Can definitely be used as paperweight.Nothing special in screen, processor or camera also.Just a marketing gimmick by samsung.Stay away.. At 13.5k we deserve far better than this."
4,I am giving this review after usage of 2 daysI bought this phone only for two req 1. Battery and Camera.1. BatteryBang on it lasted for 1 and half days there are unnecessary apps pre installed please remove those one of them is Takatak and Snapchat those are  absolutely non sense.I played Call Of Duty for straight 3 hours non stop battery drained from 98% to 80 %2. Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in India!!If anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this
1,Camera is very poor.. though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp
3,"This phone has 90hz display, but I see a lag while browing or navigating in apps, doesn't feel like 90hz at all48MP true cam when option selected gives noisy images , otherwise in normal mode works above averageBattery is excellent works for 2 daysHeating issues occur on heavy usage, in normal mode you won't notice itFront cam 8 mp just averageOverall I took 6gb 128 gb version for 13k and doesn't seem as good.Above average phone for the price...."
2,"The phone is good looking, but it doesn't support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .No handsfree in the box"
5,"It's a real monster. Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING. Fingerprint works very fast. Battery life is also really huge. Those who are not in favour of camera quality they're wrong camera quality is just awesome, size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera. Must buy product. Really happy from it 😌. Once again no complains regarding anything."
4,"Changing my review on this device after 2 month usage .  I finally have to say that this is the bang for the buck .Awesome battery life , and that's what I want . I am just using it for basic social media and calls .. rest of my heavy work is done on my primary device .CAMERA is average , My ipad's 5 MP camera shoots better than the so called ""true"" 48MP.My advice-- go for 6gb variant as 2.5 gb is acquired by the system .Overall - 4☆"
5,Very good phone. Camera display speed very good. Weight is little heavy.  But worth compare to the price
3,Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn’t give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you’re choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you’ll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review
1,"This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information."
5,Good- got it for 9999- decent phone for this cost with all the necessary gizmos and bling- finger print sensor is good. fast and sensitive. Haven't tried the face unlock.- display is top notch on any good Samsung phone for this price- quality pics/ decent ( note - I'm a normal user of camera )- battery is very good. its really a monsterBad ( depends on perspective )- slightly big for small hands- it has all the dumb samsung apps inbuilt ( you can uninstall a few )- slightly heavier when you have a good solid case ( read as spigen branded )Overall very happy to have a good ( more than decent ) phone for the initial offer price.
1,Don’t buy this product .Image quality is below average comparing with the specification. Useless camera.And there is NO RETURN POLICY and replacing with same mobile is big headache .DON’T buy this mobile
4,"Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps."
5,Awesome
5,Best buy at this price! The display quality is amazing and I do not have any complaint with the camera too. There is no other phone available at this price which comes with 4GB ram. You should go ahead with this.
1,"Very bad experience from Amazon. Very bad camera quality of the phone. I want to return the phone, but amazon is not taking back the phone. I don't want to purchase any product from amazon further. Leaving amazon app permanently"
4,i didn't upload photo ....for any reason but it is not up to the mark .1.display 4/52.cam 3/53.fing sens.. 4.5/54.processor 3/55.build quality 3.75/5back panel is not good looking coz some self design as per my opinionin this price segment rs 9000 is good enough
5,Good product value for money but ordering is too difficult within one minute soldout
1,This phone is not value for moneyIts a downgraded phone of earlier phone launched in india.The camera is worst i ever seen in any redmi phone.Battery is ok.The display quality is very bad not hd. Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.Dot notch display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera.Recently i am using redmi note 5 pro. And this phone is just downgraded phone by redmi .you cannot imagine low light photography in this phone.The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.If you really need a phone there are many options in the market.If you are taking phone for the first and a beginner you can go for redmi 9 prime.
5,Good mobile
3,"Processor is bit slow, camera is below average except that everthing works fine. I personally don't like MIUI because of lots of ads and bloatwares. But, good budget range phone if you ignore/adjust this issues."
4,Overall its good and satisfied for the price.Pros:1. Good Battery.2. Best budget phone for 8999 with 4GB RAM and 64GB Internal Memory.The only drawback i felt is Camera.If you are looking for a better camera I would suggest to pick some other model.
5,best good product prive battry camera all very good
5,Nice PerformanceCamera quality goodlight in weightmultifeatures are excellentgood gaming purpose#Mi
1,Very very Poor Mobile. If you have used any FHD mobile phones then I bet you that you can't use this phone for more than a Hour.PROSBattery. 👍🏻👍🏻Sleek design. 👍🏻Call quality 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻CONSWorst Display ever seen. YouTube videos👎🏻👎🏻Processor is Pathetic. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻Camera Front is just okay. Back total failure.👎🏻Poor Internet connectivity. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻Nothing inside the box. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻Please don't think of buy this phone. 100% you will regret. MADE IN CHINA product. They mentioned as INDIA everywhere but the Mobile. Soft cover shows MADE IN CHINA. Rs.8998 is wasted..You can buy for a elderly person who use only for Call purpose. Better Don't Buy 😂😂😂
4,Product is best at this price but charging speed is very slow but we cannot accept more then this at this price
3,"It got so many bugs, the screen turned completely blank when i clicked on 'update system app', surprisingly NO heating issues, brightness is lowFor camera the rear is okay but front lacks details"
1,Auto response start problem with start mobile
4,It is  a good phone which is orange a nice colour I love it it features are better than other phones
3,good
5,Good product. Value for money phone. Everything is average. Display is good. Battery life is also good. I bought it for a employee of mine. Overall a good phone. 4/64 combo is hard to  find in this price range. Exceeded my expectations.
5,GOOD
1,Worst product ever as the camera quality is very poort rear as well as front. Amazon was not ready to take the return as they have a new policy now which is replacement policy so they will get you a replacement but won't take it back. Bought that in sale as had heard from friends that redmi phones are good but it ain't. Will suggest not to buy at all from Amazon as it's better to go and buy from the store atleast they take 500rs and will exchange the product. Speaker is poor you can not hear properly on speaker at all. Product is not worth in this price range as one can get better options by payin 1000-2000 bucks extra.
3,G35 is ok for day to day usage not highly capable..
1,"It is a just ok kind of phone. Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use. It is completely waste of money. Do not buy this mobile."
4,Good
2,I was having Samsung before same 4gb ram and battery back was very good but in redmi with out much of space or app ram speed is very very slow and battery back up draing with a day so not happy with the redmi product .I can return to Amazon with in 7 days but unfortunately our building is effected with covid possiitive so totally issulated no one should have contact with us so can't able to send the return mobile
4,Overall good mobile...But Camera not good as expected.Overall Performance is good .Value For Money
1,"Redmi9Too many disadvantagesCamera quality is worst:both front and rear.Processor is very slow.Body is plastic and which is uselessDisplay quality is very badMicro usb charger: this wonder, since all model new phones are coming with c-port, but this phone with old model micro usb port.Video calling is issue.Heating issue during charge aswell as during the call,You can't video call and many more issue.And you can't return the phone in Amazon.Totally this phone is gutterchap quality."
5,"Best mobile ,best service currior boy"

3,Charging Adapter came with phone turned out to be defective. stopped working after 2 weeks of purchase.Don't know how to return the adapter or how to claim the warranty on adapter alone.Phone is working fine so far and looks good
3,"Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3. Under 9000 INR4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)5. Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5. Building quality is poor. As well as camera are very dissatisfied.6. Useless camera bump for 2 poor camera only just for marketing showing 3 circles.7. Loaded with bloatware and adware. Unauthorised data transfer to China.If possible go for Motorola E7 around the same price and you will have great experience with Snapdragon and clean android experience."
1,"My suggestion for everyone who is thinking to buy redmi 9, please don't buy.Redmi is a very trust brand but not redmi 9.I purchased this phone 3weeks ago, first it was in good condition, after 3 week it started to hang every morning, after 4 days the phone completely shutdown.I don't know what to do, before getting one month this happened.It's getting really hurt to use this phone."
5,"Very good product for the budget  My honest review after 5 days of usageDisplay 4/5Camera 3.8/5 it is good for the budgetAudio quality 5/5Finger print sensor 5/5Face I'd 5/5It has good processor hello g35 which is good even redmi gave  hyper engine technology which is good for playing mild games and surprisingly sar value is too low which is awesome , dont try to play heavy  games it will sometime get hang , battery life is awesome it will get upto max 2 days battery backup with mild usageThe only problem they did not give usb type c cable but for the budget it is not a big issueMainly I will recommend this product who love to study in online platform"
1,Very very poor camera.its look like jio 1500/- camera and supplier not responded regarding this issue
1,Battery performance is not good camera quality is not good also there is no brightness in my device I don't want this mobile
2,"Phone is only for Calling, Whats App and Youtube.I gifted this phone to my mother, so as per her usage i felt its okay.Worst part is camera.... I even had Redmi Note 4.... I seriously felt Note 4  camera is much better that redmi 9.I got this phone in 7500/-"
5,Best
1,The phone is very hang and some application doesn't work properly....Pls don't buy this ....If you are try to return it will having lots of stages and procedures.The performance of this phone is very bad...Redmi provide 4gb ram but it having Below 2 gb experience...Poor network connectivity and some times it showing blank screen...Very waste products...and big lose of money.........
3,In display lines started coming after using 1 day . I want to return this . Amazon Customer service is worst. Though damage is visible they are not accepting for return.
1,"Please don't  buy this phone  or any new series  of Samsung  like M11,M21,M10,M20 etc. I have bought M11 4GB ram phone ,after two month it became dead totally, power button wasn't  working  properly  & charting  point was problematic, Samsung  service  center  told me that there will be 8300 rs needed to repair  this phone & I can't  have free service  due to liquid  issue  damage  and so I have to abandon  this phone  & warranty period became myth  as I lost 14000rs on this phone. I had used Samsung  Galaxy J3pro  model for five years but none of these problems  occured. My wife has M20 model & from the day she bought  it the display & other parts of this handset  still remains  problematic. So my suggestion  is the old series was really good but the new series of sansung are all problematic, so please before buying  these models  think twice everybody."
5,The battery life is good it can be used for 2 days consecutive without charging.The back camera is awesome compared to the selfie camera.The phone is actually value for money....This phone can be used by any category of people irrespective of age. The phone is user friendly. ;)
3,"First time I purchased any Samsung phone and it's pain!In just 10 days touchscreen stopped completely working on left side. Contact Amazon, they are saying we have 7 days replacement only, contact Samsung they will pick your phone from your place and service and deliver. But irony is Samsung not even answering the phone properly.Phone is getting hang again n again and this touchscreen issue is completely making me mad."
5,The Samsung M11 is and all rounder phone. Even though it does not have a phone cover and earphones in the box It's battery life is long and good. The touch screen it good and is water resistant. The camera quality is also good but I have seen better. The gaming speed is very good no lag unless you have network issues. In all I give this phone a 4.5/5
3,"The phone is slightly sluggish, even though 75% of internal memory is free, it takes little time to respond.As wanted an Make In India mobile phone I have gone for it, as no other options at this price."
4,The packing was amazing and got delivered within 2 days of order. It do not have earphones included(just want to highlight). The mobile performance is good. Camera quality is fine during day but do not expect much from night mode. Battery life till now is around 1day (didnt test with continues video watching) of now.
5,"Great phone at this price range. Works perfectly. Battery life is superb. Violet colour looks fresh, catchy and awesome.Definitely worth it. Value for money.Recommended"
4,Average Camera Quality. Long battery life.Its sturdy and does not hang unlike some of the popular chinese brandsCustomer service center is far more responsive and friendly.The qualcomm octa core takes care of most standard gaming and normal usage needs
4,Like the physical overview and back panel color.Weight of the phone really discomfort to hold a while.
5,I like this product it and also I like the punch hole designed cameraSamsung m11 is good user-friendly deviceAnd also I can use this HD versionThe display is so smoothy in natureBeautiful wallpapers and theme i observed itI am using violet colourit's text and design is so beautifulAnd also there is a triple Camera sensor that gives it clear picture without watermark
4,Ok so I bought this from Amazon and I would like to appreciate that this one is awesome phone... So basically I bought this one for my Maa and she is sooo much happy... It's really nice phone for me... Thank you Samsung and Amazon for a great deal
1,"The worst exeprience I have ever went through.The product is defective, although the samsung is ready to replace the product, but the Amazon is misguiding me.Amazon should not misguide their customers, or else it will result in negative effects, if this type of response is happening.No one is responding from Amazon.I think the worst ever."
2,"I bought this phone and found that the audio was not clear over the zoom calls. So exchanged the phone. When I checked zoom call once, I could not recognize audio issue. But now I have started using it, it's audio quality is very weak. Speaker is also not good. For pictures, video, whatsup, social media I find it's good, but don't like to call from this phone or receive any calls. :-("
4,Overall performance is good or better. But comera quality should be more better. Even it don't have any front flash for brighter selfy.The combination of RAM (4GB) and battery (5000mah) is perfect combo of long lasting technical support.
5,I bought this as a secondary phone. It has all that I need and gives me full value for the cost. Has a nice size and performs well without hanging. A good Samsung product.
5,In this price i would say it is the best phoneBest displayAwesome battery lifeFingerprint scanner works goodGives good feel in hand
3,Battery life is too good according to its price. Fingerprint reader and face unlock both is too fast. According to its price value of phone is good
1,This phone is within the warranty period of one year. It just hangs within 5 minutes of usage and the the finger print scanner and touch screen stops working. A very poor example of Amazon product sales
5,the delivery was much in time and the delivery man was very courteous as well as followed all covid norms.overall the experience has been outstanding
1,Worst product ever...Money was just wasted on it... Over heating issue is there likd if u use chrome for simple browsing then in 5 minutes it heats like hell...and also there is no option they provided for return or something...only one option was there talk to their expert ... Literally my money was wasted .. Don't buy this from this seller...
5,"Nothing is to be said. So far battery life is concerned, honestly to be said only after six months or so."
1,Warning:⚠️ FRONT CAMERA is very very poor. I am utterly disappointed. If you want to be cheated like me then go for it. 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 Millions dislikes SAMSUNG.
1,"Phone has problem. Call disconnected when the called person ok the call. When contacted the service center, they only updated the software. It works only for few days.Again same problem arises."
4,The bigger size is really helpful for mail checks and lot of other things.Battery life seems good.Camera n Picture quality is really value for money. (Can see pics loaded with review)(Note: Using since June 20)
5,அருமை ஆனால் புகைப்படங்கள் மிகவும் மோசகாக கிடைக்கிறது பிறகு சார்ஜ் செய்யும் போது அதிக வெப்பம் அடைகிறது
4,Value of money. The exchange offer was great. The phone looks awesome and the front camera is on the left side which makes the view better.
1,"This product is very bad in quality in comparison to other touch quality is very bad slow speed I m not suggesting to any one to buy this model ,I m very diss appointed"
1,Front camera quality is very poor but battery life and back camera are good
4,A good budget phone. Camera quality is not upto the mark. Execpt that everything is quit good so far. Like the design & color of the phone. Quite satisfied with the purchase.
4,Writing review after one month. Looks good so far. Reasonable battery life. Display and camera also fine.
4,After 3 months of using the phoneI am satisfied but I still have a little regret in my mind ......But go ahead and buy it  it is a wonderful product
1,Defective... shows a pop up 'error in application' every 30 minutes but sometimes every 2 min... any songs or YouTube would pause all of a sudden... fingerprint reader doesn't work most of the time
3,Battery life has not been tested.Sound volume and quality are ok ok.Performance is good.
3,TFTA display is better than mi . Oppo . Vivo .real me IPS LCD in this segment.Camera is too good for its price . The image processing is good with high dynamic range.Unlike other  brand phones having washed out colors.
4,Bought this phone for my mom. She loves it. But exterior sound is too low. Can't hear from another room when the phone rings evenin full volume.
4,Big & Best product in this price range from SAMSUNG .The only thing I felt is wrong was - The device heats up while charging .
2,Takes much time to save a fingerprint. I found the battery not bad. The screen is very disappointing with resolution of only 1560×720. The camera is worse than others at this price segment.
5,The powerpacked phone in budget range. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock is amazing.  It take 0.1 second to unlock your phone. Battery life is amazing for heavy usage. 5 star from my side to Samsung.
5,Its a good looking phone with great features in affordable rate. Was delieverd at the right time and in good condition. Amazon is doing great overall its worth it.
1,Very slow charging even though they mentioned fast charging it is not real.In 10 minutes time it charged only 3 points . I bought it another platform. They don't allowed return. When their claim fastcharging is wrong they have to allow return
2,Realme narzo 20 smartphone butmost important issue auto call recording not available. and all options are the best mobile phone
4,Back cam is goodFront cam is not much goodProcessor 🔥👌Battery 👌
1,Please don't buy it.It is worst mobile ever as it's fingerprint doesn't not work.It also don't charge fast it takes 3hours to charge full from 10%.Save your money. Please trust me and don't buy.
1,इसमें काॅल करने के बाद स्क्रीन की लाइट नहीं जलती इसलिए फोन काटने में समस्या होती हैसमाधान करें
4,Phone is superbGood qulaitiesBut i think it has slow charging
1,"1.Battery backup is very low.2.Hangs many times.3.Need doc format in camera.4.less features in camera.5.Doesnt have security app like Knox.6.More weight.7.doesnt have better features compare to vivo,samsung A6 ,oppo A6."
5,The product is good in lower price best mobile.
3,"Narzo 20 Review:Pros:Overall everything is going smoothly and fast till now.Very satisfied with system accessibility features.Very nice design.Cons:Bit heavy.Super slow charging(4hrs).Lots of inbuilt apps which cannot be uninstall.Occasionally some apps stops working automatically.(Like Google crome and some apps.)And some times phone screen also does not response but it became alright when I turn off and on the screen. Packaging was not upto the mark. All these things compelled me rate 3 stars. Otherwise, good one."
1,Different procecer such fake commitment
4,The product is good ...it's worth to be purchased ....
5,Excellent phone but only issue of battery charging is taking long time
1,Charging is very bad camera is super
4,Phone is little bit lagging
5,Runs smoothlyGood battery lifeJust that it takes a bit long to charge as it's a 6000 mAh battery
5,"All the rumours prove fake and false about its long charging duration,Camera and fingerprint is superb,I recomend go for this beautiful phone.but the price is little high than other sites like flipcart etc."
1,"In real mi narzo 20 mobile, hardware fault. Gravity sensor not work. Auto call recording not work. I am not satisfy for this mobile."
5,This Narzo 20 is Awasome and this Camera is also Very Nice in this Price range.But I am very Disappointed by it's charging speed and Charger. It's charger charge the phone just like an 10w charger.
5,Gud product
2,"Worst phone! I reached out to customer care , the technician checked and reset the device but still problem continues. If any app is in use you don't get phone calls, it don't ring.Every time you need to restart the device.I asked Amazon to change the phone to different model but customer service informed I can only exchange it with the same model.Waste of money"
5,"Vote for my expectations fully secure with 4g network, memory space n battery life"
2,Display quality is not good
4,This is good mobile phone. Better than redmi in this price. One star is less because of display and battery charging time more. Otherwise it is good phone. Pubg lags in this phone
1,"One of the worst battery takes 3hrs to charge, also sound there is a sound issues. Heavy weight, camera quality is poor for this price range. I prefer not to buy this product"
4,"I like this product,it is absolutely fine and battery backup is also good..This phone is working very smooth...and for gaming and working it is awesome...🪔Buy this product it is is so fine...value for money🥰"
3,"If you have minimal use (calling, camera & normal apps) this can be a good purchase."
5,Every time i buy something after delivered price goes down. wtf bro?
5,A small mark is coming on display at side of volume button
4,There is no glassguard given and cencor is also not working properly.Really bad experience with phone.
3,Charging 1a is very slow and it is taking up to 1-2 hours for getting fully charged... Camera is not that clear otherwise ok ok product.

1,I ordered this phone this is too poor quality ph...bluetooth not connect with car...dont purchase it ..Now amazone not refund my money after return
5,Seems really Decent phone
5,Very elegant... Looks very smart .....But the cover is not yet available...
5,"I am writing the review after use of about 1 day. I purchased it for my mother. She is very happy to have it. Aa she was earlier user of Samsung basic mobile and she used the mobile for about 6 years. So now she upgraded to smartphone of this brand because in her opinion Samsung mobiles are long lasting. In my opinion:-  Display- 4.5/5  Battery- 5/5  Camera- 5/5  Performance- 4/5  Look- 4/5  Value for money- 4.5/5Display is good and bright as usual Samsung display are always of better quality.  Sound is not best but okay. Look is good but need improvement in back design as it seems to be a cheap plastic material. Battery has no complaints. Camera specially front camera is surprisingly good. But performance should be improved as somtime touch is less responsive.so if you are multitasker and heavy user of mobile then itz not for you. but keeping the price in mind 7299 rs for 3gb ram and 32 gb storage its a fair deal as you are attached to Samsung brand which is better than cheap chinese mobiles like Mi, Oppo, etcPlz don't forget to like if fou find my review helpful 👍"
1,performance was very bad if I open the application that time hang my phone with in 3 seconds and when I rotate the video on landscape mode that time video has slowly moved
4,"Dont expect much from this phone, this is a average user phone, phone will be  lag if using more apps, but its decent for this price, value for money.  Best for Basic to Android upgraders."
1,"I ordered the phone as soon as it was launched. When I received the phone, the camera was not working properly. Everything was very blurry and phone was very slow.I placed a return request. I then received the replacement piece. Camera was working this time but after 1 day use, I noticed that nobody called me the whole day when I generally receive around 10 calls. When I tried calling from another number, it said that the number is out of coverage area when jio had good network reception and VoLTE was on. I have a placed a return request for second time now."
5,"Why did i purchased?1.For using wifi hotspot, instead of my primary phone2.To make or receive Emergency calls either from office or other personalsWhat did i liked most?1.Good Build quality2.Good Display, excellent quality3.Good signal reception, clear voice quality.4.economy price.5.Good Battery6.Latest operation system.7.Dolby atmos(good for music lovers)8.hotspotWhat makes you disappoint?Usb port should be ctype.Finally, what did you say?This is the excellent phone in this price range.Can be used as wifi hotspot and standby phone.This phone is only for basic usage like listening music, simple  voice calls, chatting, watching youtube, surfing net.Not recommended for gamers and heavy users.And display supports upto 720p only.Note:In initial setup, you may face lag and struck in youtube videos. But once after setup completed,restart  the phone.Everything  will get settled up."
3,"So I recieved the phone a few days back. And I will be using this phone as my primary phone. So I will keep this brief and almost to the point.Build quality- tacky looking, good, but can be improved for future budget phones. I got grey color, and it's not metallic, my mum says the rear looks like shahbadi floor tiles. Not an insult. Anyways I like it, but it's not metallic.Screen- personally, I am happy with it, touch feedback is nice too, but ofcourse not like 20k+ range phones.touch is very responsive in the calculator app.Battery- well 5000mah, good, it's quite more than necessary for me but good.Camera- macro camera- took a fair enough macro shot, 2mp. 3.2mp would have been a sweet spot in budget yet good quality. Front and main camera yet to test fully. Night time photos? Forget it. Honestly even most mid range phones don't fare well in night.Processor power- its not a powerful chip to begin with, but fine, I am going to manage with it. For others, the phone is a bit laggy/slow in some aspects..or most. Camera takes a good whole second or 2 to start, the viewfinder flow is not smooth and laggy/glitchy.but I like the wide and macro combination. SHOULD'VE BEEN 3.2MP :'(More apps= bit more lag while entering main menu. So the less no of apps, should suffice. I opened a bunch of apps, including 3 Google tabs in browser, and many apps, lag was not severe slowdown, but was a little slower than before or it's slow to begin with and didn't really have high expectations. Using the device care and/or restarting the phone did feel better and smoother, but took a good whole 7 to 10 seconds for the live wallpaper to load. Talking of wallpapers, even being samsing OneUI, there is no option for galaxy themes :(I am not gonna do any major gaming on this so I cannot say anything on it's regard, I prefer pc gaming. But don't expect much, however if you really want have a  experience where you'd feel better/happy with the purchase, I'd suggest playing classic games like Mario, crash bandicoot etc. Some game suggestions- Dadish, alto.I will update this review after a week/months use. And finally a half/full year update.If you have a budget of atleast 10k then I'd suggest buying some other samsung product or your preference. I've used the m31s and compared to this, that phone is way smooth, and many more models out there. But if you want a entry level phone, or coming from a feature phone, budget constraints, secondary phone. Then this is the phone to go with.  I personally like my m02 quite a bit."
1,"Phone is very slow& heats up quickly. I replace the first piece. Received the replacement the very next day, thanks to amazon. But the second handset was even worse as it got extremely heated even before it was set up completely. Returning it also."
1,"No wireless display as specified and camera not working evertime, quality is poor, even though 13mpixel, it's like VGA camera.. pictures are blur..please don't waste your money.."
3,Average Smartphone.....😵
4,"Mobile is good for simple use but pathetic camera , no fingerprint sensor and old processor which makes it slow for a phone in 2021 .  I purchased it as my secondry phone, display is really awesome and light weight with sleek design. For better deal opt for micromax IN 1B if you can compromise on display and will use as primary phone  .But the conclusion is samsung's quality and customer care cannot be compared with any other brand  in india .If you want a secondry phone then its a perfect choice at this price"
5,"At a first glance phone looks decent one. It has almost all the features except finger print but it's ok in this price range. Checked the sound quality, camera, internet speed. All seems to be fine. For a basic user it's a good choice. Will review further after using few more days."
5,The product is best value for money and only watch it as a budget smartphone
1,Performance and display is not as per standard. Pale display....it looka like a duplicate screen. Performance is so slow that even opening a calculator take 5sec of lag to open. It seems this phn is either refurbished version of some older phone. Samsung has not delivered such low standard phn till now.
1,"Reason to buy :1. Very stylish looks . u found a premium quality.2. Big display.3. Battery is good.Reason not to buy1. It's like a Scorpio with auto""s engine.App load time is long2. Camara just a scrap.3. Speaker is very very bad. Burst speaker.Over all don't buy this . if you don't want anything more than call nd need only a good looking ph then only buy or either go for poco c3,redmi 9a"
1,I have used 3 or 4 samsung phones with this price tag. But this phone model is disappointing me.I found below issues in the phone that i received from this seller. Not sure about other users.1. Call volume is low.2. Performance issue.3. Phone hangs in the middle without loading the website completely.4. Very heavy but ( i did not notice it when i ordered. This is my mistake).5. Call disconnection but not very frequently.There is no option for refund. But it has only exchange with the same model.I returned this mobile . Am waiting for replacement phone. Let us see how the new phone of same model works.
2,Good in screen size. Average phone in the price range. 👍Camera 📷 worst-: On the name of samsung it's very bad. 👎Battery🔋backup-: It's is good can run full day.👍Speed~RAM-: Don't even think of playing any game. It's lag vere very much even while playing Temple Run in 3gb variant.👎Memory management-: it's come with 32gb internal memory in with 10gb is allready consume by system software.👎Overall ~ If you are purchasing this phone for only calling purpose then go for it. 👍Don't think of playing a single 50-100Mb game u won't be able to play on this device 🙏
3,"Writing this review after couple of days of using. First I ordered this and received a slow item, then I replaced the item and thanks to Amazon I have received the replacement within 1 day. But, the replacement item is still slow. Hence, I have decided to return the item.PROS:1. Big Screen2. Huge Battery Life3. 3GB of RAM4. 32GB of Internal Storage6. Latest Android OSCONS:1. MediaTek Processor (after having 3GB of RAM, the phone takes 2 seconds to open Chrome and 1.5 seconds to open contact list)2. Hangs After Playing GamesVERDICT:You can go for this phone if you are looking for a secondary phone or you are gifting this to your parents. This phone is not for them who will watch movies, play games and hinging on social media apps."
5,* Display is very good* Battery Backup Excellent* Stylish Mobile* YouTube Videos playing without buffering
1,"Guys if you are looking for a smartphone Please do not buy this product. Reasons are given below1. Battery life is not upto the Mark even in power saving mode. Drained very fast in just 15 hrs. If you watch movie then ot will drain in 4 hrs only.2. Camera. Both front and rear camera are just like vga camera. No quality of Megapixels.3. Hangs a lot. Takes too much to unlock and don't have a fingerprint scanner as well. No facelock option.4. Many times it dont show the caller number on screen for 5 to 10 seconds.When you are working on it and someone calls you then only ringtone will play first and small icon will appear on the top after 5-10 seconds. Unknown no. by truecaller will show when you disconnect call.5. I have not installed any game as it hangs in normal operation.6. Screen width is not upto mark,as keys of keyboard come closer. You will feel uncomfortable while typing.7. Sound quality is low, as no proper music beats.8. When you are on call the screen automatically flash and touch enables.Samsung should recall this model. Worst ever phone. You can add 2000 more and can get better phone than this."
2,"Phone is little bit slow hanging in first start , below average camera quality both front and rear , plastic back but at this price point cant expect more. But we can expect good Qualcomm Snapdragon processor or exynos ...long charger wirePros - good battery not yet checked , bright and clear screen, latest update today via OTA,Cons- very small charger wire and it is unacceptable, below average camera, very slow phone , plastic cheap quality,I suggest spend bit more on good specification phone don't just go with Samsung..."
5,"Best smartphone in this prize,nice display, battery life best,but I want to more features like, screen shot and screen recorder too."
1,"First I was happy that Samsung rolled out a budget phone under 7000 Rs. but later got disappointed that we have to bear slow processor. The processor is quite slow and the phone started hanging as soon as I booted for the very first time. Along with this drawback, the display is very cheap when it comes to expecting a nice one from a brand like Samsung. I would suggest not to go with the brand value but see the specifications before you buy and don't make the mistake which I made."
4,"3/32gb variant @ 7299/- is good deal with samsung brand. Quad-core MediaTek MT6739 Processor is outdated & slow but adequate for basic usage. No lagging for whatsApp, fb, YouTube.  Display & Screen resolution is great as well as battery backup. 10W charger took more than 3.5hr for full charging. Cameras are average considering price point."
4,"This is my first personal Samsung phone, and what better model to start with! Using it for a week  now and everything is functioning as it should. Very good display, sound and maneuverability overall.  Only one thing :  The mobile's data cable could really have been a bit longer. Other than that the phone is working fine. The best thing is the 5000mAH battery,  which I am enjoying. :-) Truly  a value for money.Will update if I find any other significant matter in the coming days."
4,Product is just ok if you have another phone. I use iPhone n I took it as some apps have xtra features in android.Phone has a good battery. Processor is not good enough so it’s a little slagging. Design is good. Display is too bright if u hold it straight with ur eyes as it’s a tft lcd.  I hope in future updates mobile will become a little smoother.  It is very rare that you will get every update time to time in this price. But I am sure u r not going to get a better choice in this price. If you have money shortcomings you can consider it!!Have a nice day ahead!!
2,I ONLY USE FOR MAKING CALLS.WHATSAPP VIDEOS ONE OR TWO I SEE AT THE MAXIMUM.MOBILE LOOKS GOOD.NO ONE CAN TALK ILL ABOUT SAMSUNG DISPLAY OR CAMERA.AS USUAL BATTERY FAILS.IN THIS CASE ATTERY DRAINS EVERYDAY I NEED TO CHARGE EVENTHOUGH I DIDNOT PLAY ANY GAME OR SEE MEDIA.IF WE PUT FULL CHARGE ATLEAST IT SHOULD LAST FOR ONE FULL DAY.MORNING IF IT IS 100 PERCENT EVENING IT COMES AROUND 35 PERCENT.CURSE FOR SAMSUNG.
5,Best samsung mobile in this price category.Thank you Amazon.
2,"I would not recommend this product to any age group.This mobile has most slowest processor, even on first day you feel like you are operating crashed system.Go for bit higher prise product you Will not regret."
5,"If we compare the product quality with the price, definitely it is a value for money device for your daily usage.Battery life is very good, charging is a bit slow but ok.Look wise the phone gives a decent look from back side which can be increased by using back cover.Front side look is awsm.Screen size is good for gaming and movies, performance is great even in sunlight.Camera quality is absolutely fine.Definitely you can go for this having a branded logo on back."
5,A wonderful value for money! I had asked it as a extra side phone. It provides excellent prolonged battery life and beautiful design that doesn't get you off. The performance is obviously not as fast as premium phones in terms of speed if you want to use as a multi purpose phone. But basic apps just do all fine.
1,Defective Item was received.IMEI number is not displaying when dialing the required number.Requested for a refund but exchange partner has refused to collect it despite raising a request within 24 hours.Please check the seller on Amazon before purchasing your products.
3,The phone gets very hot with minimal use.Editing the review after the phone was replaced. This time got the right product and it works pretty well.Guess it was a faulty product to begin with. Happy with Amazon. Samsung needs to do their quality checks better.
5,Just amazing..Battery back up to video quality as well as net working and perform too fast..
5,"Very good budget phone with big screen. Support is only for 2.4ghz WiFi and not support 5ghz WiFi which user is missing compared to other manufacturers smartphone around same price range. Charger point is not so smooth to insert the charging pin and seems it might cause priblem after an year use, but need to see how it copes with."
5,One  of Best mobile phone in this range💪 truely💪awesome
3,After using this device for 5 days I can share some pros and consPros-1- Budget smartphone from Samsung at this price range.2- Screen is better in performance.3- 5000 mAh battery life stands upto 24 hours after watching videos for 5 hours and calling. (Couldn't play game)4- Picture quality is average.Cons-1- The device lags and sometimes hang on performing easy steps like shifting app to app.2- Multitask becomes difficult as it is slow in performance.3- Camera is not upto the mark.4- Doesn't feel premium while holding the phone.5- due to bigger battery the mobile feels heavy. (206 gms)6- Found bugs like-(1) Pressing power button takes time to wake and sleep the screen.(2) Home screen zooms upto 300% without activating.(3) Opening camera stucks for upto 5-10 sec sometimes.(Will update more if found)Thanks!
5,Good quality product.. working perfectly. No defects found on mobile. Good quality rear cameras and good quality front cameras. Good sound quality.  Good display quality . Light weight . Good touch sensitive. Designs and colours are good . In this price mobile  is good. Phone back Is made of plastic. Good performance ram no lag coming . Android 10 installed . After we connect internet  to phone we get updations of all. Totally good mobile. Total 10 gb is used in rom 22 gb Is balance.
1,Believe me guys don't make mistake you will regret. This phone hangs a lot even at normal task like opening notification panel or settings or receiving calls. Better go for other brands if you are tight with your budget they buy new Gionee phones Gionee F103 pro was my first phone there are some software update problem but except that everything runs much smoother than this M02 and note it this Gionee phone was 5 years old and still you can play COD in it. Even i have played pubg recently before it was ban. Now i ordered new mobile because i was getting battery issue in my Gionee handset and trusted Samsung but i got something more bad than previous phone.Don't buy it!
1,Pathetic performance of the phone. My father in law was using old redmi 3i for past many years. Since it's battery was almost gone i bought this useless mobile with weakest processor. Opening a dialer itself takes 3-4 seconds. I didn't imagine this like sluggishness of the mobile from Samsung. Better i would've gone with xiomi or realme. Wasted Rs.7500.. lets see how long will it work
4,"So I ordered this phone 20 days ago I guessAs i got a good exchange offer for my repaired handset i only paid 900.About the product-The screen quality is awesome at this price point, the battery is also promising, build quality is above average however it doesn’t offer fingerprint which is pretty basic even at this price.The main concern with this handset is the ram management on this one creates problem. The multitasking can’t be done fluently and yes it lags a bitTo me I purchased this handset for my 2.5 years old niece as she loves watching videos throughout the day. So for us it was a health purchase but for those who want to use this as a primary phone. Please increase your budget otherwise you will be irritated."
1,"I am not happy buy the mobile in amazon.Whats in the box:- Handset, Earphone, USB Cable, Sim Tray Ejecter, Pre-applied Screen Protector and Protective Case, Booklet with Warranty Card and Quick Guide"
5,Best Product Thnx for Amazon.in
5,Very nice phone.Eye protection also there.Awesome looking.Delivered very quickly
5,Nice
1,"Please don't buy this mobile. Waste of money. I buy this mobile before 20 days only. Now not working properly. Hanging problem, handset very slow. Please don't buy it"
5,It's worth for 9.5k. after exchange offer.light weight n thin.easy to use.mobile have fingerprint n facial recognition to unlock and lifespan of battery lasts long.ram n rom are good.worth buying it.camera quality is ok.
1,Hi i received this item on 16 july.after 10 days phone start hanging.it automatically switched off.it repeating again and again.its being automatically switched of.please solve my issue.please take necessary action as soon as possible.
1,There is no headphone in the box... unsatisfied 😟 disappointed ☹️
2,"It's an average phone. Quite on the pretty side. ONLY those who are looking for a budget phone can think of purchasing this one. The camera is very average, but the functions & controls of the phone are smooth. It's very lightweight - that's a plus!"
5,Its a really very amazing and a nicely working phone..the camera quality and battery is also very good🤩😊.liked the product very much
4,Nice phone value for money but in inbox there is no earphone and screen protector receive being a regular customer of Amazon i am  unhappy there was  clearly written that these items are included in inbox.
1,"when i ordered this phone , headphone is free with phone but received order without headphone"
3,i have recently bought this phone..on 18 may 2020.. delivery is good but there was no headphones in a box.features r awesome nd phone is working gud.but camera quality is bit bad.
1,Worst mobile . I never expect from oppo such a low grade mobile. Touch is not working. Phone hanging. No return and replacement option.  From Amazon I got bad experience. Don't buy this mobile. Waste of money.
5,"Nice mobile prices 12,450"
1,"Body sensor not working. Was late by 2 days to find out this defect and so could not use ""return"" option.Due to body sensor problem, phone display never gets off while talking and so when brought close to ear, buttons like mute, hold gets activated while speaking.The basic function, which is to talk to others on phone becomes troublesome. Everytime have to very careful of holding position to make sure phone is not touched on body. Hate this and feel cheated/dejected.Cannot return as well."
1,It is roadside product with dusty display. When called Amazon customer care she deny to replace item. Don't buy anything from Amazon. Amazon only sells defective items. I returned many items and this was very useless response. She also disconnected call.USELESS AMAZON
1,This mobile was used by someone else.I have got someone else's mobile.I am not happy for this mobile.I will not do return this mobile.Because the reason of I give gift for other person.
4,"Better to value for money , quality is as per shown ..And fast delivered by amazon."
1,Earphones not received in a phone box
5,"Oppo always exports premium quality mobiles. Let there be no such features like other mobile but i phone also doesn't export such features at high price, then?I have attached some pictures also you can check them incase you wanna see the picture quality.Hence you can buy this without any tension.Amazing mobile's camera and body quality and display is also good.Go for it I suggest. 😃"
5,Fantastic
5,The phone is excellent but if the front and rear camara should be high and should be their dark mode compalsary but it should be added fastly and should give ear phonesonly main default is not nice camara should be high because the less cost mobiles will take more tean agers so they do moor selfies so it should increase and oppo is the selfie expert but this phone no selfie expert camara for next phone it should increase .Imay think I will increase
1,This product received wrost.. In this item some useful applications not run..Order canceled but no cancelation status and pick up status updating by Amazon..No any contact provided by Amazon..Realy disappoint..
2,This product details said there is a earphone and screen protector.  But i didnt get that
1,Don't buy it from Amazon the return service of Amazon is very bad..disgusting they never think customer problem no one in call centre never call you return policy and service is very poor only benefit looking cite ... don't buy anything from amazon.. in future I never buy electronics items from Amazon... flipcart is most trusted than amazon
3,"I like the product. But as compared to my other phone Realme X2. I found the lag in processing in some of minor things also. It is having 6GB RAM then also the having some processing issue. I don;t like the product. Even after this specs, the things are getting lag."
4,Nice mobile in this Price 👌👌👌👌..
5,Very nice phone for Rs.12500/-
4,Nice product...but there is no C pin charger  thts only one prob in this product...
3,Headsets are missing in the phone box...where are the original headsets...its normally included in phonebox??
1,The phone lags a lot right from the box. You have to swipe 3-4 times. Apps get hung. Never seen such a pathetic phone.
4,"Good product  but as compared to Mi note 8 its not Good . If you want to rought use for bussiness purchase.. Provessor is slow , not for gaming. But want you tube and surffing it's usefull. Another all thing is good .I don't have time for upload pics , but this review is enought.Product is same as photos."
1,"i have received the waste and damaged products and i chasing the customer support from last 10 days no solution upto now waste of money on  amazon ,waste of time on amazon ,and i customer of amzaon from last 5 years and i am a prime member this is the services i am getting"
5,For the money an excellent phone. My usage is mostly for mail and messaging. Bit of browsing and reading. The battery lasts for two days in my use. I bought one and then I was very happy with it and I bought another of the same.
1,"Screen quality is very poor , camera is also nearly poor, all over the phone is worst. I ordered this phone by choosing the no cost emi option of Bajaj , but they are also taking the processing charges of Rs.174 on every instalment.So please don’t use Bajaj’s emi option for ordering this phone. Thanks"
3,Updating after 4month :-screen recorder not available..which is default function of every android now a days..-Charging draining faster but charging gaining very slower.-its not a 21st century phone .. so many basic features missing Day 1: experience:-Most important : it will not redirect the link into the present app in mobile .... It will open link every times in default browser..Eg: if I got any Facebook /insta /Twitter link and I already have installed these app then it will not asking me to get open with app instead it will redirect to browser and again I need to login... So so poor technology1.processor looks slow while setup and configuration my account data restoration as compare to redmi note 7 (same price older version phone than this)2. Camera quality is very low both back and front ...capture blurred images..not focusing the face even after setup manually.3.  Not value for money.. I think I made mistake to choose oppo brand .. I compare all the feature with redmi.. redmi looks far better than this..4. No front flash light available to click in night5. Looks slow to handle multiple apps compare to redmi6. Please don't buy this phone..this is so poor technology phone..
5,I have been an user of nokia 6.1 as it started to face issues I have opted for this one. After using premium phones like Xperia and Nokia I feel the fabrication is not upto to the standards. Helios processing a little slow.Banking apps a little stretched due to the size of the screen. Rest all a good buy.
1,"I couldn't like it bcoz of its poor water resistence quality.I bought it on Dec.2020 but the working system of this disturbed on March 2021,within a period of 2-3 months.It is great loss .It mars  the Credibility of the Company also.I wanted to purchase one more but the damage has spoiled my mood n faith.I want compansation for the loss.It would be of great support n credibility of the company if it exchangeg the mobile OppoA31,Mystery or mend it properly without my loss.If the company do this favour,it would be a gentl step towatds customer care n service as well as the establishment of strong credibility n capabilitu of the Company."
1,"1. Phone don't have type C charging2. Dual app not possible for all app like redmi phones3. Charger is normal 5v 2 Amp so no fast charging.4. Not for multi tasking people.5. Camera and sound average6. Processor and touch very slow7. Only 6GB RAM AND 128 GB ROM is good  in this phone.8. Also it's not showing dual 4G9. Battery is only 1 day at normal uses.10. Display dpi is also very low.11. Can be treated as entry level phone.12. WhatsApp Camera function is abnormal, don't waste money on OPPO A31"
1,SAMSUNG WROST QUALITY PHONE PRICE IS TO MUCH I AM A REGULAR USER OF SAMSUNG FROM S2 TO S21 (S9 IS BETTER QUALITY THAN S21)S21 BROKEN MY HEART IN FUTURE I NEVER BUY SAMSUNG AND ITS PRODUCT AND AMAZON ALSO NO RETURN POLICY
5,"One of the best flagships I have used in my recent purchase... Samsung has done a good job with this S21 series... The display is super amazing, battery life is fabulous... Overall the product offers a quality experience... Although it should include a charging adapter and a back cover..."
5,"Nice,but heating issue,says exynos has the problem will it be rectified by software update.or what shall I do"
5,"If you're stuck between choices, hopefully I can help you out.- Priced around 82k(discounted to 76k with a galaxy watch active 2 free in my case)Tldr: comparison between OnePlus 9 pro and this phone, if you're looking for great camera at the cost of just a little snappiness, this is the phone to go for. (Details below)1. [Speed]: A lot us living in India have been accustomed to the ultra fast responsiveness of OnePlus phones, they are optimised for speed, that's their selling point, so OnePlus takes a lead in that dept. Again, in no regard is this a slow phone, just doesn't match snappy standards of OnePlus.(I myself was a OnePlus 6 user before and was considering OnePlus 9 pro)2. [Camera]: I am no professional photographer, yet I can clearly see the huge difference between camera quality of Samsung and OnePlus phones, especially the selfie camera, OnePlus really doesn't even hold a candle to this phone's camera. This one goes to Samsung.3. [Bloatware]: Over the years samsung has been criticised over overloading it's phones with preloaded samsung apps which majority of users won't use, on the contrary, OnePlus has always held a great rep for providing clean android out of the box. Does this phone have samsung apps? : Yes. Are they as much in number and intrusive as they used to be: No. I was most sceptical of this while buying as my father who has a mid range model of Samsung has a lot of bloatware, but to my surprise this one does not. Point still goes to OnePlus for much cleaner OS, but it's pretty clean on Samsung's side now too.4. [Exynos]: I don't game a lot on phone, so probably isn't the right person for benchmark comparisons, but from all my usage the phone hasn't shown any signs of lag at all. One point I'd like to mention though is that the phone will get warm to touch even on moderate use, but if you use a cover(which most of us do) you won't notice it.Conclusion: As you can see that the phone clearly compromises a bit on performance when trading blows with OnePlus 9 pro, but it's camera department makes up for it by a great margin. In my case, I was looking for a phone with priority towards a great camera, so I went for this. But if that isn't a priority for you, then I'd recommend going for OnePlus 9 pro"
5,The fone is a beast.. battery life is superb.. it gets u through the day. Camera quality is top notch. Finger print scan is the highlight.. my first galaxy fone and I am loving it.  A charger brick would have been appreciated but nonetheless every house has a type c charger now a days. So over all a good buy..
2,"edit: had given two stars earlier due to laggy performance and grainy low light shots, must say that it has gotten better after software upgrades. But still not upto a flagship 80k price level, I think that's the gap b/w exynos and snapdragon."
5,"Cameras are above and beyond the best of all Chinese ""flagships"" ..processng and mutil tasking is superfast... Battery lasts over a day and wireless charging n reverse wireless charging(for wireless pods or watch) is topping... Dex is a gem hidden.. also I went for 256gb version so 4k 60fps vide capture is lovely to capture and loom at... streaming on all platforms is best with such bright n crisp panel."
5,"Writing this review almost 3 weeks of use.The build quality of the phone is good and it also feels sturdy to hold. The matt finish glass back and the chrome finish aluminium body allows for a firm hold [no drops yet ;)]. The matt finish metal camera housing blends well with the aluminium body, although the bump seems to be a bit odd but i dont think that would matter, coz most of the users will be using it with a case [considering the cost of the phone :D].. The overall quality and feel is premium to say the least.The display quality is good and the 120mhz refresh rate does make the viewing experience stand apart. The touchscreen quality is awesome. Although i would have preferred a curved display.The sound quality is fairly good,probably coz the ear piece acts as a speaker on top. Could have done better on the sound quality.The camera quality is superb, although the quality degrades a higher zoom. The night mode enhances the image at the cost of resolution and seems grainy when zoomed in. But it still fairs better.Phone performance is good with memory hogging apps and games although there is some heating but thats acceptable.Charging seems to be somewhat slow even with the 25w Samsung charger which needs to be brought separately :( not a good move by Samsung [stop following the crowd ;)]Overall to summarize, satisfied with the product. Got what was advertised.Sorry no product photos, will upload some soon."
5,"S21+ heats up after 30 mins of normal usage, it is completely normal for first week of usage.As AI runs always in the background to learn the usage pattern.No Complaints after one week."
1,"First let off is the adapter for charging the mobile is not provided. The problem is you need a type c adapter which you have to buy separately. Most importantly, it is not available from website to buy original samsung adapter. So you pay 80k to buy a phone without the adapter and then you buy a duplicate adapter for 3k...Dont buy this phone"
1,Samsung processor is worst even 10 min of normal usage it gets heated upBattery life is very badSometimes freezes which is shameOnly camera is fine rest all i worstEven my s8 plus was far better than rhisTottaly waste of money
5,Good and Nice phone...Moved out from Chinese phones ...back to my Galaxy again...Real and true flagship...Battery life is OK to Good..since it's a single 4800 MAH and it's available for one day..Phone looks decent..Exynos 2100 processor is good and fast enough but it's still not equal to Snapdragon 888 in some areas...I have not come across any heating issue in this phone..Samsung will release optimized software updates in the near future..CAMERA quality is really superb and once again Samsubg proved they are the leaders...Night vision..8k videos ..Videos to camera conversion..film.maker mode...very versatile phone...Sammy u did EXCELLENT  JOB HERE🥰🥰🥲🥲Phone design is very unique and it's outstanding ..Chinese phone makers....please grown up guys...overall an excellent beast in this price range..kudos to Samsung...
1,"Amazon mentioned wrong terms condition about bundle offer active 2 smart watch, samsung terms condition are different for redemption. Both terms condition showing different date for redemption Amazon show after activation of 72 hrs date between 15 April to 31 may and smsung date are 25 to 31 may.But I'm not getting smart watch and stuck between Amazon and Samsung.Amazon not taking any responsibility clearly deny."
5,Processor is fast.
4,Samsung flagship doesn’t need any introduction but here is what i have liked and disliked in my usage since last couple of months.1. Exceptional screen - super smooth fluid screen. Colours are rich. Switch between 60 and 120 hz option is available.2. Pro camera - I am really impressed. I still prefer Google Pixel for camera in a phone and I believe no camera phone in the market can beat that. But the “Pro” mode on this phone is too good. Gives DSLR like features. It is super awesome. Normal camera is also very very good. I am attaching some of the photos taken from this.3. Average battery life - it is ok. Gives one day backup with average use (4-5) hrs screen time.4. Fingerprint sensor doesn’t work with tampered glass - None of the tampered glass available in the market works with in screen-fingerprint sensor. It is better not to use fingerprint sensor if you decide to apply a tampered glass. I am using it without any screen protector. But i am using a flip cover.
3,Phone is overheating with basic usage (105+)
5,Got it for 63k after couple of offers (active 2 watch with the payment of 990/- is separate)1. Impressive camera. Try clicking picture of moon uzing 30x zoom and the results would be surprising.2. Exynos 2100 is way better than the previous gen processor and at par with Snapdragon 8883. Very good battery life. Light usage will take you to 1.5 to 2 days without charging.4. One thing everyone misses is the adaptive refresh rate which helps in saving battery.5. It's Samsung display panel! Come on!6. Toughest gorilla glasse yet both front and backOverall I found great features and according to me it's worth the price I finally had to pay!
3,Camera: Selfie is excellent. Rear camera is not so great. It become blur when we zoom it.Battery: life is good but it gets heated when we use camera. The heat is unbearable as if it may get blasted. Evwn it gets heated while charging too.No adaptor where we need to search for some other.Looks: excellent but slippery. Have to be very careful.
5,I upgraded from Samsung s8+ to Samsung s21+. Phone is awesome battery life could have been better.
5,"If you're looking for the complete android Flagship package without competely breaking the bank look no further. Great performance and battery life. Don't be disssuaded by the Exynos chip, it's plenty fast even when compared to the Snapdragon 888 in the OnePlus 9 Pro. Battery life is plentiful and heats a bit while charging but stabilises soon. Overall great value for money. Great option if you're looking for a brand change as well."
4,"S21 plus has a great screen, good battery life, excellent camera and I did not find any heating issues with the phone. However,  I am really missing the Dash Charging of 1plus series. Samsung should not have copied Apple on selling phones without adapter, not for Rs 65-70k phone! I am still looking for a charger that can fully charge in less than 2 hrs."
4,"Before buying Galaxy S21plus I have done alot of research and finally got this 256gb variant for 67k,will get watch active 2 or buds pro for 990. Then we are paying only 50K.It's very smooth and awesome mobile.Battery life is not great but okay (getting 5:30 to 6 hours SOT) and Upto 3× pics are good , Camera quality is nice.It's not more expensive if we include additional products price.if we compare with iPhone12 price 256gb  or oneplus 9  It's really worth buying.There are no heating issues for exynos 2100.But I recently faced one issue is lag in camera app. Let's see if they resolve in future  updates.I have attached the latest SOT which is on 13th june ( 7 hours) after keeping the charging with samsung 15watt adaptor. Previously I used to keep the charging from the laptop USB C port."
1,The Samsung watch offer quoted in the product description is a scam. That is only applicable to s21 ultra prebooked in first half of January.
5,"This is my first Samsung phone, to be honest not disappointed at all. I love the phone, it's easy to use, takes great vibrant pictures even though it might sometimes feel unreal and functions well as a work phone without any issues. Still it's not apple and I will continue to use them side by side. I would recommend to purchase this phone to anyone who has doubts whether to choose this over other phones in the category & price range."
4,"Good camera quality, battery lasts about12 hours, however heating issue still persists. Overall, good phone"
5,The best s series phone !!! Awesome looks ... amzing display... super solid processor... don't think just buy it better than iphone 12 in all aspects..
4,Good phone with a nice battery.Easy to useLitbit it get heats in the beginning.Again it cools down.No more problems.Camera is good.New and different types of modes in the camera.Amazing.Just go for it.Price is heavy.Overall good.
3,"I would have given 5 stars if my phone box was not opened and resealed. Other than that, the phone is awesome.For my usage, the battery lasts for 24hrs.The only bug it has is, when I use the camera everytime I click a photo the charge goes down by 1%, that too in high resolution mode. So for ten clicks approximately 8 to 10 % of battery is lost. None of the other apps drains battery that much."
5,"Simply silky smooth and the best ! Worth the price. Don't go for another phone, just buy this one, you won't regret."
4,It takes too much time to chargeCam is osmDisplay and design 👌Finally I'm ok with this productAnd i got this mobile at 63000₹ + samsung watch active2 ant 990₹ + 25w charger 1500₹ Total price is 65500₹
5,"Overall experience is nice. Camera is good. Performance of 2100 processor is fine too. Night mode is kind of average. Gaming experience is not the best but better than the previous generation. I think, SD865 is still the most stable process. 2100 and SD888 is based on 5nm architecture, which produces more heat."
5,"Great phone. Shifted from one plus 5T. Thought of buying one plus 9 pro but after the various issues faced by users in the review went against it. So far absolutely loving this phone.  Excellent battery life, amazing screen, smooth performance, awesome camera. Only thing I wished for was Samsung to include the charger."
2,"It's not user friendly device, hard to use"
4,The phone is very good but the battery backup is very poor. I some times start thinking that the battery is already used one.
5,It's a great flagship phone. Bought at 63k (256GB variant) after exchanging an old phone. Everything is great about the phone. Only 2 issues : no fast charger provided in the box and even after 1 week  Galaxy Active Watch 2 is still not available on Samsung Shop app.
4,"Battery life is good for this phone,  little costly considering  no charger and earphones  provided with handset, it should have been provided along with phone itself"
4,Overall it's a best phn in the market but if u can afford 10-12k more Go for Ultra through bank offers n exchange
1,"Kindly replace this product.  As promised,  it is not upto the mark as far as battery is concerned.  Very very poor battery. Doesn't last even for a day despite making only 2- 3 calls a day and no  to minimal usage."
3,Price is high but phone performance not good
5,Got a very good deal I got the phone with 256gb of storage and also the buds pro in 70k which is very good 👍👌😀
2,"Please be aware that this is a downgraded version of globally launched Mi 11 and Mi 11 pro.Reason for low rating -1. Ordinary display. This is not the 2K display as featured on global versions of Mi 11 series2. No gorilla glass victus unlike global version.3. Band tests shows poor build quality which may result in breakage of phone due to bending4. Such a cheap tactic of selling a phone with the promise of fast charging and not providing charger with a adequate charging capacity.5. No curved display unlike global version.6. Took almost 20 days to get my hands on the phone post order.7. Reported heating issues in SD 888 while playing intensive gamesIn short, xiaomi has attempted to sell big story by first launching Mi 11 globally and then putting ""X"" and selling subpar product in India through illusion.I guess, Xiaomi should not have cut the corners and compromise the quality in Indian versions. Indians are willing to pay premium and success of oneplus is the testament to that. Any cunning move to undercut the value proposition will hurt xiaomi in long run.(note that I currently use redmi note 20 pro and have used so many phones of xiaomi ever since it launched first ever phone in India and hence hold a adequate credentials to voice my criticism as a fan)"
5,"What a Smartphone by Xiaomi! I am thoroughly impressed. I was using One Plus earlier but now One Plus doesn't stand a chance.  No one is giving you Snapdragon 888 process at this killer price, so just go for this.Display is gorgeous and just unbeatable. Even Samsung Galaxy S21+ is no match in display. Latest E4 Amoled is magical – vivid colors, 1300 nits brightness, and 120Hz sampling refresh. You won't even notice such a small front camera punch hole.Camera is best in class. Time freeze motion mode, Telemacro and clone mode are just amazing features.Overall device feel so premium in hand thanks of top in class glass, ceramic and metal body."
4,"Received my Mi 11x Pro today😻 . Really excited . Came with a  power adapter, usb cable,clear case ,type c to 3.5 mm converter and everything that is given in the what's in the box.My first impression was overwhelming as it was a major upgrade from my last phone. It's a piece of art, the glass body and the amoled display makes feel.. Terrific.. 😅 One thing to take extra care is the camera portion which is placed Protruding at the back . The case is of average quality. The phone is butter smooth 🤤 It's just been a few hours so hoping for the best 🤞"
5,"I love gaming and have been waiting for a SDM 888 under 40k which does not compromise on any aspect, and now i finally have it in my hands and its a Gaming Beast.The 360 Hz touch sampling rate makes up for buttery smooth game control. For all mobile gamers, pls have a look at the touch sampling rate as that determines more your response times, even more than screen refresh rate (not that Mi 11X pro lacks there with its vibrant 120 Hz OLED Panel).Camera Again, since I love making travel videos, and have been using an iPhone 11 for the past one year, this has been a welcome change, with its saturated and punchy images and videos that are a treat to the eye. For vlogs in outdoor scenarios, audio used to become an issue, however audio zoom  feature really helps reduce background noise and focus on the subject. No need to carry a separate mic!I have always liked soft bright colors on my gadgets and so chose the celestial silver one. Considering the hardware it packs the phone is surprisingly light and slim.As for the user interface which is MIUI, this phone has the cleanest version of MIUI yet. However being a nerd, I never shy away from the plethora of custom ROMs that popular Xiaomi devices get over at XDA, and this I am sure is going to be a blockbuster one, just like the K20 Pro from the past!! SO that's something up to try in the future!!"
5,"One of the best phones from Xiaomi, display is outstanding, camera, chipset are all the best you can get at this price, in-display fingerprint scanner is missing but trust me, side mounted scanner is more fast than u expect, this time Xiaomi has killed OnePlus in all ways possible, and also must say that the UI is much more clean and Im really enjoying the new software teweks..😊Last but not least Super wallpapers in amoled display looks insanely amazing"
5,"Such an wonderful phone , everything is fast, wonderful display and feature packed"
3,"I am a oneplus 5 user for the last 4 years. So I can only compare it with Oneplus 5. Mi 11X pro is having one of the worst front cameras. The output is too artificial. In terms of processor, it's good, but you should think twice if you are looking for a mobile with a good camera."
5,"Loved theCrisp screenSnappy processorUFS storage speedGames turbo modeCamera - awesome after tweaksDidn't like the Mi bloatware, but can be removed. Overall, a great package deal. Feels like a flagship, works like a flagship"
5,"This is my first Xiaomi device, switching from One Plus . I generally do not tend to change devices frequently, so before buying I make sure that I know what I am getting into.Why I considered this device?Wanted the flagship processor, a good display with high refresh rate and dual speakers as I consume a lot of OTT content, 5G support to make the device future ready and a slim phone profile.YaysReally good performance, day to day multitasking is a cakewalk thanks to SD 888 processorHigh touch sampling rate provides an edge while gaming, controls feel much more responsiveDisplay is really bright and vivid. The colour reproduction is unparalleled.  This display can give the flagships a run for their money, may be even beat them.Camera captures crisp and detailed images, colours are tuned perfectly (something which even OP has not been able to fix). Really loved the Magic Zoom, Slow Shutter and the Freeze frame modes.I had been a bit skeptical on the UI because MIUI has a history of pushing bloatwares and ads. It came to me as a surprise that there are no ads or bloatwares. Really enjoyed the feature rich and highly customizable MIUI.A vertical camera setup, Gorilla Glass back and slim footprint makes the device feel really premium. I really loved the back panel and how the colour changes when viewed from different angles.NaysNot a fan of punch hole display but Mi 11X Pro seems to have the smallest punch-hole I have ever seen on any other phone."
4,I got the product on time. Phone camera quality is very good and faster processing and charging are added benefits. I was able to charge my phone to 100% in leee than one hour. And it took 9 hours to discharge my phone to 1% while using hotspot and streaming high quality videos at the same time.
4,I have used iq007 legend for a week and returned it. luckily i got refund and purchased this mi 11x pro. I  generally play pubg at least 2 hours a day in HDR+EXTREME but I didn't find that much heat and frame drops in mi 11X pro but iq007 legend produced some heat and observed frame drops.  battery drop is equally more after gamming in both the devices and 33watts will be a draw back for mi11x.camera is very discouraging. details are very bad even with 108MP mode but 108MP camera in mi10 5g produced sharp detailed 108MP images. not satisfied with mi11x pro cameras.
5,"Overall KICKASS device, but some of my favourite features -- Display - simply gorgeous!, those colours - so vibrant, and so butter smooth- Processing speed - super fast - easily able to multi task.- Camera - some awesome UI optimizations - my favourite is the time freeze motion mode. The telemacro is just dope!- Very clean UI - no bloatware- This phone just feels right to hold! great hand feel.- I thought Audio zoom was a gimmick, but that actually works. Great job Xiaomi!"
5,"I am writing this review after using it for more than 15 days. If you are looking to buy Flagship mobile under 40k you can close your eyes and go for it, Performance is outstanding when use multiple apps i never see a lag and for gaming it is really awesome and coming to camera segment i have attached some pictures which i took two days before pictures says everything. Excellent flagship phone from redmi"
5,"I came to buy One Plus 9 in this portal and Found a phone which is configuration wise much better than than my previous choice . I chose to save 10K with no compromise on the product .Now the question is what are the additional benefits I got even after saving 10K ?1. Got a Bigger and much better display 6.67” Vs 6.55” ,2. Much Brighter 1300 Vs 1100 , P2i coating to support water and resistant ,3. Also liquid cooling with better refresh rate as during lockdown I keep playing games so these two features was necessary . Also I know Battle Ground Indian version is coming .Now these were only feature wise benefits . But the experience was even better got the delivery on 14th so for last 4 days includes the long Eid Weekend I kept playing games and watching Netflix .Got no heating issue , battery is too good , and screen is much better and bigger … Finally I have bought another Redmi 9 Power , with 10K which I saved  for my niece’s online class 😀"
1,Worst mobile even wastage of money if it's price becomes 10000
5,"I got the phone delivered even with lockdown in the city, thank you Amazon!i am happy with the device. The DIsplay, Camera, PHOTOS, speed - everything is just perfect.For me DISPLAY is most important - we stare at the device all day.This is probably the best display I have seen in premiurm range phones. I think E4+ Amo led and Display Mate tech is helping.Other important things are camera and speed. It has a gorgeous camera - no complains only. The device is very fast, using non stop for last few days.Other than that -It Feels sturdy and the OS is quite clean, smooth.Couldn't find an cons as such... will update if I find something.Overall: It your budget is in 40k range - don't think, just go for this device - you will be happy!"
5,Super phone with all flagship level specsEspecially performance was beast with low costThanks mi
5,"Today received my order, as of now it is excellent.Took long time for delivery due to order prioritization."
5,"I'm writing this review after using the phone for a fortnight. I will breakdown my review in terms of Pros and Cons:PROS:- Best AMOLED screen in the market. The display is of the greatest quality. From colour saturation to brightness, everything is crisp and clear.- Celestial silver looks really premium.- Side mounted fingerprint sensors are REALLY FAST. The phone unlocks in a jiffy. Face unlock also works really well.- Camera is above average, if not the best. The 104MP rear camera takes stunning images and the picture quality is superb. Xiaomi has provided some great camera features like Vlog modes which is really fantastic. Videos shot in 4K & 8K are really good.- Speaker & sound quality is THE BEST. Love it.- WiFi & network reception are working better than expected. Supports WiFi calling, which is really helpful.- Processor is FAST. RAM management is really good.- Battery life is above average.CONS:- Not a fan of Google dialer & messaging app. MI dialer & messaging apps were FAR BETTER.- Proximity sensors are not working to the best of their capabilities. I hope they fix it with an update.- Front camera is average, if you take selfies.Overall I love this phone. I won't be wrong to say that this is the best phone in the market, at this price range. In fact it can knock down some other phones which costs 60/65k, I hope you understand my hint ;)."
4,Overall an excellent phone with everything power packed. Just the issue that i found was of battery draining fast. I hope an update from Xiaomi will solve this and further optimize it.
5,"Will write detailed review later but here is my opinion, if you're confused between iqoo 7 legend, oneplus 9r & Mi 11x Pro go for Mi 11x pro considering all round performance.-Good in Camera-Performance is silky smooth-UI is very much improved MIUI 12-Android 11-Not much of a bloatware issue-Amazing Stereo speakers (Dolby Atom)-Gaming is amazing as it has flagship SD888-Not much of a heating issues as compared to previous flagship (will heat after heavy processor usage & it's normal cuz it have SD888)I would say that if you're buying a phone just for a single purpose i.e. gaming go for iqoo 7 legend it's best in class flagship processor. But Mi 11x Pro for all round usage."
5,"The Mi 11 X Pro is beautiful phone which has everything above the cut.Starting with display, being the only phone with a A+ certification is amazing, the E4 AMOLED on this is quite bright for a phone, have used a phone with such high brightness till date. Very distinct even under direct sunlight. Content watching on this phone is exceptionally good and playing games on 120Hz is a tootally different experience.Next comes the camera, the camera setup is too good, the pictures are not only near perfect on the phone but also when you use the image on your computer. The dynamic range of the phots are really good. Tried a bit of video recording and was amazed by the quality of the video recording, the time freeze motion and the audio zoom work well. By far one of the best camera's I have used on a Xiaomi phone.I was not so sure about MIUI but it seems to have become way better, there are few cool features which I can never let go but its been a pleasant experience so far, looks like Xiaomi has finally woke up to improve their software experience. The overall experience is snappy, Snapdragon 888 being the best of the best the performance matches to it, everything just works as expected.Combining all of these in a light weight yet durable form factor is a amazing."
5,"After watching a lot of videos and reading a lot of articles online, I finally decided to try out this phone. After using it for a week, I wasn’t disappointed at all. Listing down a couple of things that really impressed due to the price point for this phone:Loved the glossy black colour. Looks beautiful and very premium. The phone felt really good to hold in my hands, being super light and thin.The display was exceptionally bright, and I could really feel the colours coming alive while watching Netflix. I’m not a fan of the selfie camera in the display, but this punch hole camera was quite unobtrusive while watching movies and playing games. I really liked this.I play AoV on my phone, and was quite impressed with the smooth display and the fact that the phone was not heating up after playing for more than an hour. I guess I have the 888 processor to thank for this. Not sure if any other phone at this price offers this one.Last, but not the least, the camera here is quite good. I usually don’t experiment with different settings, and just use all default settings. Even then, the images produced were stunning. I did a quick comparison with people in my family (who use apple and oneplus) and really liked the way the colours were balanced in the photos from my camera. The level of detailing that this camera can capture is also very high.With all my office work, social media, watching youtube, movies etc.. the phone usually lasts me for 1.5 days after a single charge.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a power packed device at an affordable price. Totally worth the money."
4,"Definitely not the top tier phone yet impressed.Love the design. Snapdragon 888 has loads of raw processing power. Wifi 6 support is what I loved. 108mp camera shots are okay. Felt that the photos are much better than my old OnePlus 7Pro shots.Cons:-Hate the slow data transfer usb 2.0 port-Slow 55 minute charging.(33w Sonic charger)-Miui Bloatware (getapps, Xiaomi ads, Tencent trackers) are a hassle can be removed using debloater tool from PC.-NightMode is horrible.-Overheating issue, hopefully should be fixed with MIUI 12.5 update in coming months."
5,It is the best phone and truly a flagship at a very reasonable price.  Samsung/Oneplus: you are are looting people just due to your brand name.  Xiaomi is giving best features at best price.Please ignore the cons as mentioned in many of the views as it is a perfect phone as on date.  Everything about the phone is too nice and you will have good feeling of holding a true flagship mobile in your hand.You will not regret buying this phone rather will feel that it is truly a value for money mobile.Keep it up Xiaomi !!!  Very Beautiful Smartphone !!
5,"Writing a review after using the phone for 24 hours.Looks - This can be subjective but I love the celestial silver colour. Changes colours as light hits it. Look at pictures in my review. Bezels are thin and the phone is light weight.Display - This is my first phone with an Amoled display and boy what a world of difference. I compared it next to an Iphone 11 which has an IPS LCD panel and this display is so much better.Performance - Very snappy. No stutters in day to day usage. I'm not a gamer so can't comment on gaming performance.Camera - Very Nice. I paid extra for the 108MP sensor as compared to Mi 11X. Looks like it was worth it.Battery - Average. Normal usage got me an SOT of 5.5 hours, which is not bad and not great either.All in all very good value and in my opinion much better than OP 9R."
5,I needed a really good phone as a second device to help me with recording videos along with my mi 10. This more than satisfies the requirement. What I liked most :Camera - images come out clean with the right saturation. Some cool modes like the clone mode are fun to use with kids around the house. Great for shooting my pet dog!Display - super bright and very clean visuals. Don't know the tech terms but looks phenomenal. Think the 120 Hz refresh rate is a bit of game changer.Performance - Haven't seen any lag on any of the applications I've run including heavy shooters or video editing short clips of my dog for YouTube.Design - black is my preferred color after having lived with light colored phones ...this feels cleaner to hold. Comfortable to hold and carry despite the largeish battery.Overall a great phone and at this price it's a no brainer. Miui is also optimized for performance and has a simpler interface. Love it so far.
3,"Average phone, some heating issues, 108 MP camera just making fool as they did same in Note 8 pro, Nothing much difference when  I compare to Note 8 pro vs 11 pro in terms of speed and smoothness, when we compare the price there is Lot difference."
4,"Writing this review after using the phone for last 7 daysFirst of all, the display is superb, phone is also nice and easy to hold onto hand and lightweightIt's very fast with SD 888 and 8GB RAM, silky smooth for day to day work and gaming (gets hot after 10 mins or so)Back camera is awesome, pro feature and videos are really cool. UWD camera is pedestrian thoughBattery, drains really fast, not sure why. Forget about 120HZ refresh rate, even with 60HZ and with normal use (no game!!), phone had to be charged within the day. I found that with 60HZ, dark mode and battery saver on, phone lasts a day without charging. This is a bit disappointingNext comes the software, MIUI needs improvement. Found strange issues like error popup during first time set up. It also starts to misbehave (like touch does not work properly, or hangs sometime) after 1-2 days of use and had to restart to get over it. I hope fixes will come soon for thisOverall I still feel it is a great value for money, if software is fixed, then other than battery, phone really becomes a flagship killer!"

4,"Today I got the delivery of this phone in my Home town. Great Service Amazon India, Thanks !!The phone is Cosmic Black, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage version.PROS:1) Very decent-looking backside cover, not you feel like the cheap plastic one.2) Came with ok  Ok clear soft case.3) Came with screen protector/cover loaded on the front screen.4) The phone is very fast, reviewed after using for 20+ hours.CONS:1) THE BATTERY LIFE IS NOT GOOD, IT DRAINS  FAST. While I am trying to set up all the needed Andriod applications in this phone, the battery drains from 38% to 5% within 20 mins of use.2) This phone is having a  Heating issue after using for 30 mins only. If I play some heavy games for 1 hour, surely I can make an omelet on the backside of the phone 😡 . This is the only reason for which I bound to give a 4-star rating to this phone.Overall this phone is good, attractive in looking (both front and back), rich in features, value for money."
5,"I think Xiaomi has killed the competition with a complete package in its latest flagship Mi 11X Pro!• The Snapdragon 888 5G is amazingly fast and delivers a great performance. I am sure the gamers must be loving it already!• The Camera with the Telemacro sensor is mind-blowing. I think Xiaomi has just nailed the camera tuning to get the perfect shots on the device. My favourite features are - the Time freeze motion mode, Clone mode and AI Skyscaping.• The 120 Hz refresh rate along with the vivid colours on the E4 AMOLED display, give a next level silky smooth experience. DisplayMate A+ display and 360 Hz touch sampling rate are perfect for gaming.• The sleek design and light- weight device is a 'thing of beauty' to hold in your hands. Not to forget the Celestial Silver variant is too pretty to behold!• Loved the clean new MiUI experience so far with reduced Bloatware and optimized battery life.Final Verdict: The best premium device with the best display, a great camera and a steal deal at this price! I have been in love with the phone!"
1,Don't buy ... because cemera is totally bad ..not working properly... Hitting issues .
2,"I have bought two phones redmi note 10 and mi 11x pro simultaneously from the amazon. One costs 12500 and other costs 40000 and to my surpise camera of redmi note 10 is better than mi 11x pro. Performance side I don't have any complaints, multi-tasking can be easily done on this phone. Camera is where Xiaomi has really cut the costs. If you are looking to buy this phone expecting that camera will perform ok considering that all other specs are flagship then don't buy this as the camera has 0 star performance on this phone. I am also returning my phone"
5,"After MI 5, i am buying thisExtremely smooth, Found some bugs which was fixed in the last update.No lags while playing pubg (on UHD mode)Battery life is excellentNo heating issues as many saidI miss that In display finger print reader. Side mount has some issues while puting and taking the mobile out from pocketSince i used with the miui, I cant go away from miui and i love miui. So iqoo is not the phone i could choose.Also i need the IR blaster. Please othe(R) brands too add IR blaster"
2,"Please be aware that this is a downgraded version of globally launched Mi 11 and Mi 11 pro.Reason for low rating -1. Ordinary display. This is not the 2K display as featured on global versions of Mi 11 series2. No gorilla glass victus unlike global version.3. Band tests shows poor build quality which may result in breakage of phone due to bending4. Such a cheap tactic of selling a phone with the promise of fast charging and not providing charger with a adequate charging capacity.5. No curved display unlike global version.6. Took almost 20 days to get my hands on the phone post order.7. Reported heating issues in SD 888 while playing intensive gamesIn short, xiaomi has attempted to sell big story by first launching Mi 11 globally and then putting ""X"" and selling subpar product in India through illusion.I guess, Xiaomi should not have cut the corners and compromise the quality in Indian versions. Indians are willing to pay premium and success of oneplus is the testament to that. Any cunning move to undercut the value proposition will hurt xiaomi in long run.(note that I currently use redmi note 20 pro and have used so many phones of xiaomi ever since it launched first ever phone in India and hence hold a adequate credentials to voice my criticism as a fan)"
5,"What a Smartphone by Xiaomi! I am thoroughly impressed. I was using One Plus earlier but now One Plus doesn't stand a chance.  No one is giving you Snapdragon 888 process at this killer price, so just go for this.Display is gorgeous and just unbeatable. Even Samsung Galaxy S21+ is no match in display. Latest E4 Amoled is magical – vivid colors, 1300 nits brightness, and 120Hz sampling refresh. You won't even notice such a small front camera punch hole.Camera is best in class. Time freeze motion mode, Telemacro and clone mode are just amazing features.Overall device feel so premium in hand thanks of top in class glass, ceramic and metal body."
4,"Received my Mi 11x Pro today😻 . Really excited . Came with a  power adapter, usb cable,clear case ,type c to 3.5 mm converter and everything that is given in the what's in the box.My first impression was overwhelming as it was a major upgrade from my last phone. It's a piece of art, the glass body and the amoled display makes feel.. Terrific.. 😅 One thing to take extra care is the camera portion which is placed Protruding at the back . The case is of average quality. The phone is butter smooth 🤤 It's just been a few hours so hoping for the best 🤞"
5,"I love gaming and have been waiting for a SDM 888 under 40k which does not compromise on any aspect, and now i finally have it in my hands and its a Gaming Beast.The 360 Hz touch sampling rate makes up for buttery smooth game control. For all mobile gamers, pls have a look at the touch sampling rate as that determines more your response times, even more than screen refresh rate (not that Mi 11X pro lacks there with its vibrant 120 Hz OLED Panel).Camera Again, since I love making travel videos, and have been using an iPhone 11 for the past one year, this has been a welcome change, with its saturated and punchy images and videos that are a treat to the eye. For vlogs in outdoor scenarios, audio used to become an issue, however audio zoom  feature really helps reduce background noise and focus on the subject. No need to carry a separate mic!I have always liked soft bright colors on my gadgets and so chose the celestial silver one. Considering the hardware it packs the phone is surprisingly light and slim.As for the user interface which is MIUI, this phone has the cleanest version of MIUI yet. However being a nerd, I never shy away from the plethora of custom ROMs that popular Xiaomi devices get over at XDA, and this I am sure is going to be a blockbuster one, just like the K20 Pro from the past!! SO that's something up to try in the future!!"
5,"One of the best phones from Xiaomi, display is outstanding, camera, chipset are all the best you can get at this price, in-display fingerprint scanner is missing but trust me, side mounted scanner is more fast than u expect, this time Xiaomi has killed OnePlus in all ways possible, and also must say that the UI is much more clean and Im really enjoying the new software teweks..😊Last but not least Super wallpapers in amoled display looks insanely amazing"
5,"Such an wonderful phone , everything is fast, wonderful display and feature packed"
3,"I am a oneplus 5 user for the last 4 years. So I can only compare it with Oneplus 5. Mi 11X pro is having one of the worst front cameras. The output is too artificial. In terms of processor, it's good, but you should think twice if you are looking for a mobile with a good camera."
5,"Loved theCrisp screenSnappy processorUFS storage speedGames turbo modeCamera - awesome after tweaksDidn't like the Mi bloatware, but can be removed. Overall, a great package deal. Feels like a flagship, works like a flagship"
5,"This is my first Xiaomi device, switching from One Plus . I generally do not tend to change devices frequently, so before buying I make sure that I know what I am getting into.Why I considered this device?Wanted the flagship processor, a good display with high refresh rate and dual speakers as I consume a lot of OTT content, 5G support to make the device future ready and a slim phone profile.YaysReally good performance, day to day multitasking is a cakewalk thanks to SD 888 processorHigh touch sampling rate provides an edge while gaming, controls feel much more responsiveDisplay is really bright and vivid. The colour reproduction is unparalleled.  This display can give the flagships a run for their money, may be even beat them.Camera captures crisp and detailed images, colours are tuned perfectly (something which even OP has not been able to fix). Really loved the Magic Zoom, Slow Shutter and the Freeze frame modes.I had been a bit skeptical on the UI because MIUI has a history of pushing bloatwares and ads. It came to me as a surprise that there are no ads or bloatwares. Really enjoyed the feature rich and highly customizable MIUI.A vertical camera setup, Gorilla Glass back and slim footprint makes the device feel really premium. I really loved the back panel and how the colour changes when viewed from different angles.NaysNot a fan of punch hole display but Mi 11X Pro seems to have the smallest punch-hole I have ever seen on any other phone."
4,I got the product on time. Phone camera quality is very good and faster processing and charging are added benefits. I was able to charge my phone to 100% in leee than one hour. And it took 9 hours to discharge my phone to 1% while using hotspot and streaming high quality videos at the same time.
4,I have used iq007 legend for a week and returned it. luckily i got refund and purchased this mi 11x pro. I  generally play pubg at least 2 hours a day in HDR+EXTREME but I didn't find that much heat and frame drops in mi 11X pro but iq007 legend produced some heat and observed frame drops.  battery drop is equally more after gamming in both the devices and 33watts will be a draw back for mi11x.camera is very discouraging. details are very bad even with 108MP mode but 108MP camera in mi10 5g produced sharp detailed 108MP images. not satisfied with mi11x pro cameras.
5,"Overall KICKASS device, but some of my favourite features -- Display - simply gorgeous!, those colours - so vibrant, and so butter smooth- Processing speed - super fast - easily able to multi task.- Camera - some awesome UI optimizations - my favourite is the time freeze motion mode. The telemacro is just dope!- Very clean UI - no bloatware- This phone just feels right to hold! great hand feel.- I thought Audio zoom was a gimmick, but that actually works. Great job Xiaomi!"
5,"I am writing this review after using it for more than 15 days. If you are looking to buy Flagship mobile under 40k you can close your eyes and go for it, Performance is outstanding when use multiple apps i never see a lag and for gaming it is really awesome and coming to camera segment i have attached some pictures which i took two days before pictures says everything. Excellent flagship phone from redmi"
5,"I came to buy One Plus 9 in this portal and Found a phone which is configuration wise much better than than my previous choice . I chose to save 10K with no compromise on the product .Now the question is what are the additional benefits I got even after saving 10K ?1. Got a Bigger and much better display 6.67” Vs 6.55” ,2. Much Brighter 1300 Vs 1100 , P2i coating to support water and resistant ,3. Also liquid cooling with better refresh rate as during lockdown I keep playing games so these two features was necessary . Also I know Battle Ground Indian version is coming .Now these were only feature wise benefits . But the experience was even better got the delivery on 14th so for last 4 days includes the long Eid Weekend I kept playing games and watching Netflix .Got no heating issue , battery is too good , and screen is much better and bigger … Finally I have bought another Redmi 9 Power , with 10K which I saved  for my niece’s online class 😀"
1,Worst mobile even wastage of money if it's price becomes 10000
5,"I got the phone delivered even with lockdown in the city, thank you Amazon!i am happy with the device. The DIsplay, Camera, PHOTOS, speed - everything is just perfect.For me DISPLAY is most important - we stare at the device all day.This is probably the best display I have seen in premiurm range phones. I think E4+ Amo led and Display Mate tech is helping.Other important things are camera and speed. It has a gorgeous camera - no complains only. The device is very fast, using non stop for last few days.Other than that -It Feels sturdy and the OS is quite clean, smooth.Couldn't find an cons as such... will update if I find something.Overall: It your budget is in 40k range - don't think, just go for this device - you will be happy!"
5,Super phone with all flagship level specsEspecially performance was beast with low costThanks mi
5,"Today received my order, as of now it is excellent.Took long time for delivery due to order prioritization."
5,"I'm writing this review after using the phone for a fortnight. I will breakdown my review in terms of Pros and Cons:PROS:- Best AMOLED screen in the market. The display is of the greatest quality. From colour saturation to brightness, everything is crisp and clear.- Celestial silver looks really premium.- Side mounted fingerprint sensors are REALLY FAST. The phone unlocks in a jiffy. Face unlock also works really well.- Camera is above average, if not the best. The 104MP rear camera takes stunning images and the picture quality is superb. Xiaomi has provided some great camera features like Vlog modes which is really fantastic. Videos shot in 4K & 8K are really good.- Speaker & sound quality is THE BEST. Love it.- WiFi & network reception are working better than expected. Supports WiFi calling, which is really helpful.- Processor is FAST. RAM management is really good.- Battery life is above average.CONS:- Not a fan of Google dialer & messaging app. MI dialer & messaging apps were FAR BETTER.- Proximity sensors are not working to the best of their capabilities. I hope they fix it with an update.- Front camera is average, if you take selfies.Overall I love this phone. I won't be wrong to say that this is the best phone in the market, at this price range. In fact it can knock down some other phones which costs 60/65k, I hope you understand my hint ;)."
4,Overall an excellent phone with everything power packed. Just the issue that i found was of battery draining fast. I hope an update from Xiaomi will solve this and further optimize it.
5,"Will write detailed review later but here is my opinion, if you're confused between iqoo 7 legend, oneplus 9r & Mi 11x Pro go for Mi 11x pro considering all round performance.-Good in Camera-Performance is silky smooth-UI is very much improved MIUI 12-Android 11-Not much of a bloatware issue-Amazing Stereo speakers (Dolby Atom)-Gaming is amazing as it has flagship SD888-Not much of a heating issues as compared to previous flagship (will heat after heavy processor usage & it's normal cuz it have SD888)I would say that if you're buying a phone just for a single purpose i.e. gaming go for iqoo 7 legend it's best in class flagship processor. But Mi 11x Pro for all round usage."
5,"The Mi 11 X Pro is beautiful phone which has everything above the cut.Starting with display, being the only phone with a A+ certification is amazing, the E4 AMOLED on this is quite bright for a phone, have used a phone with such high brightness till date. Very distinct even under direct sunlight. Content watching on this phone is exceptionally good and playing games on 120Hz is a tootally different experience.Next comes the camera, the camera setup is too good, the pictures are not only near perfect on the phone but also when you use the image on your computer. The dynamic range of the phots are really good. Tried a bit of video recording and was amazed by the quality of the video recording, the time freeze motion and the audio zoom work well. By far one of the best camera's I have used on a Xiaomi phone.I was not so sure about MIUI but it seems to have become way better, there are few cool features which I can never let go but its been a pleasant experience so far, looks like Xiaomi has finally woke up to improve their software experience. The overall experience is snappy, Snapdragon 888 being the best of the best the performance matches to it, everything just works as expected.Combining all of these in a light weight yet durable form factor is a amazing."
5,"After watching a lot of videos and reading a lot of articles online, I finally decided to try out this phone. After using it for a week, I wasn’t disappointed at all. Listing down a couple of things that really impressed due to the price point for this phone:Loved the glossy black colour. Looks beautiful and very premium. The phone felt really good to hold in my hands, being super light and thin.The display was exceptionally bright, and I could really feel the colours coming alive while watching Netflix. I’m not a fan of the selfie camera in the display, but this punch hole camera was quite unobtrusive while watching movies and playing games. I really liked this.I play AoV on my phone, and was quite impressed with the smooth display and the fact that the phone was not heating up after playing for more than an hour. I guess I have the 888 processor to thank for this. Not sure if any other phone at this price offers this one.Last, but not the least, the camera here is quite good. I usually don’t experiment with different settings, and just use all default settings. Even then, the images produced were stunning. I did a quick comparison with people in my family (who use apple and oneplus) and really liked the way the colours were balanced in the photos from my camera. The level of detailing that this camera can capture is also very high.With all my office work, social media, watching youtube, movies etc.. the phone usually lasts me for 1.5 days after a single charge.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a power packed device at an affordable price. Totally worth the money."
4,"Definitely not the top tier phone yet impressed.Love the design. Snapdragon 888 has loads of raw processing power. Wifi 6 support is what I loved. 108mp camera shots are okay. Felt that the photos are much better than my old OnePlus 7Pro shots.Cons:-Hate the slow data transfer usb 2.0 port-Slow 55 minute charging.(33w Sonic charger)-Miui Bloatware (getapps, Xiaomi ads, Tencent trackers) are a hassle can be removed using debloater tool from PC.-NightMode is horrible.-Overheating issue, hopefully should be fixed with MIUI 12.5 update in coming months."
5,It is the best phone and truly a flagship at a very reasonable price.  Samsung/Oneplus: you are are looting people just due to your brand name.  Xiaomi is giving best features at best price.Please ignore the cons as mentioned in many of the views as it is a perfect phone as on date.  Everything about the phone is too nice and you will have good feeling of holding a true flagship mobile in your hand.You will not regret buying this phone rather will feel that it is truly a value for money mobile.Keep it up Xiaomi !!!  Very Beautiful Smartphone !!
5,"Writing a review after using the phone for 24 hours.Looks - This can be subjective but I love the celestial silver colour. Changes colours as light hits it. Look at pictures in my review. Bezels are thin and the phone is light weight.Display - This is my first phone with an Amoled display and boy what a world of difference. I compared it next to an Iphone 11 which has an IPS LCD panel and this display is so much better.Performance - Very snappy. No stutters in day to day usage.

3,Pros:1. Light weight2. Detachable battery3. Clean display4. Latest security patches for Android 10Cons:1. Can observe lags in screen transitions. Not a smooth navigation. Rendering is staggered.2. Auto-brightness feature is chaos. Frequently changes brightness even when they lighting is stable and phone is unmoved.3. Facebook is part of the stock OS and cannot be uninstalled.
2,"Poor signal reception (both wifi & mobile) makes this product unusable.😏 Other than this is worth for the price.While speaking a call,many interruptions(signal reception failure) occur even at good signal area (my older devices didn't make this type of complaint).Connecting to wifi also a very very slow work. Sometimes it doesn't load/download anything(simply loading).😏If HMD global solved the signal reception problem with software update (if the problem is with software), this device is worth. If the signal reception problem need hardware related solution,then this is really a bad product to purchase. Since we've purchased mobile phone primarily to call and connect with internet. But while that purpose is in a risk,then how to use this product?🤔"
5,"Recieved today, I would like to say its very good option of other Chinese phone in this segment, NOKIA  as usual always rocks, You will get battery removal feature in this phone."

And now Nokia customer care is saying that they don’t replace any smart phone, they only repair. So now am stuck !!! Slightly disappointed with both Nokia and Amazon! Now I think I shud have just bought a phone from a shop:(:("
2,ProsLightweightCompatible sizeGood for budget phone below 7kConsThe performance of Mobile is not goodPlaystore is crashing all the timeCamera quality is below average
5,"Pros: 1.) SD Card can be used as internal memory so no storage issues2.) Comes with clean Android, no unnecessary APPS like Chinese Brands ( we can disable few unnecessary except facebook)3.) 2 years mandatory Security Updates4.) Screen Casting is working very good with out any issues5.)Performance is very good much more than I expected, No lagCons:1.) SOUND quality is bit bad, like a 3 year old mobile2.) Camera is like Note 6 pro Camera ,not comparable with current mobilesOverall very good for Elder People , (Build quality, Storage, Screen Casting,Android one, Big screen, no unnecessary apps which confuses Elders, 1 year Nokia Replacement) One Main Thing Nokia Mobile updates doesnt make your Mobile Slow after 2  years . Other Chinese Brands updates makes the mobile performance bad to make you buy new one even with IPhone its the same , IPhone was fined for this in Europe."
1,Phone processor is very slow and one can not run the phone smoothly. I thought after take over nokia will try to change its brand image by selling superior quality products but it seems management is not interested in selling quality phone and they are just  ruining nokia’s brand image which was built after Woking on quality and durability.
5,"Pros:+ The phone oozes a good sense of value for money. It does justice to its price (one cannot expect sky-high premium features at this price).+ Good build-quality as expected from Nokia.+ Display clarity is good for a phone at its price point.+ The Nokia Android user interface is near-identical to stock Android. Have not faced any lag issues. The phone is decent at light multi-tasking for a device at its price point.Cons:- The selfie camera could have been better. (The main camera is fine.)- Wish it had come with Android One integration. Hopefully the phone might get some security patches from Nokia.Overall a great phone if you are on a very tight budget and have trust issues with Chinese brands, and do not want to buy phones with heavily modified, bloatware-filled Android."
3,"Sound quality is not a super one, but at this price it's fine and no other hand set will provide better. Nokia looks good brand. Wide screen. With this budget it provides more than enough and I don't think any one should be very critical about technical specifications and performance. It performs as it should. With this price recommend for any user who's need is smartphone. Look wise it does not let you down."
1,"Very very very..... poor service, first I got phone which was restarting randomly, so I have replaced it, replaced item is also defective, there is no display on phone, after that I initiate for refund request, amazon delivery agent Zakir came to me for pickup the phone, he checked phone and said I will not pickup your phone because there is no display, what an answer, he told me to get email from amazon customer care, I called amazon customer care and get email that phone has display issue, 2nd time initiated return request now this time again Zakir came, and Now he is saying there is no display in phone so I can't get IMEI number so I can't pickup phone, and without giving proper answer he go away, third time I initiated pickup again, same guy Zakir came and now he took my phone in his hand and said same, I am not getting IMEI so can't pick your phone, this time I asked him to explain me exact issue, he refused and gave me answer rudely, now since that day I have initiated 7 pickups all the time my pickup of defective phone is canceling."
1,"THE PRODUCT IS FAULTY. Within a couple of days of using it, it started frequently asking to do a Recovery, because it could not ""Load Android System"" and needs to do a Factory Reset by wiping out all user data. The phone was allowed to do this reset 3 times over a period of a week. The error still keeps popping up, rendering the phone useless. When I tried to return the product on Amazon, the return window was already closed. How can an electronic device be given only a 7 day window to be returned?? I would NOT recommend this device. EDIT: Added screenshot of the error."
1,"The phone doesn't have enough space and on top of that, it comes with tons of useless preinstalled apps. So basically you can not install any new app and the phone fails to do basic day to day stuff. Don't waste your money, don't waste your time. You won't be able to do a simple google search also with this phone. Even I had to open amazon. in my laptop just to order a new phone."
2,Mobile hanging frequently internal memory get fill with very minimal app installing.Screen settings get changed after mobile switching off and on.Nokia should improve the software part and do proper testing before it get released to customer.Now I need to follow up with Nokia service centre for fixing the issue.😔
1,"I have brought Nokia C3 for my father. When i started phone , its home screen was not seen at all.Very poor product. Please , please do not buy it. It is totally  waste of money.I requested to replace it, but even after two days it is not possible.Amazon customer care number is not responding.Very pathetic condition. I have decided not to buy online any product"
1,Extremely sorry to say horrible product And mentally disturbing after sales reaction . New Nokia C3 is in hanged status from day one and put it for return for the last one month . Since the phone is hanged and show home screen as ‘android phone ‘ collection agent refused to pick due to inability for verification of IME no . Ever since I had escalated 6 times to customer service it did nothing to arrange a pick up or refund . Only way to fix is to file criminal complaint on fraud . Never trust the brand for high value items . Similar bad experience on Oxi meter too
1,This is the worst phone ever i ordered it once it has a battery problem so i put an exchange the second one which i got doesnot even start at all
1,"Worst product..I replaced it 2 times but didn’t get a good one..had some problem or the other..called the customer service, they couldn’t provide assistance..Nokia is a trusted brand.didn’t expect this"
1,The product is the worse. The seller that Amazon has paired up with is a fraud and a cheat and is selling damaged and defective products again and again.The phone does not switch on and even if it does it does not show any control keys and keeps hanging again and again.The worst product. I don't know why Amazon is selling this product with an enhanced price.
1,"Camera Quality very worst, unable to update with google camera"
5,Basic specs in a beautiful design. No notch so you can use the full screen. Battery could have been better. Camera is low-res if you're used to better ones. For basic uses this is good. Has extra Google assistant button
3,Product is good in build quality but the software is not as expected and needs more improvement. Just a call history directly don't show the number saved and we have to click on history to see the details. Calls gets hung sometimes and the floating caller button disappears sometimes. Needs more improvement.
1,Frequently reboots on its own. Needs to be factory reset occasionally. Screen freezes while using. Returned.
1,"It has some issue, it won't charge up 50% even if charged for 6 hours &  as soon connected to charger error pops up saying ""Battery Temperature is very high"", asked for a replacement or return after seeing the ""Battery Temperature High"" issue, it could be serious."
5,"Great performance, features and video quality. Sound has slightly higher treble but can live with it. Very sturdy. Battery is removable and sim slots are convenient."
5,"Nokia as always the best. But pretty basic smartphone. Good for elderly people. Plastic build. Removable battery, first after so many years.  Latest Android. Average camera."
1,"Device hangs a lot... Bluetooth doesn't work at all, i have received a device which unable to connect to other device using Bluetooth. Its a company fault"
1,"Low quality product seeling by Amazon. Don't buy this kind of items from Amazon, i brought this on last week and the phone box was open when i got it, so frns be carefull and if u need this phone dn buy from nokia website only.And I'm still waiting for my refund"
2,"Phone is fine, battery is quite pathetic barely lasting 4-5 hours of minimal usage, just a few calls and an hour of videos."
1,Not working properly.
5,I AM SATISFIED WITH.  BUT THERE IS NO HEADSET INCLUDED.  OTHERWISE PHONE IS QUITE FINE. THANKS.
1,Phone does not start nor it can be charged fail to understand why did vendor not checked that
1,Minimum 3to4times daily hanging problem (After call received)Please give me free replacement
5,"Awesome mobile at 7.5k, Sound quality is good and picture quality is ok. Performance wise, it is good."
1,"Working very slow, hanged always, no space available. Always need to uninstall an application while need to use another one. When someone calls nothing shows on the screen."
1,Not good ... trying to copy from apple or Samsung both and ended badly again
1,No return and refund facility available for this worst product. Plz don't buy it.spend some more amount and buy good company phone instead of this rubbish.my amount went in hell.plz be safe.
3,Worst mobile. Never consider buying this. I've asked for replacement but the new device hasn't arrived yet. Do not waste your money in Nokia. Instead go for Chinese companies like Redmi in this budget segment.
5,I'm satisfied worth buying totally worth it
3,Its good....but i dont get the headphone with new phone...this is disgusting...
1,Waste of money..don't purchase...
5,Great photo Ossam phone
5,"Happy to write 1st 100% Satisfied product review regarding Tecno Spark 7 Pro (Magnet Black 6GB RAM 64GB Storage smart phone). Liked Unique features like Kids Mode, Special functions, FREE from Harrassment filter for Spam calls and SMS, chip-assisted protection, Display Eye care setting, Truely worth of price satisfied with its features. Competes well with other top branded phones."
5,"Been using it for a few days and specs really hold up. I had just bought this as it was good value for money phone I could find with 4GB+64GB. But after using it, I realized the other features like the display, battery backup and camera are all great. Screen is highlight!"
5,"I was slightly skeptical about buying Tecno but after seeing my friends use it, I went ahead. After using it for a few days I realized why Tecno is so popular. I was never into clicking pictures, but after seeing the camera in this phone, I have begun trying my hand at photography. I feel the phone does the job more than I do. Best camera ever."
5,"I loved the camera on this phone. You can check from the pictures in my review that how amazing pictures you are able to click. This phone has a whooping 89.5% of screen to body ratio. I'm a huge gaming buff and watch a lot of movies and series. The big screen is such a delight to watch on. Also, the 180hz processor makes gaming smooth. Overall, I love this phone."
5,"I bought the phone after a lot of research,as i wanted a value for money all rounder and boy there are so many options...This one has it allLOOKS -9/10 -Looks stylish,suave,upmarket and yet simple.CAMERA- 9.5/10 - Fantastic camera at this price , both pictures and videos are amazing with great ai featuresBattery,Display - 9/10Go for it if you want a vfm all rounderCONS-1.Not really a con but it has single front flash whereas the specs mentions dual front flash,so though usage wise it's not at all an issue but you expect better communication.OVERALL-9.5/10 -- GO FOR IT!!!"
1,"Not dual front flash,Only single flash"
4,"Amazing finishing, great speed worth for money."
5,The phone works well without any performance issues like time lags or apps hanging midway. The screen resolution is excellent and gives a crisp viewing experience with bright colours and good clarity. The camera has an excellent resolution and is able to take equally vivid photographs during day and night-time. I would absolutely recommend this phone to anyone who’s looking for a seamless experience at value-for- money prices.
5,"After a month use:Happy With:-Battery Life: one time charge for more than 1 Day- camera quality: 100% satisfied with the photos with good detail- Screen good for watching movies netflix, watched all episodes of Family Man 2 on this phone. Brightness and good color- so many colorful theme options"
5,"This phone is super cool, and I think 'xiaomi' , 'oppo' or 'vivo' like brands will not provide such a phone for even 16K bucks.Its a super gaming smartphone. The battery life is awesome. The phone doesn't heat even if you play games for 6 hours (I'd tried playing about 4 hours myself, and the result surprised me) . Even all the features are of superior quality. The camera is like samsung galaxy worth 45K bucks. There is such a huge amount of features I can't even state here. Suggesting everyone to buy. 😇😇😇😄😄"
5,"I was the first person to buy a Tecno in my family. And once, others saw the performance, this is the third Tecno phone. And as usual, Spark 7 pro also hit the bull's eye in terms of value for money. The camera works amazingly video calls and even for clicking pictures in the night. Best buy ever!"
4,Nice mobile to use that. Back camara excellent. Front cam not bad. Need to improve some settings. In Mobile hotspot settings not able to manage connections.Have a good battery. But slow charging.
5,"I urgently needed a phone and I bought this phone after being recommended by a friend. It seems to have everything in it. Amazing AI camera, long battery, great display etc. Moreover, it's Andriod 11. What more can I ask for? Check the pictures I posted. The camera captures great light and has sharpness. I am a happy Tecno customer."
1,Please if you found delivery by appario private limited... Please don't buy... I got 2nd hand mobile and returned. Mobile is okay okay... But I will recommend to you go with redmi not 9... Looks great... This techno looks like dagar.....youtube videos not looks good.
5,"I love the specs. I had just bought this as it was cheapest phone I could find with 4GB+64GB. But after I recieved it, I realized the other features like the display, battery back and camera are all amazing. This phone is clearly the best phone for 10k."
4,Good Mobile Phone
5,"Hello Friends,I giving first time feedback and 5* to this mobile phone for overall performance and value for 💸 with best features."

5,I wanted a gaming phone and all the other options were very expensive. I went for this and I think I have had the smoothest gaming experience ever. I face no issues like heating up and lagging. It feels like any game on this is a cakewalk. The battery also supports several hours of gaming.
5,Budget
4,"Tecno spark 7 is best mobile ,this price renge ,awesome performance ,,and look like very good  Thnku techno ....."
4,In this range this phone is very good.
5,I receive today so looking good I using some day after written any author
5,"Writing the review after roughly 2-3 weeks of usage.First, the colour is unique which makes it stand out of the other phones in this segment. The rough contour at the back helps to solidify the grip. So seems to be quite suitable for rough users.Secondly, the battery backup is pretty huge despite the screen and ability to multitask.Apps run smoothly, and camera quality is excellent during day, and decent during the night. Network and storage is another USP, as my primary usage is to make calls.The big screen and RAM let's you enjoy netflix, games, and youtube all the the same time, in super HD quality. And not to forget the face unlock feature!Turned out to be a great buy, extremely value for money with the variety of features provided!"
5,"It's almost a week I am using this phone. First of all, really loved the colour. Wasn't sure if it would be as good as shown in picture but it is. Ordered the green one. Second, the battery surprisingly lasts for a long time. It takes a little time for phone to get fully charged, but once it is, I can get a lot of work done. If you are looking for screen size and battery you can go for this. To top that there's an amazing camera. Loved the filters in the AI Camera and the portrait mode."
5,I have been using the phone for 1 week now. The phone is very smooth and you can multi-task easily.The camera (both rear and front) are really good. The pictures and videos are very sharp and well lit. I experimented with both Macro and low light photography. The results are quite good. Highlight: The AI feature automatically switches to the mode.Battery is good. 6000mAh.  I charge it once a day and easily watch movies and play games.Overall a very good buy.
4,"Requirents were : good front and back camera with flash on both sides, decent storage , quality display for good browsing and multimedia playing experience. So I  was waiting for micromax in 1b 4gb version which comes rarely in stock  when I came across review of this mobile .

5,"Back panel and design are great. Strong and handy phone with decent performance. Network availability is good, and easy to carry. Camera works fine, but the screen size, brightness and battery are top class.Ideal for the first time smartphone users."
5,Really impressed with the design of the phone. The design is premium and classy especially for this range.Most satisfied with the battery backup as it easily lasts a day and a half on heavy use.Camera and screen are excellent as well for the budget.
5,"Have added photos after a month use.I am a moderate user who does everything except gaming. That said, the battery lasts up to 1 and half daysDecent cameras for the price. Pictures are satisfactory but could be better.Very responsive fingerprint sensor and good sound quality."
5,"Excellent entry level phone with premium phone features. Battery backup is really good, network availability is good, the phone is light and handy. Check out pictures clicked using the phone."

1,Battery bahut dheeme charj hoti hai 18 ghante lagte hai
1,Mobile software are very good.. But charging 🔋⚡ is very late... For 1 hour only 5% will charge.... Totally bakwas mobile. Pls don't buy.
1,"Defective product shipped.. reported within a  few  hours of receipt and no one showed up for inspection despite several follow ups. Now, it is not being replaced or refunded. Horrible experience!!"
5,Nice phone camera better attractive look
1,"The headphone jack is not working  😡 Despite the customer care approved the replacement the delivery boy is not listening to them.He is standing at the door, calling this or that official and not replacing my phone. I feel so much harassed. Please somebody intervene."
5,Design-GoodCamera-NiceDisplay-satisfactoryBattery backup-Up to the markOverall-Must to have phone for redmi lovers
5,"First sell, First order. Mobile is very nice..."
1,"Worst phone ever. Don't buy ths phone.heating issue at the bottom side of touch screen, touch button as well as ghost touch activates on its own within 1-2 minutes and you can not use any of the app properly.Initially thought it may be a due to some kind of virus, even after company reset issue is there and also you can see screen flickering very easily."
1,"Before buying you must know the difference between 7k mobile and 10k to 15K Mobiles .Reason for choosing this title earlier i used a pro version model , Now i am reviewing this model after 3 days of usage.1. Ear speaker quality in outdoor's very poor  . Keep your headphones handy ,2.Sensor's are not working properly ( this is the reason i choose this title , sensor quality is based on price )3.App search option is not available  , you must be very patient to search required app when you have an urgent need , you have to swipe all your mobile to choose required app . or change the launcher . default launcher is not capable of doing this basic function .Rest all other functions are good  ."
1,"This is my 4th MI Phone in 3 years. Earlier ones were good.But here The extra battery has made phone heavier and hence has lost it charm, now looks like chinese phone. Earlier ones were as good as other phone apart from brand.Not recommended.Would love to return but it was gift for family,"
5,"I bought this for an older relative who needed a basic smartphone. Given its pricepoint I didn't have much expectations for the Redmi 8A but after unboxing and setting it up I have to admit - it looks and behaves like a premium phone!In almost every aspect 8A has been upgraded over the 7A. While it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, the camera is much better than I expected. There is a bit of lag in opening and switching between multiple applications but it shouldn't be a big deal for people with basic usage patterns. To facilitate better grip, 8A has a non-glassy back that is textured. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the phone given its pricepoint. For its target demographic (light users who might just want to take some pics, use social media and the occasional app) this is a great phone.The only drawback I felt is that Xiaomi has been aggressive in bundling custom apps in the phone that deliver lots of ads and sponsored videos by default (and it requires some know-how to disable them)."
3,Mobile is good at this priceBut when I was using hotspot and screen recording the mobile became overheated it hanged so i switch off it.In this range mobile is really good..
1,The phone hangs a lot. Processor is too slow. Apps close on their own. Can't ecen listen yo music continuously.
1,"We are highly unsatisfied with the product .There is performance issue with the phone in which the touch ,speed as well as the processor is very slow.It does not worth the money and the sound quality is also low.The battery also gets drained very early though it is of 5000 mAH.We have mailed a return request but they have not taken any action.I need to return this phone and want a new phone as soon as possible."
1,Mobile software crupted within 2 months ...I visited MI store after Lockdown ....Mi Store not giving warranty service asking for money for service ...I am longtime user of MI mobiles but this time it hurted me ...no more MI mobiles
1,Defective display (minor scratch) on the scratch and there is now way i can return / service / request replacement.
3,"Perfect mobile for a beginner level smartphone with 2day battery backup, the only problem is processer only otherwise there's no issues"
5,PRICE : ECONOMICALPERFORMANCE: BUTTERY SMOOTHLAGS: NOBACK CAMERA: GOODFRONT CAMERA: REASONABLESCREEN QUALITY: EXCELLENTBUILD QUALITY: EXCELLENTBATTERY CAPACITY: 5000 mAhFINGERPRINT READER: NOBODY MATERIAL: PLASTICFEONT GLASS: CORNING GORILLA GLASS 5OVERALL THE PHONE IS LAG LESS & PERFORMANCE IS GREAT.WORKS REALLY WELL.BEST BUDGET SMART PHONE.
1,I purchased this phone in Feb. 2020  from Amazon site and now it's May 2020 and  I find it difficult to swipe it open after the display goes on sleep mode.  So this is the status it's touch mechanism within 3 months.  So one has to be careful about buying cheap quality Redmi phones as the touch mechanism may not be of good quality..
5,"Camera: Good Quality. In good light, the pictures are awesome.Battery: No doubt, awesome backup.Display: Smooth and colors look better than similar range phones.Screen: No tempered is compulsory. Smooth and reliable.Sound: GoodI bought this for mom. Definitely a awesome product for regular average use.Don't see what is missing because what is provided in this phone is rare or not there in other products with same or even higher price range"
1,From 12 the day it is not working. Mi service center re installed the software but still it is not working
5,"Top smartphone in this priceEXCELLENCE camera , great display"
3,"Nice design,heavy, gr8 display size , camera quality poor, battery capacity excellentGood price for these features"
1,"My review for Seller Appario :2nd ViDEO :DEFECTIVE PIECE: Mobile is misbehaving... suddenly clicking on any/many app... ""WITHOUT TOUCHING ON SCREEN""... suddenly opening Gmail... suddenly opening SMS and start typing... very sad..."
1,"I was purchased Redmi 8A on.  19/02/2020,  but received phone is defective,  i was already registered my complain, but Amazon not postive response."
4,"Phone is good, no finger print reader, but price is disappointingBecause it is launched at a price of 6499 now see the price"
4,"The phone has many pros and some cons.The cons are :Speaker sound is not that good.Sound with bluetooth headphone ,earphone is not good.Equalizer can not be used in case of bluetooth headsets, earphones.There should be a 4 ,64 gb variant.There are some MI apps which can not be uninstalled.Camera is ok, medium quality."
4,"I was a little sceptical while purchasing this phone as it was my first Chinese phone as I was fed up with my mom's rough phone usage! She successfully killed many good brand phones like HTC, Samsung etc so wanted something really cheap this time. I paid 7500 for this phone even though the old price was 6500! Due to lockdown, I had no option to roam around! The best part was I got 3100Rs for old Samsung J4 in exchange with no mess, whereas local shopkeepers were talking about 1k resale value lol! That was less than year old phone though but still, I was happy with buyback price so went ahead and decided to buy this phone even though there are plenty of negative reviews!Now coming to the phone I didn't feel like I'm holding some entry-level Chinese phone! It's a great phone for ladies who use phone just for WhatsApp and calling. No problems found so far. The battery is excellent. Colour is catchy. The best part is Type C slot as all other phones in my home have Type C! Best phone for basic users. Not for Pro. I own LG G7, Oneplus etc so I know what premium means! So I won't call it premium but it's definitely worth a try! Consider the life of a couple of years and proceed as even branded entry-level phones die sooner or later. It's been only 2 days so can't say much about it. If there seems to be any problem I'll update my review."
5,"Redmi 8A Dual (Sea Blue, 3GB RAM)Battery: The smartphone comes with a 5000 mAH battery. For an average user, this is great.OS: The preinstalled OS Android 9 with MIUI Global 11.0.2. user interface.OS Volume Bug: There is a bug which constantly causes volume to drop to zero. You can fix this bug by System Update.Camera: Pretty decent camera. There are already too many reviews on this, so I'm not gonna comment.Bloatware: Probably, this is what bugs me most in android devices. There are bunch of preinstalled apps and games. Most of them are unnecessary for you. You can remove most of them but not all. This is pathetic.RAM Usage: After removing bloatwares, the system takes around 1.1 GB of RAM, so you will have 1.9 GB of RAM which is enough for the most users.No Heating Issue: I'm not a gamer, but if you are an average you will not find any heating issue, at least most of the time."
4,It is fantastic phone for you if you are a normal user and not  a gamer . But unfortunately I received the handset is defective (I dont know that other have faced it or not) . In some app like BHIM UPI it shows the device is rooted. You can not oparate may app in rooted device . So please make sure that if your device same problem . If yes then mark my review as helpful. Thak me latter.
1,"I wasted my money on this phone,Phone hang a lot and all functions start working automatically and iam not able to restart the phone. So at that time I have to wait for 20 30mints.I demand product replacement or refund plz."
3,"Pros:*Cool battery*Type c charger and fast charging*Corning Gorilla glass 5(toughness)*Splashproof*Wireless FMCons:*Too many pre-installed unwanted apps which would kill internal storage and ram space*No private safe, but covered with second space. (Hide option is provided for folder as a whole, not for individual file/image. That too without password protection!! Too bad*processor performance is not great but good.*presence of Finger print sensor would be great*Both the cameras are too bad.. would feel like having 5 mp camera.*Weights heavy due to 5k battery"
1,Service is good but........
1,"When I receive this item it was 63% charge then I put charge after two hours it get only 68% only then I put whole night charge next day morning it get only 80% charge.. I totally disappointed..After that I returned this item then I received new mobile when I opened I directly put into charge, I get the same issue I don't what a do.. what they are doing I don't know they not checks properly and not inspected.. I really upset this service.."
4,"I bought this phone for my dad.Pros:good battery lifelarge screenlook and feel is nicecamera is good for its priceCons:THIS HANDSET IS MADE IN CHINAI thought it is Redmi (made in India), but it is made by Xiomi.Does not have fingerprint scanner."
1,"In this price segment this is the worst mobile I have used yet. Camera is above average not best, there is a big issue in this phone is network and wifi connection issue.Phone automatically disconnected wifi connection all the time and network is also very weak comparing to other mobiles. One big issue I found today that touch is working automatically. And there is another problem with Amazon to replace the phone that now I have to post the phone to Amazon then they will send a new phone.Third class performance"
4,Missing fingerprint sensor but nice phone with nice design
1,Bought  a new redmi dual 8A through Amazon .There is a technical issue with this handset.its functioning on it's own .various screen and key pad functions start functioning without even touching the handset.Amazon is not willing  to replace the handset. What a waste of money
3,Cons: No fingerprint sensor.No Widevine L1 support.Not a good camera at all. Photos captured are blurry and unclear. Totally disappointed with the camera.Too many MI built in apps which reduces the usable memory in hand.Pros: Premium quality design.Feels good in hand.Corning Gorilla Glass 5.Type C port.Fast charging.Dedicated Memory Card slot expandable upto 512 GB.Super Class Audio Speakers. Sound is very good. Listening music is very much enjoyable.Not heating up while charging.Display not bad at all.All in all a good phone at this price range.
3,"Cons:1. Very bad camera. Selfie camera is not even enough for video calling.2. Performance is not up to mark with 3gb RAM.3. Heating problem with extensive usage of internet or gaming.4. Many unnecessary apps which cannot be removed are impacting performance.Pros:1. Very good battery life.2. Nice display and well built.3. Budget phone.Overall, it is a budget smartphone with less smartness. Lot of notifications which are unable to remove with many unnecessary apps in OS."
1,"Not a good product. Took it to service center. First they changed software. But again started to hang. Requested for replacement, but not getting replacement during warranty. I purchased this because of its high rating and it looks amazon rating is fake."
1,"I have purchased 8A dual but its not a good product ,i have buy many product from amazon but i havent recevied such a bab product these phone camera is not good & get blink any while opening app..& phone get swtich off..while video call camera is not stable i request you to change the product & refund the money asap...i m not happy with this product..these issue i m facing from 1 month.."

4,"This the best ever non Chinese budget phone you can get at Rs. 10000 to Rs. 12000. I will provide you pros and cons of this Galaxy M11.Pros:1.  Great design, I really like the infinty O display (Punch hole camera design).2. Matte finish, so you can have better hold. (Also it won't shatter like glass, since it has plastic backpanel!).3. One UI - It is a great OS skin apart from Stock android and oxygen OS, and you will not get any annoying ads.4. Massive battery of 5000 mAh - Even with heavy usage, phone's battery can hold for a day, so if you are not a heavy user, you can charge once in two or two and half days. (And slower chip like Snapdragon 465 is additional plus, since it doesn't suck too much battery).5. Since it is a Samsung phone, you will get a minimum SAR Value (Radiation limit) compared to other Chinese brands, so it's good for your health too!6. Fast charging.Cons:1. Snapdragon 450, it is obviously slowest chipset in this price range.2. It cannot handle heavy games (Still i could play Call of Duty Mobile without any problem)3. Camera is not that great.4. 720p display, could have given 1080p display.if you play heavy games, then you should be going for Poco M2, which is good in these range.if you are a normal person, who doesn't play much games (I do play games, but not most of the time), you can definitely buy this phone.And I say again, it is the best non Chinese phone you can get in this range with amazing design."
1,My mobile is 1week old.There is sensor issue.Thumb unlock takes time. We need to give thumb impressions  twice or thrice to open.After call ends when we remove mobile from our ear immediately  sensor doesn't  recognize.  We need to press lock button then only light comes on display.This is irritating for regular user. This issue should be resolved by Samsung.There is no replacement  also.
4,"I have used the phone one week and then writing a review. Its an awesome phone with great features.Great battery life, no lagging, very smooth.Except the front camera which is 8 MP it is really bad quality one.😅Back camera is good of 16 MP its a mediocre level at this price(hazy cameras).If you want a phone for office use and multitasking only but not so much photography within affordable price then go for it."
1,"The cellphone was unpacked and switched on day before yesterday I.e 30 Dec 2020. The camera or screen software appeared corrupt.  The images being shown are the "" Negative "" format.The return window has closed on 30 Dec 2020, but the relationship between Amazon and its customers should stay alive hopefully.I would urge that the defective piece be replaced.Regards."
5,"It s wonderful,  handy. Mobile.  I m 70+ n it s more convenient  to  me to access  this mobile.  So far I  have  no negative  to say. While using  Camera Photos r very crystal  clear. In kerala  raining  heavily  n m facing  electricity  problems  but because  of my Samsung  m11 approximately  48 hrs , m using for  watching Facebook, u tube, google news ,watts up, making  calls  etc. Good  phone  in  100 percent  basis"
1,"I ordered this mobile for my mother who uses only phone app, fb, WhatsApp, YT. After 10days the Sim1 slot stopped working. She is able to access Internet perfectly but the moment she picks up a call, it says call ended. But For the other party, call timer keeps running till 15 secs and then call gets disconnected automatically."
5,"Mobile with all essential features, swift touch screen, fine cameras and reasonably good operations.I may even buy it again for someone in the family. Writing this review after using it for 6 months almost."
5,"The Samsung Galaxy m11 is a great phone in itself. But the major thing I want to focus on is the price; the phone is for 9k which is really a good value seeing its brand and the specs. The performance of the device is awesome and seeing the price point, it is good for gaming (as it comes with snapdragon 450). The RAM and the SoC is the best combination at this price. It is a great device for small multitasking and can handle workload. The camera is also great with its triple lenses (out of which only two are useful) and can take amazing videos in lowlight. The display is awesome and the touch sensitiveness is great. But this device too has some cons. First of all, let me talk bout the os. At the time of opening, it had OneUI 2 based on Android 10, which gave an amazing battery life (nearly 3 days in light loads). But this changed when I upgraded it to OneUI 3 based on Android 11. The battery life significantly got reduced. The phone used to get warm while charging, and it performs slower when the RAM used to high up (these all problems were not there in OneUi 2). The fingerprint sensor is a bit slower.But at the end of the day, the phone is great and can totally give you a full day of battery and also the screen is really awesome. I will tell if you are getting it for such a low price, consider it as you are left of two years of software updates and three years of patch level update (the phone comes with three years of software update but at the time of buying, it has already got a year of update)."
1,"Mobile phone is not working,  showing error .We're sorry that you received a defective product. Please contract amazon customer service,"
5,"Best phone at this price. U can blindly go for it . All the features are perfect and up to the mark performance. Good battery life, good screen resolution and display.Perfect size and comfortable to hold. Camera is awesome. The best part is the fingerprint scanner and other features like Dolby atmos, blue light filter and also the focus mode. Best"
3,"Finger print reader takes time to react.Battery life as of a normal phone.Camera used occasionally, seems to be good"
4,Phone Is AveragePros -1. Back Camera Is Average2. Big Battery3. It's slim4. Fingerprint Sensor Is Fast5. It's Bezzleless6. M11 Comes With USB Type CCons -1. Front Camera Is Bad2. Samsung Shoud Have Give More Powerful Processor According To Price3. It Come's With Plastic Body4. It Easily Scratches5. No Gorilla Glass Protection6. This Phone Price Should Be 9k To 10k
1,"charging not proper,damage near charge point,very bad experience with amazone customer care,After given return request person not pick the phone for replace.He return and customer care plan to technical person visit after three four call 14 sep2020 which is too late.Not satisfied with receiving both mobile phone SAMSUMG M-11.I want to return both phone and want my money in my account."
1,"Extremely disappointed. Faulty product delivered. Not replaced. Service promised, but technician did not show up. I am left holding a total dud with a lot of material damage."
5,"Display is good not very ultra soothing but if you are not a man working in video editing field then you wont have any problem with display.Battery backup is excellent, on an average i use my phone for 7-8 hours a day and it gives me a backup of 40-45 hours and if i use it around 10-12 hours a day it gives backup of around 30-35 hours.Picture quality is average but it is a no issue if you are not a high end photography taker, i will say it is good for a normal user, i have given a photograph you can see the quality.Performance is good, dosent lag as most people says.Overall it is a very good choice to go for if you need a phone which you dont want to charge all the time."
4,I use this as my second device since it can accommodate two SIMS and a memory card. Overall it is value for money and good to buy product. Camera quality is not all that great. Both front and rear cameras need to improve.
1,"display quality is disgusting,& the white spots the reason why I replaced it still available after replacement....I'm fadedI need the phone that's why I am not going to return or replace again"
1,"The Samsung Galaxy M11 mobile sadly did not live up to price tag of 15000Rs on 2 accounts :Display: The screen had a old pale yellowish color tone to it which have it a cheap look.Sound : poor sound quality, (this is in comparison with moto g5s plus which has similar price range) the volume is low and there is no clarity with more noise along with music at full volume.The fingerprint sensor is quick and efficient though. No comments on battery life as opted for return as I was very disposed about the two issues I mentioned earlier.To anyone who cares even a little bit about display and sound, I recommend never by this phone.The return process is long and bothersome as there was only exchange option and no return the first time I tried. And for exchange had to meet with Amazon technician who told the product can be returned by calling customer service. So called customer service only to be told only exchange is available(again) as only after exchanged once can it be returned. So carried service centre again after exchange to opt for a return as refund. Finally I have returned the product and waiting for refund to be credited in another week or so. The return itself took a week. The return process is a big drag so I recommend getting a detail picture of the product by going through the reviews before deciding to buy it."
2,"Purchased Samsung M11 in July 2020 and within 4 months the sound distortion is extremely bad. The other person's voice starts wavering and gets muffled making conversation extremely difficult. Also, the person on the other end cannot hear me clearly despite me speaking fairly loudly.Face Recognition and Finger Print options often fail to function as they should.Battery life is good, camera average. But the mike/sound is extremely disappointing and this is most important in a phone!"
4,"Mid Range Smartphone by Samsung..!!!Pros :-1. Non Chinese Brand.2. Clean samsung UI.( No bloatware ,No Add )3. Bigger Battery.4. Decent Camera.5. Screen Quality is good at this price of range.Cons :-1. Samsung must provide atleast Screen Guard.2. No back cover ( other Chinese brand are providing , so why Samsun doesn't )3. Charging time is more than expected .( We need more higher output charger)."
1,"Absolutely rubbish hangs a lot even touch is not working properly and when tried to return it unsupportive staff, it seems I have to end a long relation with Amazon after this horrifying experience."
1,"Fingerprint reader is good ,battery life is aslo good but camera is not that much betterAnd the main drawback is features are very very much less as compare to m21 and the very important thing SPEED OF PHONE IS SLOW much worst than m21 of 4gb variantNot satisfied"
4,"I've bought M30s and two M21 for my family. So went for tgis without hesitation. Got M11 for Rs.8100. Almost 50% lower than its launch price. Bought it for my father. Very good mobile for usage like calls, watching videos and messaging apps. No lag so far, although the speed is not great. Camera is not satisfactory. Battery is huge. 15W charging for an 8k non-chinese phone is great."
4,Bettery life is good. Maximum 1 day or 1 and 1/2 day.  Its depends on usages.Camera quality is not good.Touch also not so good compare to other phone.Overall you can say just good for normal usages.But in this range you will get other better option.
1,I want to return the product as I am not satisfied with the product quality and even it is also mentioned that there are 7 days return policy but your executive misguided me and  due to this I am facing problems with the product
1,Worst experience with this product.I have not seen before like this.I received this on 17th of March 2021. But from then phone isn't working properly. And return window is closed. So I went Samsung service center and there they update software. But till now I am facing same problem.
5,This is very good phon for me and everyone oneVery fast
4,I have been using since 6 months. Bought another for mom. Meets my expectations. I don't like the unnecessary notifications from Samsung which cannot even be disabled
5,"I like this phone because it's in my budget not very costly. I like the battery, and camera but it is not so good but I like, which thing of this I like the most is the colours metallic blue, black and one more colour attachments are not so good because there is no earphone or back cover. This phone is good because there not so much cameras, light weight and edges are good. I thanks to Samsung and Amazon to export this mobile phone to world. Thanks"
5,Very good phone for this budget - ticks all the requirements for me and the better life is great.
2,Phone sound just like ghosht sound. Please replace
1,From the day 1 it is giving trouble. We ignored initially but later on and now it is getting worse. Camera not opening. Backlight is always on. Incoming calls not showing. U can get d ringtone but can not understand who is calling. And many more. Do not purchase from Amazon and it's seller.
5,"Truly worth for price, great battery backup while on internet or games through out the day. Amazing mobile phone for day to day work even work from home culture during this pandemic period. Love this awesome model."
1,"I odered 2 piece, and both of them were defective. One the that was not switch on and in other there was heating problemI totally disappointed by this product, Don't buy samsungM11 most of its pieces are defective."
3,ok
4,I have ordered this phone for a student of poor background family to study for online classes.
5,Best phone and price !
1,"Many times hang this mobile. Recent, only one month ago I am purchased this mobile. But I am very offset for this. This M11 product is not successful mobile. It's hanging problem."
1,"Camera quality is very low , mobile is hanging problem only 5 day old and 2 time hang , and net very slow work over all not good product"
3,I didnt expect that samsung decreasing their quality of camera in their low budget phones as worst  as it. their keypad phones of older days had much more quality for camera than this. buyers must think of it before paying for this .
4,"Tecno spark 7 is best mobile ,this price renge ,awesome performance ,,and look like very good  Thnku techno ....."
4,In this range this phone is very good.
5,I receive today so looking good I using some day after written any author
5,"Writing the review after roughly 2-3 weeks of usage.First, the colour is unique which makes it stand out of the other phones in this segment. The rough contour at the back helps to solidify the grip. So seems to be quite suitable for rough users.Secondly, the battery backup is pretty huge despite the screen and ability to multitask.Apps run smoothly, and camera quality is excellent during day, and decent during the night. Network and storage is another USP, as my primary usage is to make calls.The big screen and RAM let's you enjoy netflix, games, and youtube all the the same time, in super HD quality. And not to forget the face unlock feature!Turned out to be a great buy, extremely value for money with the variety of features provided!"
5,"It's almost a week I am using this phone. First of all, really loved the colour. Wasn't sure if it would be as good as shown in picture but it is. Ordered the green one. Second, the battery surprisingly lasts for a long time. It takes a little time for phone to get fully charged, but once it is, I can get a lot of work done. If you are looking for screen size and battery you can go for this. To top that there's an amazing camera. Loved the filters in the AI Camera and the portrait mode."
5,I have been using the phone for 1 week now. The phone is very smooth and you can multi-task easily.The camera (both rear and front) are really good. The pictures and videos are very sharp and well lit. I experimented with both Macro and low light photography. The results are quite good. Highlight: The AI feature automatically switches to the mode.Battery is good. 6000mAh.  I charge it once a day and easily watch movies and play games.Overall a very good buy.
4,"Requirents were : good front and back camera with flash on both sides, decent storage , quality display for good browsing and multimedia playing experience. So I  was waiting for micromax in 1b 4gb version which comes rarely in stock  when I came across review of this mobile .

4,"Nice phone just like any other budget Smart phone  This phone had a serious problem of Charging ..it was very slow and took hours to charge the phone . Later after may attempts I realized that the Adapter was not working , the charging cable was working fine .I  replaced the adapter with an Adapter of Redmi5 phone and now its charging Fast ..Better the company check the Adapter as there are several complaints here of Slow Charging .Overall a Good Phone"
1,"Bro I can't believe, while starting only it get hanged... After that without putting much app or data it's responding very poorly late. For giving so much qntity, they comprise qlty.  Not good for normal use also. Camera also like vga. Apps taking seconds to tk open. Voice quality is poor, voice hears different while talking and also sound is very very low. Not up to the mark for 2021 phones."

1,Mobile too waste. Mobile specification is good but not good at all for the use. mobile getting heat in the few days. i'm unable to return the mobile as return window was closed in 7 days. please please don't buy the mobile.
4,Initially I was very skeptical to buy this mobile or not. But somehow made up my mind to give it a try. After using it for almost 1 week I can say this is the best mobile in this price range. Camera quality and Battery life is superb. Did not observe any slowness or hang while opening the apps. Overall very satisfied with the product.
1,Mbil was good but.. Amazon ne used mbile de diya mujhe jo pehle se koi chala raha tha. Jiska temrpar laga hua tha with scress and mbil ka seal nhi tha
5,"This product is made in India, has amazingly good quality, it lets you import everything from your old phone through google, you won't even lose your apps. Camera quality, screen size, sleek and lightweight, has everything that you need. You can't need more than what it has to offer at this price, there's n AI lens too Go for it, its a good quality phone that's also Indian made."
2,"Some software issues incurred within one week, alarm stopped working in spite of several resets."

5,"Happy to write 1st 100% Satisfied product review regarding Tecno Spark 7 Pro (Magnet Black 6GB RAM 64GB Storage smart phone). Liked Unique features like Kids Mode, Special functions, FREE from Harrassment filter for Spam calls and SMS, chip-assisted protection, Display Eye care setting, Truely worth of price satisfied with its features. Competes well with other top branded phones."
5,"Been using it for a few days and specs really hold up. I had just bought this as it was good value for money phone I could find with 4GB+64GB. But after using it, I realized the other features like the display, battery backup and camera are all great. Screen is highlight!"
5,"I was slightly skeptical about buying Tecno but after seeing my friends use it, I went ahead. After using it for a few days I realized why Tecno is so popular. I was never into clicking pictures, but after seeing the camera in this phone, I have begun trying my hand at photography. I feel the phone does the job more than I do. Best camera ever."
5,"I loved the camera on this phone. You can check from the pictures in my review that how amazing pictures you are able to click. This phone has a whooping 89.5% of screen to body ratio. I'm a huge gaming buff and watch a lot of movies and series. The big screen is such a delight to watch on. Also, the 180hz processor makes gaming smooth. Overall, I love this phone."
5,"I bought the phone after a lot of research,as i wanted a value for money all rounder and boy there are so many options...This one has it allLOOKS -9/10 -Looks stylish,suave,upmarket and yet simple.CAMERA- 9.5/10 - Fantastic camera at this price , both pictures and videos are amazing with great ai featuresBattery,Display - 9/10Go for it if you want a vfm all rounderCONS-1.Not really a con but it has single front flash whereas the specs mentions dual front flash,so though usage wise it's not at all an issue but you expect better communication.OVERALL-9.5/10 -- GO FOR IT!!!"
1,"Not dual front flash,Only single flash"
4,"Amazing finishing, great speed worth for money."
5,The phone works well without any performance issues like time lags or apps hanging midway. The screen resolution is excellent and gives a crisp viewing experience with bright colours and good clarity. The camera has an excellent resolution and is able to take equally vivid photographs during day and night-time. I would absolutely recommend this phone to anyone who’s looking for a seamless experience at value-for- money prices.
5,"After a month use:Happy With:-Battery Life: one time charge for more than 1 Day- camera quality: 100% satisfied with the photos with good detail- Screen good for watching movies netflix, watched all episodes of Family Man 2 on this phone. Brightness and good color- so many colorful theme options"
5,"This phone is super cool, and I think 'xiaomi' , 'oppo' or 'vivo' like brands will not provide such a phone for even 16K bucks.Its a super gaming smartphone. The battery life is awesome. The phone doesn't heat even if you play games for 6 hours (I'd tried playing about 4 hours myself, and the result surprised me) . Even all the features are of superior quality. The camera is like samsung galaxy worth 45K bucks. There is such a huge amount of features I can't even state here. Suggesting everyone to buy. 😇😇😇😄😄"
5,"I was the first person to buy a Tecno in my family. And once, others saw the performance, this is the third Tecno phone. And as usual, Spark 7 pro also hit the bull's eye in terms of value for money. The camera works amazingly video calls and even for clicking pictures in the night. Best buy ever!"
4,Nice mobile to use that. Back camara excellent. Front cam not bad. Need to improve some settings. In Mobile hotspot settings not able to manage connections.Have a good battery. But slow charging.
5,"I urgently needed a phone and I bought this phone after being recommended by a friend. It seems to have everything in it. Amazing AI camera, long battery, great display etc. Moreover, it's Andriod 11. What more can I ask for? Check the pictures I posted. The camera captures great light and has sharpness. I am a happy Tecno customer."
1,Please if you found delivery by appario private limited... Please don't buy... I got 2nd hand mobile and returned. Mobile is okay okay... But I will recommend to you go with redmi not 9... Looks great... This techno looks like dagar.....youtube videos not looks good.
5,"I love the specs. I had just bought this as it was cheapest phone I could find with 4GB+64GB. But after I recieved it, I realized the other features like the display, battery back and camera are all amazing. This phone is clearly the best phone for 10k."
4,Good Mobile Phone
5,"Hello Friends,I giving first time feedback and 5* to this mobile phone for overall performance and value for 💸 with best features."

5,I wanted a gaming phone and all the other options were very expensive. I went for this and I think I have had the smoothest gaming experience ever. I face no issues like heating up and lagging. It feels like any game on this is a cakewalk. The battery also supports several hours of gaming.
5,Budget
1,"I am not happy buy the mobile in amazon.Whats in the box:- Handset, Earphone, USB Cable, Sim Tray Ejecter, Pre-applied Screen Protector and Protective Case, Booklet with Warranty Card and Quick Guide"
5,Best Product Thnx for Amazon.in

5,Nice
1,"Please don't buy this mobile. Waste of money. I buy this mobile before 20 days only. Now not working properly. Hanging problem, handset very slow. Please don't buy it"
5,It's worth for 9.5k. after exchange offer.light weight n thin.easy to use.mobile have fingerprint n facial recognition to unlock and lifespan of battery lasts long.ram n rom are good.worth buying it.camera quality is ok.
1,Hi i received this item on 16 july.after 10 days phone start hanging.it automatically switched off.it repeating again and again.its being automatically switched of.please solve my issue.please take necessary action as soon as possible.
1,There is no headphone in the box... unsatisfied 😟 disappointed ☹️
2,"It's an average phone. Quite on the pretty side. ONLY those who are looking for a budget phone can think of purchasing this one. The camera is very average, but the functions & controls of the phone are smooth. It's very lightweight - that's a plus!"
5,Its a really very amazing and a nicely working phone..the camera quality and battery is also very good🤩😊.liked the product very much
4,Nice phone value for money but in inbox there is no earphone and screen protector receive being a regular customer of Amazon i am  unhappy there was  clearly written that these items are included in inbox.
1,"when i ordered this phone , headphone is free with phone but received order without headphone"
3,i have recently bought this phone..on 18 may 2020.. delivery is good but there was no headphones in a box.features r awesome nd phone is working gud.but camera quality is bit bad.
1,Worst mobile . I never expect from oppo such a low grade mobile. Touch is not working. Phone hanging. No return and replacement option.  From Amazon I got bad experience. Don't buy this mobile. Waste of money.
5,"Nice mobile prices 12,450"
1,"Body sensor not working. Was late by 2 days to find out this defect and so could not use ""return"" option.Due to body sensor problem, phone display never gets off while talking and so when brought close to ear, buttons like mute, hold gets activated while speaking.The basic function, which is to talk to others on phone becomes troublesome. Everytime have to very careful of holding position to make sure phone is not touched on body. Hate this and feel cheated/dejected.Cannot return as well."
1,It is roadside product with dusty display. When called Amazon customer care she deny to replace item. Don't buy anything from Amazon. Amazon only sells defective items. I returned many items and this was very useless response. She also disconnected call.USELESS AMAZON
1,This mobile was used by someone else.I have got someone else's mobile.I am not happy for this mobile.I will not do return this mobile.Because the reason of I give gift for other person.
4,"Better to value for money , quality is as per shown ..And fast delivered by amazon."
1,Earphones not received in a phone box
5,"Oppo always exports premium quality mobiles. Let there be no such features like other mobile but i phone also doesn't export such features at high price, then?I have attached some pictures also you can check them incase you wanna see the picture quality.Hence you can buy this without any tension.Amazing mobile's camera and body quality and display is also good.Go for it I suggest. 😃"
5,Fantastic
5,The phone is excellent but if the front and rear camara should be high and should be their dark mode compalsary but it should be added fastly and should give ear phonesonly main default is not nice camara should be high because the less cost mobiles will take more tean agers so they do moor selfies so it should increase and oppo is the selfie expert but this phone no selfie expert camara for next phone it should increase .Imay think I will increase
1,This product received wrost.. In this item some useful applications not run..Order canceled but no cancelation status and pick up status updating by Amazon..No any contact provided by Amazon..Realy disappoint..
2,This product details said there is a earphone and screen protector.  But i didnt get that
1,Don't buy it from Amazon the return service of Amazon is very bad..disgusting they never think customer problem no one in call centre never call you return policy and service is very poor only benefit looking cite ... don't buy anything from amazon.. in future I never buy electronics items from Amazon... flipcart is most trusted than amazon
3,"I like the product. But as compared to my other phone Realme X2. I found the lag in processing in some of minor things also. It is having 6GB RAM then also the having some processing issue. I don;t like the product. Even after this specs, the things are getting lag."
4,Nice mobile in this Price 👌👌👌👌..
5,Very nice phone for Rs.12500/-
4,Nice product...but there is no C pin charger  thts only one prob in this product...
3,Headsets are missing in the phone box...where are the original headsets...its normally included in phonebox??
1,The phone lags a lot right from the box. You have to swipe 3-4 times. Apps get hung. Never seen such a pathetic phone.
4,"Good product  but as compared to Mi note 8 its not Good . If you want to rought use for bussiness purchase.. Provessor is slow , not for gaming. But want you tube and surffing it's usefull. Another all thing is good .I don't have time for upload pics , but this review is enought.Product is same as photos."
1,"i have received the waste and damaged products and i chasing the customer support from last 10 days no solution upto now waste of money on  amazon ,waste of time on amazon ,and i customer of amzaon from last 5 years and i am a prime member this is the services i am getting"
5,For the money an excellent phone. My usage is mostly for mail and messaging. Bit of browsing and reading. The battery lasts for two days in my use. I bought one and then I was very happy with it and I bought another of the same.
1,"Screen quality is very poor , camera is also nearly poor, all over the phone is worst. I ordered this phone by choosing the no cost emi option of Bajaj , but they are also taking the processing charges of Rs.174 on every instalment.So please don’t use Bajaj’s emi option for ordering this phone. Thanks"
3,Updating after 4month :-screen recorder not available..which is default function of every android now a days..-Charging draining faster but charging gaining very slower.-its not a 21st century phone .. so many basic features missing Day 1: experience:-Most important : it will not redirect the link into the present app in mobile .... It will open link every times in default browser..Eg: if I got any Facebook /insta /Twitter link and I already have installed these app then it will not asking me to get open with app instead it will redirect to browser and again I need to login... So so poor technology1.processor looks slow while setup and configuration my account data restoration as compare to redmi note 7 (same price older version phone than this)2. Camera quality is very low both back and front ...capture blurred images..not focusing the face even after setup manually.3.  Not value for money.. I think I made mistake to choose oppo brand .. I compare all the feature with redmi.. redmi looks far better than this..4. No front flash light available to click in night5. Looks slow to handle multiple apps compare to redmi6. Please don't buy this phone..this is so poor technology phone..
5,I have been an user of nokia 6.1 as it started to face issues I have opted for this one. After using premium phones like Xperia and Nokia I feel the fabrication is not upto to the standards. Helios processing a little slow.Banking apps a little stretched due to the size of the screen. Rest all a good buy.
1,"I couldn't like it bcoz of its poor water resistence quality.I bought it on Dec.2020 but the working system of this disturbed on March 2021,within a period of 2-3 months.It is great loss .It mars  the Credibility of the Company also.I wanted to purchase one more but the damage has spoiled my mood n faith.I want compansation for the loss.It would be of great support n credibility of the company if it exchangeg the mobile OppoA31,Mystery or mend it properly without my loss.If the company do this favour,it would be a gentl step towatds customer care n service as well as the establishment of strong credibility n capabilitu of the Company."
1,"1. Phone don't have type C charging2. Dual app not possible for all app like redmi phones3. Charger is normal 5v 2 Amp so no fast charging.4. Not for multi tasking people.5. Camera and sound average6. Processor and touch very slow7. Only 6GB RAM AND 128 GB ROM is good  in this phone.8. Also it's not showing dual 4G9. Battery is only 1 day at normal uses.10. Display dpi is also very low.11. Can be treated as entry level phone.12. WhatsApp Camera function is abnormal, don't waste money on OPPO A31"
1,Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
4,If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
1,Camera quality is not good. It is mentioned as 13mp but the motion of the camera is like 2mp. Phone is very slow in operation even though it is 3gb RAM . More over it is MADE IN CHINA.
5,"Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."
5,"If I started to rating it's all features, it will as followed (Out of 5 🌟):Processor ⭐⭐⭐⭐Display ⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐Battery ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Sound in loud ⭐⭐⭐Sound in 3.5 mm cord ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Camera Selfie ⭐⭐⭐Camera Back ⭐⭐⭐⭐Networking ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Lack:There is no Fingers print sensor locked.There is no Back cover in the box.Camera quality not so good."
4,"I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
1,Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!
3,"Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other"
5,Worst phone.. overall performance is just bakwaz....don't buy...always hangs
3,"COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"
1,"Compass is not working, showing error as required sensor are not available,And everything is fine."
1,"Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. 😞. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone 📱, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% 😀. The phone is too lightweight ☺️ and very handy😄 Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. 😃.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. 😭GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. 😠😠.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. 😥. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good 👍But it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. 😠Display quality is too poor. 😫 Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. 🥺  No led in front of the display.😰Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection 😥If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or above🤗 with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy."
5,Cheap & Best phone in this range
3,Made in China product
1,Made in china...The country of origin should be mentioned in the description...Returning the Chinese crap
1,1. Very bad quality mobile2. Poor display quality(looks very cheap)3. Sound is very low4. Cmaera is like 2mp camera5. Performance is very slow(lag while using phone)6. Will get better mobiles with this price.7. Think 100 times before wasting your money on crap8. No pros at all
1,Redmi 9A launched useless phone everTotally waste moneySo please not buying this phone
3,REALME batter than redmi now
5,"1. Display is excellent. Colors and sharpness is good.2. Descent cameras according to price.3. In hand feel of phone is good. It's slim and despite 5000 Mah battery, it feels light.4. Battery backup is good. Easily last one day.5. Performance is good according to price. Mediatek G25 does it job well. You can play COD and FREE FIRE easily at low settings.6. Speaker loudness is average but quality is good.7. MIUI 12 experience is amazing. No ads and reduced bloatware."
5,Awesome product at low price.Compatible productFast and best batteryLess time more battery chargeAnd does not drain battery.Amazing product
4,"Advantage :3GB+32 For Rs. 7498/-With 6.5 Inch & 5000 mah Battery Acceptable.Disadvantage :*No Finger Print Sensor*Front Camera is 5 MP Only, if it's 8 MP & Rear Side 13+5 MP means little acceptable.Over all Ok."
3,No finger print....there is vast color difference in picture & actual . there is no matching in SEA BLUE color. piece received with DARK Blue colorotherwise good gadget at this price.
4,Quite goodBattery and build quality is betterBut camera and speakers are okok.
5,Screen is big and crisp battery backup is great. You can find lag here and there but manageable don't expect gaming in this phone. Camera is below average. All together phone feels premium in look with below average performance. If tou are planning to buy in this budget no phone will beat this phone.
5,"Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
3,Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
5,It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
5,"Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"
2,Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
3,"This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked priceMi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.Need Improvement.Processor is best for browsering , social networkingThis processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.Battery capacity is awesome ♥️ no need to say. brightness level is good and it also handle with sun. Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses"
3,Weary good product  very fast delivery
3,"Points to be noted:👉 The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.👉 This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.👉 Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.👉 Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.👉 After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone."
5,"Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best. Display is huge(20:9).Camera is above par.Performance is good.Overall best package.5/5 for Rs.6800."
5,Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
2,Phone is good. But it is made in China
5,Wow
1,"I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available. You can replace only. So, please don't buy this worst product. Even for first time im facing that amazon support also not supporting in this issue. I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon."

2,Worst camera ever...both front & back... & Screen resolution is not good.
4,"So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5⭐ for thatPros-•Low price, wont get any other phones in this range• Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.•Good for basic usage.•Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:•camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)•Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use⭐"
1,Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
4,If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
1,Camera quality is not good. It is mentioned as 13mp but the motion of the camera is like 2mp. Phone is very slow in operation even though it is 3gb RAM . More over it is MADE IN CHINA.
5,"Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."
5,"If I started to rating it's all features, it will as followed (Out of 5 🌟):Processor ⭐⭐⭐⭐Display ⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐Battery ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Sound in loud ⭐⭐⭐Sound in 3.5 mm cord ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Camera Selfie ⭐⭐⭐Camera Back ⭐⭐⭐⭐Networking ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Lack:There is no Fingers print sensor locked.There is no Back cover in the box.Camera quality not so good."
4,"I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
1,Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!
3,"Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other"
5,Worst phone.. overall performance is just bakwaz....don't buy...always hangs
3,"COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"
1,"Compass is not working, showing error as required sensor are not available,And everything is fine."
1,"Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. 😞. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone 📱, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% 😀. The phone is too lightweight ☺️ and very handy😄 Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. 😃.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. 😭GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. 😠😠.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. 😥. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good 👍But it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. 😠Display quality is too poor. 😫 Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. 🥺  No led in front of the display.😰Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection 😥If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or above🤗 with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy."
5,Cheap & Best phone in this range
3,Made in China product
1,Made in china...The country of origin should be mentioned in the description...Returning the Chinese crap
1,1. Very bad quality mobile2. Poor display quality(looks very cheap)3. Sound is very low4. Cmaera is like 2mp camera5. Performance is very slow(lag while using phone)6. Will get better mobiles with this price.7. Think 100 times before wasting your money on crap8. No pros at all

3,REALME batter than redmi now
5,"1. Display is excellent. Colors and sharpness is good.2. Descent cameras according to price.3. In hand feel of phone is good. It's slim and despite 5000 Mah battery, it feels light.4. Battery backup is good. Easily last one day.5. Performance is good according to price. Mediatek G25 does it job well. You can play COD and FREE FIRE easily at low settings.6. Speaker loudness is average but quality is good.7. MIUI 12 experience is amazing. No ads and reduced bloatware."
5,Awesome product at low price.Compatible productFast and best batteryLess time more battery chargeAnd does not drain battery.Amazing product
4,"Advantage :3GB+32 For Rs. 7498/-With 6.5 Inch & 5000 mah Battery Acceptable.Disadvantage :*No Finger Print Sensor*Front Camera is 5 MP Only, if it's 8 MP & Rear Side 13+5 MP means little acceptable.Over all Ok."
3,No finger print....there is vast color difference in picture & actual . there is no matching in SEA BLUE color. piece received with DARK Blue colorotherwise good gadget at this price.
4,Quite goodBattery and build quality is betterBut camera and speakers are okok.
5,Screen is big and crisp battery backup is great. You can find lag here and there but manageable don't expect gaming in this phone. Camera is below average. All together phone feels premium in look with below average performance. If tou are planning to buy in this budget no phone will beat this phone.
5,"Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
3,Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
5,It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
5,"Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"
2,Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
3,"This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked priceMi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.Need Improvement.Processor is best for browsering , social networkingThis processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.Battery capacity is awesome ♥️ no need to say. brightness level is good and it also handle with sun. Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses"
3,Weary good product  very fast delivery
3,"Points to be noted:👉 The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.👉 This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.👉 Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.👉 Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.👉 After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone."
5,"Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best. Display is huge(20:9).Camera is above par.Performance is good.Overall best package.5/5 for Rs.6800."
5,Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
2,Phone is good. But it is made in China
5,Wow
1,"I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available.

1,"It is a bundle of problems;1. Camera, so called 108 MP is poorer than my last 12 MP of Moto G6 plus.2. Macro camera is the worst one. No use of this.3. Vibrations during incoming calls if it is in silent mode, you won't be able to feel whether it is vibrating. End of the day you will miss many calls.4. Bluetooth gets disconnected very often.5. I have bought this one to use its call recording feature, but it says 'your call is being recorded' even to other person also. What is the use of it, I don't know.I have used 3-4 phones in last 3 years but never found such worst quality phone.Plz don't buy Mi phones. They are cheaters..Their so called technical expert customer care people don't know anything, they ask me to clear the cache data and re-updation of already updated MiUi version."
4,Hey I'm tech content creator on YouTube name as a 'Madan Gaikwad'*Initial review*1) Camera Oversaturation issue.2) 120Hz display refresh rate not optimazased for some apps.3) No EIS currently on 4K 30fps4) Some Speed test on our YouTube channel so I'm observed ram management biggest issue on UI or CPU Throttling also.5) Battery performance avarage- 120 hz + 50% brightness + No gaming - 6hrs on screen time.6) Charging time impressive-65 mins.More videos on madan gaikwad YouTube channel.
4,"Excellent Phone with all it's features, excellent camera, excellent 120hz refresh rate, excellent sound, excellent battery, excellent performance of 750g processor. Don't go with them who are comparing it with other similar but different processor phones, sound is perfect, a small smart phone will not give you like 120w sound output so whatever it's giving is awesome. Super night mode camera. Only missing is Super Amoled display but it's ok. It is a compact phone with great camera and great performance.Though side finger print sensor misses sometime to open or turn off the screen, this is minor issue.Selfie Camera is not upto the mark, the selfie photots are flipped, it looks very odd.h Hope Mi will take care of this issue in next update."
1,बहुत ही बेकार प्रोडक्ट
1,"So many problems from day one.. Text blur, loud speaker on call too low, recent app menu doesn't show preview some times, camera even not as good as redmi note 5..if want to but buy it from mi storeNow I have brought this again same issue of text blur in one handmade. Any one facing same."
1,I am using this phone from last 10 hours.... Battery not so good and camera also not so good.... Not so fast according to 120 hz display
1,"Camera quality is just a gimmick, display quality is average. Finger print sensor is not fast"
5,It's a superb product for the price point.Display is awesome. Really loved that 120hz display but the screen could have been brighter.Audio is loud enough.No stutter noticed during usage of display.Charging time is blazingly fast .Rear camera is good and the front camera was just a typical mi  front camera.
1,"With the hype of cheap 5g phone and 108MP camera and different modes for camera setting I made decision to take this phone on day 1 as this was supposed to be atleast as good as mi note 9 max pro. But the mobile has many issues. It's internet connectivity over wifi drops occasionally when switched apps. It's not able to process the video editing even with 750 processor my realme 3 pro was doing lot faster and better than this mobile.I'm writting this review in Gmail app as the connectivity of mobile over wifi is so bad its not opening Amazon app.Photos are good at full size zoom is having pixels even at day light.Photo modes are good with included long exposure options.Display isn't that great compare to my old realme 3 pro.Feels little bit heavy in hand as the back case is of glass.I regret buying it now have to wait for update to see if there is any improvement else have to sell it off or exchange it with as it's missing basic of phone i.e. stable internet connection where all apps in mobile now a days won't work without it.Verdict: if looking only 108MP and 5G features and thinking of buying this phone then dont go for it. Wait for another 3 months lots of 5G affordable phones to hit the market soon with improved processor and os and more supporting brands.Updated on 18-03-2021Apps are crashing unable to open the Amazon over click on item from chrome.Gmaps is not showing blue root lines at all,I'm thinking of exchanging 😤 even for 60-70% rate. My previous real me 3 pro still works lik a charm."
5,"Miss:(1) Stock Android unavailable(2) Camera not optimized(3) Slightly overpriced. Bought 8 GB + 128 GB variant for Rs 21999, however should have been priced at Rs 19,999."
1,Not able to login google account in a first login very bad software
1,"while talking over speaker phone, some of my friends they are getting their voice repeated in between for 2 to 3 sec , also while talking if any notification comes they don't get my voice for 1 to 2 sec.front camera quality while making video call over whatsapp is bad main camera images are over sharpening, sometimes bad dynamic range, human skin time is over whitesh or redishsometime call dialer and message app is really buggy, while Playing games if i recieved the sometimes it shows black screen, if i setup any other dialer instead of google then not able to increase or decrease volume of the call. rather than give us old miui dialer and message app those are great ones. gpay, paytm, bhim app, are not doing verification properly the message app , i tried lot of times then i have to install other message app to verify them.hdr10 , darkers areas goes more darker and not visible, why i have to press button if fingerprint is there , every time i have to press button, raise phone and double to wake screen is not working properly , its buggy sometimes work sometimes doesn'tAnd why amazon hold the reviews for 7 days after first sale?"
1,This products chrge probem issue use in a hour. And screen and finer print not 🚫 working
1,Camera is not good
2,Camera is not upto the mark.. We can say worst camera at this price
1,I dislike this phone. MI(xiaomi company)  Announce that this phone 108MP camera but this is 0nly like 48MP  i compaired with MI 9 pro and oppo f11 48mp click same  and this 108mp quality Click Pictures is Similar with all picture and also zoom after click picture it's last end is same
1,"Will not recommend to anyone as it has inbuilt announcement feature of call recording. Whenever User starts call recording, everytime announcement is heard by both the parties that THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"
1,poor quality camera... waste of money... dont buy this phone at any cost
1,"Phone looks tall.Display is just average like other Redmi phones. MIUI 12 is very boring and low grade.Photos are too bright, Colors vary a lot.Overall it is just below average phone"

1,Dislike. Not worth for money. Everything is below average performance. Display quality Image clarity audio quality color saturation should be very poor. 120r.rate is fake. No difference. Audio speaker is vibrating the set. Feel in hand. Money loss. MI cheating India customer. I waste money. No more products purchase in MI. I am very upset. Please return money. My amount is hard work money
5,CAMERA QUALITY IS VERY GOOD you can make a vlock in this phone Android 10 in this phone i like 12 miui poco M2 is comparing this phone but this phone is flagship phone
1,Third class camera performance. Only 108 megapixel camera images is good. All other modes photos poor quality.
2,Battery drains very fast compared to other mobiles. Camera is good but very prone to get scratches easily.
1,"Think before you buy, they wont provide you return previlages, also no discount on icici debit card."
2,"MY VERY FIRST HONEST REVIEW:-I have been a man of HTC/Honor/Vivo so far. This is the very first time I have purchased Mi phone i.e. Mi 10i considering its 5G feature in a reasonable price-range. Honestly, this lacks in many things Vs as hyped. Specs on the paper look alluring but don't justify in reality, Quality is missing in everything. Quality is replaced with some alternate cheap gimmicks. Camera is 108MP which is the fist time ever in India as claimed by Mi but in reality it just another piece of crap - it doesn't give the actual/sharp detail or crisp output it is just like other cheap phones whose cameras make the buffalo look like Cow. Its Selfie Camera is worst than the old phones' VGA camera. Now lets talk about the other features: Display is sluggish not so responsive as it should be. 120hz RR is nowhere noticed or noticeable. sometimes we have to tap thrice on the icon. Unnecessary pre-loaded bundle-apps. It Weighs on bit bulky side. Audio is louder enough but not that sharp and crisp. Battery charges ultra-fast backup is also decent and justifies 4820mAh.The most important thing for me is - network connectivity in which, this phone really disappoints me in a big-way. My earlier VIVO Z1X used to have strong connectivity in the closed-door area whereas this phone has only 2-3 bars on the same place. My main reason to buy this phone was - to have strong connectivity and rapid response of screen and processor but it doesn't behave like 6GB RAM. It satisfies me ONLY in Fast Charging and Batter backup rest all are not up to the mark...Sorry Mi fans, this is what my sincere observation is from 4 days' usage. I wonder, If 4G connectivity is not so good then how come we expect 5G to be beneficial. The side-mount finger sensor behaves strangely. Sometime it is fast and sometime doesn't recognize.I do not know whether Mi can fix all this thru OTA update. If so, Mi can add one more customer in their family. Thanks!"
1,During launching time amazon didn't give full details of this phone.NFC sensor not available.
1,"Really disappointed. Gets hot even with general usage, battery getting drained, pathetic speaker, I wish there were some review before I purchased it. Regret my purchase. The only thing that is great is camera quality."
4,The phone was amazing except call recording issues... There is no automatic call recording option.although u record ur calls... There is no voice
3,other then 5g you can take poco m2 pro.poco m2 pro is very better in that price.Rate of mi 10i is little high.Approx cost may be 16-17k.
1,"Not a good product. It's like any sub 15k mobile with 5g processor. I did not like it at all. One thing I cannot understand that why these stupid mobile companies are kept increasing the length of mobile unnecessarily. Considering the width, the length is way too long, useless and makes the phone unhandy. A phone screen must not be larger than 6 inch and length should not exceed 16:9 screen ratio. Idiot companies are just racing to show their screen larger on paper to compete with peers.Update: The phone screen damaged with a very-very mild impact while the company says it has gorilla glass protection. Now had to pay 9500 for screen only :( I cannot believe I had wasted 22k and now had to waste another 9500."
1,Call recordings future is very bad. When call recording open .recoridg; voice audable is both side
3,"I bought this phone with a great hope that it might replace my current POCO f1, but it didn't.Talking about camera, where we spend greater amount of time on Selfies, the pictures are too distorted. I haven't used rear camera much, but I'll do that on weekend and share pictures.The OS is exactly the same as POCO F1, so no comments or concerns, as I find it satisfactory.The display is large and bright, battery provides enough amount of supply for 1.5 days with 2-3 hours of the media and 24 hours of constant internet connectivity.The phone has hybrid Sim slot and there's no 256 gb version for India, which makes it difficult to use for long term, if one like to take high-resolution videos.I would rate this phone 3.5 because of below avg front camera, no amoled display and storage limitations.Thanks!"
1,"Plz don't buy Mi phones. They are cheaters..name: 6GB RAM + 128GB StorageIt is a bundle of problems;1. Camera, so called 108 MP is poorer than my last 12 MP of Moto G6 plus.2.

1,Mi 10i phone has many problem.Battery life is very poor.Mobile is heating up while charing.I had factory reset my mobile after that Google photo app not upload in my mobile.I want to return the mobile. AMAZON have returned or replacement policy but it is not effective.In FLIPKART is very easy to return or replace.So don't buy anything from Amazon.in.I am very disappointed from Amazon and also Mi 10i mobile.
5,Awesome phone.Nice camera and smooth experience.Best phone under 20K
2,Camera quality is totally worst.Oversharpning is too
1,"I am using this phone for last 10 days. First of all phone is very bulky. Previously i was using redmi note 6 pro. Compared to that it is more weight and bulky.Fast charging is good 0-100 in 1hr,but daining also much fast. It is not lasting till night. My previous Note 6 pro after 18 months with same apps and 3 email. It lasts till eveningCall quality: if we put loud speaker the other person in the line can't hear our voice clearly.I am using ""Botim"" app for video calling. In that app if we put speaker, our mic won't workOnly difference i am feeling compared to note 6 pro is the cosmetic changes & it's because of MIUI 12.Camera and speaker volume and quality is goodNot worth buying in this 2021"
5,value for money but battery not good
1,"Battery back up is bad , hardly one  hour only .I want to urge all the buyers please comment frank and true so , one may avoid these bad things."
5,This is a brilliant Mini phone but market price 700 rupees Amazon price 1300
5,All things are Excellent Nothing is Damage and Forget to pack.
1,"This is a useless and worst phone. Wastage of money . Purchased this and the phone was not reading the Sim card. Replaced the item,but when received the replacement,again this useless stuff was not able to read the Sim. Not working at all. WORST,DONT BUY THIS."
1,"This product is tiny and good for carry, but battery backup is horrible, even its not running 3 hours in standby.don't buy if you want battery life more then 3 hours"
1,I have order it no of times but sim didnt work in any of the device.Do not buy
5,Amazing product it is works good
4,Super on
1,This mobile is very smallest to small  and price is high  it's not better than other mobile phone
5,Good quality
4,"Really amazing product but the manual to use it is not clear so have to do some experiments to discover some features, also it is a little difficult to make Bluetooth calls otherwise product is good.(Edit:-Mic could be improved)"
3,Sound quality good handling good
5,"Battery life is quite good, sound quality in call is amazing but in Bluetooth audio there no bass only treble..... , Its mic quality i think can be much better... If u speak in low tone then it will not catch your voice ,you have to say little bit louder or take mic to ur mouth to speak... , I think the price is bit high.... It has magic voice that can change your voice during call which is pretty amazing ... You can use this to prank your friends"
2,Don't buy it
1,"I needed this phone badly, delivery was great, but phone is damaged, so iam very furious about that, Amazon should check items properly before delivering."
1,I received a damaged product.just because we couldn't put a sim to check the product(within the said replaced day policy) we have to keep this damaged product..it cannot read the sim
5,Product is very useful battery backup for 1 day in heavy use and 2 day for minium use but lookwise it's best and very very handyYou can put it in your jeans pant upper mini pocket very easily.I Love It
3,Battery quality is too bad. Battery life only 1 hour.....Sound quality good.Value for money.
3,not  up to the mark when comparatively to other china products small phones
5,Small hai pr cute hai

4,"I've been using this phone for 4days now.I will share my review with pros and cons:cons:1.It feel like a cheap phone idk why,there are some phones in this price segment ""looks"" premium.2.No LED notification,a major missing.3.Rear Camera is not that good in default,but when we changed to 48MP it looks ""kinda"" good.It seems like good in this price segment.4.Its little bit getting Hot while charging and I feel some Hottnes while taking photos(maybe coz of outside temperature)5.It takes quite a bit to get fully charged,yah the battery is 6000 but its fast charging with 18W.6.so much pre installed apps(we can uninstall it) and also like previously,we have to go through each app to disable ""Recommendations""Pros:1.Very light weight and it doesn't feel a massive 6000 is inside2.Front camera is Superb! good detailed pics in portrait.3.Battery is so good.I use the phone to take a lot of pictures and use it for 1 hr swiping through Instagram,the battery doesn't notice that at all lol(its pretty good)4.Stereo speaker does that job GOOD5.For games,ya with a medium settings it is good for 1hr continuous gaming after that it gets little hot but there is no overheating like that issue till now.This is all I can remember,I will try to update if I notice it afterwards."
3,"Redmi 9 Power Electric Green (4+128)(FIRST 24-HOURS REVIEW)• A phone with Superb Design and unique colours• I have purchased electric green colour and believe it is really superB in looks• Heavy in weight but its okey as it looks fine in hands• Dual stereo speakers with ultimate sound quality!! BUT BUT BUT !!• Redmi claimed 6000mAh Battery, means we think that it will go through atlest ""1 & Half day to 2 days"" of battery backup in one charge, But there is nothing like that.• The Battery will Last go to 1 day of maximum backup only if limited use.(I charged the phone full in last evening by 7pm and its 1 pm today righ now and it is 55% left with no use as i am using it as a secondary phone, means the Remaining 55% battery will last longer to 11pm. The total battery backup without use of phone will go to 28 Hours, as i am using it as a secondary phone with no whatsapp, youtube or any kind of internet surfing with this phone)• It means if u want to use it as a primary phone with whatsapp, youtube, and other internet features then i dont think so that it can give 1 day backup• Redmi claimed 22W Fast Charger with it, apart from it while using its own 22W fast charger it takes more then enough time to charge(It takes time to Charge full)• Camera quality is like hell, specially the front camera, Don't buy if u wants a Camera Quality in Mid Range phoneSummary:-Purchase it if u want as a secondary phonePurchase it if u want super outer looks with ultimate colour optionsPurchase it if u dont want good selfie camera quality (According to price range)Purchase it if u want a Good Looking Attractive Phone"
1,"Very Disappointed by the product. Camera quality is too bad. The only one thing is in phone is it has 6000mah Battery. Overall this product is very worst. Don't buy if you are looking it as a primary phone which has best camera, Storage & massive battery."
1,"Honest review after a week of usage -Do not make the mistake of buying this mobile. While the price point is competitive, it would make lot of sense to pay an extra 1000 and go for the Redmi Note 9 instead of Redmi 9 Power.This mobile has pathetic camera quality. It says 48 MP camera, but the quality is as good as 8 or 13 MP camera. Redmi note 9 having the same camera gives far better quality images. I am truly disappointed with the camera quality.So do not go on the Megapixels. This mobile honestly has very bad camera quality.The performance is OK. A snapdragon octacore processor does not do any justice as I have experienced good amount of lags while opening basic apps.The battery back up is good, but apart from that, there is nothing special about this phone.I regret buying this in the flash sale."
4,Ok Product
1,"Camera is very worst, In indoor lighting pictures are getting blurred, Front camera is something like 4 years back quality because it has only 8MP.When coming to back camera even with 48MP, photos are not clear.My suggestion is not to purchase this mobile, if you can bare 1000/- more, best choice is Redmi note9 or you can purchase realme phones with in this budget.I tried to return the product due to camera quality not expected, but return will not take return back due to quality issue for mobile phone.I purchased many Mobiles, but this is my first worst experience.So please don't by this mobile 🙏🙏🙏🙏"
1,"I bought Redmi 9 power blue (128 GB) in the first sale on 22nd Dec 2020.Amazon delivered it very speedy on 23rd Dec 2020.Reviews:1) Camera: Average for both front and back cameras.2) Sound: Good3) Battery: Drained very fastly, even charging is a bit slower, not looks like 6000 mah.4) Processor: slow processing and sometimes hang also. And touch is also responding slow.5) Games: I didn't try much yet.6) Weight: BulkyI bought it because of the camera but a little bit disappointed with it."
1,Front camera is very poor for video calling. Sometime screen goes totally white on video calling like hanging problems.Its looking dark face.Also battery is not according to expectation as 6000mAH. Battery showing 20% and suddenly goes 80%without charging.

1,Phone having bad quality and hanging issue and performance is very poor and bad camera quality and brightness over exposed in sun light
1,Non of the features they have mentioned match the phone.-Both Cameras are horrible.-The phone is laggy-Battrey back is horrible-Charge time is horribly slow for a 22W charger
1,Got a damaged phone .. plus Amazon customer service not helping on this .. bad product .. poor service by amazon ... please Don't buy ...
4,Purchased on 22nd Dec 2020.4 GB RAM 128 GB Storage Capacity.Mighty Black (Colour).Rs. 11998Included: Charger. Clear Case. Sim Tray Ejector. Documentation.About 17+ GB of Storage Capacity is utilised by OS and Pre-installed Apps.
3,"I bought this mobile on the first sale 22 Dec 128 gb version, coming to the phone the miui is the same we find in other mi devices which is the reason I bought the phone but one this which I miss the most in MIUI 12 is the absence of second space(why Mi ❓)Pros: Good battery, 48MP back camera and MIUi 12cons: front camera(my redmi note 5 does a better job), no second space, a bit bulky when you hold the phone"
1,"Battery do`t work as specified 6000 mah. worst camera result ever. even new theme or fonts don't work. battery drain to fast. very chip on weight,look,speaker,display many more, friends first time a request you to please do not buy this phone. company try to achieve their position high that's why they start to deliver this type of chip product to customer.  In my home 7 mobile is redmi but i never seen this type of chip mobile ever. i am so sad after purchase this mobile. I need to my money Back."
1,"Firstly got too late delivery from amazon, no response from customer care representative. The product is now totaly different like stock Android and cheap like oppo, Vivo Xiaomi lossing his market. Quality also not upto the mark. It gives low performance even many times the miui stop the apps. Very very bad feeling to order this mobile.On second day of delivery it stuck on bootAnd keep restarting again & again.lastly i had to format it and i lost my data of year &year.Shamfull xiaomi. DONT BUY xiaomi phone with MIUI 12 it is worst than worst"
5,Redmi mobile is having features what we essential requitred.I m very happy with the new model.So far it's very nice and value for my.Wil review after couple of days usage.
4,Its value for money but if you are a selfie person than no pictures are ok but not too good I love everything about it
3,"Average performanceEdit (after 1 year usage): no issues in daily tasks,While playing pubg and some calls it freezes and swithes off."
5,Awesome product. Like it❤️ 12k under best phone.Dual stereo speakers.Good camBattery backup ❤️💯Build quality 💯Design 💯Best choice 👍
1,Front facing camera is too bad....
1,Front camera on video call is showung dark face. Screen goes white like hanging problem.Battery goes 20%to 80% automatically.Its camera performance is very low.You can choose other option in same price like vivo.
2,"Front camera is third class. Rear camera's quality  is average.  Battary like  4000 mah. Wi fi, Hotspot,  Bluetooth touch key does not work properly.  There are no auto call record option and notification receive indicating  led. Only sound quality is very good. No return policy only replacement, so I am hopeless."
4,"Primary usage Suitable for battery, videos watching, storage 128GB like songs backup listening music offline with speaker HiRes 2 speakers one in top and one at bottom, splash resistant.If ur requirement is secondary like Camera 48mp camera with Snapdragon 662.Not for heavy games.Then its suits me well. 5 star.No phone for these specs at this price point."
2,"After a month use....Phone is just ordinary.  No effects of the memory options are noticed.  In fact it takes roughly 2 minutes to get to the main screen after power on.  Preloaded with 13-15 gb of system files and bloatware.  So you get to use only 49 GB effective storage place.The phone is like paying for our dish TV, you will be forced to watch a lot of advertising apps.A lot of personal information may be used, your mi id will be linked to phone, email, ip address, location etc.Earlier I used Lenovo p2 nothing of this, and was a great phone.Having said all bad things, the phone is good for sound, visual, and battery.  Camera is the worst part.If you are buying for a camera then this one is a bad choice.  Battery 🔋 and the sound is great.Too many bloatware, I suppose Redmi should pay attention.  Or we all should avoid the phone and the brand.Repair would be easy as Redmi has many service centers around the country.  Except battery and music I don't see any difference or advantage over other phones for routine activities.Overall very average phone 📱 which is priced on higher side."
1,The product is not upto the mark.It gives low performance even many times the miui  stop the apps and camera quality is also poor.
3,The product is very disappointed in the camera segment. Front and back both camera is worst. It is not as 48 mp camera .Battery backup is well as 6000 mah.only vedio can play up to 13 hours after that phone is dead.if you bye for a big battery only then you can bye this product.all so processor is not as helio g85.
4,"I have ordered blazing blue colur but i have recived black colour instead of blue,But still it is a wonderful phone at reasonable cost.Battery backup is awesome and camera is amazing.I highly recommend to buy this phone from these seller"
5,Chief and best
5,Nice phone
4,"The pros of this smartphone are1. fhd+ display2. good battery life ( 2.5 days+ if only used for calling and light use,  1.5 days for overall usage like YouTube, watsapp, google meet, music, calling and gaming)3. 18w fast charge and 22.5w charger in box ( 19 - 96% in 2 hours)4. less bloatware5. ufs storage6. Stereo speakersAnd cons are1) average processor.2) average camera. (Steady photos are very good but low light needs improvement)3) MIUI 12 is little laggy.4) little heavy.5) Speakers are not that loud but works very well.So only buy if you want good viewing experience, battery life , fast charging and 22.5 w charger."
1,Front camera 3rd class.
3,Just got the phone in hand and the phone started lagging the next day.1- Performance average.2- Camera Average.3- Bit heavy and bulky too u can feel that.4- Design poor or should i say worse.5- MIUI is worst.
5,"Value For money, Sound quality is Superb, display clarity nice, overall worth for it."
1,Friends don't buy redmi 9 power smart phone.Don't waste your hard earned money to buy such disgusting phone.Performance very badBattery life very badFast charging not at allCamera quality v v poor.User friendly not at all.This is my genuine review after using it.My had wasted my money you all plz don't waste your money buying this phone.
1,"After using for 10 days My genuine review.1.Mobile always hanging.If you open camera it will hanging automatically.If you open 2 tabs,it will hanging.2. Cameras response time is too late.3. Front camera waste. It's shows you black only.4. Battery performance gud.My old Redmi note 4 is best to compare this Redmi 9 power.""My biggest mistake buying this redmi 9 power""We need a solution from mi and Amazon."
2,It's a MARKETING TRAP...IT CLAIMS to have all the best feature but they performance is below average... it's has all the features but no quality....Only Pros1.Good quality FHD screen2.Battery backup is okay.3. Speaker quality.Cons1. Below Avg camera.2. It HANGS3. NOT A SMOOTH TOUCH.4. TOUCH LAGS need to tap button multiple times one gets irritate.5 . One feels cheated because we have better option in the same price range.Worst use experience. I feel my older 3 GB ram redmi 8a is more smooth than this.My recommendation always give priority to a better Processor.
1,"Please don't buy this go for redmi note 9 pro.Camera is very bad .I seriously suggest not to manufacture redmi products in India ,all the made in India of redmi is worst ..."
1,Battery Issue.... Phone is Heating during Charging and During Running Application.
1,Facing heating issue while using camera app and general usage in 60hz refresh rate if I use 120hz it gradually heating issue increase please solve this problem
5,"My first time buying a OnePlus phone and I really like the finish of the one. Camera is excellent, Android 11 is very smooth to use, functions are fast.Just my first day of usage so hard to be critical of anything. The downside for me is that there is no place expand the memory."
1,Within 10 minutes of usage. It’s felt like over heat. I can’t experienced any mobile like this.
2,"Iam OnePlus user since 4 years, I exchange my one Plus 7 pro mobile with OnePlus 9 R Not expected From One Plus, quality is not good, Look like cheep mobile, camera quality also not good, one Plus 7 pro superb mobile, totally iam disappointed with 9R."
1,I don't why no reviewer is speaking about it. It was heating with a normal usage.
5,After 5 days of usage writing this review.1. Best camera quality for the price2. Snapdragon 870 is doing its best in speed with 120Hz display. - Best3. 65W charger takes only 35 min to charge 100% from 15%. - Best4.  Fluid amoled display is awesome on its smoothness. - best5. Lake blue colour is simply awesome 💙Issues1. Facing very lite heating issue.2. Found a bug and informed OnePlus customer service which is if we turn on call recording on call it indicates opponent also that we are recording call. They told they will correct it in next update. Hope this will be cleared but not sure.I give 95/100 for this mobile.
4,"I am writing down this after using for a couple of days. I got the carbon black one with 12GB RAM.  Overall the device is good, and honestly is the reskin of one plus 8T with lower price 😁.  I will list down the pros and cons -pros -1. With Oxygen OS 11, the overall user experience is quite smooth. You will get an update as soon as you finish setup.2. The Warp 65 fast charging is fine, takes around 35 mins for one full charge.3. The screen to body ratio is good.4. The matt finish on the back side is awesome.Cons -1. Battery drains a little fast, not sure if some future updates will fix it.2. Rear Camera is ok, can be better.3. I would have preferred popup front camera, rather than the punch hole.4. For dual apps, I would have loved to see the option for all apps. Right now it has support for few.5. support for few more 5G bands will be good to have."
3,"Writing after 4 Days of use1. Heating Issues -you will start noticing from the very first use2. Battery - charges 0 to 100 in just 35-40 mins but also drains so fast. Need to Charges twice in a day after using whatsapp, some browsing, calling.3. Camera - Not very good. Less than as expected. Think twice before buying if you are camera enthusiastic.4. Smooth- 120hZ and 60hZ both condition works well. I found it smooth to use and open apps5. Snap 870 processor really works.6. Other Oneplus features works good.7. Not a flagship phone.Money and Decision is yours..!!Thanks"
3,"I have recieved this new phone yesterday. Since I have started using its been heating all the time, while on charge, playing games etc.. All other things are pretty good."
1,"OnePlus 9r is best of both world that you get from samsung and apple. I would rate full 5 stars for mobile except camera and heating issue. Also, the delivery experience while exchanging mobile turned out to be worst. Hence rating overall 1star for the bad and worst humiliated experience. Now I'm afraid to order again from Amazon."
1,"Worst phone by one plusHeating issues :yesBattery drain : yesPhone hang or crash : twice in a dayPhone needs a restart daily else it will stop working. Once it's restarted all settings changes to default.Dissatisfied, disappointed by one plus"
1,"HiPlease consider this message with a serious note the One Plus 9R which was bought on the above mention date got hanged and did not open exactly on the 13th day of buying it. The replacement policy was only for 10 days and my phone showed prblms from the 13th day. I took it to the One Plus Care Centre and they said it needed an update i waited for 3 days for the 'So Called' update to arrive but after 3 days the Care Centre informed me that this phone needed a Motherboard change when i ask them to replace the phone, they said that the care could not replace it for a new one because i had bought from amazon. They are now suggesting to replace it through amazon only. Is this what i bought a 40k One Plus phone for? If i can only tag the Oneplus company people in this!!!!!What kind of mobile phones do they sell???And also i want to claim a replacement of my phone from Amazon....i just dont care if the 10 days return policy is over.... I just want to say that i bought a 40k worth phone from you guys... And that it doesnt work...been waiting for more than 7 days now....with a ""Dabba"" phone in hand..... Is this the kind of service you provide??? I really would like you to have my phone replaced at the earliest Reply back soon......"
5,Review after 3 days usePros1) Build quality is awesome with aluminum frame and mate finish carbon black2) Display full HD+ Amoled screen display with 120hz refresh rate gives you the smooth experience3) The Snapdragon 870 processor will gives you good gaming experience4) Main camera is doing good performance with good picture quality and nightscape video is awesome and camera features were good5) usb-a to usb-c 65wat charger helps to full charge in 30 minCons1) It has heating issue after using phone for 40 min continuously2) Batery drain so fast as iam a heavy user it last me around 15 hours3) macro camera Is doing a worst performance
5,"An overall decent phone. The clean software experience would be the reason to choose this instead of Mi 11X or IQOO 7. Hardware wise it's more than capable. The camera I would say , is decent. It depends on your photography skills. The sensor specs only matter so much, I would say invest some time in learning photography. Check the photos attached. If you are a power user , this is one of the best value for money phones at this segment. For the custom rom folks , the kernel is open sourced, so in a year can expect decent ROM. I think IQOO bootloader is not unlocked so keep that in mind."
1,"First of all, it is hearing every time I use camera and play games. And picture quality is much below average. I previously owned Oneplus7 T and I had to sell that in order to buy this one. It was a wrong decision. The sensor is so bad and whenever I click a photo it is never detailed but only superfluous. I am disappointed."
1,Disappointed. This was my first purchase of oneplus phone and I was so eager to get a hand on it. But seriously there is need for improvement. Battery is like a candle as it is draining easily. Product has no premium finish. Also the display is not up-to the mark. They're claiming it as a gaming phone and sorry to say that you can't use it as a gaming device. Also the camera is average. Please don't go for it as there are lot of other good smartphones in the market with same set of features for 40k. Big no from my side. One plus Nord is better than this and I would recommend One plus should call back entire.  9R series.
5,From One plus 3Then One Plus 6And Now One Plus 9R...Always Launched and Booked😎😎😎No issues ever.
1,Battery issues
5,"As I'm a OnePlus user for more than 4 years now I purchased the OnePlus Plus 9 Pro on 30th March and loved it.And got the 9R for my sister and she loved this phone.I would say it's better to get 9R over 9 else buy the 9 Pro.Camera on the 9R is not as people are saying that it's bad. It's decent for the price. A normal person can't tell the difference btw.Screen is beautiful, phone looks premium."
5,"Okay, First of all, I was using oneplus 6 before and was planning for an upgrade, and eagerly waiting for 9 series. I decided to buy Oneplus 9 first, then I came to know that it wont have OIS stabilization. Then I planned to go for Oneplus 9 pro, but !! Insane heating issues and battery draining problem.Why should I waste money for such a phone, and finally I bought Oneplus 9r . Folks Hazzelblad is just a gimmick, Anybody using Oneplus 9R can get the same output using Google camera in OP9R !!Speakers are really good, Dolby Atmos, Cameras are above average+ , Super stable video mode gives you iPhone like stabilization, gaming is supercool, I bought 12/256 varient, and its super snappy, butter smooth. The only struggle I'm facing right now is the availability of accessories like tempered glass and back cases (official glass and cases are really expensive) , and we know this is a new model launched days before, so hopefully it'll sorted soon !!"
1,Worrest decision taken by OnePlus not providing 5G network bands in india. Only one 5G band in OnePlus 9R. Before they said we will provide other 5G by update. I want my money back. I will take legal action
5,"Review (8GB):This phone has very good performance. I ordered lake Blue its looking Stunning. love the device.Pros:=> Great performance/speed for SD 870 processor=> Battery life is fine=> Gesture control, Finger print scanner is nice=> Good cover provided with the phone, that really helpsCons:=> Heating while charging the phone. May be because of fast charge effect, OnePlus should look into this. After 100% charge, it automatically get cooled. no heating issueAs others are complaining there is=> No display tint issues=> No heating issues while using the phone, gaming etc. But noticed while charging=> No charging issues, within 10-15 mins 60-70% chargingRear Camera is good. Getting good pics in portrait mode. i will add few pictures soon."
1,"I just switched from OP6.Unlike when I brought the OP6, when I had zero complaints. I'm having many issues with the OP9R from day one.Things to note:1. The display has some major issues, there's an off-axis pinkish tint to whites and grays, which is quite annoying, and almost all the devices seem to affected with this as per OnePlus forums.2. The Camera are just mediocre, and I find the OP9 Camera much better than this. Even though OP9 lacks OIS, it almost always catches better pics and has better focus and stabilization in videos. Like MKBHD said, the Macro and Monochrome sensors are just garbage.3. The whole of the phone, particularly the backplate vibrates on playing sounds, it's pretty annoying and makes the phone feel cheap.Good stuff:1. Warp Charging is unbelievably fast.2. Other than the off-axis color shift, it's a great display.3. The phone is very snappy, added to the 120Hz display gives it a very confident smoothness.Overall:I think OnePlus put very little effort to this phone, as if they made it just to satisfy the Indian customers to complement the OnePlus 9 series. Their quality control seems to be quite bad, as OnePlus forums is full with issues with this device. I have a very unpopular suggestion, buy the OnePlus 9, it's only 7K more (SBI Credit Card). You get a newer and efficient Chipset, a substantially better camera. Having OIS gives no seeming advantage to OnePlus 9."
1,"I got a defective phone, it is struggling in moderate to weak network areas. Data Speeds are not even 20kbps. Highly disappointed. As the pic depicts, mobile data error icon can be seen 90% of my day usage. It is very weird. I switched from samsung a50 to OnePlus. it gave me excellent data speeds even in poor network area. I will update my review after one month."
1,Got a defective product and amazon is not ready to exchange it saying please contact manufacturer for warranty.
5,"The OnePlus 9R is a fair proposition in terms of the phone's pricing. For Rs 39,999, I get great performance, along with a very fluid and clean software experience. The photography, especially in low light, might not be spectacular, but it's still pretty good. Fast charging, decent battery life, and an attractive design contribute to the OnePlus 9R being a great purchase decision."
5,"Ordered Carbon Black; 12GB+256GB variant.Recieved a day early, on 19 April 2021.First Day Review:This phone is basically an 8T but with a Snapdragon 870, at a lower cost, but that doesnt mean they skimped on quality.So far from 1 day of use, this phone has been incredibly snappy and intuitive. Switching over from a Galaxy Note 8 was a piece of cake, although it took a good few hours to transfer the data.Charging is really quick as you would expect from a 65W WarpCharger.Camera quality is satisfactory in Auto mode, and gets better in Pro Mode with manual control.Speakers are loud and clear, and there is enough stereo seperation that it doesnt feel too unbalanced.Screen gets really bright and colours are accurate, haven't run into any rainbowing, Black Crush or Purple tinting issues. The 120Hz refresh rate also adds to the snappiness feel of the phone.Gaming is really enjoyable, especially those game that take advantage of the features like haptic feedback in COD Mobile. Speaking of which, the haptic motor (vibration) feels super crisp and tight, giving it a premium experience.I had gone for the Carbon Black, and the matte finish on the back glass is exactly what I had hoped for, and the matte finish also has an advantage of repelling fingerprints.So far the phone has been awesome, and I recommend it 10/10.Will update this review if I notice anything off :)"
4,"The only reason I went for Oneplus 9R is that I have been using Oneplus 5T from last 3+ years, the phone is perfectly fine till now and I always wanted to go with Oneplus for the upgrade after using Oneplus 5T and for its great user experience.Coming to the Oneplus 9R, I am not totally satisfied with the phone as I had higher expectations on Oneplus 9R. With the given features and upgrades I feel the phone is not doing so great. When you compare this phones with the similar range of phones from other brands you will have different opinions and thoughts.Pros:- Display quality is very good, with Fluid AMOLED Display and 120 Hz refresh rate display it is buttery smooth- Built quality is great, with aluminum body and Front and back Gorilla Glass 5 protection. Feels premium in hand- Phone speakers are doing well, sound is crisp, loud and with more details- Handset microphone is also great, Can hear the exact voice of the caller and it's clear and loud- Performance - Qualcomm 870 Chipset is doing well, phone is running smooth with no lags so far.- Front camera is good if you compare with other 16MP sensors on other phones.- As usual clean UI experience with Oxygen 11 OS.Cons:- Minor heating issues.  Felt phone was heating up during initial setup, while moving the files from old phone to new one. first 2-3 days felt phone is getting warmer with normal usage aslo and during the time of charging. I feel the heating issues resolved after receiving the first OS update or who knows the phone might be settling down after few days of usage.- Primary camera(s) is not up to the mark, photos can be seen only better in pro mode, videos are little better and front camera is OK. Lots of additional and unnatural colors are being added to the shot. There is no much clarity when you zoom and no details and images are scattered. Camera is not good with the hype which Oneplus created.  I wish Oneplus would be able to fix the camera issues with some good updates if hardware supports and if not then that's it.-Battery backup - Battery drains very quickly with the 120Hz refresh on, battery lasts only for 1 day with full charge and optimal usage. But the good thing is, it charges very quickly as well with 65W Warp charger. from 6 to 100 % took 49 minutes to charge.Overall, if you want to go with the display and performance other then Camera quality and some other issues which I highlighted, then you can go for it and if you are an Oneplus fan.NOTE: Whoever wants good Camera, they might think twice before purchasing this phone. You will get way better camera phones than Oneplus 9R under 40K (38 with discount)."
2,"OnePlus did a blunder with this one. Battery quality is very bad. And it's charging very slow. I'm not sure it's some unit problem or software issue, so I've requested a replacement, but it states over 1 hour to full charge when it's already charged 60%. The charging rate is very low as well, and battery deplete very fast, I can say it depletes faster than it's charging rate.Screen quality is great.Sound quality isn't very good either, it has very less max volume, I literally had to keep it at full volume always for a decent sound.As for heating issues, as everyone else is stating, it's over heating a lot! While normal usage it overheats, let alone any power playing.Honestly, I feel OnePlus made a blunder here. I was really looking forward to this device. Let's see how the replacement unit feels.Edit - battery seem to be performing better after replacement. However, still have issues like overheating and speaker sound."
4,"I have an OnePlus 3 and an One plus 8 and this this my third purchase of an oneplus phone in the family.A bit disappointed to hold the phone at first after using OnePlus 8 for almost a year now. First, the lack of curved edges deprives you of a smooth navigation gestures especially with the cover on. Further, it is not the slimmest phone in this price catagory. But not so heavy.Full marks to the Super-AMOLED display, which is super cool and crisp. Even in broad sunlight, it is visible because of the 1,100 nits it offers. Build quality is very premium. Ergonomically well designed. Perfect for one-handed opraration. The front and rear is of corning gorilla glass 5 and the frame is metal (where as for the OnePlus 9 the frame and rear are of plastic!!) Lucky me! So it looks very elegant. But no IP rating for water proof is disappointing. But company says it is water proof. The insulation in the SIM tray is an evidence.The phone is superfast with a great sensitivity for touch and swipe gestures with the Snap Dragon 870 processor. 120 hz refresh rate is super smooth. Gamers would love it with a top-notch haptics (vibration features) and with the 244 hz touch sampling rate.Battery charging is very fast too. The juice holds up for quite long because of the better power management by the latest processor and the LLDR 5 RAM. Delightful!! Occassional warming yes during heavy games. That's normal. Camera is decent. Front camera is 16 MP should be a 32 in this price range. Avoid beautification option as you may look like a cartoon. Rear camera takes above average photos in day light. But below average during low light/ nights especially the wide angle camera. But it has optical image stabilisation even the OnePlus 9 doesn't have that. So shaky hand fellows don't worry for the blur. Videos are of best quality. Best in this category. With a good video editor and skill you can make cinema like videos but the stabilisation is not-so-good in the nights.Stereo speakers are of very good quality. It is loud and doesn't crack even at high volumes. Call quality is decent. Not comparable with iPhones though. And Dolby audio is very enjoyable with headphones. With a good quality earphones/ headsets, I assure it is not less than a immersive audio experience especially for games.'Flip to mute' and 'raise the phone to answer' features are missing. Don't know why. It is just a OnePlus 8T with a good looking rear camera console with Rs.3000 less. Even the cover of 8T suits perfectly on this.So overall I am satisfied if not delighted. My OnePlus 8 is still better I feel. But this is the best in this price range. Better than the vivo x60, Mi11X pro or even the samsung S20 FE especially for the build quality and the premium feel it gives. Also the oxygen OS is best out of all android OS'. Also the in-display finger print sensor and the face unlock, I have not experienced  anything faster, prompter and more acuurate in recent times with anyother gadgets!! But the phone has only one 5G band. Suggest not to use the cover supplied with the box. It gives a kinda smoky look and makes the phone look bulky. But withstands accident falls. I have ordered the sandstone bumper case from the OnePlus store. Lake blue colour variant is awesome. Best of all the colors of all the OnePlus phones till today in my opinion. Catches not much finger prints or smudges like the 8 series. Scratch proof. Phone comes with a pre-applied scratch gaurd sticker. So no extra purchase required. Charging cable is a bit shorter than OnePlus 8. Type C charger with 65W charging adapter. 0 to 100 in 50 minutes. One significant change here is the data transfer to and from computer is quite faster than my OnePlus 8 also using OTG. Adaptive brightness they have got it right this time. In previous Oneplus devices, it was irritating. I have become loyal to OnePlus because the life of OnePlus phones is quite long compared to any other leading brands. My OnePlus 3 still stands formidable after 5 years. One star less just for the absense of curved edges display and a not-so-slim thickness. Else this phone is very good. Though corner of my mind says the price should be 10% lesser.P. S.Not encountered any overheating or battery draining issues as highlighted by some users. May be because I bought the phone after the release of first software update  and updated before writing this review. If you are not a fan of flagship processors and not a gamer, go for the OPPO F19 Pro with half of this price. Slimmer, lighter and with 3.5 mm jack."
1,Worst camera...  even a sub-10k phone will beat this phone in camera segment.I never expected such poor quality camera in a flagship killer brand..... first and last OnePlus phone. Congratulations for losing your customer.
1,Heats like hell. Initial set up heats up mobile.. 7nable to hold even after using a back case.. Same with games/camera/video streaming apps. Difficult to hold in hand. Needs an urgent fix.
4,"I have been using Realme 2 pro for the past 2 and half years and I felt like I needed a upgrade and bought OnePlus 9R, have to say it's a worthy upgrade and the speed is amazing. Everything is super fast and 120hz refresh rate is cherry on the top. Camera is okaish nothing that great. There are some heating here and there while using apps. Battery is okay as well. If you are using heavily it will not last you for a day, with normal usage it will easily last for a day. Also the phone fully charges in 40 minutes thanks to the 65w fast charging. OxygenOs is good nothing that great. There are lots of booklets inside the box, I hope next time OnePlus reduce that and instead add a usb c to 3.5mm jack adaptor. This is the first time I am using a OnePlus phone and I am really enjoying every moment of it and I would recommend this phone to everyone who is planning on upgrading their phone."
1,"I never expected that OnePlus phones will be having heating issue. With my device OnePlus 9R 12GB, I faced this issue and highly disappointed 😞. I even bought OnePlus Buds Z as well and Bluetooth droops very often."
1,"Just recieved latest flagship phone but disappointed with quality of product at 39k price tag. It's heating up within use of 30 mints even when it gets charged up completely. Batery draining in short time even with normal use of watsapp, accessing mails. Weirdest things I have noticed that you feel the sound viberation from back side when while calling to someone and it's wrost when you play music. It give you a feel poor quality product."
3,"Here's my final review after more than one month of continuos usage of this phone.Charging speed: 5⭐Display : 5⭐Touch response and feel : 5⭐  120 hz display feels and looks butter smooth.Battery life: 3⭐ (Even in 60 hz refresh rate, battery doesn't last for a day).Back Camera (in daylight):  3⭐ (because of very bad skin colour reproduction)Back Camera (in night): 5⭐Front camera: 2⭐ (my Mi A3 takes way better selfies).Ui and themes: 5⭐Fingerprint reader: 5⭐Audio quality (Call/Music): 4.5⭐Performance: 2.5⭐ (heats up really fast).Build quality and looks : 5⭐(it won't break easily if fallen accidentally.)Internet speed : 5⭐"
1,Extremely worst battery.. battery drain s very quickly.. mobile also average camera
1,Phone was getting heat when charging and continuse use for 30m any application not expected this from brand like One plus.
5,"Review after 7 days of extensive usage. • I would say the performance you are going to get one oneplus and that OxygenOS touch you gonna get from knowhere. It's too smooth to handle after using this you'll find thise ""IOS"" devices are lagging cuz they aren't having 120 Hz display even the price for iphone 12 is almost double the price of oneplus 9R.Pros: • Snapdragon 870 which is smooth as hell either it be for video editing and redndering or it be for playing games. Even the ""Call of Duty"" runs like water buttery smooth at max fps. • Tested this device while playing games on it like COD/Free Fire with max Resolution and FOS and would say thermals are very good it won't heat up after almost an hor of gaming temp was still maintained to be as 40°C in a Non AC room. • Video Stability and recording best in the market if you turn night mode on even in the dark scenes it is well lit up no one can guess it was shooted in night. Video potrait is best for content creater the bokeh effect is mouth watering for the content creators the bokeh youll get is as similar as you'll get in a dslr camera but the surrounding should be well lit up. • Oxygen OS it is the best operating system I've seen on an Android device unlike other OS available for Android. • User interface is best thing of oneplus devices you can't get rid of it's addiction even you'll start hating IOS 😅 not actually but it's the best UI I've ever used • You'll get 5g support so you don't need to worry about future upgrades. This will work smooth. • Design and placement of Camera Module is the best the oneplus have done ever while it's completely subjective, but youll get 🦍 Glass 5 protection on front and back along with a aluminum chasis/side frame it's a well built device simply rigid and feels premium to hold. • Haptic is best in the price range. • Dua Dolby Stereo Speakers make it loud enough to consume your content at any place • Full day power just in few minutes this device comes with a 65W wrap charge which will charge your device in just the time span of 30/35 mins. You'll never fall short of power either it be powerful performance or the power interms of battery. • Oneplus's Fluid Amoled display is best screen I've ever seen smooth responsive and vivid best for Netflix, lovers xD.Cons: • There are some bugs oneplus need to solve it as it isn't justified for this kind of flagship devices. I'm mentioning few of them oneplus pls act accordingly. • While using YouTube  the framerate drops I don't know it's a google fault or what but even the notification bar seem to be freezing while scrolling down as to like 90fps. There are few more applications like Google photos application which I've discovered uptil now. • Phone get warms outside it might be due to the electronic devices catch too much of heat radiations from Sun rays. • Oneplus pls provide One-Hand mode as soon as possible as the device is having a large form factor it's quite not possible for using the device single handedly even if I am having really large palms and long fingers indeed, I am just thinking anout those girls having small cute palms and fingers💅🤣😅. • Now jumping to camera section one plus needs to work on the picture capturing algorithm the problems faced were like... • 1) Sometime captures undersaturated photos in potrait and 2x Zoom mode. • Need to work on the algorithm of focusing as it hunts for focus sometimes in the darker. • Basically Camera needed to be well optimized by oneplus in few aspects rather say camera performance is awesome just few bugs are needed to be solved. I've attached few pictures you can refer to those.Conclusion: • If you want a well built phone with best processing speeds and Video Capabilities you can opt for it it's is the best device in my terms under 50k budget but few bugs and improvisation are required & I hope Oneplus will donit sooner or later.Thanks for reading my review."

1,I wasted my money. Lots of hangings and very slow. Network issues. This is not a 5G or even equal to 1G. Please do not buy this and waste your money. I asked for a refund but Amazon saying is can be replaceable. Not a good service by Amazon and don't know why they are selling such a third class mobile.
5,"My usecase - I replaced by secondary phone Redmi Note 4 - wanted to 5G phone with good battery and Sub 15K price tag.

1,"Recently I ordered it, while recording video from front camera, screen is becoming white and also the video,Also while normal uses, it hanging and screen is becoming black.This experience is necessary for the people who are going to buy new mobile with their hard earned money.Take care."
5,"Very nice phone, I brought it at an offer period, but it cost is little bit more,Battery backup decentCamera clarify very goodPerformance... Very nice...Snapdragon Proceccer is the best compare to mediatek. Budget friendly phone, 128 gb and extra slot for increasing memory, 6 gb ram... Very good... Face recognition system and finger print sensor are awesome....."
4,Phone was awasome in its price range.there only 2 problems for this phone1 call recording it says when we start call recording. And auto call recording was only for contacts in mobile.2 mobile heat issue while charging.
2,"I am writing my open review of this phone after using approximately 18daysPhone looks very good look wise 5 out of 5 🌟Camera quiliy is good but not expected from this price pointPhone some times working slow, something I feel I am using my old phone, it means phone performance is not match from my expectations, On this price we should have to buy another phones."
1,"The product which I got, it's not charging even after 4-5 hrs of continuous charging, frequent hanging, and d touch sensor s not dat much great compared to other products, I experience  frequent black outs even, it's disgusting to use this product"
5,"Phone is very good. Box comes with phone case(synthetic) also phone has temper glass sticked to it, No heating , Just used it for a day, Good battery backup"
5,Just loved it ....Cons: 90hz refresh rate is just awesome .Finger print sensors are too good and even face lock.The processor is smooth and the battery is just love easily last for 1.5 days with normal use and a day with heavy use.Cons : I haven't found any cons.
5,Best smart phone I have purchased so far in such reasonable price with exchange of my old phone I got Rs 4000 discount. There are lots of advance and useful features in this phone which will give you the feeling like the costly phones. Great feeling in hand like a chocolate bar and you want to bite it. Excellent design.
4,"It's a choice able budget 5G smart phone. Very good looks, built quality decent, performance smooth, display and touch excellent, battery acceptable, voice and sound quality very good, no network issue, no heating issues, but cameras not good at all. SAR value is low in this segment 5G(Head: 1.066 & Body:0.607).Though it's the review after 18 hrs of uses. The actual review will be done after 1month of uses."
1,"I am not able to connect my Bluetooth with it, and it has a hanging problem too, I can't send a video call from the phone , I am not able to accept the video call, the calling sound quality is not that great 😒"
4,Nice phone
3,"Phone design and look is ok... Camera quality is average (as I bought it for only 14000) it could be a way better.The phone has unique manufacturing defect that it gives error message while using that |the phone temperature is very high"" and automatically phone data and other programme stop working...Even the phone body not heat that much... This is the major issue as you can't use mobile data or camera without restarting the phone or leave for 10minute hold..."
5,"One of the best phone within 16-17k range. Purchased for 15k.Good and fluid performance, good camera, easy to handle, body weight ratio is good. Can easily handle by one hand. Outdoor pics r good, indoor pics r OK. Can easily handle multiple tasks. Battery back up is excellent.In the midrange it's one of the best phones, don't compare with phones above 50k."
4,"Though it's relatively new. I loke this phone. It's fast, clear cam with many options.Battery backup is good as of now.Being into marketing, my phone usage is very high. Also I watch movies and play games.Still it gives 24 hr backup with everything.As of now, I am liking it."
2,"Device is little heavy. Camera quality is average and not appear of 48 mega pixel. Camera quality has really disappointed me. Screen is also not soothing for eyes. Overall, it's doesn't satisfy the brand reputation and money spent on it."
5,Looking is awesome and stylish look ...I feel it's quite better and budget 5g phone.  Performance also very good..go for it...
4,Mobile looks good battery backup is also good as it is an 5000 mah battery. But it is not having an feature of automatic call recording system.
3,"on the time of call recording other person knows the this call is going to record, Screan recording issue."
1,Sound quality is not good
5,Loving it.. Thank you so much amazon.
3,Good 5g phone from oppo....Features and everything is fine but only disappointment is the camera as I was expecting a better camera as such price from oppo. But camera is just OK.
2,You won't get 5G experience compare to other 5G products.. If you are using DUAL SIM CARDS for calls then let me tell ... it gets stuck while selecting the calling options. Few applications like Zoom / Skype are not that supportive... it take time to synchronize.Battery life is moderate ... says fast charging but it doesn't. Same goes with Camera
5,Nice product.
5,Worth a money. Good sound quality. Amazing camera quality.. Smooth access and user friendly.
3,"I didn't like the camera quality. Oppo is known for cameras, but this one was disappointing. Seems they are charging for 5g feature. Display is very good though."
4,The Product is nice the Only issue is with Charging time. It claims 18W fast charging but taking more than usual to charge. It took around 120 minutes to charge from 41-100%. Either the charger supply is underrated or company is claiming it wrong.
1,"Buy other set of oppo but don't buy thisNo call recorder no any external speakers sounds qulty is to bad taking to much time for charging camera is also not so goodPhone heat to fast overall waste of money,Don't buy."
1,"Performance is very bad, its very slow and quality of front camera also poor"
3,Camera issue: When I was clicking photo out side scene then there are some kind of three lines in pictures. I have tried many times but issue was still same. Accept this issue others thing are good in this mobile.
5,This phone is awesome bcz Ram extension up to 5gb means our phone become 11gb ram phone.... Awesome Performance....
1,I got a faulty product so I have raised a complaint to exchange but they don't have this phone in stock
2,"Please be aware that this is a downgraded version of globally launched Mi 11 and Mi 11 pro.Reason for low rating -1. Ordinary display. This is not the 2K display as featured on global versions of Mi 11 series2. No gorilla glass victus unlike global version.3. Band tests shows poor build quality which may result in breakage of phone due to bending4. Such a cheap tactic of selling a phone with the promise of fast charging and not providing charger with a adequate charging capacity.5. No curved display unlike global version.6. Took almost 20 days to get my hands on the phone post order.7. Reported heating issues in SD 888 while playing intensive gamesIn short, xiaomi has attempted to sell big story by first launching Mi 11 globally and then putting ""X"" and selling subpar product in India through illusion.I guess, Xiaomi should not have cut the corners and compromise the quality in Indian versions. Indians are willing to pay premium and success of oneplus is the testament to that. Any cunning move to undercut the value proposition will hurt xiaomi in long run.(note that I currently use redmi note 20 pro and have used so many phones of xiaomi ever since it launched first ever phone in India and hence hold a adequate credentials to voice my criticism as a fan)"
5,"What a Smartphone by Xiaomi! I am thoroughly impressed. I was using One Plus earlier but now One Plus doesn't stand a chance.  No one is giving you Snapdragon 888 process at this killer price, so just go for this.Display is gorgeous and just unbeatable. Even Samsung Galaxy S21+ is no match in display. Latest E4 Amoled is magical – vivid colors, 1300 nits brightness, and 120Hz sampling refresh. You won't even notice such a small front camera punch hole.Camera is best in class. Time freeze motion mode, Telemacro and clone mode are just amazing features.Overall device feel so premium in hand thanks of top in class glass, ceramic and metal body."
4,"Received my Mi 11x Pro today😻 . Really excited . Came with a  power adapter, usb cable,clear case ,type c to 3.5 mm converter and everything that is given in the what's in the box.My first impression was overwhelming as it was a major upgrade from my last phone. It's a piece of art, the glass body and the amoled display makes feel.. Terrific.. 😅 One thing to take extra care is the camera portion which is placed Protruding at the back . The case is of average quality. The phone is butter smooth 🤤 It's just been a few hours so hoping for the best 🤞"
5,"I love gaming and have been waiting for a SDM 888 under 40k which does not compromise on any aspect, and now i finally have it in my hands and its a Gaming Beast.The 360 Hz touch sampling rate makes up for buttery smooth game control. For all mobile gamers, pls have a look at the touch sampling rate as that determines more your response times, even more than screen refresh rate (not that Mi 11X pro lacks there with its vibrant 120 Hz OLED Panel).Camera Again, since I love making travel videos, and have been using an iPhone 11 for the past one year, this has been a welcome change, with its saturated and punchy images and videos that are a treat to the eye. For vlogs in outdoor scenarios, audio used to become an issue, however audio zoom  feature really helps reduce background noise and focus on the subject. No need to carry a separate mic!I have always liked soft bright colors on my gadgets and so chose the celestial silver one. Considering the hardware it packs the phone is surprisingly light and slim.As for the user interface which is MIUI, this phone has the cleanest version of MIUI yet. However being a nerd, I never shy away from the plethora of custom ROMs that popular Xiaomi devices get over at XDA, and this I am sure is going to be a blockbuster one, just like the K20 Pro from the past!! SO that's something up to try in the future!!"
5,"One of the best phones from Xiaomi, display is outstanding, camera, chipset are all the best you can get at this price, in-display fingerprint scanner is missing but trust me, side mounted scanner is more fast than u expect, this time Xiaomi has killed OnePlus in all ways possible, and also must say that the UI is much more clean and Im really enjoying the new software teweks..😊Last but not least Super wallpapers in amoled display looks insanely amazing"
5,"Such an wonderful phone , everything is fast, wonderful display and feature packed"
3,"I am a oneplus 5 user for the last 4 years. So I can only compare it with Oneplus 5. Mi 11X pro is having one of the worst front cameras. The output is too artificial. In terms of processor, it's good, but you should think twice if you are looking for a mobile with a good camera."
5,"Loved theCrisp screenSnappy processorUFS storage speedGames turbo modeCamera - awesome after tweaksDidn't like the Mi bloatware, but can be removed. Overall, a great package deal. Feels like a flagship, works like a flagship"
5,"This is my first Xiaomi device, switching from One Plus . I generally do not tend to change devices frequently, so before buying I make sure that I know what I am getting into.Why I considered this device?Wanted the flagship processor, a good display with high refresh rate and dual speakers as I consume a lot of OTT content, 5G support to make the device future ready and a slim phone profile.YaysReally good performance, day to day multitasking is a cakewalk thanks to SD 888 processorHigh touch sampling rate provides an edge while gaming, controls feel much more responsiveDisplay is really bright and vivid. The colour reproduction is unparalleled.  This display can give the flagships a run for their money, may be even beat them.Camera captures crisp and detailed images, colours are tuned perfectly (something which even OP has not been able to fix). Really loved the Magic Zoom, Slow Shutter and the Freeze frame modes.I had been a bit skeptical on the UI because MIUI has a history of pushing bloatwares and ads. It came to me as a surprise that there are no ads or bloatwares. Really enjoyed the feature rich and highly customizable MIUI.A vertical camera setup, Gorilla Glass back and slim footprint makes the device feel really premium. I really loved the back panel and how the colour changes when viewed from different angles.NaysNot a fan of punch hole display but Mi 11X Pro seems to have the smallest punch-hole I have ever seen on any other phone."
4,I got the product on time. Phone camera quality is very good and faster processing and charging are added benefits. I was able to charge my phone to 100% in leee than one hour. And it took 9 hours to discharge my phone to 1% while using hotspot and streaming high quality videos at the same time.
4,I have used iq007 legend for a week and returned it. luckily i got refund and purchased this mi 11x pro. I  generally play pubg at least 2 hours a day in HDR+EXTREME but I didn't find that much heat and frame drops in mi 11X pro but iq007 legend produced some heat and observed frame drops.  battery drop is equally more after gamming in both the devices and 33watts will be a draw back for mi11x.camera is very discouraging. details are very bad even with 108MP mode but 108MP camera in mi10 5g produced sharp detailed 108MP images. not satisfied with mi11x pro cameras.
5,"Overall KICKASS device, but some of my favourite features -- Display - simply gorgeous!, those colours - so vibrant, and so butter smooth- Processing speed - super fast - easily able to multi task.- Camera - some awesome UI optimizations - my favourite is the time freeze motion mode. The telemacro is just dope!- Very clean UI - no bloatware- This phone just feels right to hold! great hand feel.- I thought Audio zoom was a gimmick, but that actually works. Great job Xiaomi!"
5,"I am writing this review after using it for more than 15 days. If you are looking to buy Flagship mobile under 40k you can close your eyes and go for it, Performance is outstanding when use multiple apps i never see a lag and for gaming it is really awesome and coming to camera segment i have attached some pictures which i took two days before pictures says everything. Excellent flagship phone from redmi"
5,"I came to buy One Plus 9 in this portal and Found a phone which is configuration wise much better than than my previous choice . I chose to save 10K with no compromise on the product .Now the question is what are the additional benefits I got even after saving 10K ?1. Got a Bigger and much better display 6.67” Vs 6.55” ,2. Much Brighter 1300 Vs 1100 , P2i coating to support water and resistant ,3. Also liquid cooling with better refresh rate as during lockdown I keep playing games so these two features was necessary . Also I know Battle Ground Indian version is coming .Now these were only feature wise benefits . But the experience was even better got the delivery on 14th so for last 4 days includes the long Eid Weekend I kept playing games and watching Netflix .Got no heating issue , battery is too good , and screen is much better and bigger … Finally I have bought another Redmi 9 Power , with 10K which I saved  for my niece’s online class 😀"
1,Worst mobile even wastage of money if it's price becomes 10000
5,"I got the phone delivered even with lockdown in the city, thank you Amazon!i am happy with the device. The DIsplay, Camera, PHOTOS, speed - everything is just perfect.For me DISPLAY is most important - we stare at the device all day.This is probably the best display I have seen in premiurm range phones. I think E4+ Amo led and Display Mate tech is helping.Other important things are camera and speed. It has a gorgeous camera - no complains only. The device is very fast, using non stop for last few days.Other than that -It Feels sturdy and the OS is quite clean, smooth.Couldn't find an cons as such... will update if I find something.Overall: It your budget is in 40k range - don't think, just go for this device - you will be happy!"
5,Super phone with all flagship level specsEspecially performance was beast with low costThanks mi
5,"Today received my order, as of now it is excellent.Took long time for delivery due to order prioritization."
5,"I'm writing this review after using the phone for a fortnight. I will breakdown my review in terms of Pros and Cons:PROS:- Best AMOLED screen in the market. The display is of the greatest quality. From colour saturation to brightness, everything is crisp and clear.- Celestial silver looks really premium.- Side mounted fingerprint sensors are REALLY FAST. The phone unlocks in a jiffy. Face unlock also works really well.- Camera is above average, if not the best. The 104MP rear camera takes stunning images and the picture quality is superb. Xiaomi has provided some great camera features like Vlog modes which is really fantastic. Videos shot in 4K & 8K are really good.- Speaker & sound quality is THE BEST. Love it.- WiFi & network reception are working better than expected. Supports WiFi calling, which is really helpful.- Processor is FAST. RAM management is really good.- Battery life is above average.CONS:- Not a fan of Google dialer & messaging app. MI dialer & messaging apps were FAR BETTER.- Proximity sensors are not working to the best of their capabilities. I hope they fix it with an update.- Front camera is average, if you take selfies.Overall I love this phone. I won't be wrong to say that this is the best phone in the market, at this price range. In fact it can knock down some other phones which costs 60/65k, I hope you understand my hint ;)."
4,Overall an excellent phone with everything power packed. Just the issue that i found was of battery draining fast. I hope an update from Xiaomi will solve this and further optimize it.
5,"Will write detailed review later but here is my opinion, if you're confused between iqoo 7 legend, oneplus 9r & Mi 11x Pro go for Mi 11x pro considering all round performance.-Good in Camera-Performance is silky smooth-UI is very much improved MIUI 12-Android 11-Not much of a bloatware issue-Amazing Stereo speakers (Dolby Atom)-Gaming is amazing as it has flagship SD888-Not much of a heating issues as compared to previous flagship (will heat after heavy processor usage & it's normal cuz it have SD888)I would say that if you're buying a phone just for a single purpose i.e. gaming go for iqoo 7 legend it's best in class flagship processor. But Mi 11x Pro for all round usage."
5,"The Mi 11 X Pro is beautiful phone which has everything above the cut.Starting with display, being the only phone with a A+ certification is amazing, the E4 AMOLED on this is quite bright for a phone, have used a phone with such high brightness till date. Very distinct even under direct sunlight. Content watching on this phone is exceptionally good and playing games on 120Hz is a tootally different experience.Next comes the camera, the camera setup is too good, the pictures are not only near perfect on the phone but also when you use the image on your computer. The dynamic range of the phots are really good. Tried a bit of video recording and was amazed by the quality of the video recording, the time freeze motion and the audio zoom work well. By far one of the best camera's I have used on a Xiaomi phone.I was not so sure about MIUI but it seems to have become way better, there are few cool features which I can never let go but its been a pleasant experience so far, looks like Xiaomi has finally woke up to improve their software experience. The overall experience is snappy, Snapdragon 888 being the best of the best the performance matches to it, everything just works as expected.Combining all of these in a light weight yet durable form factor is a amazing."
5,"After watching a lot of videos and reading a lot of articles online, I finally decided to try out this phone. After using it for a week, I wasn’t disappointed at all. Listing down a couple of things that really impressed due to the price point for this phone:Loved the glossy black colour. Looks beautiful and very premium. The phone felt really good to hold in my hands, being super light and thin.The display was exceptionally bright, and I could really feel the colours coming alive while watching Netflix. I’m not a fan of the selfie camera in the display, but this punch hole camera was quite unobtrusive while watching movies and playing games. I really liked this.I play AoV on my phone, and was quite impressed with the smooth display and the fact that the phone was not heating up after playing for more than an hour. I guess I have the 888 processor to thank for this. Not sure if any other phone at this price offers this one.Last, but not the least, the camera here is quite good. I usually don’t experiment with different settings, and just use all default settings. Even then, the images produced were stunning. I did a quick comparison with people in my family (who use apple and oneplus) and really liked the way the colours were balanced in the photos from my camera. The level of detailing that this camera can capture is also very high.With all my office work, social media, watching youtube, movies etc.. the phone usually lasts me for 1.5 days after a single charge.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a power packed device at an affordable price. Totally worth the money."
4,"Definitely not the top tier phone yet impressed.Love the design. Snapdragon 888 has loads of raw processing power. Wifi 6 support is what I loved. 108mp camera shots are okay. Felt that the photos are much better than my old OnePlus 7Pro shots.Cons:-Hate the slow data transfer usb 2.0 port-Slow 55 minute charging.(33w Sonic charger)-Miui Bloatware (getapps, Xiaomi ads, Tencent trackers) are a hassle can be removed using debloater tool from PC.-NightMode is horrible.-Overheating issue, hopefully should be fixed with MIUI 12.5 update in coming months."
5,It is the best phone and truly a flagship at a very reasonable price.  Samsung/Oneplus: you are are looting people just due to your brand name.  Xiaomi is giving best features at best price.Please ignore the cons as mentioned in many of the views as it is a perfect phone as on date.  Everything about the phone is too nice and you will have good feeling of holding a true flagship mobile in your hand.You will not regret buying this phone rather will feel that it is truly a value for money mobile.Keep it up Xiaomi !!!  Very Beautiful Smartphone !!
5,"Writing a review after using the phone for 24 hours.Looks - This can be subjective but I love the celestial silver colour. Changes colours as light hits it. Look at pictures in my review. Bezels are thin and the phone is light weight.Display - This is my first phone with an Amoled display and boy what a world of difference. I compared it next to an Iphone 11 which has an IPS LCD panel and this display is so much better.Performance - Very snappy. No stutters in day to day usage. I'm not a gamer so can't comment on gaming performance.Camera - Very Nice. I paid extra for the 108MP sensor as compared to Mi 11X. Looks like it was worth it.Battery - Average. Normal usage got me an SOT of 5.5 hours, which is not bad and not great either.All in all very good value and in my opinion much better than OP 9R."
5,I needed a really good phone as a second device to help me with recording videos along with my mi 10. This more than satisfies the requirement. What I liked most :Camera - images come out clean with the right saturation. Some cool modes like the clone mode are fun to use with kids around the house. Great for shooting my pet dog!Display - super bright and very clean visuals. Don't know the tech terms but looks phenomenal. Think the 120 Hz refresh rate is a bit of game changer.Performance - Haven't seen any lag on any of the applications I've run including heavy shooters or video editing short clips of my dog for YouTube.Design - black is my preferred color after having lived with light colored phones ...this feels cleaner to hold. Comfortable to hold and carry despite the largeish battery.Overall a great phone and at this price it's a no brainer. Miui is also optimized for performance and has a simpler interface. Love it so far.
3,"Average phone, some heating issues, 108 MP camera just making fool as they did same in Note 8 pro, Nothing much difference when  I compare to Note 8 pro vs 11 pro in terms of speed and smoothness, when we compare the price there is Lot difference."
4,"Writing this review after using the phone for last 7 daysFirst of all, the display is superb, phone is also nice and easy to hold onto hand and lightweightIt's very fast with SD 888 and 8GB RAM, silky smooth for day to day work and gaming (gets hot after 10 mins or so)Back camera is awesome, pro feature and videos are really cool. UWD camera is pedestrian thoughBattery, drains really fast, not sure why. Forget about 120HZ refresh rate, even with 60HZ and with normal use (no game!!), phone had to be charged within the day. I found that with 60HZ, dark mode and battery saver on, phone lasts a day without charging. This is a bit disappointingNext comes the software, MIUI needs improvement. Found strange issues like error popup during first time set up. It also starts to misbehave (like touch does not work properly, or hangs sometime) after 1-2 days of use and had to restart to get over it. I hope fixes will come soon for thisOverall I still feel it is a great value for money, if software is fixed, then other than battery, phone really becomes a flagship killer!"
5,Display.  10/10Connectivity.  10/10New features.  10/10Smooth ness .  10/10Battery.  5/10.Better than one plus phone & samsungNumber one premium phone.Cons:Improve battery . Fast draining battery.
4,Some software bugs need to fix. Other than that this mobile is all-rounder
1,The phone is fast but the battery is not working properlyGuys try to buy a better phone than this but don’t do it Because of the battery problem
5,"Writing this review after a week of use.The product is better in terms of spec as compared to the nearest OnePlus and Samsung alternative & hence I bought it.The camera, processing, screen and battery performance is simply impressive.Being a OnePlus user in the past, I find this model of Mi make change to my preference to Mi as my favourite."
1,AMOLED is worst.Lot of bugs in dark mode.Interface hangs slot.9pro is much better than this model.
3,"Experience of 5 days-1. The best part is it's display.2. Stereo speaker is good enough with dolby  atmos on, lack of bass in it.3. Heating is little bit more than usual4. battery backup is average, 12nm chipsets are  better than 888 in terms of battery backup.5. performance is snappy6. miui sucks, custom roms may help it7.back camera is excellent in daylight, but it  performs below average in night8. selfie camera struggles, I found that  note 10  pro max selfie cam (16mp) does better job than  this."
4,"Today I got the delivery of this phone in my Home town. Great Service Amazon India, Thanks !!The phone is Cosmic Black, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage version.PROS:1) Very decent-looking backside cover, not you feel like the cheap plastic one.2) Came with ok  Ok clear soft case.3) Came with screen protector/cover loaded on the front screen.4) The phone is very fast, reviewed after using for 20+ hours.CONS:1) THE BATTERY LIFE IS NOT GOOD, IT DRAINS  FAST. While I am trying to set up all the needed Andriod applications in this phone, the battery drains from 38% to 5% within 20 mins of use.2) This phone is having a  Heating issue after using for 30 mins only. If I play some heavy games for 1 hour, surely I can make an omelet on the backside of the phone 😡 . This is the only reason for which I bound to give a 4-star rating to this phone.Overall this phone is good, attractive in looking (both front and back), rich in features, value for money."
5,"I think Xiaomi has killed the competition with a complete package in its latest flagship Mi 11X Pro!• The Snapdragon 888 5G is amazingly fast and delivers a great performance. I am sure the gamers must be loving it already!• The Camera with the Telemacro sensor is mind-blowing. I think Xiaomi has just nailed the camera tuning to get the perfect shots on the device. My favourite features are - the Time freeze motion mode, Clone mode and AI Skyscaping.• The 120 Hz refresh rate along with the vivid colours on the E4 AMOLED display, give a next level silky smooth experience. DisplayMate A+ display and 360 Hz touch sampling rate are perfect for gaming.• The sleek design and light- weight device is a 'thing of beauty' to hold in your hands. Not to forget the Celestial Silver variant is too pretty to behold!• Loved the clean new MiUI experience so far with reduced Bloatware and optimized battery life.Final Verdict: The best premium device with the best display, a great camera and a steal deal at this price! I have been in love with the phone!"
1,Don't buy ... because cemera is totally bad ..not working properly... Hitting issues .
2,"I have bought two phones redmi note 10 and mi 11x pro simultaneously from the amazon. One costs 12500 and other costs 40000 and to my surpise camera of redmi note 10 is better than mi 11x pro. Performance side I don't have any complaints, multi-tasking can be easily done on this phone. Camera is where Xiaomi has really cut the costs. If you are looking to buy this phone expecting that camera will perform ok considering that all other specs are flagship then don't buy this as the camera has 0 star performance on this phone. I am also returning my phone"
5,"After MI 5, i am buying thisExtremely smooth, Found some bugs which was fixed in the last update.No lags while playing pubg (on UHD mode)Battery life is excellentNo heating issues as many saidI miss that In display finger print reader. Side mount has some issues while puting and taking the mobile out from pocketSince i used with the miui, I cant go away from miui and i love miui. So iqoo is not the phone i could choose.Also i need the IR blaster. Please othe(R) brands too add IR blaster"
5,Great photo Ossam phone
5,"Happy to write 1st 100% Satisfied product review regarding Tecno Spark 7 Pro (Magnet Black 6GB RAM 64GB Storage smart phone). Liked Unique features like Kids Mode, Special functions, FREE from Harrassment filter for Spam calls and SMS, chip-assisted protection, Display Eye care setting, Truely worth of price satisfied with its features. Competes well with other top branded phones."
5,"Been using it for a few days and specs really hold up. I had just bought this as it was good value for money phone I could find with 4GB+64GB. But after using it, I realized the other features like the display, battery backup and camera are all great. Screen is highlight!"
5,"I was slightly skeptical about buying Tecno but after seeing my friends use it, I went ahead. After using it for a few days I realized why Tecno is so popular. I was never into clicking pictures, but after seeing the camera in this phone, I have begun trying my hand at photography. I feel the phone does the job more than I do. Best camera ever."
5,"I loved the camera on this phone. You can check from the pictures in my review that how amazing pictures you are able to click. This phone has a whooping 89.5% of screen to body ratio. I'm a huge gaming buff and watch a lot of movies and series. The big screen is such a delight to watch on. Also, the 180hz processor makes gaming smooth. Overall, I love this phone."
5,"I bought the phone after a lot of research,as i wanted a value for money all rounder and boy there are so many options...This one has it allLOOKS -9/10 -Looks stylish,suave,upmarket and yet simple.CAMERA- 9.5/10 - Fantastic camera at this price , both pictures and videos are amazing with great ai featuresBattery,Display - 9/10Go for it if you want a vfm all rounderCONS-1.Not really a con but it has single front flash whereas the specs mentions dual front flash,so though usage wise it's not at all an issue but you expect better communication.OVERALL-9.5/10 -- GO FOR IT!!!"
1,"Not dual front flash,Only single flash"
4,"Amazing finishing, great speed worth for money."
5,The phone works well without any performance issues like time lags or apps hanging midway. The screen resolution is excellent and gives a crisp viewing experience with bright colours and good clarity. The camera has an excellent resolution and is able to take equally vivid photographs during day and night-time. I would absolutely recommend this phone to anyone who’s looking for a seamless experience at value-for- money prices.
5,"After a month use:Happy With:-Battery Life: one time charge for more than 1 Day- camera quality: 100% satisfied with the photos with good detail- Screen good for watching movies netflix, watched all episodes of Family Man 2 on this phone. Brightness and good color- so many colorful theme options"
5,"This phone is super cool, and I think 'xiaomi' , 'oppo' or 'vivo' like brands will not provide such a phone for even 16K bucks.Its a super gaming smartphone. The battery life is awesome. The phone doesn't heat even if you play games for 6 hours (I'd tried playing about 4 hours myself, and the result surprised me) . Even all the features are of superior quality. The camera is like samsung galaxy worth 45K bucks. There is such a huge amount of features I can't even state here. Suggesting everyone to buy. 😇😇😇😄😄"
5,"I was the first person to buy a Tecno in my family. And once, others saw the performance, this is the third Tecno phone. And as usual, Spark 7 pro also hit the bull's eye in terms of value for money. The camera works amazingly video calls and even for clicking pictures in the night. Best buy ever!"
4,Nice mobile to use that. Back camara excellent. Front cam not bad. Need to improve some settings. In Mobile hotspot settings not able to manage connections.Have a good battery. But slow charging.
5,"I urgently needed a phone and I bought this phone after being recommended by a friend. It seems to have everything in it. Amazing AI camera, long battery, great display etc. Moreover, it's Andriod 11. What more can I ask for? Check the pictures I posted. The camera captures great light and has sharpness. I am a happy Tecno customer."
1,Please if you found delivery by appario private limited... Please don't buy... I got 2nd hand mobile and returned. Mobile is okay okay... But I will recommend to you go with redmi not 9... Looks great... This techno looks like dagar.....youtube videos not looks good.
5,"I love the specs. I had just bought this as it was cheapest phone I could find with 4GB+64GB. But after I recieved it, I realized the other features like the display, battery back and camera are all amazing. This phone is clearly the best phone for 10k."
4,Good Mobile Phone

5,I wanted a gaming phone and all the other options were very expensive. I went for this and I think I have had the smoothest gaming experience ever. I face no issues like heating up and lagging. It feels like any game on this is a cakewalk. The battery also supports several hours of gaming.
5,Budget
4,"I've been using this phone for 4days now.I will share my review with pros and cons:cons:1.It feel like a cheap phone idk why,there are some phones in this price segment ""looks"" premium.2.No LED notification,a major missing.3.Rear Camera is not that good in default,but when we changed to 48MP it looks ""kinda"" good.It seems like good in this price segment.4.Its little bit getting Hot while charging and I feel some Hottnes while taking photos(maybe coz of outside temperature)5.It takes quite a bit to get fully charged,yah the battery is 6000 but its fast charging with 18W.6.so much pre installed apps(we can uninstall it) and also like previously,we have to go through each app to disable ""Recommendations""Pros:1.Very light weight and it doesn't feel a massive 6000 is inside2.Front camera is Superb! good detailed pics in portrait.3.Battery is so good.I use the phone to take a lot of pictures and use it for 1 hr swiping through Instagram,the battery doesn't notice that at all lol(its pretty good)4.Stereo speaker does that job GOOD5.For games,ya with a medium settings it is good for 1hr continuous gaming after that it gets little hot but there is no overheating like that issue till now.This is all I can remember,I will try to update if I notice it afterwards."
3,"Redmi 9 Power Electric Green (4+128)(FIRST 24-HOURS REVIEW)• A phone with Superb Design and unique colours• I have purchased electric green colour and believe it is really superB in looks• Heavy in weight but its okey as it looks fine in hands• Dual stereo speakers with ultimate sound quality!! BUT BUT BUT !!• Redmi claimed 6000mAh Battery, means we think that it will go through atlest ""1 & Half day to 2 days"" of battery backup in one charge, But there is nothing like that.• The Battery will Last go to 1 day of maximum backup only if limited use.(I charged the phone full in last evening by 7pm and its 1 pm today righ now and it is 55% left with no use as i am using it as a secondary phone, means the Remaining 55% battery will last longer to 11pm. The total battery backup without use of phone will go to 28 Hours, as i am using it as a secondary phone with no whatsapp, youtube or any kind of internet surfing with this phone)• It means if u want to use it as a primary phone with whatsapp, youtube, and other internet features then i dont think so that it can give 1 day backup• Redmi claimed 22W Fast Charger with it, apart from it while using its own 22W fast charger it takes more then enough time to charge(It takes time to Charge full)• Camera quality is like hell, specially the front camera, Don't buy if u wants a Camera Quality in Mid Range phoneSummary:-Purchase it if u want as a secondary phonePurchase it if u want super outer looks with ultimate colour optionsPurchase it if u dont want good selfie camera quality (According to price range)Purchase it if u want a Good Looking Attractive Phone"
1,"Very Disappointed by the product. Camera quality is too bad. The only one thing is in phone is it has 6000mah Battery. Overall this product is very worst. Don't buy if you are looking it as a primary phone which has best camera, Storage & massive battery."
1,"Honest review after a week of usage -Do not make the mistake of buying this mobile. While the price point is competitive, it would make lot of sense to pay an extra 1000 and go for the Redmi Note 9 instead of Redmi 9 Power.This mobile has pathetic camera quality. It says 48 MP camera, but the quality is as good as 8 or 13 MP camera. Redmi note 9 having the same camera gives far better quality images. I am truly disappointed with the camera quality.So do not go on the Megapixels. This mobile honestly has very bad camera quality.The performance is OK. A snapdragon octacore processor does not do any justice as I have experienced good amount of lags while opening basic apps.The battery back up is good, but apart from that, there is nothing special about this phone.I regret buying this in the flash sale."
4,Ok Product
1,"Camera is very worst, In indoor lighting pictures are getting blurred, Front camera is something like 4 years back quality because it has only 8MP.When coming to back camera even with 48MP, photos are not clear.My suggestion is not to purchase this mobile, if you can bare 1000/- more, best choice is Redmi note9 or you can purchase realme phones with in this budget.I tried to return the product due to camera quality not expected, but return will not take return back due to quality issue for mobile phone.I purchased many Mobiles, but this is my first worst experience.So please don't by this mobile 🙏🙏🙏🙏"
1,"I bought Redmi 9 power blue (128 GB) in the first sale on 22nd Dec 2020.Amazon delivered it very speedy on 23rd Dec 2020.Reviews:1) Camera: Average for both front and back cameras.2) Sound: Good3) Battery: Drained very fastly, even charging is a bit slower, not looks like 6000 mah.4) Processor: slow processing and sometimes hang also. And touch is also responding slow.5) Games: I didn't try much yet.6) Weight: BulkyI bought it because of the camera but a little bit disappointed with it."
1,Front camera is very poor for video calling. Sometime screen goes totally white on video calling like hanging problems.Its looking dark face.Also battery is not according to expectation as 6000mAH. Battery showing 20% and suddenly goes 80%without charging.

3,"I bought this mobile on the first sale 22 Dec 128 gb version, coming to the phone the miui is the same we find in other mi devices which is the reason I bought the phone but one this which I miss the most in MIUI 12 is the absence of second space(why Mi ❓)Pros: Good battery, 48MP back camera and MIUi 12cons: front camera(my redmi note 5 does a better job), no second space, a bit bulky when you hold the phone"
1,"Battery do`t work as specified 6000 mah. worst camera result ever. even new theme or fonts don't work. battery drain to fast. very chip on weight,look,speaker,display many more, friends first time a request you to please do not buy this phone. company try to achieve their position high that's why they start to deliver this type of chip product to customer.  In my home 7 mobile is redmi but i never seen this type of chip mobile ever. i am so sad after purchase this mobile. I need to my money Back."
1,"Firstly got too late delivery from amazon, no response from customer care representative. The product is now totaly different like stock Android and cheap like oppo, Vivo Xiaomi lossing his market. Quality also not upto the mark. It gives low performance even many times the miui stop the apps. Very very bad feeling to order this mobile.On second day of delivery it stuck on bootAnd keep restarting again & again.lastly i had to format it and i lost my data of year &year.Shamfull xiaomi. DONT BUY xiaomi phone with MIUI 12 it is worst than worst"
5,Redmi mobile is having features what we essential requitred.I m very happy with the new model.So far it's very nice and value for my.Wil review after couple of days usage.
4,Its value for money but if you are a selfie person than no pictures are ok but not too good I love everything about it
3,"Average performanceEdit (after 1 year usage): no issues in daily tasks,While playing pubg and some calls it freezes and swithes off."
5,Awesome product. Like it❤️ 12k under best phone.Dual stereo speakers.Good camBattery backup ❤️💯Build quality 💯Design 💯Best choice 👍
1,Front facing camera is too bad....
1,Front camera on video call is showung dark face. Screen goes white like hanging problem.Battery goes 20%to 80% automatically.Its camera performance is very low.You can choose other option in same price like vivo.
2,"Front camera is third class. Rear camera's quality  is average.  Battary like  4000 mah. Wi fi, Hotspot,  Bluetooth touch key does not work properly.  There are no auto call record option and notification receive indicating  led. Only sound quality is very good. No return policy only replacement, so I am hopeless."
4,"Primary usage Suitable for battery, videos watching, storage 128GB like songs backup listening music offline with speaker HiRes 2 speakers one in top and one at bottom, splash resistant.If ur requirement is secondary like Camera 48mp camera with Snapdragon 662.Not for heavy games.Then its suits me well. 5 star.No phone for these specs at this price point."
2,"After a month use....Phone is just ordinary.  No effects of the memory options are noticed.  In fact it takes roughly 2 minutes to get to the main screen after power on.  Preloaded with 13-15 gb of system files and bloatware.  So you get to use only 49 GB effective storage place.The phone is like paying for our dish TV, you will be forced to watch a lot of advertising apps.A lot of personal information may be used, your mi id will be linked to phone, email, ip address, location etc.Earlier I used Lenovo p2 nothing of this, and was a great phone.Having said all bad things, the phone is good for sound, visual, and battery.  Camera is the worst part.If you are buying for a camera then this one is a bad choice.  Battery 🔋 and the sound is great.Too many bloatware, I suppose Redmi should pay attention.  Or we all should avoid the phone and the brand.Repair would be easy as Redmi has many service centers around the country.  Except battery and music I don't see any difference or advantage over other phones for routine activities.Overall very average phone 📱 which is priced on higher side."
1,The product is not upto the mark.It gives low performance even many times the miui  stop the apps and camera quality is also poor.
3,The product is very disappointed in the camera segment. Front and back both camera is worst. It is not as 48 mp camera .Battery backup is well as 6000 mah.only vedio can play up to 13 hours after that phone is dead.if you bye for a big battery only then you can bye this product.all so processor is not as helio g85.
4,"I have ordered blazing blue colur but i have recived black colour instead of blue,But still it is a wonderful phone at reasonable cost.Battery backup is awesome and camera is amazing.I highly recommend to buy this phone from these seller"
5,Chief and best
5,Nice phone
4,"The pros of this smartphone are1. fhd+ display2. good battery life ( 2.5 days+ if only used for calling and light use,  1.5 days for overall usage like YouTube, watsapp, google meet, music, calling and gaming)3. 18w fast charge and 22.5w charger in box ( 19 - 96% in 2 hours)4. less bloatware5. ufs storage6. Stereo speakersAnd cons are1) average processor.2) average camera. (Steady photos are very good but low light needs improvement)3) MIUI 12 is little laggy.4) little heavy.5) Speakers are not that loud but works very well.So only buy if you want good viewing experience, battery life , fast charging and 22.5 w charger."
1,Front camera 3rd class.
3,Just got the phone in hand and the phone started lagging the next day.1- Performance average.2- Camera Average.3- Bit heavy and bulky too u can feel that.4- Design poor or should i say worse.5- MIUI is worst.

5,"I am writing the review after use of about 1 day. I purchased it for my mother. She is very happy to have it. Aa she was earlier user of Samsung basic mobile and she used the mobile for about 6 years. So now she upgraded to smartphone of this brand because in her opinion Samsung mobiles are long lasting. In my opinion:-  Display- 4.5/5  Battery- 5/5  Camera- 5/5  Performance- 4/5  Look- 4/5  Value for money- 4.5/5Display is good and bright as usual Samsung display are always of better quality.  Sound is not best but okay. Look is good but need improvement in back design as it seems to be a cheap plastic material. Battery has no complaints. Camera specially front camera is surprisingly good. But performance should be improved as somtime touch is less responsive.so if you are multitasker and heavy user of mobile then itz not for you. but keeping the price in mind 7299 rs for 3gb ram and 32 gb storage its a fair deal as you are attached to Samsung brand which is better than cheap chinese mobiles like Mi, Oppo, etcPlz don't forget to like if fou find my review helpful 👍"
1,performance was very bad if I open the application that time hang my phone with in 3 seconds and when I rotate the video on landscape mode that time video has slowly moved
4,"Dont expect much from this phone, this is a average user phone, phone will be  lag if using more apps, but its decent for this price, value for money.  Best for Basic to Android upgraders."
1,"I ordered the phone as soon as it was launched. When I received the phone, the camera was not working properly. Everything was very blurry and phone was very slow.I placed a return request. I then received the replacement piece. Camera was working this time but after 1 day use, I noticed that nobody called me the whole day when I generally receive around 10 calls. When I tried calling from another number, it said that the number is out of coverage area when jio had good network reception and VoLTE was on. I have a placed a return request for second time now."
5,"Why did i purchased?1.For using wifi hotspot, instead of my primary phone2.To make or receive Emergency calls either from office or other personalsWhat did i liked most?1.Good Build quality2.Good Display, excellent quality3.Good signal reception, clear voice quality.4.economy price.5.Good Battery6.Latest operation system.7.Dolby atmos(good for music lovers)8.hotspotWhat makes you disappoint?Usb port should be ctype.Finally, what did you say?This is the excellent phone in this price range.Can be used as wifi hotspot and standby phone.This phone is only for basic usage like listening music, simple  voice calls, chatting, watching youtube, surfing net.Not recommended for gamers and heavy users.And display supports upto 720p only.Note:In initial setup, you may face lag and struck in youtube videos. But once after setup completed,restart  the phone.Everything  will get settled up."
3,"So I recieved the phone a few days back. And I will be using this phone as my primary phone. So I will keep this brief and almost to the point.Build quality- tacky looking, good, but can be improved for future budget phones. I got grey color, and it's not metallic, my mum says the rear looks like shahbadi floor tiles. Not an insult. Anyways I like it, but it's not metallic.Screen- personally, I am happy with it, touch feedback is nice too, but ofcourse not like 20k+ range phones.touch is very responsive in the calculator app.Battery- well 5000mah, good, it's quite more than necessary for me but good.Camera- macro camera- took a fair enough macro shot, 2mp. 3.2mp would have been a sweet spot in budget yet good quality. Front and main camera yet to test fully. Night time photos? Forget it. Honestly even most mid range phones don't fare well in night.Processor power- its not a powerful chip to begin with, but fine, I am going to manage with it. For others, the phone is a bit laggy/slow in some aspects..or most. Camera takes a good whole second or 2 to start, the viewfinder flow is not smooth and laggy/glitchy.but I like the wide and macro combination. SHOULD'VE BEEN 3.2MP :'(More apps= bit more lag while entering main menu. So the less no of apps, should suffice. I opened a bunch of apps, including 3 Google tabs in browser, and many apps, lag was not severe slowdown, but was a little slower than before or it's slow to begin with and didn't really have high expectations. Using the device care and/or restarting the phone did feel better and smoother, but took a good whole 7 to 10 seconds for the live wallpaper to load. Talking of wallpapers, even being samsing OneUI, there is no option for galaxy themes :(I am not gonna do any major gaming on this so I cannot say anything on it's regard, I prefer pc gaming. But don't expect much, however if you really want have a  experience where you'd feel better/happy with the purchase, I'd suggest playing classic games like Mario, crash bandicoot etc. Some game suggestions- Dadish, alto.I will update this review after a week/months use. And finally a half/full year update.If you have a budget of atleast 10k then I'd suggest buying some other samsung product or your preference. I've used the m31s and compared to this, that phone is way smooth, and many more models out there. But if you want a entry level phone, or coming from a feature phone, budget constraints, secondary phone. Then this is the phone to go with.  I personally like my m02 quite a bit."
1,"Phone is very slow& heats up quickly. I replace the first piece. Received the replacement the very next day, thanks to amazon. But the second handset was even worse as it got extremely heated even before it was set up completely. Returning it also."
1,"No wireless display as specified and camera not working evertime, quality is poor, even though 13mpixel, it's like VGA camera.. pictures are blur..please don't waste your money.."
3,Average Smartphone.....😵
4,"Mobile is good for simple use but pathetic camera , no fingerprint sensor and old processor which makes it slow for a phone in 2021 .  I purchased it as my secondry phone, display is really awesome and light weight with sleek design. For better deal opt for micromax IN 1B if you can compromise on display and will use as primary phone  .But the conclusion is samsung's quality and customer care cannot be compared with any other brand  in india .If you want a secondry phone then its a perfect choice at this price"
5,"At a first glance phone looks decent one. It has almost all the features except finger print but it's ok in this price range. Checked the sound quality, camera, internet speed. All seems to be fine. For a basic user it's a good choice. Will review further after using few more days."
5,The product is best value for money and only watch it as a budget smartphone
1,Performance and display is not as per standard. Pale display....it looka like a duplicate screen. Performance is so slow that even opening a calculator take 5sec of lag to open. It seems this phn is either refurbished version of some older phone. Samsung has not delivered such low standard phn till now.
1,"Reason to buy :1. Very stylish looks . u found a premium quality.2. Big display.3. Battery is good.Reason not to buy1. It's like a Scorpio with auto""s engine.App load time is long2. Camara just a scrap.3. Speaker is very very bad. Burst speaker.Over all don't buy this . if you don't want anything more than call nd need only a good looking ph then only buy or either go for poco c3,redmi 9a"
1,I have used 3 or 4 samsung phones with this price tag. But this phone model is disappointing me.I found below issues in the phone that i received from this seller. Not sure about other users.1. Call volume is low.2. Performance issue.3. Phone hangs in the middle without loading the website completely.4. Very heavy but ( i did not notice it when i ordered. This is my mistake).5. Call disconnection but not very frequently.There is no option for refund. But it has only exchange with the same model.I returned this mobile . Am waiting for replacement phone. Let us see how the new phone of same model works.
2,Good in screen size. Average phone in the price range. 👍Camera 📷 worst-: On the name of samsung it's very bad. 👎Battery🔋backup-: It's is good can run full day.👍Speed~RAM-: Don't even think of playing any game. It's lag vere very much even while playing Temple Run in 3gb variant.👎Memory management-: it's come with 32gb internal memory in with 10gb is allready consume by system software.👎Overall ~ If you are purchasing this phone for only calling purpose then go for it. 👍Don't think of playing a single 50-100Mb game u won't be able to play on this device 🙏
3,"Writing this review after couple of days of using. First I ordered this and received a slow item, then I replaced the item and thanks to Amazon I have received the replacement within 1 day. But, the replacement item is still slow. Hence, I have decided to return the item.PROS:1. Big Screen2. Huge Battery Life3. 3GB of RAM4. 32GB of Internal Storage6. Latest Android OSCONS:1. MediaTek Processor (after having 3GB of RAM, the phone takes 2 seconds to open Chrome and 1.5 seconds to open contact list)2. Hangs After Playing GamesVERDICT:You can go for this phone if you are looking for a secondary phone or you are gifting this to your parents. This phone is not for them who will watch movies, play games and hinging on social media apps."
5,* Display is very good* Battery Backup Excellent* Stylish Mobile* YouTube Videos playing without buffering
1,"Guys if you are looking for a smartphone Please do not buy this product. Reasons are given below1. Battery life is not upto the Mark even in power saving mode. Drained very fast in just 15 hrs. If you watch movie then ot will drain in 4 hrs only.2. Camera. Both front and rear camera are just like vga camera. No quality of Megapixels.3. Hangs a lot. Takes too much to unlock and don't have a fingerprint scanner as well. No facelock option.4. Many times it dont show the caller number on screen for 5 to 10 seconds.When you are working on it and someone calls you then only ringtone will play first and small icon will appear on the top after 5-10 seconds. Unknown no. by truecaller will show when you disconnect call.5. I have not installed any game as it hangs in normal operation.6. Screen width is not upto mark,as keys of keyboard come closer. You will feel uncomfortable while typing.7. Sound quality is low, as no proper music beats.8. When you are on call the screen automatically flash and touch enables.Samsung should recall this model. Worst ever phone. You can add 2000 more and can get better phone than this."
2,"Phone is little bit slow hanging in first start , below average camera quality both front and rear , plastic back but at this price point cant expect more. But we can expect good Qualcomm Snapdragon processor or exynos ...long charger wirePros - good battery not yet checked , bright and clear screen, latest update today via OTA,Cons- very small charger wire and it is unacceptable, below average camera, very slow phone , plastic cheap quality,I suggest spend bit more on good specification phone don't just go with Samsung..."
5,"Best smartphone in this prize,nice display, battery life best,but I want to more features like, screen shot and screen recorder too."
1,"First I was happy that Samsung rolled out a budget phone under 7000 Rs. but later got disappointed that we have to bear slow processor. The processor is quite slow and the phone started hanging as soon as I booted for the very first time. Along with this drawback, the display is very cheap when it comes to expecting a nice one from a brand like Samsung. I would suggest not to go with the brand value but see the specifications before you buy and don't make the mistake which I made."
4,"3/32gb variant @ 7299/- is good deal with samsung brand. Quad-core MediaTek MT6739 Processor is outdated & slow but adequate for basic usage. No lagging for whatsApp, fb, YouTube.  Display & Screen resolution is great as well as battery backup. 10W charger took more than 3.5hr for full charging. Cameras are average considering price point."
4,"This is my first personal Samsung phone, and what better model to start with! Using it for a week  now and everything is functioning as it should. Very good display, sound and maneuverability overall.  Only one thing :  The mobile's data cable could really have been a bit longer. Other than that the phone is working fine. The best thing is the 5000mAH battery,  which I am enjoying. :-) Truly  a value for money.Will update if I find any other significant matter in the coming days."
4,Product is just ok if you have another phone. I use iPhone n I took it as some apps have xtra features in android.Phone has a good battery. Processor is not good enough so it’s a little slagging. Design is good. Display is too bright if u hold it straight with ur eyes as it’s a tft lcd.  I hope in future updates mobile will become a little smoother.  It is very rare that you will get every update time to time in this price. But I am sure u r not going to get a better choice in this price. If you have money shortcomings you can consider it!!Have a nice day ahead!!
2,I ONLY USE FOR MAKING CALLS.WHATSAPP VIDEOS ONE OR TWO I SEE AT THE MAXIMUM.MOBILE LOOKS GOOD.NO ONE CAN TALK ILL ABOUT SAMSUNG DISPLAY OR CAMERA.AS USUAL BATTERY FAILS.IN THIS CASE ATTERY DRAINS EVERYDAY I NEED TO CHARGE EVENTHOUGH I DIDNOT PLAY ANY GAME OR SEE MEDIA.IF WE PUT FULL CHARGE ATLEAST IT SHOULD LAST FOR ONE FULL DAY.MORNING IF IT IS 100 PERCENT EVENING IT COMES AROUND 35 PERCENT.CURSE FOR SAMSUNG.
5,Best samsung mobile in this price category.Thank you Amazon.
2,"I would not recommend this product to any age group.This mobile has most slowest processor, even on first day you feel like you are operating crashed system.Go for bit higher prise product you Will not regret."
5,"If we compare the product quality with the price, definitely it is a value for money device for your daily usage.Battery life is very good, charging is a bit slow but ok.Look wise the phone gives a decent look from back side which can be increased by using back cover.Front side look is awsm.Screen size is good for gaming and movies, performance is great even in sunlight.Camera quality is absolutely fine.Definitely you can go for this having a branded logo on back."
5,A wonderful value for money! I had asked it as a extra side phone. It provides excellent prolonged battery life and beautiful design that doesn't get you off. The performance is obviously not as fast as premium phones in terms of speed if you want to use as a multi purpose phone. But basic apps just do all fine.
1,Defective Item was received.IMEI number is not displaying when dialing the required number.Requested for a refund but exchange partner has refused to collect it despite raising a request within 24 hours.Please check the seller on Amazon before purchasing your products.
3,The phone gets very hot with minimal use.Editing the review after the phone was replaced. This time got the right product and it works pretty well.Guess it was a faulty product to begin with. Happy with Amazon. Samsung needs to do their quality checks better.
5,Just amazing..Battery back up to video quality as well as net working and perform too fast..
5,"Very good budget phone with big screen. Support is only for 2.4ghz WiFi and not support 5ghz WiFi which user is missing compared to other manufacturers smartphone around same price range. Charger point is not so smooth to insert the charging pin and seems it might cause priblem after an year use, but need to see how it copes with."
5,One  of Best mobile phone in this range💪 truely💪awesome
3,After using this device for 5 days I can share some pros and consPros-1- Budget smartphone from Samsung at this price range.2- Screen is better in performance.3- 5000 mAh battery life stands upto 24 hours after watching videos for 5 hours and calling. (Couldn't play game)4- Picture quality is average.Cons-1- The device lags and sometimes hang on performing easy steps like shifting app to app.2- Multitask becomes difficult as it is slow in performance.3- Camera is not upto the mark.4- Doesn't feel premium while holding the phone.5- due to bigger battery the mobile feels heavy. (206 gms)6- Found bugs like-(1) Pressing power button takes time to wake and sleep the screen.(2) Home screen zooms upto 300% without activating.(3) Opening camera stucks for upto 5-10 sec sometimes.(Will update more if found)Thanks!
5,Good quality product.. working perfectly. No defects found on mobile. Good quality rear cameras and good quality front cameras. Good sound quality.  Good display quality . Light weight . Good touch sensitive. Designs and colours are good . In this price mobile  is good. Phone back Is made of plastic. Good performance ram no lag coming . Android 10 installed . After we connect internet  to phone we get updations of all. Totally good mobile. Total 10 gb is used in rom 22 gb Is balance.
1,Believe me guys don't make mistake you will regret. This phone hangs a lot even at normal task like opening notification panel or settings or receiving calls. Better go for other brands if you are tight with your budget they buy new Gionee phones Gionee F103 pro was my first phone there are some software update problem but except that everything runs much smoother than this M02 and note it this Gionee phone was 5 years old and still you can play COD in it. Even i have played pubg recently before it was ban. Now i ordered new mobile because i was getting battery issue in my Gionee handset and trusted Samsung but i got something more bad than previous phone.Don't buy it!
1,Pathetic performance of the phone. My father in law was using old redmi 3i for past many years. Since it's battery was almost gone i bought this useless mobile with weakest processor. Opening a dialer itself takes 3-4 seconds. I didn't imagine this like sluggishness of the mobile from Samsung. Better i would've gone with xiomi or realme. Wasted Rs.7500.. lets see how long will it work
4,"So I ordered this phone 20 days ago I guessAs i got a good exchange offer for my repaired handset i only paid 900.About the product-The screen quality is awesome at this price point, the battery is also promising, build quality is above average however it doesn’t offer fingerprint which is pretty basic even at this price.The main concern with this handset is the ram management on this one creates problem. The multitasking can’t be done fluently and yes it lags a bitTo me I purchased this handset for my 2.5 years old niece as she loves watching videos throughout the day. So for us it was a health purchase but for those who want to use this as a primary phone. Please increase your budget otherwise you will be irritated."
1,Very slow charging even though they mentioned fast charging it is not real.In 10 minutes time it charged only 3 points . I bought it another platform. They don't allowed return. When their claim fastcharging is wrong they have to allow return

5,Day to day performance of the phone is good*no heating*good charging speed and good back up*extremely light weight*very good screen quality*very fast in display fingerprint sensor*camera is also good but ois is not thereOverall I am happy it costed me 12740 considering all the offers available.
4,"I am writing this review after using this phone for about a month.No hanging issue, No hearing issue,Good camera for an ordinary user. Features are also best for an average user.All protection is provided with the phone including back cover and screen guard.Haven't tried gaming.You can easily migrate from your old phone to the new one using cloning app of OPPO.Color OS is very heavy and almost 4GB RAM is consumed at any point of time this includes my 83 installed apps.Final Verdict is ""A MUST BUY PHONE"""
5,"I must say it's a great product of Oppo comes with stylish look and good 48MP ai camera,slim and good looking phone with a 5000mh baterary.Happy with service of Amazon for a quick next day delivery"
5,"Previously I have been using Oppo F11. I was very impressed with that and I have decided to purchase this mobile on April 8 without any reviews as it was launched.The first most impressive feature is the battery management. Very very efficient battery management. Though I am not a game player, I use the mobile most of the time and with a very quick charging (full charge within an hour), the battery stays for me than a day easily. I have never tested the Low Battery Management system though.Camera. The 48 MP camera and the Portrait mode allows us to get the pictures which look very nice and even the video is of excellent quality.Light weight. The moment I took the mobile into my hands, the first thought that came into my mind is, ""I wouldn't even know if I have dropped the mobile somewhere"". Very light weight.Audio quality is good. Didn't observe any heating issues until now.Finger sensor and facial unlock are impressive.Cons.1. Felt price to be a bit more when compared to it's counterparts.2. Color OS is heavy and it comes with unnecessary baggage that occupies considerable amount of space.3. No inbuilt optimizers.Overall, am happy with my purchase."
3,"I ordered this mobile and from the same day it is giving me less talk time even if wifi is off.  If everything is good except the battery then it is worthless to buy this mobile which costed me around 18,000/ rupees.  because without good battery backup we can not use all mobile features. The camera was good. As per the product description, talk time should be 34 hours. But it is around 18 hours. If we play games or use YouTube it is less than then. I have initiated the replacement and waiting for my mobile to come. The replacement is not given at the time of the old mobile pickup.  my old mobile MI note6 pro was giving me more than 36 hours  backup that costed me 15,000/ rupess only at that time two years back.Overall, i will not recommend for this mobile, please people like me are looking for good battery backup. It has not notification light. Finger print is also not much effective."
1,"I will give you one star rating because. I am suffering automatic call recorder is not good this product.when I am record the call it's tell others also listen the ""your call has been recorded"" what is this meaning. This is worrest features in this mobile. I am searching every settings in the mobile there is no off that option. Give me suggest how to overcome this worrest feature?"

1,Battery Issue.... Phone is Heating during Charging and During Running Application.
1,Facing heating issue while using camera app and general usage in 60hz refresh rate if I use 120hz it gradually heating issue increase please solve this problem
5,"My first time buying a OnePlus phone and I really like the finish of the one. Camera is excellent, Android 11 is very smooth to use, functions are fast.Just my first day of usage so hard to be critical of anything. The downside for me is that there is no place expand the memory."
1,Within 10 minutes of usage. It’s felt like over heat. I can’t experienced any mobile like this.
2,"Iam OnePlus user since 4 years, I exchange my one Plus 7 pro mobile with OnePlus 9 R Not expected From One Plus, quality is not good, Look like cheep mobile, camera quality also not good, one Plus 7 pro superb mobile, totally iam disappointed with 9R."
1,I don't why no reviewer is speaking about it. It was heating with a normal usage.
5,After 5 days of usage writing this review.1. Best camera quality for the price2. Snapdragon 870 is doing its best in speed with 120Hz display. - Best3. 65W charger takes only 35 min to charge 100% from 15%. - Best4.  Fluid amoled display is awesome on its smoothness. - best5. Lake blue colour is simply awesome 💙Issues1. Facing very lite heating issue.2. Found a bug and informed OnePlus customer service which is if we turn on call recording on call it indicates opponent also that we are recording call. They told they will correct it in next update. Hope this will be cleared but not sure.I give 95/100 for this mobile.
4,"I am writing down this after using for a couple of days. I got the carbon black one with 12GB RAM.  Overall the device is good, and honestly is the reskin of one plus 8T with lower price 😁.  I will list down the pros and cons -pros -1. With Oxygen OS 11, the overall user experience is quite smooth. You will get an update as soon as you finish setup.2. The Warp 65 fast charging is fine, takes around 35 mins for one full charge.3. The screen to body ratio is good.4. The matt finish on the back side is awesome.Cons -1. Battery drains a little fast, not sure if some future updates will fix it.2. Rear Camera is ok, can be better.3. I would have preferred popup front camera, rather than the punch hole.4. For dual apps, I would have loved to see the option for all apps. Right now it has support for few.5. support for few more 5G bands will be good to have."
3,"Writing after 4 Days of use1. Heating Issues -you will start noticing from the very first use2. Battery - charges 0 to 100 in just 35-40 mins but also drains so fast. Need to Charges twice in a day after using whatsapp, some browsing, calling.3. Camera - Not very good. Less than as expected. Think twice before buying if you are camera enthusiastic.4. Smooth- 120hZ and 60hZ both condition works well. I found it smooth to use and open apps5. Snap 870 processor really works.6. Other Oneplus features works good.7. Not a flagship phone.Money and Decision is yours..!!Thanks"
3,"I have recieved this new phone yesterday. Since I have started using its been heating all the time, while on charge, playing games etc.. All other things are pretty good."
1,"OnePlus 9r is best of both world that you get from samsung and apple. I would rate full 5 stars for mobile except camera and heating issue. Also, the delivery experience while exchanging mobile turned out to be worst. Hence rating overall 1star for the bad and worst humiliated experience. Now I'm afraid to order again from Amazon."
1,"Worst phone by one plusHeating issues :yesBattery drain : yesPhone hang or crash : twice in a dayPhone needs a restart daily else it will stop working. Once it's restarted all settings changes to default.Dissatisfied, disappointed by one plus"
1,"HiPlease consider this message with a serious note the One Plus 9R which was bought on the above mention date got hanged and did not open exactly on the 13th day of buying it. The replacement policy was only for 10 days and my phone showed prblms from the 13th day. I took it to the One Plus Care Centre and they said it needed an update i waited for 3 days for the 'So Called' update to arrive but after 3 days the Care Centre informed me that this phone needed a Motherboard change when i ask them to replace the phone, they said that the care could not replace it for a new one because i had bought from amazon. They are now suggesting to replace it through amazon only. Is this what i bought a 40k One Plus phone for? If i can only tag the Oneplus company people in this!!!!!What kind of mobile phones do they sell???And also i want to claim a replacement of my phone from Amazon....i just dont care if the 10 days return policy is over.... I just want to say that i bought a 40k worth phone from you guys... And that it doesnt work...been waiting for more than 7 days now....with a ""Dabba"" phone in hand..... Is this the kind of service you provide??? I really would like you to have my phone replaced at the earliest Reply back soon......"
5,Review after 3 days usePros1) Build quality is awesome with aluminum frame and mate finish carbon black2) Display full HD+ Amoled screen display with 120hz refresh rate gives you the smooth experience3) The Snapdragon 870 processor will gives you good gaming experience4) Main camera is doing good performance with good picture quality and nightscape video is awesome and camera features were good5) usb-a to usb-c 65wat charger helps to full charge in 30 minCons1) It has heating issue after using phone for 40 min continuously2) Batery drain so fast as iam a heavy user it last me around 15 hours3) macro camera Is doing a worst performance
5,"An overall decent phone. The clean software experience would be the reason to choose this instead of Mi 11X or IQOO 7. Hardware wise it's more than capable. The camera I would say , is decent. It depends on your photography skills. The sensor specs only matter so much, I would say invest some time in learning photography. Check the photos attached. If you are a power user , this is one of the best value for money phones at this segment. For the custom rom folks , the kernel is open sourced, so in a year can expect decent ROM. I think IQOO bootloader is not unlocked so keep that in mind."
1,"First of all, it is hearing every time I use camera and play games. And picture quality is much below average. I previously owned Oneplus7 T and I had to sell that in order to buy this one. It was a wrong decision. The sensor is so bad and whenever I click a photo it is never detailed but only superfluous. I am disappointed."
1,Disappointed. This was my first purchase of oneplus phone and I was so eager to get a hand on it. But seriously there is need for improvement. Battery is like a candle as it is draining easily. Product has no premium finish. Also the display is not up-to the mark. They're claiming it as a gaming phone and sorry to say that you can't use it as a gaming device. Also the camera is average. Please don't go for it as there are lot of other good smartphones in the market with same set of features for 40k. Big no from my side. One plus Nord is better than this and I would recommend One plus should call back entire.  9R series.
5,From One plus 3Then One Plus 6And Now One Plus 9R...Always Launched and Booked😎😎😎No issues ever.
1,Battery issues
5,"As I'm a OnePlus user for more than 4 years now I purchased the OnePlus Plus 9 Pro on 30th March and loved it.And got the 9R for my sister and she loved this phone.I would say it's better to get 9R over 9 else buy the 9 Pro.Camera on the 9R is not as people are saying that it's bad. It's decent for the price. A normal person can't tell the difference btw.Screen is beautiful, phone looks premium."
5,"Okay, First of all, I was using oneplus 6 before and was planning for an upgrade, and eagerly waiting for 9 series. I decided to buy Oneplus 9 first, then I came to know that it wont have OIS stabilization. Then I planned to go for Oneplus 9 pro, but !! Insane heating issues and battery draining problem.Why should I waste money for such a phone, and finally I bought Oneplus 9r . Folks Hazzelblad is just a gimmick, Anybody using Oneplus 9R can get the same output using Google camera in OP9R !!Speakers are really good, Dolby Atmos, Cameras are above average+ , Super stable video mode gives you iPhone like stabilization, gaming is supercool, I bought 12/256 varient, and its super snappy, butter smooth. The only struggle I'm facing right now is the availability of accessories like tempered glass and back cases (official glass and cases are really expensive) , and we know this is a new model launched days before, so hopefully it'll sorted soon !!"
1,Worrest decision taken by OnePlus not providing 5G network bands in india. Only one 5G band in OnePlus 9R. Before they said we will provide other 5G by update. I want my money back. I will take legal action
5,"Review (8GB):This phone has very good performance. I ordered lake Blue its looking Stunning. love the device.Pros:=> Great performance/speed for SD 870 processor=> Battery life is fine=> Gesture control, Finger print scanner is nice=> Good cover provided with the phone, that really helpsCons:=> Heating while charging the phone. May be because of fast charge effect, OnePlus should look into this. After 100% charge, it automatically get cooled. no heating issueAs others are complaining there is=> No display tint issues=> No heating issues while using the phone, gaming etc. But noticed while charging=> No charging issues, within 10-15 mins 60-70% chargingRear Camera is good. Getting good pics in portrait mode. i will add few pictures soon."
1,"I just switched from OP6.Unlike when I brought the OP6, when I had zero complaints. I'm having many issues with the OP9R from day one.Things to note:1. The display has some major issues, there's an off-axis pinkish tint to whites and grays, which is quite annoying, and almost all the devices seem to affected with this as per OnePlus forums.2. The Camera are just mediocre, and I find the OP9 Camera much better than this. Even though OP9 lacks OIS, it almost always catches better pics and has better focus and stabilization in videos. Like MKBHD said, the Macro and Monochrome sensors are just garbage.3. The whole of the phone, particularly the backplate vibrates on playing sounds, it's pretty annoying and makes the phone feel cheap.Good stuff:1. Warp Charging is unbelievably fast.2. Other than the off-axis color shift, it's a great display.3. The phone is very snappy, added to the 120Hz display gives it a very confident smoothness.Overall:I think OnePlus put very little effort to this phone, as if they made it just to satisfy the Indian customers to complement the OnePlus 9 series. Their quality control seems to be quite bad, as OnePlus forums is full with issues with this device. I have a very unpopular suggestion, buy the OnePlus 9, it's only 7K more (SBI Credit Card). You get a newer and efficient Chipset, a substantially better camera. Having OIS gives no seeming advantage to OnePlus 9."
1,"I got a defective phone, it is struggling in moderate to weak network areas. Data Speeds are not even 20kbps. Highly disappointed. As the pic depicts, mobile data error icon can be seen 90% of my day usage. It is very weird. I switched from samsung a50 to OnePlus. it gave me excellent data speeds even in poor network area. I will update my review after one month."
1,Got a defective product and amazon is not ready to exchange it saying please contact manufacturer for warranty.
5,"The OnePlus 9R is a fair proposition in terms of the phone's pricing. For Rs 39,999, I get great performance, along with a very fluid and clean software experience. The photography, especially in low light, might not be spectacular, but it's still pretty good. Fast charging, decent battery life, and an attractive design contribute to the OnePlus 9R being a great purchase decision."
5,"Ordered Carbon Black; 12GB+256GB variant.Recieved a day early, on 19 April 2021.First Day Review:This phone is basically an 8T but with a Snapdragon 870, at a lower cost, but that doesnt mean they skimped on quality.So far from 1 day of use, this phone has been incredibly snappy and intuitive. Switching over from a Galaxy Note 8 was a piece of cake, although it took a good few hours to transfer the data.Charging is really quick as you would expect from a 65W WarpCharger.Camera quality is satisfactory in Auto mode, and gets better in Pro Mode with manual control.Speakers are loud and clear, and there is enough stereo seperation that it doesnt feel too unbalanced.Screen gets really bright and colours are accurate, haven't run into any rainbowing, Black Crush or Purple tinting issues. The 120Hz refresh rate also adds to the snappiness feel of the phone.Gaming is really enjoyable, especially those game that take advantage of the features like haptic feedback in COD Mobile. Speaking of which, the haptic motor (vibration) feels super crisp and tight, giving it a premium experience.I had gone for the Carbon Black, and the matte finish on the back glass is exactly what I had hoped for, and the matte finish also has an advantage of repelling fingerprints.So far the phone has been awesome, and I recommend it 10/10.Will update this review if I notice anything off :)"
4,"The only reason I went for Oneplus 9R is that I have been using Oneplus 5T from last 3+ years, the phone is perfectly fine till now and I always wanted to go with Oneplus for the upgrade after using Oneplus 5T and for its great user experience.Coming to the Oneplus 9R, I am not totally satisfied with the phone as I had higher expectations on Oneplus 9R. With the given features and upgrades I feel the phone is not doing so great. When you compare this phones with the similar range of phones from other brands you will have different opinions and thoughts.Pros:- Display quality is very good, with Fluid AMOLED Display and 120 Hz refresh rate display it is buttery smooth- Built quality is great, with aluminum body and Front and back Gorilla Glass 5 protection. Feels premium in hand- Phone speakers are doing well, sound is crisp, loud and with more details- Handset microphone is also great, Can hear the exact voice of the caller and it's clear and loud- Performance - Qualcomm 870 Chipset is doing well, phone is running smooth with no lags so far.- Front camera is good if you compare with other 16MP sensors on other phones.- As usual clean UI experience with Oxygen 11 OS.Cons:- Minor heating issues.  Felt phone was heating up during initial setup, while moving the files from old phone to new one. first 2-3 days felt phone is getting warmer with normal usage aslo and during the time of charging. I feel the heating issues resolved after receiving the first OS update or who knows the phone might be settling down after few days of usage.- Primary camera(s) is not up to the mark, photos can be seen only better in pro mode, videos are little better and front camera is OK. Lots of additional and unnatural colors are being added to the shot. There is no much clarity when you zoom and no details and images are scattered. Camera is not good with the hype which Oneplus created.  I wish Oneplus would be able to fix the camera issues with some good updates if hardware supports and if not then that's it.-Battery backup - Battery drains very quickly with the 120Hz refresh on, battery lasts only for 1 day with full charge and optimal usage. But the good thing is, it charges very quickly as well with 65W Warp charger. from 6 to 100 % took 49 minutes to charge.Overall, if you want to go with the display and performance other then Camera quality and some other issues which I highlighted, then you can go for it and if you are an Oneplus fan.NOTE: Whoever wants good Camera, they might think twice before purchasing this phone. You will get way better camera phones than Oneplus 9R under 40K (38 with discount)."
2,"OnePlus did a blunder with this one. Battery quality is very bad. And it's charging very slow. I'm not sure it's some unit problem or software issue, so I've requested a replacement, but it states over 1 hour to full charge when it's already charged 60%. The charging rate is very low as well, and battery deplete very fast, I can say it depletes faster than it's charging rate.Screen quality is great.Sound quality isn't very good either, it has very less max volume, I literally had to keep it at full volume always for a decent sound.As for heating issues, as everyone else is stating, it's over heating a lot! While normal usage it overheats, let alone any power playing.Honestly, I feel OnePlus made a blunder here. I was really looking forward to this device. Let's see how the replacement unit feels.Edit - battery seem to be performing better after replacement. However, still have issues like overheating and speaker sound."
4,"I have an OnePlus 3 and an One plus 8 and this this my third purchase of an oneplus phone in the family.A bit disappointed to hold the phone at first after using OnePlus 8 for almost a year now. First, the lack of curved edges deprives you of a smooth navigation gestures especially with the cover on. Further, it is not the slimmest phone in this price catagory. But not so heavy.Full marks to the Super-AMOLED display, which is super cool and crisp. Even in broad sunlight, it is visible because of the 1,100 nits it offers. Build quality is very premium. Ergonomically well designed. Perfect for one-handed opraration. The front and rear is of corning gorilla glass 5 and the frame is metal (where as for the OnePlus 9 the frame and rear are of plastic!!) Lucky me! So it looks very elegant. But no IP rating for water proof is disappointing. But company says it is water proof. The insulation in the SIM tray is an evidence.The phone is superfast with a great sensitivity for touch and swipe gestures with the Snap Dragon 870 processor. 120 hz refresh rate is super smooth. Gamers would love it with a top-notch haptics (vibration features) and with the 244 hz touch sampling rate.Battery charging is very fast too. The juice holds up for quite long because of the better power management by the latest processor and the LLDR 5 RAM. Delightful!! Occassional warming yes during heavy games. That's normal. Camera is decent. Front camera is 16 MP should be a 32 in this price range. Avoid beautification option as you may look like a cartoon. Rear camera takes above average photos in day light. But below average during low light/ nights especially the wide angle camera. But it has optical image stabilisation even the OnePlus 9 doesn't have that. So shaky hand fellows don't worry for the blur. Videos are of best quality. Best in this category. With a good video editor and skill you can make cinema like videos but the stabilisation is not-so-good in the nights.Stereo speakers are of very good quality. It is loud and doesn't crack even at high volumes. Call quality is decent. Not comparable with iPhones though. And Dolby audio is very enjoyable with headphones. With a good quality earphones/ headsets, I assure it is not less than a immersive audio experience especially for games.'Flip to mute' and 'raise the phone to answer' features are missing. Don't know why. It is just a OnePlus 8T with a good looking rear camera console with Rs.3000 less. Even the cover of 8T suits perfectly on this.So overall I am satisfied if not delighted. My OnePlus 8 is still better I feel. But this is the best in this price range. Better than the vivo x60, Mi11X pro or even the samsung S20 FE especially for the build quality and the premium feel it gives. Also the oxygen OS is best out of all android OS'. Also the in-display finger print sensor and the face unlock, I have not experienced  anything faster, prompter and more acuurate in recent times with anyother gadgets!! But the phone has only one 5G band. Suggest not to use the cover supplied with the box. It gives a kinda smoky look and makes the phone look bulky. But withstands accident falls. I have ordered the sandstone bumper case from the OnePlus store. Lake blue colour variant is awesome. Best of all the colors of all the OnePlus phones till today in my opinion. Catches not much finger prints or smudges like the 8 series. Scratch proof. Phone comes with a pre-applied scratch gaurd sticker. So no extra purchase required. Charging cable is a bit shorter than OnePlus 8. Type C charger with 65W charging adapter. 0 to 100 in 50 minutes. One significant change here is the data transfer to and from computer is quite faster than my OnePlus 8 also using OTG. Adaptive brightness they have got it right this time. In previous Oneplus devices, it was irritating. I have become loyal to OnePlus because the life of OnePlus phones is quite long compared to any other leading brands. My OnePlus 3 still stands formidable after 5 years. One star less just for the absense of curved edges display and a not-so-slim thickness. Else this phone is very good. Though corner of my mind says the price should be 10% lesser.P. S.Not encountered any overheating or battery draining issues as highlighted by some users. May be because I bought the phone after the release of first software update  and updated before writing this review. If you are not a fan of flagship processors and not a gamer, go for the OPPO F19 Pro with half of this price. Slimmer, lighter and with 3.5 mm jack."
1,Worst camera...  even a sub-10k phone will beat this phone in camera segment.I never expected such poor quality camera in a flagship killer brand..... first and last OnePlus phone. Congratulations for losing your customer.
1,Heats like hell. Initial set up heats up mobile.. 7nable to hold even after using a back case.. Same with games/camera/video streaming apps. Difficult to hold in hand. Needs an urgent fix.
4,"I have been using Realme 2 pro for the past 2 and half years and I felt like I needed a upgrade and bought OnePlus 9R, have to say it's a worthy upgrade and the speed is amazing. Everything is super fast and 120hz refresh rate is cherry on the top. Camera is okaish nothing that great. There are some heating here and there while using apps. Battery is okay as well. If you are using heavily it will not last you for a day, with normal usage it will easily last for a day. Also the phone fully charges in 40 minutes thanks to the 65w fast charging. OxygenOs is good nothing that great. There are lots of booklets inside the box, I hope next time OnePlus reduce that and instead add a usb c to 3.5mm jack adaptor. This is the first time I am using a OnePlus phone and I am really enjoying every moment of it and I would recommend this phone to everyone who is planning on upgrading their phone."
1,"I never expected that OnePlus phones will be having heating issue. With my device OnePlus 9R 12GB, I faced this issue and highly disappointed 😞. I even bought OnePlus Buds Z as well and Bluetooth droops very often."
1,"Just recieved latest flagship phone but disappointed with quality of product at 39k price tag. It's heating up within use of 30 mints even when it gets charged up completely. Batery draining in short time even with normal use of watsapp, accessing mails. Weirdest things I have noticed that you feel the sound viberation from back side when while calling to someone and it's wrost when you play music. It give you a feel poor quality product."
3,"Here's my final review after more than one month of continuos usage of this phone.Charging speed: 5⭐Display : 5⭐Touch response and feel : 5⭐  120 hz display feels and looks butter smooth.Battery life: 3⭐ (Even in 60 hz refresh rate, battery doesn't last for a day).Back Camera (in daylight):  3⭐ (because of very bad skin colour reproduction)Back Camera (in night): 5⭐Front camera: 2⭐ (my Mi A3 takes way better selfies).Ui and themes: 5⭐Fingerprint reader: 5⭐Audio quality (Call/Music): 4.5⭐Performance: 2.5⭐ (heats up really fast).Build quality and looks : 5⭐(it won't break easily if fallen accidentally.)Internet speed : 5⭐"
1,Extremely worst battery.. battery drain s very quickly.. mobile also average camera
1,Phone was getting heat when charging and continuse use for 30m any application not expected this from brand like One plus.
5,"Review after 7 days of extensive usage. • I would say the performance you are going to get one oneplus and that OxygenOS touch you gonna get from knowhere. It's too smooth to handle after using this you'll find thise ""IOS"" devices are lagging cuz they aren't having 120 Hz display even the price for iphone 12 is almost double the price of oneplus 9R.Pros: • Snapdragon 870 which is smooth as hell either it be for video editing and redndering or it be for playing games. Even the ""Call of Duty"" runs like water buttery smooth at max fps. • Tested this device while playing games on it like COD/Free Fire with max Resolution and FOS and would say thermals are very good it won't heat up after almost an hor of gaming temp was still maintained to be as 40°C in a Non AC room. • Video Stability and recording best in the market if you turn night mode on even in the dark scenes it is well lit up no one can guess it was shooted in night. Video potrait is best for content creater the bokeh effect is mouth watering for the content creators the bokeh youll get is as similar as you'll get in a dslr camera but the surrounding should be well lit up. • Oxygen OS it is the best operating system I've seen on an Android device unlike other OS available for Android. • User interface is best thing of oneplus devices you can't get rid of it's addiction even you'll start hating IOS 😅 not actually but it's the best UI I've ever used • You'll get 5g support so you don't need to worry about future upgrades. This will work smooth. • Design and placement of Camera Module is the best the oneplus have done ever while it's completely subjective, but youll get 🦍 Glass 5 protection on front and back along with a aluminum chasis/side frame it's a well built device simply rigid and feels premium to hold. • Haptic is best in the price range. • Dua Dolby Stereo Speakers make it loud enough to consume your content at any place • Full day power just in few minutes this device comes with a 65W wrap charge which will charge your device in just the time span of 30/35 mins. You'll never fall short of power either it be powerful performance or the power interms of battery. • Oneplus's Fluid Amoled display is best screen I've ever seen smooth responsive and vivid best for Netflix, lovers xD.Cons: • There are some bugs oneplus need to solve it as it isn't justified for this kind of flagship devices. I'm mentioning few of them oneplus pls act accordingly. • While using YouTube  the framerate drops I don't know it's a google fault or what but even the notification bar seem to be freezing while scrolling down as to like 90fps. There are few more applications like Google photos application which I've discovered uptil now. • Phone get warms outside it might be due to the electronic devices catch too much of heat radiations from Sun rays. • Oneplus pls provide One-Hand mode as soon as possible as the device is having a large form factor it's quite not possible for using the device single handedly even if I am having really large palms and long fingers indeed, I am just thinking anout those girls having small cute palms and fingers💅🤣😅. • Now jumping to camera section one plus needs to work on the picture capturing algorithm the problems faced were like... • 1) Sometime captures undersaturated photos in potrait and 2x Zoom mode. • Need to work on the algorithm of focusing as it hunts for focus sometimes in the darker. • Basically Camera needed to be well optimized by oneplus in few aspects rather say camera performance is awesome just few bugs are needed to be solved. I've attached few pictures you can refer to those.Conclusion: • If you want a well built phone with best processing speeds and Video Capabilities you can opt for it it's is the best device in my terms under 50k budget but few bugs and improvisation are required & I hope Oneplus will donit sooner or later.Thanks for reading my review."
4,good batter backupgood cameragood mob designno any issue
4,"Hi all,As I have bought redmi note 9 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this.I would give  you my honest experience..I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons  of this phone,1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 2 hrs.2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of redmi note 9 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.6.sound is average,So it's my honest feedback after using it for 4 days. I really feel disappointed.( In battery, camera, display, Sound)Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.Thanks 👍"
5,"Super camera, battery, sound amazing  very much"
3,"Bought Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black) in 1st sale, using it extensively. Read my review, if you are planning to buy one.EDIT: 1. Updating review for using more than a month, facing some strange battery drain issue, battery is not lasting even for a day. Once, fully charged, it automatically gets decreased by 5-10% without doing anything.2. For daily usage screen size feels too big, not easily manageable, also device is bulky.--------------------------------Pros:1.  48MP Quad Camera (with Samsung GM2 Sensor) captures amazing pictures, both outdoor as well as indoor.- Even in low light conditions, photo looks cool.- Selfie looks more natural, not over beautification like oppo,vivo.2.  6.67 inch FHD+ dot display looks good.3.  Dedicated Memory card slot.4.  5020 mAH li-polymer battery - it easily lasts for more than a day with average usage.- With 18w charger, it takes less than 2 hrs for full charge.5.  P2i splash-proof nano-coating6.  Notification LED7.  IR Blaster*NavIC for navigation, but haven't noticed any difference than GPS.Cons:1.  60 Hz display (vs 90 Hz display of Realme 6) : Difference is noticable, while playing games.2.  For PUBG, RN9Pro frame rate setting limited to Ultra, on other hand, Realme6 supports up to Extreme.In short, Gaming is better on Realme 6 with MediaTek G90T.Final Verdict: If you want device with better battery performance, Redmi Note 9 Pro is gold choice.- For better display & gaming experience, get Realme 6.*Will edit review, after using few more days."
1,The phone is not supporting any kind of SD card and always asking to format the SD card. The medias and files of external storage keeps disappearing automatically without permission. the pictures clicked takes a lot of time in processing and couldnt be viewed instantly.
1,"Not good,Hang and some time show error many times in every app,Some feature problemOver all disappointing"
1,This mobile showing 1.5GB free ram only out of 4GB even I have not download a single app😡😡
1,Very bad quality heating charge very much
1,"Incoming receiver(voice call) has corrupted with in 20 days of purchase and couldn't talk or take the calls without keeping on speaker. Felt very upset, even though not using the phone for much time but the hardware got damaged.Really with much eager i have waited and i have purchased but with in time lost the interest  on this product and  some how hanging is there in the mobile. Please make sure of purchasing of this product and i'm an MI fan but not satisfied with this product"
3,"I'm giving this 3 stars because of the camera performance, I'm not a gaming fan only bought this mobile for battery n camera purpose, but camera disappoint a lot. They photos looks gud until you zoom in, there is no detailing what so ever. It has all the censors n may work gud, the only problem is that the software didn't work properly. This may be resolved in future updates, so please consider this before buying. I'm waiting for a stable Gcam support for this Note 9 pro. Will update my review if the problem get fixed."
1,"Xiaomi phone quality is detorerating gradually, after owning so many phones and suggesting others for their quality, but recently I am encountering issues in brand new phones. Mainly the proximity sensor issue is there. Display goes off when call someone or get call and it stays off entire duration of the call. Its annoying and frustrating."
2,"I am facing display retention problem, after using the display for about 30-60 minute the screen retain the picture, and I don't think it is a software issue. The display panel used in this device have a problem. So please mind the display before purchasing this device."
1,Touch problem and battery problem
3,"This phone promises lot but gives very less.Most Importantly 48mp option in camera modes.I didn't find much difference in normal mode and 48mp mode. Sometimes photos taken by 48mp are noisy, 48mp mode doesn't work well when strong ambient light present.Other issue is Google assistant. I tried many times to wake assistant with command Ok google, but it doesn't work only. I've set up everything in assistant which is essential to use voice assistance, but no usePlease don't feel heart broken, so far these two are the only drawbacks I found but I must say battery is just wow. With one full charge phone last almost 2 days with normal use. I was surprised. Camera also works well for 13k mobile. Except 48mp mode, maybe due to some software issues. Otherwise phones runs quite smoothly, load games & apps very quickly"
1,"I am disappointed with redmi note 9 pro products. I bought this phone on dated 25 may 2020. Today, 28/05/2020, the screen suddenly stopped working and phone automatically going to off. Voice not clear during the phone call. The phone doesn't get switch on after the screen display went off. This is a ridiculous product brand who only offers reasonable priced phone but quality is so poor and services are worst. I am not able to contact their team. The product is still under warranty. I an suggestion no one purchase this product"
5,Awesome phoneCamera is goodBattery backup is goodDisplay quality goodAnd performance as per processor is awesome as MI is best in that
5,"Superb phone. Awesome camera, battery, processor, & speed"
1,The phone Restarts automatically if you call more than 15 mins.
1,"This phone is worst. It's been only 8 days , the phone is lagging a lot. I have made a new space in phone for my office workplace so on switching it takes around 1 min.Sometimes,it gives a lag when I try to unlock through fingerprint, moreover frequently it restarts.I told this issue to Amazon people they told me to download the app to verify my issues, and they are saying that there no such issues they have report of it and when I asked them ki how much ram is in current usage they were not able to tell me because as I can check ram usage is around 70℅ and I dnt have enough apps in my phone. They have changed all the return policies and their service is worst."
5,I would suggest everyone to buy the product... I have purchased this in first sale at 12999₹ and is overall very satisfied till date at this price point.Pros:1. Massive battery backup2. Camera (Too good)3. Design4. Quich fingerprint scanner5. Top notch quality6. Very responsive and quick7. Pubg and counter strike is very  smooth8. Fells as a premium phoneCons:1. A little heavy due to huge battery2. Slow charging 18 watts (2 hours  approx) full charge3. Display performs a little less in  sunlight4. Little slippery (if used without  cover)Overall if compared to realme 5 pro and realme narzo with redmi note 9 pro it looks very premium and design is very good and wins in every aspect if charging is kept asideRealme only wins in charging capacity which provides 33 watts charger.Hope it helps👍
1,"it hangs, the camera does not open in the first instance always prompts to restart the mobile when opening the camera, battery does not last long as expected, needs to be charged everyday if its full charge in the morning it needs to be charge by 7 pm, without any games or any heavy usage. The screen goes blank after attending any call... seems like i got some defective piece and could not return the same coz of lockdown and still have not been able to show it to any service center, seems like i have wasted my hard earned money..."
1,I've taken this mobile by seeing product reviews on YouTube. But Device totally different from reviews. Too much heat and hanging. Battery drainage  are the problems O face now. I'm truly unsatisfied with the product. Delivery is ok.
1,"Note 9 pro is worst phone launched by MI till now, i bought this phone by trusting MI brand as i have used Redmi note 4 earlier which is a superb phone by MI.But in this Redmi Note 9 pro,  Xiaomi is making fool customers by by just changing the location of finger sensor at a wrong place (sideways).They say that camera is 48 Mp but when you take photos, there is nothing like 48 MP.Touch screen is too slow.Battery is 5020 mha but it is draining too fast. Nothing like 5020mha.Phone is too heavy to handle while you do multiple tasks while using the phone.Just a waste of money."
1,Worst cameras
5,🙏Thank You Amazon Employees👍🇮🇳For My Refund After 2 Months Because My Phone Was Not Working Properly ...But This Was A Great Phone I'm Thinking About Buying This Phone Again Next Sale Unfortunately I'll Have To Pay 1 Thousand Extra To Bad I Would Have Gotten Exchange Unit But This Lockdown I Couldn't....But I Still Thank All Amazon Employees  For Understanding & Helping Us Out With Our Problem's May God Bless You All With Good Health & Fitness 👍🇮🇳🙏 🙏🇮🇳I Have Trust In Amazon 🙏🛰️📡  🇮🇳👍#1Amazon #1👍🇮🇳
1,Don't buy 4GB version bcz too slow and if u use 3 or 4 application mobile stuck and some time restart automatically....Camera picture quality OK but night time not good and camera app response also slow other wise mobile NYC battery backup and big screen all super expect camera responses and software hanging problems
1,Because redmi note 9 pro doesn't proper working
1,Defective item it automatically restarts
3,"The way youtube took us by storm by claiming it to have a solid and premium build quality. I was amazed. But soon after I ordered and received the product, I realized that the screen has a gradiant grey shading from the bottom. The glass quality doesn't look like the ones we have in premium phones. I wonder if Corning Gorilla Glass is also made as per grade and different rates. To sum it up you get a considerable product better go for Samsung M21 and thank me later."
3,"The front camera size on the screen is too big , Mi should  work on this  ,It is the issue  ,, otherwise Good phone comparing to other brands"
1,"Very bad experience,so much hanging phone , heating issues also ,bad colours effect display"
5,"Display size getup awesome. Battery performance, charging time, sound quality are also good. No heating issue.  I am unhappy for not having optical zoom of 48 mp camera.  At last Thnx Amazon for quick delivered & thanks Redmi for to bring a good quality mobile (Redmi note 9 pro) to the market."
5,Awesome phone....this is the very comfortable phone....price is no very costly..#Milove
3,"1. Awesome Build Quality and Design2. Camera is not best, just decent3. Fingerprint censor is amazing4. Display is good for offline contents, not that good for online contents like Netflix (no HDR)5. Battery is awesome6. Took 1 hr 45 mnts for full charge7. Gaming is good. but Note 8 pro is better in gaming8. Audio is awesome9. Delivery was fantastic"
3,I just purchased this phone after the lockdown. But that's my worst decision. Can you believe a new phone hanging like a 2 year old phone. Icons of home screen disappear suddenly. Camera is just like a 7k priced smartphone. Takes around 3 hours for full charge. Worst product by redmi till now( it's my first and last redmi phone)
5,"Writing this after a three day useTo start with uniqueness, the quad camera setup, NavIC, side mounted fingerprint sensor, haptic feedback, glassy finish all the factors makes the phone pretty cool.Camera - The phone produces very good images using the 3 sensors(depth, macro, wide) according to customisation along with the primary 48mp shooter. The image produced will be highly dependent on factors like light exposure, camera handling, mode selected etc. Video recording is available with EIS & 30 and 60fps. There is an option to record videos with movie scope. Overall 4.2/5NavIC - The ISRO developed positioning system adds more accuracy while navigating. I really liked it and its our country's technology. 5/5Design - The phone is packed with almost all sensors, no issues. The glassy finish, front and back gives the phone a premium look. Comes with Gorila Glass 5 protection in 3 layers. 4.5/5Dedicated external memory slot - no need to buy a 128gb variant fearing the limited storage, can expand storage upto 512gb. 5/5Network reception - i witnessed a commendable hike in download speed, so the NW reception is very good. 5/5MIUI - Yes there were some preinstalled stuff which can be uninstalled easily. About the annoying ads and notifications, they could be disabled with some settings(available on many internet blogs). There where some minute bugs, which i'd expect to be sorted out with the next UI update. 3.8/5Notch - The user can manage how the punch hole cam could appear according to his desire. I dont like to hide it, as it looks good for me. 4/5Processor - RAM - The qualcomm snapdragon 720g with 2.3ghz clock speed makes the phone more reliable and very smooth. The RAM was able to retain the cache of previously opened apps for a noticeable amount of time, so switching between the apps now and then is not an issue the Processor and RAM pulls it off easily. 4.3/5Speaker - earpiece - Both sound outputs are commendable. 4.3/5Type c USB & 3.5mm headphone jack - Type C cable along with 18w charger, charges the phone within 2 hours from 10% to 100% without any heating issues. 33W adapter can obviously charge the device even faster, but it's not provided in the box. 4/5Battery - With a whopping 5020mah battery a moderate user can use the device for more than 1.5days with one time full charging. 5/5Notification light - It was nice to see the notification light available. After stuffing so many sensors they did not forget to add that, appreciate that. 5/5Gaming experience -  I'm not a mobile gamer, so refresh rate is not a concern to me. Still the qualcomm snapdragon 720g processor can easily handle games like PUBG or COD with HDR graphics.I havent faced any kind of heating issues nor lags while using the camera.Overall it's a very good phone, for this price range it is packed with commendable features and no compromise with the sensors."
4,"i am giving honest review after 2 months of useageif you are very specifically looking for gamming dont go for it better afford realme 6if  you want for normal office work or you are college going students then its one of the best choicevalue of money is perfect in all aspect except the camera quality .<you have to compramise for camera a bit for its other features>.i personally like big displays so display was exelent for meby mistake it fell from my hand from around 6 feet height while calling but there was not a single mark or display issue so protection is really niceother features like ir blaster, alexa , fingerprint sensor , face unlock , processor , looks are awesomeoverall its worth going for at this price range"
1,"Ok so, this is a honest review. Plz don't go for the 4gb ram. This phone is probably built for 6gb ram. Coz it's slow. I got the 4gb, actually wrong product color as I ordered black, I got blue. The camera is actually amazing. But the phone is reeeeeeeallly sloooow. After unlocking the apps load so slow it's annoying and really sad that such a good specs phone sucks so much. So I'd say don't go for the 4gb one. And I haven't used the 6gb variant so I donno if it's slow too. But mine is really irritating. Not happy. But the camera is bomb and that I can't deny. Fingerprint reader is also fine, Not as good as realme sensor but it's fine."
1,"I hate this product..phone battery not working properly and heating and I am trying to return this product but this is not returning ,saying to install a amazon checkup app and that app is also not working. It's a unfair means of marketing. Amazon is doing fraud. Don't buy mobiles from amazon"
3,"The only thing I like about the phone is the side mounted fingerprint sensor. It's even faster than my Samsung tab s5e.Now comes the bad parts...1. As has been pointed out by other customers, Internet download speed is very slow (never reaches 2Mbps). My 4 years old Lenovo downloads the same file at 4Mbps using the same service provider at the same time.2. I'm not much into ""Mobile Photography"" but the picture quality is horrible. It becomes better with camera apps from Play Store(which doesn't give me control over the three other non primary lenses)3. This is my first time using an MI phone and the ads are annoying af. Can't turn them off too.4. The gesture controls are very uncomfortable. They can learn this from samsung.5. I don't know if this has happened to anyone but I actually ordered the black variant but was sent the blue one. It's written as ""Interstellar Black"" on the box but inside was the blue one.Overall, I'm disappointed. I gave it to my sister and I'll be buying another phone."
1,"Worst mobile, within 20 i was facing calling issue. Can't able to attend incoming call and not  able to call others, completely mobile hanging. I never seen basic mobile getting hanging. Worst service from Amazon. Pls I strongly recommend don't buy this product. Even bttry life also worst. Waste of money, I bought it now it's in showcase only no use of buying it."
2,I purchased this for my father in law. It will not support the telugu language as a display.  As I was not at home I could check this feature. Now I don’t have option to return.
5,Good product
1,"This product is very very bad, don’t buy it bcz I used only 10days after that it’s in my dustbin. Please don’t buy"
5,Good stuff
5,Nice
1,Handover faulty product this is not correct
5,"Good battery life.  Some very smart features like auto switch off & switch on, voice recording."
5,"I am writing the review after use of about 1 day. I purchased it for my mother. She is very happy to have it. Aa she was earlier user of Samsung basic mobile and she used the mobile for about 6 years. So now she upgraded to smartphone of this brand because in her opinion Samsung mobiles are long lasting. In my opinion:-  Display- 4.5/5  Battery- 5/5  Camera- 5/5  Performance- 4/5  Look- 4/5  Value for money- 4.5/5Display is good and bright as usual Samsung display are always of better quality.  Sound is not best but okay. Look is good but need improvement in back design as it seems to be a cheap plastic material. Battery has no complaints. Camera specially front camera is surprisingly good. But performance should be improved as somtime touch is less responsive.so if you are multitasker and heavy user of mobile then itz not for you. but keeping the price in mind 7299 rs for 3gb ram and 32 gb storage its a fair deal as you are attached to Samsung brand which is better than cheap chinese mobiles like Mi, Oppo, etcPlz don't forget to like if fou find my review helpful 👍"
1,performance was very bad if I open the application that time hang my phone with in 3 seconds and when I rotate the video on landscape mode that time video has slowly moved
4,"Dont expect much from this phone, this is a average user phone, phone will be  lag if using more apps, but its decent for this price, value for money.  Best for Basic to Android upgraders."
1,"I ordered the phone as soon as it was launched. When I received the phone, the camera was not working properly. Everything was very blurry and phone was very slow.I placed a return request. I then received the replacement piece. Camera was working this time but after 1 day use, I noticed that nobody called me the whole day when I generally receive around 10 calls. When I tried calling from another number, it said that the number is out of coverage area when jio had good network reception and VoLTE was on. I have a placed a return request for second time now."
5,"Why did i purchased?1.For using wifi hotspot, instead of my primary phone2.To make or receive Emergency calls either from office or other personalsWhat did i liked most?1.Good Build quality2.Good Display, excellent quality3.Good signal reception, clear voice quality.4.economy price.5.Good Battery6.Latest operation system.7.Dolby atmos(good for music lovers)8.hotspotWhat makes you disappoint?Usb port should be ctype.Finally, what did you say?This is the excellent phone in this price range.Can be used as wifi hotspot and standby phone.This phone is only for basic usage like listening music, simple  voice calls, chatting, watching youtube, surfing net.Not recommended for gamers and heavy users.And display supports upto 720p only.Note:In initial setup, you may face lag and struck in youtube videos. But once after setup completed,restart  the phone.Everything  will get settled up."
3,"So I recieved the phone a few days back. And I will be using this phone as my primary phone. So I will keep this brief and almost to the point.Build quality- tacky looking, good, but can be improved for future budget phones. I got grey color, and it's not metallic, my mum says the rear looks like shahbadi floor tiles. Not an insult. Anyways I like it, but it's not metallic.Screen- personally, I am happy with it, touch feedback is nice too, but ofcourse not like 20k+ range phones.touch is very responsive in the calculator app.Battery- well 5000mah, good, it's quite more than necessary for me but good.Camera- macro camera- took a fair enough macro shot, 2mp. 3.2mp would have been a sweet spot in budget yet good quality. Front and main camera yet to test fully. Night time photos? Forget it. Honestly even most mid range phones don't fare well in night.Processor power- its not a powerful chip to begin with, but fine, I am going to manage with it. For others, the phone is a bit laggy/slow in some aspects..or most. Camera takes a good whole second or 2 to start, the viewfinder flow is not smooth and laggy/glitchy.but I like the wide and macro combination. SHOULD'VE BEEN 3.2MP :'(More apps= bit more lag while entering main menu. So the less no of apps, should suffice. I opened a bunch of apps, including 3 Google tabs in browser, and many apps, lag was not severe slowdown, but was a little slower than before or it's slow to begin with and didn't really have high expectations. Using the device care and/or restarting the phone did feel better and smoother, but took a good whole 7 to 10 seconds for the live wallpaper to load. Talking of wallpapers, even being samsing OneUI, there is no option for galaxy themes :(I am not gonna do any major gaming on this so I cannot say anything on it's regard, I prefer pc gaming. But don't expect much, however if you really want have a  experience where you'd feel better/happy with the purchase, I'd suggest playing classic games like Mario, crash bandicoot etc. Some game suggestions- Dadish, alto.I will update this review after a week/months use. And finally a half/full year update.If you have a budget of atleast 10k then I'd suggest buying some other samsung product or your preference. I've used the m31s and compared to this, that phone is way smooth, and many more models out there. But if you want a entry level phone, or coming from a feature phone, budget constraints, secondary phone. Then this is the phone to go with.  I personally like my m02 quite a bit."
1,"Phone is very slow& heats up quickly. I replace the first piece. Received the replacement the very next day, thanks to amazon. But the second handset was even worse as it got extremely heated even before it was set up completely. Returning it also."
1,"No wireless display as specified and camera not working evertime, quality is poor, even though 13mpixel, it's like VGA camera.. pictures are blur..please don't waste your money.."
3,Average Smartphone.....😵
4,"Mobile is good for simple use but pathetic camera , no fingerprint sensor and old processor which makes it slow for a phone in 2021 .  I purchased it as my secondry phone, display is really awesome and light weight with sleek design. For better deal opt for micromax IN 1B if you can compromise on display and will use as primary phone  .But the conclusion is samsung's quality and customer care cannot be compared with any other brand  in india .If you want a secondry phone then its a perfect choice at this price"
5,"At a first glance phone looks decent one. It has almost all the features except finger print but it's ok in this price range. Checked the sound quality, camera, internet speed. All seems to be fine. For a basic user it's a good choice. Will review further after using few more days."
5,The product is best value for money and only watch it as a budget smartphone
1,Performance and display is not as per standard. Pale display....it looka like a duplicate screen. Performance is so slow that even opening a calculator take 5sec of lag to open. It seems this phn is either refurbished version of some older phone. Samsung has not delivered such low standard phn till now.
1,"Reason to buy :1. Very stylish looks . u found a premium quality.2. Big display.3. Battery is good.Reason not to buy1. It's like a Scorpio with auto""s engine.App load time is long2. Camara just a scrap.3. Speaker is very very bad. Burst speaker.Over all don't buy this . if you don't want anything more than call nd need only a good looking ph then only buy or either go for poco c3,redmi 9a"
1,I have used 3 or 4 samsung phones with this price tag. But this phone model is disappointing me.I found below issues in the phone that i received from this seller. Not sure about other users.1. Call volume is low.2. Performance issue.3. Phone hangs in the middle without loading the website completely.4. Very heavy but ( i did not notice it when i ordered. This is my mistake).5. Call disconnection but not very frequently.There is no option for refund. But it has only exchange with the same model.I returned this mobile . Am waiting for replacement phone. Let us see how the new phone of same model works.
2,Good in screen size. Average phone in the price range. 👍Camera 📷 worst-: On the name of samsung it's very bad. 👎Battery🔋backup-: It's is good can run full day.👍Speed~RAM-: Don't even think of playing any game. It's lag vere very much even while playing Temple Run in 3gb variant.👎Memory management-: it's come with 32gb internal memory in with 10gb is allready consume by system software.👎Overall ~ If you are purchasing this phone for only calling purpose then go for it. 👍Don't think of playing a single 50-100Mb game u won't be able to play on this device 🙏
3,"Writing this review after couple of days of using. First I ordered this and received a slow item, then I replaced the item and thanks to Amazon I have received the replacement within 1 day. But, the replacement item is still slow. Hence, I have decided to return the item.PROS:1. Big Screen2. Huge Battery Life3. 3GB of RAM4. 32GB of Internal Storage6. Latest Android OSCONS:1. MediaTek Processor (after having 3GB of RAM, the phone takes 2 seconds to open Chrome and 1.5 seconds to open contact list)2. Hangs After Playing GamesVERDICT:You can go for this phone if you are looking for a secondary phone or you are gifting this to your parents. This phone is not for them who will watch movies, play games and hinging on social media apps."
5,* Display is very good* Battery Backup Excellent* Stylish Mobile* YouTube Videos playing without buffering
1,"Guys if you are looking for a smartphone Please do not buy this product. Reasons are given below1. Battery life is not upto the Mark even in power saving mode. Drained very fast in just 15 hrs. If you watch movie then ot will drain in 4 hrs only.2. Camera. Both front and rear camera are just like vga camera. No quality of Megapixels.3. Hangs a lot. Takes too much to unlock and don't have a fingerprint scanner as well. No facelock option.4. Many times it dont show the caller number on screen for 5 to 10 seconds.When you are working on it and someone calls you then only ringtone will play first and small icon will appear on the top after 5-10 seconds. Unknown no. by truecaller will show when you disconnect call.5. I have not installed any game as it hangs in normal operation.6. Screen width is not upto mark,as keys of keyboard come closer. You will feel uncomfortable while typing.7. Sound quality is low, as no proper music beats.8. When you are on call the screen automatically flash and touch enables.Samsung should recall this model. Worst ever phone. You can add 2000 more and can get better phone than this."
2,"Phone is little bit slow hanging in first start , below average camera quality both front and rear , plastic back but at this price point cant expect more. But we can expect good Qualcomm Snapdragon processor or exynos ...long charger wirePros - good battery not yet checked , bright and clear screen, latest update today via OTA,Cons- very small charger wire and it is unacceptable, below average camera, very slow phone , plastic cheap quality,I suggest spend bit more on good specification phone don't just go with Samsung..."
5,"Best smartphone in this prize,nice display, battery life best,but I want to more features like, screen shot and screen recorder too."
1,"First I was happy that Samsung rolled out a budget phone under 7000 Rs. but later got disappointed that we have to bear slow processor. The processor is quite slow and the phone started hanging as soon as I booted for the very first time. Along with this drawback, the display is very cheap when it comes to expecting a nice one from a brand like Samsung. I would suggest not to go with the brand value but see the specifications before you buy and don't make the mistake which I made."
4,"3/32gb variant @ 7299/- is good deal with samsung brand. Quad-core MediaTek MT6739 Processor is outdated & slow but adequate for basic usage. No lagging for whatsApp, fb, YouTube.  Display & Screen resolution is great as well as battery backup. 10W charger took more than 3.5hr for full charging. Cameras are average considering price point."
4,"This is my first personal Samsung phone, and what better model to start with! Using it for a week  now and everything is functioning as it should. Very good display, sound and maneuverability overall.  Only one thing :  The mobile's data cable could really have been a bit longer. Other than that the phone is working fine. The best thing is the 5000mAH battery,  which I am enjoying. :-) Truly  a value for money.Will update if I find any other significant matter in the coming days."
4,Product is just ok if you have another phone. I use iPhone n I took it as some apps have xtra features in android.Phone has a good battery. Processor is not good enough so it’s a little slagging. Design is good. Display is too bright if u hold it straight with ur eyes as it’s a tft lcd.  I hope in future updates mobile will become a little smoother.  It is very rare that you will get every update time to time in this price. But I am sure u r not going to get a better choice in this price. If you have money shortcomings you can consider it!!Have a nice day ahead!!
2,I ONLY USE FOR MAKING CALLS.WHATSAPP VIDEOS ONE OR TWO I SEE AT THE MAXIMUM.MOBILE LOOKS GOOD.NO ONE CAN TALK ILL ABOUT SAMSUNG DISPLAY OR CAMERA.AS USUAL BATTERY FAILS.IN THIS CASE ATTERY DRAINS EVERYDAY I NEED TO CHARGE EVENTHOUGH I DIDNOT PLAY ANY GAME OR SEE MEDIA.IF WE PUT FULL CHARGE ATLEAST IT SHOULD LAST FOR ONE FULL DAY.MORNING IF IT IS 100 PERCENT EVENING IT COMES AROUND 35 PERCENT.CURSE FOR SAMSUNG.
5,Best samsung mobile in this price category.Thank you Amazon.
2,"I would not recommend this product to any age group.This mobile has most slowest processor, even on first day you feel like you are operating crashed system.Go for bit higher prise product you Will not regret."
5,"If we compare the product quality with the price, definitely it is a value for money device for your daily usage.Battery life is very good, charging is a bit slow but ok.Look wise the phone gives a decent look from back side which can be increased by using back cover.Front side look is awsm.Screen size is good for gaming and movies, performance is great even in sunlight.Camera quality is absolutely fine.Definitely you can go for this having a branded logo on back."
5,A wonderful value for money! I had asked it as a extra side phone. It provides excellent prolonged battery life and beautiful design that doesn't get you off. The performance is obviously not as fast as premium phones in terms of speed if you want to use as a multi purpose phone. But basic apps just do all fine.
1,Defective Item was received.IMEI number is not displaying when dialing the required number.Requested for a refund but exchange partner has refused to collect it despite raising a request within 24 hours.Please check the seller on Amazon before purchasing your products.
3,The phone gets very hot with minimal use.Editing the review after the phone was replaced. This time got the right product and it works pretty well.Guess it was a faulty product to begin with. Happy with Amazon. Samsung needs to do their quality checks better.
5,Just amazing..Battery back up to video quality as well as net working and perform too fast..
5,"Very good budget phone with big screen. Support is only for 2.4ghz WiFi and not support 5ghz WiFi which user is missing compared to other manufacturers smartphone around same price range. Charger point is not so smooth to insert the charging pin and seems it might cause priblem after an year use, but need to see how it copes with."
5,One  of Best mobile phone in this range💪 truely💪awesome
3,After using this device for 5 days I can share some pros and consPros-1- Budget smartphone from Samsung at this price range.2- Screen is better in performance.3- 5000 mAh battery life stands upto 24 hours after watching videos for 5 hours and calling. (Couldn't play game)4- Picture quality is average.Cons-1- The device lags and sometimes hang on performing easy steps like shifting app to app.2- Multitask becomes difficult as it is slow in performance.3- Camera is not upto the mark.4- Doesn't feel premium while holding the phone.5- due to bigger battery the mobile feels heavy. (206 gms)6- Found bugs like-(1) Pressing power button takes time to wake and sleep the screen.(2) Home screen zooms upto 300% without activating.(3) Opening camera stucks for upto 5-10 sec sometimes.(Will update more if found)Thanks!
5,Good quality product.. working perfectly. No defects found on mobile. Good quality rear cameras and good quality front cameras. Good sound quality.  Good display quality . Light weight . Good touch sensitive. Designs and colours are good . In this price mobile  is good. Phone back Is made of plastic. Good performance ram no lag coming . Android 10 installed . After we connect internet  to phone we get updations of all. Totally good mobile. Total 10 gb is used in rom 22 gb Is balance.
1,Believe me guys don't make mistake you will regret. This phone hangs a lot even at normal task like opening notification panel or settings or receiving calls. Better go for other brands if you are tight with your budget they buy new Gionee phones Gionee F103 pro was my first phone there are some software update problem but except that everything runs much smoother than this M02 and note it this Gionee phone was 5 years old and still you can play COD in it. Even i have played pubg recently before it was ban. Now i ordered new mobile because i was getting battery issue in my Gionee handset and trusted Samsung but i got something more bad than previous phone.Don't buy it!
1,Pathetic performance of the phone. My father in law was using old redmi 3i for past many years. Since it's battery was almost gone i bought this useless mobile with weakest processor. Opening a dialer itself takes 3-4 seconds. I didn't imagine this like sluggishness of the mobile from Samsung. Better i would've gone with xiomi or realme. Wasted Rs.7500.. lets see how long will it work
4,"So I ordered this phone 20 days ago I guessAs i got a good exchange offer for my repaired handset i only paid 900.About the product-The screen quality is awesome at this price point, the battery is also promising, build quality is above average however it doesn’t offer fingerprint which is pretty basic even at this price.The main concern with this handset is the ram management on this one creates problem. The multitasking can’t be done fluently and yes it lags a bitTo me I purchased this handset for my 2.5 years old niece as she loves watching videos throughout the day. So for us it was a health purchase but for those who want to use this as a primary phone. Please increase your budget otherwise you will be irritated."
4,"I've been using this phone for 4days now.I will share my review with pros and cons:cons:1.It feel like a cheap phone idk why,there are some phones in this price segment ""looks"" premium.2.No LED notification,a major missing.3.Rear Camera is not that good in default,but when we changed to 48MP it looks ""kinda"" good.It seems like good in this price segment.4.Its little bit getting Hot while charging and I feel some Hottnes while taking photos(maybe coz of outside temperature)5.It takes quite a bit to get fully charged,yah the battery is 6000 but its fast charging with 18W.6.so much pre installed apps(we can uninstall it) and also like previously,we have to go through each app to disable ""Recommendations""Pros:1.Very light weight and it doesn't feel a massive 6000 is inside2.Front camera is Superb! good detailed pics in portrait.3.Battery is so good.I use the phone to take a lot of pictures and use it for 1 hr swiping through Instagram,the battery doesn't notice that at all lol(its pretty good)4.Stereo speaker does that job GOOD5.For games,ya with a medium settings it is good for 1hr continuous gaming after that it gets little hot but there is no overheating like that issue till now.This is all I can remember,I will try to update if I notice it afterwards."
3,"Redmi 9 Power Electric Green (4+128)(FIRST 24-HOURS REVIEW)• A phone with Superb Design and unique colours• I have purchased electric green colour and believe it is really superB in looks• Heavy in weight but its okey as it looks fine in hands• Dual stereo speakers with ultimate sound quality!! BUT BUT BUT !!• Redmi claimed 6000mAh Battery, means we think that it will go through atlest ""1 & Half day to 2 days"" of battery backup in one charge, But there is nothing like that.• The Battery will Last go to 1 day of maximum backup only if limited use.(I charged the phone full in last evening by 7pm and its 1 pm today righ now and it is 55% left with no use as i am using it as a secondary phone, means the Remaining 55% battery will last longer to 11pm. The total battery backup without use of phone will go to 28 Hours, as i am using it as a secondary phone with no whatsapp, youtube or any kind of internet surfing with this phone)• It means if u want to use it as a primary phone with whatsapp, youtube, and other internet features then i dont think so that it can give 1 day backup• Redmi claimed 22W Fast Charger with it, apart from it while using its own 22W fast charger it takes more then enough time to charge(It takes time to Charge full)• Camera quality is like hell, specially the front camera, Don't buy if u wants a Camera Quality in Mid Range phoneSummary:-Purchase it if u want as a secondary phonePurchase it if u want super outer looks with ultimate colour optionsPurchase it if u dont want good selfie camera quality (According to price range)Purchase it if u want a Good Looking Attractive Phone"
1,"Very Disappointed by the product. Camera quality is too bad. The only one thing is in phone is it has 6000mah Battery. Overall this product is very worst. Don't buy if you are looking it as a primary phone which has best camera, Storage & massive battery."
1,"Honest review after a week of usage -Do not make the mistake of buying this mobile. While the price point is competitive, it would make lot of sense to pay an extra 1000 and go for the Redmi Note 9 instead of Redmi 9 Power.This mobile has pathetic camera quality. It says 48 MP camera, but the quality is as good as 8 or 13 MP camera. Redmi note 9 having the same camera gives far better quality images. I am truly disappointed with the camera quality.So do not go on the Megapixels. This mobile honestly has very bad camera quality.The performance is OK. A snapdragon octacore processor does not do any justice as I have experienced good amount of lags while opening basic apps.The battery back up is good, but apart from that, there is nothing special about this phone.I regret buying this in the flash sale."
4,Ok Product
1,"Camera is very worst, In indoor lighting pictures are getting blurred, Front camera is something like 4 years back quality because it has only 8MP.When coming to back camera even with 48MP, photos are not clear.My suggestion is not to purchase this mobile, if you can bare 1000/- more, best choice is Redmi note9 or you can purchase realme phones with in this budget.I tried to return the product due to camera quality not expected, but return will not take return back due to quality issue for mobile phone.I purchased many Mobiles, but this is my first worst experience.So please don't by this mobile 🙏🙏🙏🙏"
1,"I bought Redmi 9 power blue (128 GB) in the first sale on 22nd Dec 2020.Amazon delivered it very speedy on 23rd Dec 2020.Reviews:1) Camera: Average for both front and back cameras.2) Sound: Good3) Battery: Drained very fastly, even charging is a bit slower, not looks like 6000 mah.4) Processor: slow processing and sometimes hang also. And touch is also responding slow.5) Games: I didn't try much yet.6) Weight: BulkyI bought it because of the camera but a little bit disappointed with it."
1,Front camera is very poor for video calling. Sometime screen goes totally white on video calling like hanging problems.Its looking dark face.Also battery is not according to expectation as 6000mAH. Battery showing 20% and suddenly goes 80%without charging.

4,Good phone
1,Phone having bad quality and hanging issue and performance is very poor and bad camera quality and brightness over exposed in sun light
1,Non of the features they have mentioned match the phone.-Both Cameras are horrible.-The phone is laggy-Battrey back is horrible-Charge time is horribly slow for a 22W charger
1,Got a damaged phone .. plus Amazon customer service not helping on this .. bad product .. poor service by amazon ... please Don't buy ...
4,Purchased on 22nd Dec 2020.4 GB RAM 128 GB Storage Capacity.Mighty Black (Colour).Rs. 11998Included: Charger. Clear Case. Sim Tray Ejector. Documentation.About 17+ GB of Storage Capacity is utilised by OS and Pre-installed Apps.
3,"I bought this mobile on the first sale 22 Dec 128 gb version, coming to the phone the miui is the same we find in other mi devices which is the reason I bought the phone but one this which I miss the most in MIUI 12 is the absence of second space(why Mi ❓)Pros: Good battery, 48MP back camera and MIUi 12cons: front camera(my redmi note 5 does a better job), no second space, a bit bulky when you hold the phone"
1,"Battery do`t work as specified 6000 mah. worst camera result ever. even new theme or fonts don't work. battery drain to fast. very chip on weight,look,speaker,display many more, friends first time a request you to please do not buy this phone. company try to achieve their position high that's why they start to deliver this type of chip product to customer.  In my home 7 mobile is redmi but i never seen this type of chip mobile ever. i am so sad after purchase this mobile. I need to my money Back."
1,"Firstly got too late delivery from amazon, no response from customer care representative. The product is now totaly different like stock Android and cheap like oppo, Vivo Xiaomi lossing his market. Quality also not upto the mark. It gives low performance even many times the miui stop the apps. Very very bad feeling to order this mobile.On second day of delivery it stuck on bootAnd keep restarting again & again.lastly i had to format it and i lost my data of year &year.Shamfull xiaomi. DONT BUY xiaomi phone with MIUI 12 it is worst than worst"
5,Redmi mobile is having features what we essential requitred.I m very happy with the new model.So far it's very nice and value for my.Wil review after couple of days usage.
4,Its value for money but if you are a selfie person than no pictures are ok but not too good I love everything about it
3,"Average performanceEdit (after 1 year usage): no issues in daily tasks,While playing pubg and some calls it freezes and swithes off."
5,Awesome product. Like it❤️ 12k under best phone.Dual stereo speakers.Good camBattery backup ❤️💯Build quality 💯Design 💯Best choice 👍
1,Front facing camera is too bad....
1,Front camera on video call is showung dark face. Screen goes white like hanging problem.Battery goes 20%to 80% automatically.Its camera performance is very low.You can choose other option in same price like vivo.
2,"Front camera is third class. Rear camera's quality  is average.  Battary like  4000 mah. Wi fi, Hotspot,  Bluetooth touch key does not work properly.  There are no auto call record option and notification receive indicating  led. Only sound quality is very good. No return policy only replacement, so I am hopeless."
4,"Primary usage Suitable for battery, videos watching, storage 128GB like songs backup listening music offline with speaker HiRes 2 speakers one in top and one at bottom, splash resistant.If ur requirement is secondary like Camera 48mp camera with Snapdragon 662.Not for heavy games.Then its suits me well. 5 star.No phone for these specs at this price point."
2,"After a month use....Phone is just ordinary.  No effects of the memory options are noticed.  In fact it takes roughly 2 minutes to get to the main screen after power on.  Preloaded with 13-15 gb of system files and bloatware.  So you get to use only 49 GB effective storage place.The phone is like paying for our dish TV, you will be forced to watch a lot of advertising apps.A lot of personal information may be used, your mi id will be linked to phone, email, ip address, location etc.Earlier I used Lenovo p2 nothing of this, and was a great phone.Having said all bad things, the phone is good for sound, visual, and battery.  Camera is the worst part.If you are buying for a camera then this one is a bad choice.  Battery 🔋 and the sound is great.Too many bloatware, I suppose Redmi should pay attention.  Or we all should avoid the phone and the brand.Repair would be easy as Redmi has many service centers around the country.  Except battery and music I don't see any difference or advantage over other phones for routine activities.Overall very average phone 📱 which is priced on higher side."
1,The product is not upto the mark.It gives low performance even many times the miui  stop the apps and camera quality is also poor.
3,The product is very disappointed in the camera segment. Front and back both camera is worst. It is not as 48 mp camera .Battery backup is well as 6000 mah.only vedio can play up to 13 hours after that phone is dead.if you bye for a big battery only then you can bye this product.all so processor is not as helio g85.
4,"I have ordered blazing blue colur but i have recived black colour instead of blue,But still it is a wonderful phone at reasonable cost.Battery backup is awesome and camera is amazing.I highly recommend to buy this phone from these seller"
5,Chief and best
5,Nice phone
4,"The pros of this smartphone are1. fhd+ display2. good battery life ( 2.5 days+ if only used for calling and light use,  1.5 days for overall usage like YouTube, watsapp, google meet, music, calling and gaming)3. 18w fast charge and 22.5w charger in box ( 19 - 96% in 2 hours)4. less bloatware5. ufs storage6. Stereo speakersAnd cons are1) average processor.2) average camera. (Steady photos are very good but low light needs improvement)3) MIUI 12 is little laggy.4) little heavy.5) Speakers are not that loud but works very well.So only buy if you want good viewing experience, battery life , fast charging and 22.5 w charger."
1,Front camera 3rd class.
3,Just got the phone in hand and the phone started lagging the next day.1- Performance average.2- Camera Average.3- Bit heavy and bulky too u can feel that.4- Design poor or should i say worse.5- MIUI is worst.
5,"Value For money, Sound quality is Superb, display clarity nice, overall worth for it."
1,Friends don't buy redmi 9 power smart phone.Don't waste your hard earned money to buy such disgusting phone.Performance very badBattery life very badFast charging not at allCamera quality v v poor.User friendly not at all.This is my genuine review after using it.My had wasted my money you all plz don't waste your money buying this phone.
1,"After using for 10 days My genuine review.1.Mobile always hanging.If you open camera it will hanging automatically.If you open 2 tabs,it will hanging.2. Cameras response time is too late.3. Front camera waste. It's shows you black only.4. Battery performance gud.My old Redmi note 4 is best to compare this Redmi 9 power.""My biggest mistake buying this redmi 9 power""We need a solution from mi and Amazon."
2,It's a MARKETING TRAP...IT CLAIMS to have all the best feature but they performance is below average... it's has all the features but no quality....Only Pros1.Good quality FHD screen2.Battery backup is okay.3. Speaker quality.Cons1. Below Avg camera.2. It HANGS3. NOT A SMOOTH TOUCH.4. TOUCH LAGS need to tap button multiple times one gets irritate.5 . One feels cheated because we have better option in the same price range.Worst use experience. I feel my older 3 GB ram redmi 8a is more smooth than this.My recommendation always give priority to a better Processor.
1,"Please don't buy this go for redmi note 9 pro.Camera is very bad .I seriously suggest not to manufacture redmi products in India ,all the made in India of redmi is worst ..."
1,"Worst mobile don't buy , camera quality , battery backup , everything is bad . Hanging No 1 Mobile. Pls pls don't buy Vivo Y51A model. Very very bad mobile. Software is worst always hanging. If anyone have plan to buy pls change urs plans."
5,Good item for what I paid... Long live Jeff Bezos !!!! :)
1,Chip phone
3,"Simply superb mobile, super processer with a Ram and Rom are given best combo.  But there is only one problem - that's the call record option has not given and there no mic recorder option tooo. Cannot access a auto call record. Iam  fully satisfied with this modle but only on recording option im disappointed."
5,"Got this phone at a reasonable price with 8 GB RAM. Purchased last month, battery life is good as well. Would recommend it."
5,It's a good phone. Well packed and working perfectly. Camera quality is good. Earphones are included with this phone. It takes little time to charge but battery life is equally good for me. Back cover is included so no need to buy extra. Complete required accessories are provided that's really good part. My last phone was also  Vivo (v1718) and it's been more than 4 years and still that phone is working very well. I expect same durability from this phone as well.
3,All function its ok but finger print is not proper working..And its already returnable device from first customer..
4,"It seems the handset is previously Used by somebody because already the others person routine chart is mentioned there, limit of the phone already set by prious user, there is song video uploaded there ,the date of upload seems to be March on there. And for a second its 17990₹ too much."

5,"Beautiful size with many goodeis. Great speed (thanks to its octa core processor), decent camera and nice screen size.  Can't expect more than this from a below 10K phone."
1,I received a defective product. I ordered this as gift to my aunt. The product package had a hole when it was received  and there was a blast when the mobile was put to charging for the first time. It could have been fatal for people around. I need proper justification and action for this.
5,Excellent phone should go with itIt's just amazing and display quality improved. I am using this phone for past 15 days it's quality is A1 and yeah price little high but product is excellent. For gaming experience I downloaded pubg it works in high graphics and no lag I was really shocked seeing it and also gta worked properly so for gaming also it's good . Really should go for it in this situation of India. Let's buy Indian product and make India great in phones.Made in India Made for India . Love u Panasonic
5,"👍 After Using this for 5 Days (Heavy Usage), I am Reviewing this Phone.For the User Interface It is Stock Android. Built Quality is Good but Plastic from Back. Camera is Average, as expected. Design is classical but nothing new, Ok type. RAM of 3GB is providing a decent performance as of now, Multi-Tasking is fluent with zero issues at all. It is Ok with Gaming as well, No Lags or Heating (30-45 Mins). Battery backup is around 16+ Hours. You'll have to Charge it everyday. At the Price of 8.5K, You can't and won't get a better non-Chinese smartphone with these many features & this type of performance. Overall it is like an Average Allrounder in all specs. No Complaints as of Now, as expected. I would rate it Very Decent & Nice. For People with normal Usages, It is a Perfect Phone, Must Go for it. For People with Heavy Usages, Well, You have to think for it and then buy because for this Budget I don't think you can get anything significantly better. Overall a Full Marks achiever👌. Delivery Speed & Packaging is as remarkable as always from Amazon."
5,Good quality big size phone with Hd screenAnd good camera quality in low light4000 mah batteryCheaper than other platforms
5,Go for it.

3,"A budget phone, camera not that good...yet nice  if bought for below 8000, as replacement to chinese phones."
4,"In my opinion eluga i8 is best for meetings speed is good not as Snapdragon because media Tek is bit slower than Snapdragon but  a good selection in this price .If you are looking for camera I think it's not the best option but for speaker it's louder  for gaming Ithink it's good it comes with Android 9 but after some days Android 10 update will come automatically. Easy to handle good design . 13 megapixel camera , Google camera except  camera all others are good. It comes with fingerprint plus pattern/pin/password locked ,it ask us to put lock on starting of first use itself . I think a good phone at this price range"
5,I had purchased the mobile Panasonic i8 it's the good condition mobile before I was never expected like thise kind of best mobile...thise mobile primary feature is water proof...if mobile will mistakly skip into the water fall into the water...it will switch off automatically...and it take some time means approximately abservation time is 8 hrs...then when we will start the power button it will work as well as before...so great mobile...my mobile was skip the mobile into the water in small river...any problem was not created with thise mobile
4,Bought this phone for my mom. The phone does not impress from the outset. However it works well.The sound quality is ok and the screen is also pretty average. One big plus in Corona times is that it comes with screen guard and back cover in the package. The fingerprint reader is little sensitive to dust though.All in all our does the job though i would have loved if it did the same with more aesthetics.
1,"Display is flickering in bottom half of the screen within 15 days, just after the Returning period is closed. Reboot done, switch off done and software update was also done. Nothing resolved the issue. Now every one can judge why majority go for brands other than Panasonic Model Eluga mobiles. Pathetic durability of hardware and software"
1,"Horrible don't put your money here,I recieved a defected piece and they are not ready to replace it also .Initially Amazon  told to connect to Panasonic, Panasonic says to connect to Amazon. They kept passing time like this for more than a month .Now Panasonic,Panasonic says you go to service centre and get it repaired, no replacement."
5,"For moderate usage, it's perfect.- The camera quality is good.- UI is clean and near-stock. No bloatware.- Last Android Security Update is September 2020.- Fingerprint scanner works perfect.- Did not notice lag over normal use.- Phone size not too big. Just right for my hands.To summarise, for a 3GB RAM phone, it performs really well."
5,The Phone is absolutely the real deal.I would recommend you to buy this amazing phone the feeling is awesome when you first open the box .❤️ Made In IndiaAnd the Brand is Japanese .Must buy it camera is amazing and most importantly you get a earphone which is also made by Panasonic and it's base and sound quality is definitely up to the mark.Buy Nowww
3,"1.firstly the phone encountered defect within 15 days of purchase, although it was resolved by service center2.the product performance is not up to mark when compared with competitors similar products"
4,"Pros:Stock Android,No bloatware/Chinese apps, UI is the best part about this phone for me- Clean, snappy  enough, perfect selection of wallpapers as per my liking.Good feel and finishComes with Transparent back case and Screen protector (already fitted to screen)Good screen for the priceFingerprint sensor is good for the priceGood battery life. Easily lasts a day. I dont game at all, so that could be a contributor.ConsNot a great camera,especially the rear camera is not very sharp. In well lit/natural light conditions,its decent, but in low light or artificial light its plain bad.Still running Android 9 (Pie) and no assurance of future updates, does not have inbuilt dark modeScreen protector could've been fit a bit better (not exactly lining up around the front cam area)FINAL VERDICTIF CAMERA, LATEST ANDROID UPDATE, ARE NOT IMPORTANT TO YOU THEN THIS IS A GOOD PHONE FOR EVERYDAY USE- MEDIA CONSUMPTION, SOCIAL MEDIA, BROWSING. THOUGH OTHERS HAVE POINTED OUT ITS NOT A VERY POWERFUL PROCESSOR, I DIDNT SEE ANY PARTICULAR HICCUPS WHILE PLAYING COD, AMONG US, AND SOME BASIC GAMES.Bonus: Also comes with earphones :)"
5,"Very good phone. I was not confident to purchase the phone due to lot of negative reviews, but I took the risk & purchased and it turned out to be better than what I expected. this is the best phone at this price range, if you dont like those oppo vivo mi nonsense. Phone is fast, supports all apps and games. I am submitting after 1 week use, also submitting CPUz screenshot for tech specs. If you need a second phone or your budget is 7k then this is best phone, just get it. seller was eTrade, price-Rs. 7k-Pros---*CPU - Helios P22, 3gb RAM, 32gb storage*Speed - Fast*Battery - very good easily last more than 1 day*Fingerprint - very fast*Display - good*Stock android - no junk apps installed*LED indicator*Earphone*Made in India-Cons---*Camera - good in sunlight only*No android updates"
2,Good phone at this price. Touch is a little bit lagging. However 5 star for overall performance. Mainly made in India.Change in review: The phone stopped working after 2 and half months. waiting for the response from Amazon.
1,It's the worst thing that happened to me in YEARS. I HAVE PURCHASED IT IN JULY 2020 AND not even an year passed it became of no use. It is not working AT ALL!! the phone is just rebooting on its own and is not responding at ALL! WHY DID I EVEN WASTE MY MONEY ON IT?? I AM LUCKY THAT THE WARRANTY PERIOD IS STILL WORKING.. I AM NEVER BUYING THIS AGAIN!DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!
1,"Panasonic should only make  appliances, not mobile phones!Hardly six months had passed since I bought it when just a few drops of water  from the soap case damaged the display, and worse there is no service center around in Navi Mumbai.Now, it's totally dysfunctional!!I would strongly advise against buying any phones from Panasonic!!☹️"
5,"Nice phone... Excellent battery backup, camra are poor quality, build quality is good.. processor excellent.. durable quality."
5,One thing I like most from Panasonic is they make mobile so sturdy and they give everything in a box.Usually you have to rush to mobile shop for cover case and screen guard after receiving the phone. But this people give Screen guard as well and Cover as well. Isn't that too good?I found best for aged people and parents.
5,Excellent phone and delivery by amaonThs is the best phone in this price zone . Using it for last two days found it best ..no issues .My iphone audio had issue and wanted  a mobile quickly at low price point for some time till I get iphone repaired but now thinking I can probably think twice to get it repaired whn this one has no issues
1,"Just within 2 days of the using the product, the speaker functionality as well as Ring is not working. I will wait for a few days and check if the functionality is going to come back and then action accordingly."
4,For the given price range it is a good phone. I am using it since last one week. Camera is not as expected. Speed is excellent. Phone design is good. Very handy. Speakers and its volume is very clear. Overall value for money product.
1,"After one month this cell switched off with Low Battery indication. After that not getting  charging and switch on. Since warranty period is there, I contact in toll free number and searched given service centre which is given by customer care.but on enquiry it is confirmed that service centre is closed permanently.In this situation please suggest what I have to do."
3,Setting given in phones are not adequate . Date and time and day on home or  lock screen is not visible or there is any setting for it. Few Wallpapers and no other theme.Frequently there is no option visible to pick up phone .Not satisfied . Battery back up is of course excellent and  the colours and screen aresoft to eyes. No heating up of phone even after long use.
5,I like the product
4,"I like the phone. It's affordable, fast processor, the camera is good, long battery life, free headphones, and has a cover.Two things I noticed- the phone uses google photos as a gallery no other gallery is pre-installed. Also taking screenshot is by pressing the volume key and power button."
4,"Writing only after 4 days, Phone has fault and charger has fault too. Phone does not show any call just vibrate (but works fine when we change settings for Truecaller) and charger doesn't work for first 1-2 days but on 3rd day its working magically. I want to see software update in this phone as security updates are from January or else i need to replace it."
5,"Awesome.,🤩 Real smart phone.Loving it."
4,"Decent phone in this price, for basic usage ..But it is made in India and Panasonic is Japanese company .. so no headache at all ..If you want a basic phone for phone call and messaging with good battery .. go for it ..Camera is highly usable, specially in 7k bugs"
4,"Too good as per price range. Tottaly worth Rs. 6500.Descent performance, descent camera, Battery good, lasts for 1.5 days for normal use. Display - brightness descent, call/ear speaker is clear.Only problem is the network - it's showing low all time comparatively other phone.Otherwise its good and worth overall."
1,Getting switched off while making video call..and also making sound of karrrrr karrr and always showing one signal.....after return I got again defective phone... very bad experience with PanasonicNot satisfied.Gain I got defected phone
1,Third class product. waste of money. Phone got bent in 6 month. Hanging issue started in 3 months. Headphone is also just local made... just like you get on railway bridge for 30 Rs.  I had to sell it 1000. Never ever go for Panasonic. Its worst phone.
3,"Good for the price, but received defective product. Saw that the back camera was no working at all ,unfortunately after the return window closed. Now stuck with phone where back camera doesnt work. And have to follow up for repair or replacement"
1,Panasonic Eluga18 is creating problem I notification.when acaller is calling the receiving icon does not appear on the screen.The bell is ringing but can not receive the call.Iwent through setting many times but no result.I haveto restart it again and again which is troublesome.so plz solve the problem or replace it.
4,Finger print sensor need improvement.Battery is goodGood PhoneNo hanging issueWorking fine for the past one monthNo issue with my Phone
5,"Great product by redmi, but I request to redmi please don't make fake sale"
1,Never buy chip quality battery drain issues don't buy
4,"Previous owner of Redmi 7 2gb 32gbRedmi Note 10 4gb 64gb was blazing fastIf you aren't able to buy this wait till Xiaomi release the same in poco with 6gb ram for the same price, like they did with Redmi power with a downgrade in camera, They won't remove the 48mp camera, They may decrease or remove the remaining cameras in poco version of resmi note 10About Amazon sale I logged in to amazon.in in my pc and clicked on join wait list around 12:02, then opened the app and booked the phone I was in queue for almost 20 to 25 minutes, the next step was payment which was a pain in the head, no COD, Note: only upi ids with number@ are accepted, I added a card Note: Check if ecommerce payments is enabled for your cardIn the allocated 15 minutes the order was booked but payment failed, thankfully I was allowed to pay againAlso while I was waiting in queue I got an option to buy the phone 2 ways, lightning deal - 11998, Regular price - 11999 (in Amazon App), I think lightning deal is for those who want to claim offersFirst of all, i bought this phone for basic use online payments, govt apps like Twallet, Tration, Tappfolio, MyGHMC, Digilocker, Aadhaar, Hpgas, Bharatgas, Hmwssb and much more all of them mostly dual appsI am a pc user so I don't use my mobile for gaming or streamingPros:Display : The display is crisp and clear better than my Redmi 7 (not comparing LCD with Amoled)Touch: The touch response is good it's fast, I can type fast in this phone no lag thereMobile data: 4g Data connectivity is superb I can feel the difference between my redmi 7 and this, mostly the download speedFeel: In hand feel is also good, the weight is lessCamera: Best in the segment (obviously if you don't use the stock app)Price: considering how this is priced more than Redmi Note 9 (10999), I am not angry this too will cost the same after 6 months probably will be on exchange and discount by August independence day sale.Cons:Battery: Being amoled this shouldn't consume so much battery, hope Xiaomi fixes this with an updatePlastic back: glossy back (should have come with matte or rough panel for better grip) and little bit of vibration while playing the speakers especially on top near cameraStereo speakers: yep more like dual speakers than stereo (then again Xiaomi never claimed that they support Dolby (Oppo has them and they sound awesome)Verdict: I was waiting for this from almost a year, from the launch of Redmi note 8 and my analysis went way deep, I was looking at Samsung for amoled, Redmi power for stereo speakers and good battery, Poco varient of Redmi note 9 for the processor and decent in the box fast chargerThis covered almost all of them (not fully though)Finally this just serves my purpose, I still aim to buy a good PC, Nothing can beat a desktop ( I wish remix os and phoenix os were as competitive as Windows, remix went out of play long back."
5,"Finally, Xiaomi has decided to design for its Note series of mobiles. This mobile phone is definitely going to be and head Turner when you pull the mobile out of the pocket. It has an almost 1mm protruding camera module on the rear of the mobile. I have bought aqua-green color which has these light gradient shade. The colors are up to your personal preferences.The phone has a matte finish at the back so it is definitely not a fingerprint magnet. It also doesn't feel very heavy and is very easy to hold firmly.🎯DESIGN and DISPLAY:******************************This 6.43-inch display with the Full HD Plus resolution is really good along with a punch-hole selfie camera that offers a seamless user experience.The brightness can go up 1100 nits peak so it is definitely not a difficult thing to use it under sunlight. Xiaomi provided this model with the Widevine L1 DRM certification support for this mobile. So, playing HD videos on an ott platform won't be an issue.Z-axis haptic motor used in this mobile throws more realistic vibrations while playing games. I tried it extensively with a couple of games, the experience was really satisfying. Kudos to Xiaomi for throwing in all the sensors on this mobile especially for not giving up on the remote control sensor.This mobile comes with a lot of preloaded apps like Facebook, LinkedIn, MI remote, MI credit, MI Store, MI pay, share m, etc. Out of these, you can uninstall a couple of apps and you have to live with the remaining apps for the rest of the life.🎯PERFORMANCE:**********************The fingerprint sensor is very sensitive and highly responsive that even if you touch the sensor unintentionally you will end up unlocking the phone. It is that fast. Games like Asphalt 9 and Call of Duty worked excellently without any lag or freezing. This mobile would definitely outscore any mobile under this budget easily.It took 25 to 35 minutes to charge the mobile from 0 to 75% using the 33 Watts charger which came along with the mobile.🎯CAMERA:**************It comes with the 48-megapixel F/1.79 main camera with Sony Sensor and an 8mp ultrawide camera and the remaining two are the macro and the depth sensor.The main camera will let you shoot 4K 30fps video and 960fps 720 p video. When provided with good lighting conditions the main camera gives you a decent output and the Portrait mode also did a good job by blurring out the background gently.The low light images were average and it was decent enough for mobile phones with a budget of 15k.Coming to the selfie camera The Portrait mode worked excellently and the pictures were on a little warm tone than a natural skin tone. If you don't like the warm tone on your selfie pictures then you can fix it through editing apps from Play Store.🎯VERDICT:**************This mobile offers Rock-solid performance for everyday tasks along with very good battery life. This mobile phone comes with MIUI 12.5 so you don't have to worry about future updates for at least the next two years. With AMOLED display and the stereo speakers along with IP53 rating, this has to be the most competent mobile phone under 15000 and a good value for money.I have a YouTube channel: Gizmofeatures (You can also find the unboxing and impressions video there). When Comparing with Poco M3, Moto G10 Power, Samsung M12, you can pick Redmi note 10 any day. It is the best among these Four."
1,"This mobile i used only 3 days and mobile start sucking, and this mobile stuck 6 time in one day.. Most Worst mobile in my life 😣"
1,HERE I HAVE UPLOADED THE VIDEO ABOUT THE ISSUE WITH MY NEW MOBILE.FROM THE FIRST DAY TOUCH SCREEN NOT WORKING PROPERLY
4,It has good specifications.... Cut 1star bcoz of bad tactics by redmi.... They told base variant will start with 12k but didn't launched it.... Then I have to buy 14k variant.
4,Satisfied with this product. Best phone under 14000.Camera quality is also good. Battery performance is superb coz of 33w charger 🔋🔌. Finally it is a good phone as per my opinion.
3,I am not impressed with this phone. Samsung phones have better amoled display. Sound quality not good and not loud too. This phone hangs a lot. Camera quality very bad. I have owned previous phones of mi and they are much better than this. Pls go for note 9 pro in the same budget or realme.
5,Best phoneEver
4,Everything is good in the phone..I use redmi note 10 for 1 day...And review itI found i issue with this phone that is fingerprint sensor does not work properly it slwo or some time Tap fingerprint sensor for 2-3 time for useAbout a camera very good...Front camera is also good..I will edit review after 10 day of use...In shot very GOOD PHONE
1,Phone display has been breaken. It is mentioned as gorilla glass. It has fall down from just 6 feet. Y it is broken?. I will go to consumers courst. Please guide me
1,Redmi note 10 software is very bad xiaomi please fix software problem's Improve the camera & build quality is not good & battery drain very fast.  I AM BIG FAN OF XIAOMI MY FAVORITE COMPANY
5,I pay 100rs extra for one-day delivery it took less than 20 hours.. And after 7 days of using I would say this the best budget smartphone to this day.. There is another variant that comes in 12k you can wait for that or simply buy this at 14000 it comes with a back cover and a screen protector battery backup is awesome but a slight heating issue I'm am getting...
5,"Good picture quality. The 48 Mp camera works fine and so does the selfie camera in potrait mode. Sometimes the pictures are sharper than required. The charging is fast. Got full charge in 2.5 hours of fast charge. Overall build quality is good, not too heavy as compared to previous models. The plastic phone case provided prevents from ususal bumps and falls. The sound quality is decent and so is the video quality in full HD. Gaming performance is decent too, got to play need for speed in medium setting without crashing the app. Really happy with the purchase."
1,"Mobile is lagging. while I scrolling screen is not moving, I noticed it several times,it is very slow while playing games. product is not up to the mark in this price segment"
1,Battery is very bad ...battery is draining when even phone is on sleep mode .
1,check wether both the speakers are working or noi got the manufacturing defet in a piece wich they have senteven the headphone jack also not upto the mark wich give you sound only in one ear bud
5,"We loved it always, coz it's a no 1 brand.Exellent camera."
1,Toatl vest of money. The mobile having touch issue. Half Touch is not working. I suggest you all please do not buy Redmi Note 10 series. Please please please
1,"Very disappointed with the redmi product.Touch sensation problem. Sometimes some parts of the screen doesn't work on touch. I tried my best to get this latest product, but never expected such waste of money."
1,"The sd678 processor with 6GB of ram fails to keep up with everyday stuff like composing mails and browsing. Screen freezes at times, and touch response is far from adequate (and no, it is not because of the the protective film).Camera is average for this price range.The only good thing about this phone is its amoled display.It comes with the usual miui bloatware, but can uninstall/disable some.I understand these phones are not meant to last, nor do I expect flagship level performance for 14k; but this phone fails to perform even basic tasks where sub 10k phones ace.The finger print sensor is well placed amd fast, but often fails to work.There's no way to turn off fast charging, so expect your battery to give up soon."
4,Display is very good  10/10Camera is good for the price 8/10Battery is very good 10/10Lightweight and very slimPerformance is decent not the best 7/10MIUI is very laggyBack panel quality is not goodDual stereo speakers not the loudest but ok
1,Don't purchase this phone battery problem and phone is running is slow
1,After 5 days used . Nice design but performance is not up to mark and lagging . App crashes . Lot of adds which is irritating. Best buy Oppo or Realme.
2,i have used this smartphone for couple of days and what i came across cons and pros will share1. display : best in this price range no doubt about that crisp colors little saturated as its amoled panel for viewing is a pleasure of eyes2. Speakers : i didn't liked it yes u heard it right its not good the highs as high vocals are not clear its like its been suppress the quality is not like stereo speakers type its same like single speaker its like u can heard the music but not the vocals the base is killed3 Battery : Not seems to be 5000 mah coz of 11nm chip its drains like hell even surfing would suck the battery juice like hell and phone heats up a lot yes it charge as fast as advertised apart from that nothing is good might be an update would resolve this issue have to wait and watch4. Camera : its good in the price range 48 mp does it job ultra wide macro depth are satisfactory not good not bad does there job colours are not accurate but it does happen low light pictures are ok not as advertised. camera gives good result in good light or in moderate like in room bit not good in low light or at nightselfie camera is good takes good shots edges in portrait are quiet well managed same in low light not good enough5. Built quality nice all plastic very light and easy to hold and operate with one hand if u have big hands but very light coz of all plastic body gorilla glass 3 is used but will never be tested as we always use guard so nothing to talk about itin short its up to you you want it or pass on
1,"after 6 days use  :1. 2 sim+sd card, good2. width just 74mm, then its thin and comfortable in hand, good3. battery is good4. camera is ok (in this range price) but selfie isn't bad5. finger is side and fast6. face unlock is fast7. it's not bulky like m12 Samsung8. speaker is good9. Display is good, but i don't know why main some time is not good10. charging is fast11. it's not heavy weight, it's just 180 gr but m12 is more than 200grat the endi can't say it's good handset, why?Many times hanging, every day I have to restart it at least 5 timesToday I bought realme 8,its super handset, I can't compare both are, just go for realme 8"
5,Iam not big fan of #MI before this phone. Front camera was really nice having wide angle photography as well as from back camera. Battery was best overall this is nice phone for gaming also
2,"Not a good phone i donot know why it is hypedI should have purchased moto g30 ir waited for HuwaeiProblems:1.camera is not good2. Volume automatically decrease and increase3. App not opening have to clear cache each time4. no note pad while calling5.baterry is not good yesterday level of battery of 51 % today when i woke i found my phone switch off6.fingerprint scan is not good compared to Honor7.heating problem in general use8.screen timeout when you are watching anything or reading anythingLook wise it is good,  connectivity is good"
5,Awesome phone ever i have #MI this phone value for money awesome camera  #NOTE10
4,Nice mobile
1,Wrost Phone Not waste of your moneyPlease Don't Buy This Product....... Very Bad Not Good this a Stupid Phone
1,Phone suddenly started working weird. Keyboard not working properly..Spacebar not working...Weird spellings..unable to get the call history...very very disappointed with the product quality.
1,"I am facing touch problems. To type this review I struggled lot. Games worst , some times very difficult to answer phone calls"
1,Aftwrv2 days of uses review is that Even though camera is good but when you make Video call either through Whatsapp or Duo your video image looks  that you are using some VGA camera. don't whybthwre is a difference in selfie video and video through whatsapp which uses same camera properties.Better to go with  Samsung
1,It will make you feel blind as this phone blurs fonts and apps while we scroll it... didn't like it..I made a replacement also but still the problem is same in that new one too
1,"There is some serious issue with this recently launched phone. Replaced product again shows the same touch screen problem, have to touch multiple times. How can the same issue is coming in the second phone too, unless their is some bug. Please do not buy this phone. A BIG NO NO NO TO THIS PRODUCT."
2,"1.Camera have lot of issue, front camera become completely blur during video call on low light.2. Primary camer sensor works poor on video recoding it takes time to focus on item3. Here and there we can see setting menus are lagging- example in app battery saver setting screen starts jerking when we scroll on menu.4. Some apps functionaliy are not responding  after installation. Example zomato place order option. Restarting app doesn't helped. After restarting mobile it worked.I got this by yesterday evening now 1 day completed in minimal usage i faced these many issues worst experience with redmi ,😞😞😞Iam not sure this occur in all redmi 10 mobile or only mine need to speak with customer care and replace. There no return option."
1,"उम्मीद  से बहुत काम,  मै  honor  10lite  उसे कर रहा था 1.5 साल पुराना है / दोनों फ़ोन मे एक वीडियो प्ले करने पर mi  10 मे 5% लॉस  होती है तो पुराने हॉनर  मे 3%/ mi मे बैटरी  शेयर बाजार की दनादन  काम होती जाती है / डिस्प्ले  मे शाइनिंग  ज्यादा है, पर साथ मे पीलापन  दिखता  है मुझे डिस्प्ले  मे कुछ भी  खाश नहीं लगता /कैमरा  भी एवरेज  है,  सबको सुपर गोरा बना देता है 🤣चार्जिंग  थोड़ा फ़ास्ट हैओवरआल  फ़ोन मे कुछ भी खाश नहीं है, नोट 9 ज़्यदा सही इससे बस थोड़ा भारी है /"
1,Heating problem in phone and phone start stucking. And screen become blurred
3,Pros:1. Light weight2. Detachable battery3. Clean display4. Latest security patches for Android 10Cons:1. Can observe lags in screen transitions. Not a smooth navigation. Rendering is staggered.2. Auto-brightness feature is chaos. Frequently changes brightness even when they lighting is stable and phone is unmoved.3. Facebook is part of the stock OS and cannot be uninstalled.
2,"Poor signal reception (both wifi & mobile) makes this product unusable.😏 Other than this is worth for the price.While speaking a call,many interruptions(signal reception failure) occur even at good signal area (my older devices didn't make this type of complaint).Connecting to wifi also a very very slow work. Sometimes it doesn't load/download anything(simply loading).😏If HMD global solved the signal reception problem with software update (if the problem is with software), this device is worth. If the signal reception problem need hardware related solution,then this is really a bad product to purchase. Since we've purchased mobile phone primarily to call and connect with internet. But while that purpose is in a risk,then how to use this product?🤔"
5,"Recieved today, I would like to say its very good option of other Chinese phone in this segment, NOKIA  as usual always rocks, You will get battery removal feature in this phone."
1,"The screen goes blank and remains so, after talking for few mins on phone. Contacted amazon customer care but they said they can’t return the product as we missed the last date for return by few hours. And now Nokia customer care is saying that they don’t replace any smart phone, they only repair. So now am stuck !!! Slightly disappointed with both Nokia and Amazon! Now I think I shud have just bought a phone from a shop:(:("
2,ProsLightweightCompatible sizeGood for budget phone below 7kConsThe performance of Mobile is not goodPlaystore is crashing all the timeCamera quality is below average
5,"Pros: 1.) SD Card can be used as internal memory so no storage issues2.) Comes with clean Android, no unnecessary APPS like Chinese Brands ( we can disable few unnecessary except facebook)3.) 2 years mandatory Security Updates4.) Screen Casting is working very good with out any issues5.)Performance is very good much more than I expected, No lagCons:1.) SOUND quality is bit bad, like a 3 year old mobile2.) Camera is like Note 6 pro Camera ,not comparable with current mobilesOverall very good for Elder People , (Build quality, Storage, Screen Casting,Android one, Big screen, no unnecessary apps which confuses Elders, 1 year Nokia Replacement) One Main Thing Nokia Mobile updates doesnt make your Mobile Slow after 2  years . Other Chinese Brands updates makes the mobile performance bad to make you buy new one even with IPhone its the same , IPhone was fined for this in Europe."
1,Phone processor is very slow and one can not run the phone smoothly. I thought after take over nokia will try to change its brand image by selling superior quality products but it seems management is not interested in selling quality phone and they are just  ruining nokia’s brand image which was built after Woking on quality and durability.
5,"Pros:+ The phone oozes a good sense of value for money. It does justice to its price (one cannot expect sky-high premium features at this price).+ Good build-quality as expected from Nokia.+ Display clarity is good for a phone at its price point.+ The Nokia Android user interface is near-identical to stock Android. Have not faced any lag issues. The phone is decent at light multi-tasking for a device at its price point.Cons:- The selfie camera could have been better. (The main camera is fine.)- Wish it had come with Android One integration. Hopefully the phone might get some security patches from Nokia.Overall a great phone if you are on a very tight budget and have trust issues with Chinese brands, and do not want to buy phones with heavily modified, bloatware-filled Android."
3,"Sound quality is not a super one, but at this price it's fine and no other hand set will provide better. Nokia looks good brand. Wide screen. With this budget it provides more than enough and I don't think any one should be very critical about technical specifications and performance. It performs as it should. With this price recommend for any user who's need is smartphone. Look wise it does not let you down."
1,"Very very very..... poor service, first I got phone which was restarting randomly, so I have replaced it, replaced item is also defective, there is no display on phone, after that I initiate for refund request, amazon delivery agent Zakir came to me for pickup the phone, he checked phone and said I will not pickup your phone because there is no display, what an answer, he told me to get email from amazon customer care, I called amazon customer care and get email that phone has display issue, 2nd time initiated return request now this time again Zakir came, and Now he is saying there is no display in phone so I can't get IMEI number so I can't pickup phone, and without giving proper answer he go away, third time I initiated pickup again, same guy Zakir came and now he took my phone in his hand and said same, I am not getting IMEI so can't pick your phone, this time I asked him to explain me exact issue, he refused and gave me answer rudely, now since that day I have initiated 7 pickups all the time my pickup of defective phone is canceling."
1,"THE PRODUCT IS FAULTY. Within a couple of days of using it, it started frequently asking to do a Recovery, because it could not ""Load Android System"" and needs to do a Factory Reset by wiping out all user data. The phone was allowed to do this reset 3 times over a period of a week. The error still keeps popping up, rendering the phone useless. When I tried to return the product on Amazon, the return window was already closed. How can an electronic device be given only a 7 day window to be returned?? I would NOT recommend this device. EDIT: Added screenshot of the error."
1,"The phone doesn't have enough space and on top of that, it comes with tons of useless preinstalled apps. So basically you can not install any new app and the phone fails to do basic day to day stuff. Don't waste your money, don't waste your time. You won't be able to do a simple google search also with this phone. Even I had to open amazon. in my laptop just to order a new phone."
2,Mobile hanging frequently internal memory get fill with very minimal app installing.Screen settings get changed after mobile switching off and on.Nokia should improve the software part and do proper testing before it get released to customer.Now I need to follow up with Nokia service centre for fixing the issue.😔
1,"I have brought Nokia C3 for my father. When i started phone , its home screen was not seen at all.Very poor product. Please , please do not buy it. It is totally  waste of money.I requested to replace it, but even after two days it is not possible.Amazon customer care number is not responding.Very pathetic condition. I have decided not to buy online any product"
1,Extremely sorry to say horrible product And mentally disturbing after sales reaction . New Nokia C3 is in hanged status from day one and put it for return for the last one month . Since the phone is hanged and show home screen as ‘android phone ‘ collection agent refused to pick due to inability for verification of IME no . Ever since I had escalated 6 times to customer service it did nothing to arrange a pick up or refund . Only way to fix is to file criminal complaint on fraud . Never trust the brand for high value items . Similar bad experience on Oxi meter too
1,This is the worst phone ever i ordered it once it has a battery problem so i put an exchange the second one which i got doesnot even start at all
1,"Worst product..I replaced it 2 times but didn’t get a good one..had some problem or the other..called the customer service, they couldn’t provide assistance..Nokia is a trusted brand.didn’t expect this"
1,The product is the worse. The seller that Amazon has paired up with is a fraud and a cheat and is selling damaged and defective products again and again.The phone does not switch on and even if it does it does not show any control keys and keeps hanging again and again.The worst product. I don't know why Amazon is selling this product with an enhanced price.
1,"Camera Quality very worst, unable to update with google camera"
5,Basic specs in a beautiful design. No notch so you can use the full screen. Battery could have been better. Camera is low-res if you're used to better ones. For basic uses this is good. Has extra Google assistant button
3,Product is good in build quality but the software is not as expected and needs more improvement. Just a call history directly don't show the number saved and we have to click on history to see the details. Calls gets hung sometimes and the floating caller button disappears sometimes. Needs more improvement.
1,Frequently reboots on its own. Needs to be factory reset occasionally. Screen freezes while using. Returned.
1,"It has some issue, it won't charge up 50% even if charged for 6 hours &  as soon connected to charger error pops up saying ""Battery Temperature is very high"", asked for a replacement or return after seeing the ""Battery Temperature High"" issue, it could be serious."
5,"Great performance, features and video quality. Sound has slightly higher treble but can live with it. Very sturdy. Battery is removable and sim slots are convenient."
5,"Nokia as always the best. But pretty basic smartphone. Good for elderly people. Plastic build. Removable battery, first after so many years.  Latest Android. Average camera."
1,"Device hangs a lot... Bluetooth doesn't work at all, i have received a device which unable to connect to other device using Bluetooth. Its a company fault"
1,"Low quality product seeling by Amazon. Don't buy this kind of items from Amazon, i brought this on last week and the phone box was open when i got it, so frns be carefull and if u need this phone dn buy from nokia website only.And I'm still waiting for my refund"
2,"Phone is fine, battery is quite pathetic barely lasting 4-5 hours of minimal usage, just a few calls and an hour of videos."
1,Not working properly.
5,I AM SATISFIED WITH.  BUT THERE IS NO HEADSET INCLUDED.  OTHERWISE PHONE IS QUITE FINE. THANKS.
1,Phone does not start nor it can be charged fail to understand why did vendor not checked that
1,Minimum 3to4times daily hanging problem (After call received)Please give me free replacement
5,"Awesome mobile at 7.5k, Sound quality is good and picture quality is ok. Performance wise, it is good."
1,"Working very slow, hanged always, no space available. Always need to uninstall an application while need to use another one. When someone calls nothing shows on the screen."
1,Not good ... trying to copy from apple or Samsung both and ended badly again
1,No return and refund facility available for this worst product. Plz don't buy it.spend some more amount and buy good company phone instead of this rubbish.my amount went in hell.plz be safe.
3,Worst mobile. Never consider buying this. I've asked for replacement but the new device hasn't arrived yet. Do not waste your money in Nokia. Instead go for Chinese companies like Redmi in this budget segment.
5,I'm satisfied worth buying totally worth it
3,Its good....but i dont get the headphone with new phone...this is disgusting...
1,Waste of money..don't purchase...

1,"Phone is good but lready used, FB messenger logged in with unknown ID. Top transparent sheet missing on phones screen, Frequently hanging during usage. Phone already updated it's meant used phone. Unable to replace. Unable to register complaint. Please help."
1,I wasted my money. Lots of hangings and very slow. Network issues. This is not a 5G or even equal to 1G. Please do not buy this and waste your money. I asked for a refund but Amazon saying is can be replaceable. Not a good service by Amazon and don't know why they are selling such a third class mobile.
5,"My usecase - I replaced by secondary phone Redmi Note 4 - wanted to 5G phone with good battery and Sub 15K price tag. Primary use as a GPS navigation in car, Gaming and backup Hotspot phonePros -1) Very lightweight and extremely well built2) ColorOS is flawless - simple, elegant and bug free3) Decently fast phone and responds to quick touches well - especially while using at 90hz4) Able to handle games easily - its a future proof chipset5) Aesthetically, no concerns - decent phone to carry around6) Great connectivity with my various bluetooth enabled devices - My Bose 700 soundbar, Oppo Enco X TWS and even my fitbit smart band.7) Surprisingly good video call quality on selfie camera8) rear Camera setup - since not my primary phone, but if i have to rate it, i will give it 7/10.Cons -1) 18w is a decent charging adapter - but if u r used to faster charging, this will dissapoint you2) screen brightness is good, but being an ips LCD display, it will still keep you wanting more3)Mono Speakers are decent but not loud enough."
5,Best mid range 5G smartphone by OPPO.Pros :1. 5G support2. Clean Color OS by OPPO.3. Fast Charging with massive battery.4. Sound quality is decent.5. Light weight & handy phone.Cons :1. Camera needs improvement.2. Feels little bit bulky design.3. OPPO should provide earphones with box.
1,"Recently I ordered it, while recording video from front camera, screen is becoming white and also the video,Also while normal uses, it hanging and screen is becoming black.This experience is necessary for the people who are going to buy new mobile with their hard earned money.Take care."
5,"Very nice phone, I brought it at an offer period, but it cost is little bit more,Battery backup decentCamera clarify very goodPerformance... Very nice...Snapdragon Proceccer is the best compare to mediatek. Budget friendly phone, 128 gb and extra slot for increasing memory, 6 gb ram... Very good... Face recognition system and finger print sensor are awesome....."
4,Phone was awasome in its price range.there only 2 problems for this phone1 call recording it says when we start call recording. And auto call recording was only for contacts in mobile.2 mobile heat issue while charging.
2,"I am writing my open review of this phone after using approximately 18daysPhone looks very good look wise 5 out of 5 🌟Camera quiliy is good but not expected from this price pointPhone some times working slow, something I feel I am using my old phone, it means phone performance is not match from my expectations, On this price we should have to buy another phones."
1,"The product which I got, it's not charging even after 4-5 hrs of continuous charging, frequent hanging, and d touch sensor s not dat much great compared to other products, I experience  frequent black outs even, it's disgusting to use this product"
5,"Phone is very good. Box comes with phone case(synthetic) also phone has temper glass sticked to it, No heating , Just used it for a day, Good battery backup"
5,Just loved it ....Cons: 90hz refresh rate is just awesome .Finger print sensors are too good and even face lock.The processor is smooth and the battery is just love easily last for 1.5 days with normal use and a day with heavy use.Cons : I haven't found any cons.
5,Best smart phone I have purchased so far in such reasonable price with exchange of my old phone I got Rs 4000 discount. There are lots of advance and useful features in this phone which will give you the feeling like the costly phones. Great feeling in hand like a chocolate bar and you want to bite it. Excellent design.
4,"It's a choice able budget 5G smart phone. Very good looks, built quality decent, performance smooth, display and touch excellent, battery acceptable, voice and sound quality very good, no network issue, no heating issues, but cameras not good at all. SAR value is low in this segment 5G(Head: 1.066 & Body:0.607).Though it's the review after 18 hrs of uses. The actual review will be done after 1month of uses."
1,"I am not able to connect my Bluetooth with it, and it has a hanging problem too, I can't send a video call from the phone , I am not able to accept the video call, the calling sound quality is not that great 😒"
4,Nice phone
3,"Phone design and look is ok... Camera quality is average (as I bought it for only 14000) it could be a way better.The phone has unique manufacturing defect that it gives error message while using that |the phone temperature is very high"" and automatically phone data and other programme stop working...Even the phone body not heat that much... This is the major issue as you can't use mobile data or camera without restarting the phone or leave for 10minute hold..."
5,"One of the best phone within 16-17k range. Purchased for 15k.Good and fluid performance, good camera, easy to handle, body weight ratio is good. Can easily handle by one hand. Outdoor pics r good, indoor pics r OK. Can easily handle multiple tasks. Battery back up is excellent.In the midrange it's one of the best phones, don't compare with phones above 50k."
4,"Though it's relatively new. I loke this phone. It's fast, clear cam with many options.Battery backup is good as of now.Being into marketing, my phone usage is very high. Also I watch movies and play games.Still it gives 24 hr backup with everything.As of now, I am liking it."
2,"Device is little heavy. Camera quality is average and not appear of 48 mega pixel. Camera quality has really disappointed me. Screen is also not soothing for eyes. Overall, it's doesn't satisfy the brand reputation and money spent on it."
5,Looking is awesome and stylish look ...I feel it's quite better and budget 5g phone.  Performance also very good..go for it...
4,Mobile looks good battery backup is also good as it is an 5000 mah battery. But it is not having an feature of automatic call recording system.
3,"on the time of call recording other person knows the this call is going to record, Screan recording issue."
1,Sound quality is not good
5,Loving it.. Thank you so much amazon.
3,Good 5g phone from oppo....Features and everything is fine but only disappointment is the camera as I was expecting a better camera as such price from oppo. But camera is just OK.
2,You won't get 5G experience compare to other 5G products.. If you are using DUAL SIM CARDS for calls then let me tell ... it gets stuck while selecting the calling options. Few applications like Zoom / Skype are not that supportive... it take time to synchronize.Battery life is moderate ... says fast charging but it doesn't. Same goes with Camera
5,Nice product.
5,Worth a money. Good sound quality. Amazing camera quality.. Smooth access and user friendly.
3,"I didn't like the camera quality. Oppo is known for cameras, but this one was disappointing. Seems they are charging for 5g feature. Display is very good though."
4,The Product is nice the Only issue is with Charging time. It claims 18W fast charging but taking more than usual to charge. It took around 120 minutes to charge from 41-100%. Either the charger supply is underrated or company is claiming it wrong.
1,"Buy other set of oppo but don't buy thisNo call recorder no any external speakers sounds qulty is to bad taking to much time for charging camera is also not so goodPhone heat to fast overall waste of money,Don't buy."
1,"Performance is very bad, its very slow and quality of front camera also poor"
3,Camera issue: When I was clicking photo out side scene then there are some kind of three lines in pictures. I have tried many times but issue was still same. Accept this issue others thing are good in this mobile.
5,This phone is awesome bcz Ram extension up to 5gb means our phone become 11gb ram phone.... Awesome Performance....
1,I got a faulty product so I have raised a complaint to exchange but they don't have this phone in stock
2,"Please be aware that this is a downgraded version of globally launched Mi 11 and Mi 11 pro.Reason for low rating -1. Ordinary display. This is not the 2K display as featured on global versions of Mi 11 series2. No gorilla glass victus unlike global version.3. Band tests shows poor build quality which may result in breakage of phone due to bending4. Such a cheap tactic of selling a phone with the promise of fast charging and not providing charger with a adequate charging capacity.5. No curved display unlike global version.6. Took almost 20 days to get my hands on the phone post order.7. Reported heating issues in SD 888 while playing intensive gamesIn short, xiaomi has attempted to sell big story by first launching Mi 11 globally and then putting ""X"" and selling subpar product in India through illusion.I guess, Xiaomi should not have cut the corners and compromise the quality in Indian versions. Indians are willing to pay premium and success of oneplus is the testament to that. Any cunning move to undercut the value proposition will hurt xiaomi in long run.(note that I currently use redmi note 20 pro and have used so many phones of xiaomi ever since it launched first ever phone in India and hence hold a adequate credentials to voice my criticism as a fan)"
5,"What a Smartphone by Xiaomi! I am thoroughly impressed. I was using One Plus earlier but now One Plus doesn't stand a chance.  No one is giving you Snapdragon 888 process at this killer price, so just go for this.Display is gorgeous and just unbeatable. Even Samsung Galaxy S21+ is no match in display. Latest E4 Amoled is magical – vivid colors, 1300 nits brightness, and 120Hz sampling refresh. You won't even notice such a small front camera punch hole.Camera is best in class. Time freeze motion mode, Telemacro and clone mode are just amazing features.Overall device feel so premium in hand thanks of top in class glass, ceramic and metal body."
4,"Received my Mi 11x Pro today😻 . Really excited . Came with a  power adapter, usb cable,clear case ,type c to 3.5 mm converter and everything that is given in the what's in the box.My first impression was overwhelming as it was a major upgrade from my last phone. It's a piece of art, the glass body and the amoled display makes feel.. Terrific.. 😅 One thing to take extra care is the camera portion which is placed Protruding at the back . The case is of average quality. The phone is butter smooth 🤤 It's just been a few hours so hoping for the best 🤞"
5,"I love gaming and have been waiting for a SDM 888 under 40k which does not compromise on any aspect, and now i finally have it in my hands and its a Gaming Beast.The 360 Hz touch sampling rate makes up for buttery smooth game control. For all mobile gamers, pls have a look at the touch sampling rate as that determines more your response times, even more than screen refresh rate (not that Mi 11X pro lacks there with its vibrant 120 Hz OLED Panel).Camera Again, since I love making travel videos, and have been using an iPhone 11 for the past one year, this has been a welcome change, with its saturated and punchy images and videos that are a treat to the eye. For vlogs in outdoor scenarios, audio used to become an issue, however audio zoom  feature really helps reduce background noise and focus on the subject. No need to carry a separate mic!I have always liked soft bright colors on my gadgets and so chose the celestial silver one. Considering the hardware it packs the phone is surprisingly light and slim.As for the user interface which is MIUI, this phone has the cleanest version of MIUI yet. However being a nerd, I never shy away from the plethora of custom ROMs that popular Xiaomi devices get over at XDA, and this I am sure is going to be a blockbuster one, just like the K20 Pro from the past!! SO that's something up to try in the future!!"
5,"One of the best phones from Xiaomi, display is outstanding, camera, chipset are all the best you can get at this price, in-display fingerprint scanner is missing but trust me, side mounted scanner is more fast than u expect, this time Xiaomi has killed OnePlus in all ways possible, and also must say that the UI is much more clean and Im really enjoying the new software teweks..😊Last but not least Super wallpapers in amoled display looks insanely amazing"
5,"Such an wonderful phone , everything is fast, wonderful display and feature packed"
3,"I am a oneplus 5 user for the last 4 years. So I can only compare it with Oneplus 5. Mi 11X pro is having one of the worst front cameras. The output is too artificial. In terms of processor, it's good, but you should think twice if you are looking for a mobile with a good camera."
5,"Loved theCrisp screenSnappy processorUFS storage speedGames turbo modeCamera - awesome after tweaksDidn't like the Mi bloatware, but can be removed. Overall, a great package deal. Feels like a flagship, works like a flagship"
5,"This is my first Xiaomi device, switching from One Plus . I generally do not tend to change devices frequently, so before buying I make sure that I know what I am getting into.Why I considered this device?Wanted the flagship processor, a good display with high refresh rate and dual speakers as I consume a lot of OTT content, 5G support to make the device future ready and a slim phone profile.YaysReally good performance, day to day multitasking is a cakewalk thanks to SD 888 processorHigh touch sampling rate provides an edge while gaming, controls feel much more responsiveDisplay is really bright and vivid. The colour reproduction is unparalleled.  This display can give the flagships a run for their money, may be even beat them.Camera captures crisp and detailed images, colours are tuned perfectly (something which even OP has not been able to fix). Really loved the Magic Zoom, Slow Shutter and the Freeze frame modes.I had been a bit skeptical on the UI because MIUI has a history of pushing bloatwares and ads. It came to me as a surprise that there are no ads or bloatwares. Really enjoyed the feature rich and highly customizable MIUI.A vertical camera setup, Gorilla Glass back and slim footprint makes the device feel really premium. I really loved the back panel and how the colour changes when viewed from different angles.NaysNot a fan of punch hole display but Mi 11X Pro seems to have the smallest punch-hole I have ever seen on any other phone."
4,I got the product on time. Phone camera quality is very good and faster processing and charging are added benefits. I was able to charge my phone to 100% in leee than one hour. And it took 9 hours to discharge my phone to 1% while using hotspot and streaming high quality videos at the same time.
4,I have used iq007 legend for a week and returned it. luckily i got refund and purchased this mi 11x pro. I  generally play pubg at least 2 hours a day in HDR+EXTREME but I didn't find that much heat and frame drops in mi 11X pro but iq007 legend produced some heat and observed frame drops.  battery drop is equally more after gamming in both the devices and 33watts will be a draw back for mi11x.camera is very discouraging. details are very bad even with 108MP mode but 108MP camera in mi10 5g produced sharp detailed 108MP images. not satisfied with mi11x pro cameras.
5,"Overall KICKASS device, but some of my favourite features -- Display - simply gorgeous!, those colours - so vibrant, and so butter smooth- Processing speed - super fast - easily able to multi task.- Camera - some awesome UI optimizations - my favourite is the time freeze motion mode. The telemacro is just dope!- Very clean UI - no bloatware- This phone just feels right to hold! great hand feel.- I thought Audio zoom was a gimmick, but that actually works. Great job Xiaomi!"
5,"I am writing this review after using it for more than 15 days. If you are looking to buy Flagship mobile under 40k you can close your eyes and go for it, Performance is outstanding when use multiple apps i never see a lag and for gaming it is really awesome and coming to camera segment i have attached some pictures which i took two days before pictures says everything. Excellent flagship phone from redmi"
5,"I came to buy One Plus 9 in this portal and Found a phone which is configuration wise much better than than my previous choice . I chose to save 10K with no compromise on the product .Now the question is what are the additional benefits I got even after saving 10K ?1. Got a Bigger and much better display 6.67” Vs 6.55” ,2. Much Brighter 1300 Vs 1100 , P2i coating to support water and resistant ,3. Also liquid cooling with better refresh rate as during lockdown I keep playing games so these two features was necessary . Also I know Battle Ground Indian version is coming .Now these were only feature wise benefits . But the experience was even better got the delivery on 14th so for last 4 days includes the long Eid Weekend I kept playing games and watching Netflix .Got no heating issue , battery is too good , and screen is much better and bigger … Finally I have bought another Redmi 9 Power , with 10K which I saved  for my niece’s online class 😀"
1,Worst mobile even wastage of money if it's price becomes 10000
5,"I got the phone delivered even with lockdown in the city, thank you Amazon!i am happy with the device. The DIsplay, Camera, PHOTOS, speed - everything is just perfect.For me DISPLAY is most important - we stare at the device all day.This is probably the best display I have seen in premiurm range phones. I think E4+ Amo led and Display Mate tech is helping.Other important things are camera and speed. It has a gorgeous camera - no complains only. The device is very fast, using non stop for last few days.Other than that -It Feels sturdy and the OS is quite clean, smooth.Couldn't find an cons as such... will update if I find something.Overall: It your budget is in 40k range - don't think, just go for this device - you will be happy!"
5,Super phone with all flagship level specsEspecially performance was beast with low costThanks mi
5,"Today received my order, as of now it is excellent.Took long time for delivery due to order prioritization."
5,"I'm writing this review after using the phone for a fortnight. I will breakdown my review in terms of Pros and Cons:PROS:- Best AMOLED screen in the market. The display is of the greatest quality. From colour saturation to brightness, everything is crisp and clear.- Celestial silver looks really premium.- Side mounted fingerprint sensors are REALLY FAST. The phone unlocks in a jiffy. Face unlock also works really well.- Camera is above average, if not the best. The 104MP rear camera takes stunning images and the picture quality is superb. Xiaomi has provided some great camera features like Vlog modes which is really fantastic. Videos shot in 4K & 8K are really good.- Speaker & sound quality is THE BEST. Love it.- WiFi & network reception are working better than expected. Supports WiFi calling, which is really helpful.- Processor is FAST. RAM management is really good.- Battery life is above average.CONS:- Not a fan of Google dialer & messaging app. MI dialer & messaging apps were FAR BETTER.- Proximity sensors are not working to the best of their capabilities. I hope they fix it with an update.- Front camera is average, if you take selfies.Overall I love this phone. I won't be wrong to say that this is the best phone in the market, at this price range. In fact it can knock down some other phones which costs 60/65k, I hope you understand my hint ;)."
4,Overall an excellent phone with everything power packed. Just the issue that i found was of battery draining fast. I hope an update from Xiaomi will solve this and further optimize it.
5,"Will write detailed review later but here is my opinion, if you're confused between iqoo 7 legend, oneplus 9r & Mi 11x Pro go for Mi 11x pro considering all round performance.-Good in Camera-Performance is silky smooth-UI is very much improved MIUI 12-Android 11-Not much of a bloatware issue-Amazing Stereo speakers (Dolby Atom)-Gaming is amazing as it has flagship SD888-Not much of a heating issues as compared to previous flagship (will heat after heavy processor usage & it's normal cuz it have SD888)I would say that if you're buying a phone just for a single purpose i.e. gaming go for iqoo 7 legend it's best in class flagship processor. But Mi 11x Pro for all round usage."
5,"The Mi 11 X Pro is beautiful phone which has everything above the cut.Starting with display, being the only phone with a A+ certification is amazing, the E4 AMOLED on this is quite bright for a phone, have used a phone with such high brightness till date. Very distinct even under direct sunlight. Content watching on this phone is exceptionally good and playing games on 120Hz is a tootally different experience.Next comes the camera, the camera setup is too good, the pictures are not only near perfect on the phone but also when you use the image on your computer. The dynamic range of the phots are really good. Tried a bit of video recording and was amazed by the quality of the video recording, the time freeze motion and the audio zoom work well. By far one of the best camera's I have used on a Xiaomi phone.I was not so sure about MIUI but it seems to have become way better, there are few cool features which I can never let go but its been a pleasant experience so far, looks like Xiaomi has finally woke up to improve their software experience. The overall experience is snappy, Snapdragon 888 being the best of the best the performance matches to it, everything just works as expected.Combining all of these in a light weight yet durable form factor is a amazing."
5,"After watching a lot of videos and reading a lot of articles online, I finally decided to try out this phone. After using it for a week, I wasn’t disappointed at all. Listing down a couple of things that really impressed due to the price point for this phone:Loved the glossy black colour. Looks beautiful and very premium. The phone felt really good to hold in my hands, being super light and thin.The display was exceptionally bright, and I could really feel the colours coming alive while watching Netflix. I’m not a fan of the selfie camera in the display, but this punch hole camera was quite unobtrusive while watching movies and playing games. I really liked this.I play AoV on my phone, and was quite impressed with the smooth display and the fact that the phone was not heating up after playing for more than an hour. I guess I have the 888 processor to thank for this. Not sure if any other phone at this price offers this one.Last, but not the least, the camera here is quite good. I usually don’t experiment with different settings, and just use all default settings. Even then, the images produced were stunning. I did a quick comparison with people in my family (who use apple and oneplus) and really liked the way the colours were balanced in the photos from my camera. The level of detailing that this camera can capture is also very high.With all my office work, social media, watching youtube, movies etc.. the phone usually lasts me for 1.5 days after a single charge.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a power packed device at an affordable price. Totally worth the money."
4,"Definitely not the top tier phone yet impressed.Love the design. Snapdragon 888 has loads of raw processing power. Wifi 6 support is what I loved. 108mp camera shots are okay. Felt that the photos are much better than my old OnePlus 7Pro shots.Cons:-Hate the slow data transfer usb 2.0 port-Slow 55 minute charging.(33w Sonic charger)-Miui Bloatware (getapps, Xiaomi ads, Tencent trackers) are a hassle can be removed using debloater tool from PC.-NightMode is horrible.-Overheating issue, hopefully should be fixed with MIUI 12.5 update in coming months."
5,It is the best phone and truly a flagship at a very reasonable price.  Samsung/Oneplus: you are are looting people just due to your brand name.  Xiaomi is giving best features at best price.Please ignore the cons as mentioned in many of the views as it is a perfect phone as on date.  Everything about the phone is too nice and you will have good feeling of holding a true flagship mobile in your hand.You will not regret buying this phone rather will feel that it is truly a value for money mobile.Keep it up Xiaomi !!!  Very Beautiful Smartphone !!
5,"Writing a review after using the phone for 24 hours.Looks - This can be subjective but I love the celestial silver colour. Changes colours as light hits it. Look at pictures in my review. Bezels are thin and the phone is light weight.Display - This is my first phone with an Amoled display and boy what a world of difference. I compared it next to an Iphone 11 which has an IPS LCD panel and this display is so much better.Performance - Very snappy. No stutters in day to day usage. I'm not a gamer so can't comment on gaming performance.Camera - Very Nice. I paid extra for the 108MP sensor as compared to Mi 11X. Looks like it was worth it.Battery - Average. Normal usage got me an SOT of 5.5 hours, which is not bad and not great either.All in all very good value and in my opinion much better than OP 9R."
5,I needed a really good phone as a second device to help me with recording videos along with my mi 10. This more than satisfies the requirement. What I liked most :Camera - images come out clean with the right saturation. Some cool modes like the clone mode are fun to use with kids around the house. Great for shooting my pet dog!Display - super bright and very clean visuals. Don't know the tech terms but looks phenomenal. Think the 120 Hz refresh rate is a bit of game changer.Performance - Haven't seen any lag on any of the applications I've run including heavy shooters or video editing short clips of my dog for YouTube.Design - black is my preferred color after having lived with light colored phones ...this feels cleaner to hold. Comfortable to hold and carry despite the largeish battery.Overall a great phone and at this price it's a no brainer. Miui is also optimized for performance and has a simpler interface. Love it so far.
3,"Average phone, some heating issues, 108 MP camera just making fool as they did same in Note 8 pro, Nothing much difference when  I compare to Note 8 pro vs 11 pro in terms of speed and smoothness, when we compare the price there is Lot difference."
4,"Writing this review after using the phone for last 7 daysFirst of all, the display is superb, phone is also nice and easy to hold onto hand and lightweightIt's very fast with SD 888 and 8GB RAM, silky smooth for day to day work and gaming (gets hot after 10 mins or so)Back camera is awesome, pro feature and videos are really cool. UWD camera is pedestrian thoughBattery, drains really fast, not sure why. Forget about 120HZ refresh rate, even with 60HZ and with normal use (no game!!), phone had to be charged within the day. I found that with 60HZ, dark mode and battery saver on, phone lasts a day without charging. This is a bit disappointingNext comes the software, MIUI needs improvement. Found strange issues like error popup during first time set up. It also starts to misbehave (like touch does not work properly, or hangs sometime) after 1-2 days of use and had to restart to get over it. I hope fixes will come soon for thisOverall I still feel it is a great value for money, if software is fixed, then other than battery, phone really becomes a flagship killer!"
5,Display.  10/10Connectivity.  10/10New features.  10/10Smooth ness .  10/10Battery.  5/10.Better than one plus phone & samsungNumber one premium phone.Cons:Improve battery . Fast draining battery.
4,Some software bugs need to fix. Other than that this mobile is all-rounder
1,The phone is fast but the battery is not working properlyGuys try to buy a better phone than this but don’t do it Because of the battery problem
5,"Writing this review after a week of use.The product is better in terms of spec as compared to the nearest OnePlus and Samsung alternative & hence I bought it.The camera, processing, screen and battery performance is simply impressive.Being a OnePlus user in the past, I find this model of Mi make change to my preference to Mi as my favourite."
1,AMOLED is worst.Lot of bugs in dark mode.Interface hangs slot.9pro is much better than this model.
3,"Experience of 5 days-1. The best part is it's display.2. Stereo speaker is good enough with dolby  atmos on, lack of bass in it.3. Heating is little bit more than usual4. battery backup is average, 12nm chipsets are  better than 888 in terms of battery backup.5. performance is snappy6. miui sucks, custom roms may help it7.back camera is excellent in daylight, but it  performs below average in night8. selfie camera struggles, I found that  note 10  pro max selfie cam (16mp) does better job than  this."
4,"Today I got the delivery of this phone in my Home town. Great Service Amazon India, Thanks !!The phone is Cosmic Black, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage version.PROS:1) Very decent-looking backside cover, not you feel like the cheap plastic one.2) Came with ok  Ok clear soft case.3) Came with screen protector/cover loaded on the front screen.4) The phone is very fast, reviewed after using for 20+ hours.CONS:1) THE BATTERY LIFE IS NOT GOOD, IT DRAINS  FAST. While I am trying to set up all the needed Andriod applications in this phone, the battery drains from 38% to 5% within 20 mins of use.2) This phone is having a  Heating issue after using for 30 mins only. If I play some heavy games for 1 hour, surely I can make an omelet on the backside of the phone 😡 . This is the only reason for which I bound to give a 4-star rating to this phone.Overall this phone is good, attractive in looking (both front and back), rich in features, value for money."
5,"I think Xiaomi has killed the competition with a complete package in its latest flagship Mi 11X Pro!• The Snapdragon 888 5G is amazingly fast and delivers a great performance. I am sure the gamers must be loving it already!• The Camera with the Telemacro sensor is mind-blowing. I think Xiaomi has just nailed the camera tuning to get the perfect shots on the device. My favourite features are - the Time freeze motion mode, Clone mode and AI Skyscaping.• The 120 Hz refresh rate along with the vivid colours on the E4 AMOLED display, give a next level silky smooth experience. DisplayMate A+ display and 360 Hz touch sampling rate are perfect for gaming.• The sleek design and light- weight device is a 'thing of beauty' to hold in your hands. Not to forget the Celestial Silver variant is too pretty to behold!• Loved the clean new MiUI experience so far with reduced Bloatware and optimized battery life.Final Verdict: The best premium device with the best display, a great camera and a steal deal at this price! I have been in love with the phone!"
1,Don't buy ... because cemera is totally bad ..not working properly... Hitting issues .
2,"I have bought two phones redmi note 10 and mi 11x pro simultaneously from the amazon. One costs 12500 and other costs 40000 and to my surpise camera of redmi note 10 is better than mi 11x pro. Performance side I don't have any complaints, multi-tasking can be easily done on this phone. Camera is where Xiaomi has really cut the costs. If you are looking to buy this phone expecting that camera will perform ok considering that all other specs are flagship then don't buy this as the camera has 0 star performance on this phone.

5,Great photo Ossam phone
5,"Happy to write 1st 100% Satisfied product review regarding Tecno Spark 7 Pro (Magnet Black 6GB RAM 64GB Storage smart phone). Liked Unique features like Kids Mode, Special functions, FREE from Harrassment filter for Spam calls and SMS, chip-assisted protection, Display Eye care setting, Truely worth of price satisfied with its features. Competes well with other top branded phones."
5,"Been using it for a few days and specs really hold up. I had just bought this as it was good value for money phone I could find with 4GB+64GB. But after using it, I realized the other features like the display, battery backup and camera are all great. Screen is highlight!"
5,"I was slightly skeptical about buying Tecno but after seeing my friends use it, I went ahead. After using it for a few days I realized why Tecno is so popular. I was never into clicking pictures, but after seeing the camera in this phone, I have begun trying my hand at photography. I feel the phone does the job more than I do. Best camera ever."
5,"I loved the camera on this phone. You can check from the pictures in my review that how amazing pictures you are able to click. This phone has a whooping 89.5% of screen to body ratio. I'm a huge gaming buff and watch a lot of movies and series. The big screen is such a delight to watch on. Also, the 180hz processor makes gaming smooth. Overall, I love this phone."
5,"I bought the phone after a lot of research,as i wanted a value for money all rounder and boy there are so many options...This one has it allLOOKS -9/10 -Looks stylish,suave,upmarket and yet simple.CAMERA- 9.5/10 - Fantastic camera at this price , both pictures and videos are amazing with great ai featuresBattery,Display - 9/10Go for it if you want a vfm all rounderCONS-1.Not really a con but it has single front flash whereas the specs mentions dual front flash,so though usage wise it's not at all an issue but you expect better communication.OVERALL-9.5/10 -- GO FOR IT!!!"
1,"Not dual front flash,Only single flash"
4,"Amazing finishing, great speed worth for money."
5,The phone works well without any performance issues like time lags or apps hanging midway. The screen resolution is excellent and gives a crisp viewing experience with bright colours and good clarity. The camera has an excellent resolution and is able to take equally vivid photographs during day and night-time. I would absolutely recommend this phone to anyone who’s looking for a seamless experience at value-for- money prices.
5,"After a month use:Happy With:-Battery Life: one time charge for more than 1 Day- camera quality: 100% satisfied with the photos with good detail- Screen good for watching movies netflix, watched all episodes of Family Man 2 on this phone. Brightness and good color- so many colorful theme options"
5,"This phone is super cool, and I think 'xiaomi' , 'oppo' or 'vivo' like brands will not provide such a phone for even 16K bucks.Its a super gaming smartphone. The battery life is awesome. The phone doesn't heat even if you play games for 6 hours (I'd tried playing about 4 hours myself, and the result surprised me) . Even all the features are of superior quality. The camera is like samsung galaxy worth 45K bucks. There is such a huge amount of features I can't even state here. Suggesting everyone to buy. 😇😇😇😄😄"
5,"I was the first person to buy a Tecno in my family. And once, others saw the performance, this is the third Tecno phone. And as usual, Spark 7 pro also hit the bull's eye in terms of value for money. The camera works amazingly video calls and even for clicking pictures in the night. Best buy ever!"
4,Nice mobile to use that. Back camara excellent. Front cam not bad. Need to improve some settings. In Mobile hotspot settings not able to manage connections.Have a good battery. But slow charging.
5,"I urgently needed a phone and I bought this phone after being recommended by a friend. It seems to have everything in it. Amazing AI camera, long battery, great display etc. Moreover, it's Andriod 11. What more can I ask for? Check the pictures I posted. The camera captures great light and has sharpness. I am a happy Tecno customer."
1,Please if you found delivery by appario private limited... Please don't buy... I got 2nd hand mobile and returned. Mobile is okay okay... But I will recommend to you go with redmi not 9... Looks great... This techno looks like dagar.....youtube videos not looks good.
5,"I love the specs. I had just bought this as it was cheapest phone I could find with 4GB+64GB. But after I recieved it, I realized the other features like the display, battery back and camera are all amazing. This phone is clearly the best phone for 10k."
4,Good Mobile Phone
5,"Hello Friends,I giving first time feedback and 5* to this mobile phone for overall performance and value for 💸 with best features."

5,I wanted a gaming phone and all the other options were very expensive. I went for this and I think I have had the smoothest gaming experience ever. I face no issues like heating up and lagging. It feels like any game on this is a cakewalk. The battery also supports several hours of gaming.
5,Budget
5,"Greatest deal for Snapdragon 750 that too with Samsung. Buy blindly.There are many comments on display quality.But it doesn't matter that much , what we have to see in buying 5G phone is future proof.Buying 90hz display with cheap processor won't last you for year.This phone has one of the best 5G processor SD 750 which can last longer than others.There are few 5G mobiles Under 20 k which offers better display than this 1. Oppo A74: but in this the processor you get SD 480 , which is the basic version of 5G processor and below par than SD 750.2. Oppo a53s: which uses mediatek dimension 700 . Please don't compare media Tek Vs Snapdragon.Final verdict: You have to decide what you want. If you really looking for best 5G features under 20 k then blindly go for M42. Since no other company offers SD 750 processor for less than 20 k."
5,"Edit after a month of usage -1. Best in class battery - Full charge lasts over 2 days without fail2. Fast processor - I have more than 50 apps installed, but phone works without a glitch3. Camera - No one can beat Samsung in camera build and quality!Buy without a thought :)Got the phone delivered on same day of the sale/ launch. Super happy with whatever less I have used it till now. 😊"
1,Not.much excited compare to other all
2,"Please don't waste your money on this phone, I got attracted to the exchange offer as they are offering a higher discount. But looks like it's just a marketing trick.. they rejected the exchange offer at the time of delivery.. my phone had no scratches, no dents, no cracks, by citing some minor issues.. and I had to pay the balance amount to take the delivery.At this price point, there are many other phones/variants in the market with better features. The Display is not good at all with only HD+ whereas there are many phones in the market which are half the price with FHD+ feature. You can very well compare all the icons and graphics are pixilated.Moreover, only SIM1 is 5G, SIM2 is limited to 4G, no dedicated MicroSD slot.. its a hybrid sim slot."
5,"Got this for my mom. She loves it. The battery is amazing considering the fact that she uses the light mode while I use the dark mode. It comes with some junk but those can be uninstalled the phone is not heavy and the screen is amazing. I was skeptical about the hd display thing but the point is very few people can't differentiate between 1080 and 720 p. I definitely can't tell the difference.. The display is amazing. A freind told me that the charger is slow compared to other companies. The thing is my father's Samsung is still working fine and it's j5 prime , that's 5 years .. My stock Android had a 10 watt charger n 3000 mah n it works well, yes I play cod and all. Point it I feel that slower chargers preserve the battery decay better. Maybe it's just a feeling anyhow. I'm quite happy with the phone. The missing features on the camera will be fixed with a few updates as Samsung always does and in case it doesn't that's fine too . Phone is smooth and might heat on the first few charges but it will go away . It's quite light and slim and the best part is Samsung promises 3 year Android upgrades and four year security upgraded . The hd display with 750 gives great battery and smoothness . Amazon did an amazing job at delivery during this pandemic."
3,"I bought the phone after getting attracted to the banners only and here's what i found out after that:Pros - 5,000 mah Battery is Very good can go upto 2 days without charge, true 48 mp quad camera is upto the mark as expected from samsung, 750 g processor is excellent, 5G bands are supportive with more frequencies and lastly, Knox security plays a big role in making it better.Cons - Display is really bad only HD+ instead Samsung should have gone with FHD+ with this price and it has only 266 PPI which makes it even worse only thing good in display is that it is Super Amoled, In-box Charger is only 15W which is also dissapointing and aslo there wasn't any soft case inside the box or pre-applied screen protector."
1,No Pre-installed screen guard. No basic back cover. Short charging cable. Cheap packaging. Too much cost cutting. Disappointed.
1,Please don't buy this. Display graphics quality is very very bad and charger is also cheap quality
2,Positive..1. Design2. Built Quality Premium3. Snapdragon 7504. 5G5. Samsung PayNegative1. Always on Display not available (which is very common)2. Camera Quality not much impressive3. Very Common UI interfaceVerdict.Only buy for 5G other than not very much impressive.. it cost should bhi only 15k then justified.

1,poor quality disply .resolution very low . totaly bad phone . never buy
5,Awesome PhoneAwesome CameraLong Lasting Battery Life5G SupportGood displayGo for it blindliy..HeadPhone Jack also providedAlso a good nonchinese phone for budget gamers😎⚡
1,"I used to zoom the screen share in MS Teams in Asus Max Pro M1  - which was quite crystal clear view . But i exchanged that phone with Samsung M42 and i regret now. If i zoom the MSTeams Screen share , everything is blur and not clear . Please regret from buying this product . Its waste of Money.Updated:I uploaded two videos of flickering issue in YouTube. Please watch and decide"
1,Pixelated display clearly visible.Poor resolution.Totally disappointed with the display quality. Not expected this from Samsung.Wost buy !
5,"I got this phone for my mother and she usually  uses her phone for long term ie 3-4 yrs. In that sense this phone is future proof been a 5g ready. Also it has very good processer(great performance), good camera n decent battery. Overall happy with the product which I bought at rs 18500!!!"
5,"About exchange: someone gave a review here on amazon that the exchange offer is a scam, no it's not, I got this device on the exchange offer only and things went smoothly.Look I know there are some cons that shouldn't have been and many reviewers have already listed it here and on various other platforms, but this is a mobile and it's working and it's good. The feel and look are amazing and it's not at all heavy, it's compatible with good gaming performance. Since it is a plastic body so while charging it might heat initially but as it reaches 100% it gradually cools down, and once charged it lasts a whole day even with video calls or gaming/ When you visit the settings section there are various amazing features, themes are super cool. Overall a good buy and many have written such negative reviews according to their perspective, due to which others will think the mobile is a total piece of crap when it's not, and trust me it's a good one and you can ask me questions if you have any doubts."
1,"Pros.1) Samsung Pay ( Which they are accepting only few bank card's).Cons.1) Worst Display Quality ( Even App Icons text also Blurred)2) Taking 2 hour's 30 minutes for full charge.3) If you use mobile for normal browsing and basic use of WhatsApp battery was coming to 52% percent in 1 hour.4) Very Short Charging cable was Given.5) I have 100 mbps internet connection but this mobile hardly Taking 20 MBPS, I tested with myself old mobile it is Taking 50 MBPS.6) THOSE WHOSE PLAY PUBG THIS MOBILE IS HELL FOR THEM WORST GAMING EXPERIENCE, HANGS A LOT. (THIS ones has 6gb ram but it actually performs likes 3 ram mobile).7) finger print sensor was very slow,  FACE RECOGNITION IS DUMB.8) ABOUT CAMERA ( After facing all this I didn't check that as if I check it will definitely fail to impress).9) When I saw the mobile design after opening the box , It remembers you the Chinese mobiles design which was in 2015 with back door open to change the battery."
2,"Phone is a decent one, it has average camera and its display is relatively good for 720P since it's a s.amoled. I have noticed whenever I try to open the folder on the extreme end by any thumb, the touch doesn't get sensed, instead I have to press directly on the folder icon by the other thumb, I don't know what's the reason behind this. Apart from this software is good, but I hate the way bloatwares are been added and there is no option to uninstall Netflix or some apps. Even to torcher the user, there is automatic download of mojo app and some useless apps, hence u have to stop the auto install and other app features on galaxy store. The most concerned thing is we don't have always display on feature and the carrier aggregation. Unfortunately even the Samsung helpdesk doesn't know that this feature is not available in this phone. There are many minor issues which samsung has to fix with updates if they decide to do it.  To the given price I personally had expected better from samsung, but it's just ok. If they update the software patch it would be a good phone."
1,Camera not good
5,Using m42 5g for 2 days now and here is my review i like the battery backup it's very awesome and while buying this phone i was bit worried about it's 720p display but it's not even noticable in day to day life use so u can buy this I bought m42 5g for my father and he is so satisfied and i have use so many smartphone till the date and i got the best battery backup on this one fingerprint is like ok ok not so fast not so slow it's average and for any questions u can ask from me 😊
2,"Display quality is very vary poor for this segment of phone, otherwise I would have given it five star."
5,"Pretty Decent for daily usage. Remember the Brand Name Samsung - Don't go with the review. Snapdragon works well. Features like Samsung Pay, Knox Security and big display looks awesome 👌.  Just go ahead 😀👍👌👏"
3,Looks and colour is stylish talking about camera and battery is not at good quality
1,Am upset of weak resolution display of this mobile... it's not up to the mark ... images is also average
4,"I made right choice eventhough initially was skeptical.Though it is not a superman but an reliable  all rounder.  Before this moto g5 s plus was my all rounder.  I am not a gamer a normal user.What I liked most:1. Battery. Refer my battery observations below.2. Lag free response.3. Decent camera, though colors are over done.4. Wifi Calling is working great with Airtel sim.5. No call drop or interruptions as I faced with moto  since at my home the mobile signal strength is low.What I didn't  like1. Too big for my convenience, cannot keep in jeans pocket and in shirt pocket will be protruding.2. Samsung Apps and other default apps which cannot be Uninstalled.3. Some missing features : Poor Keypad heptics, Alarm  cannot be repeated for certain dates, etc 4.  Ring tone and alarm volume is low. if there is any other noise difficult to hear.Battery:Charging time nearly 2 hrs  when phone is switched off.1st recharge 100%:At end of 48 hrs 5% remaing.Light usage only -  20 minutes of mobile call. 1 hr You tube video, 1 hr Watsapp video, installing 10 apps, some small and wats app message sending and reading. Throught 2 sims , Bluetooth, location and wifi all where active.2nd recharge 100%:At end of 56hrs 5% remain. Usage is almost 75% compared to 1st recharge."
4,"Have been using the phone for 3 days and the only drawback is the display of the phone. If you don't mind the display, then it is a very good phone that is also future ready. The cameras are also decent. The looks of the phone are amazing. You can go for it if you don't watch YouTube or stream videos on your phone."
1,"I have purchased this model 1 day back, but I was facing performance issue on network connectivity. And my sim2 is not working in this device. With 4GB Ram what ever apps are running the same apps are not able to work with 8GB Ram. It is the defective piece.And the support is also worst where they are not able to give the refund of the amount. They are suggesting to use the same model again with the defects. They don't require any customer satisfaction."
3,"The phone was bought for using in online classes. The voice quality was poor. My students were unable to hear me with a distance of 2 feet from the device. Replaced it once, but the replacement aslo had the same issue."
5,"One day delivery by Amazon as committed..About phone- posting review after 2days of use- not very heavy, good features, battery life is good more than 1day, fast processing, superb camera"
5,Battery  for normal use  almost 2daysBoth Camera is very goodDisplay could have  FHD+ but OKNo heating issueAndroid 11  don't see big change from  Android 9Ear speaker voice vibrates in phone body5G not in service as of now...Overall Good as on 5 days review...
5,"M42 5G 8gb/128gb is a wonderful phone  and true to its specifications. In the few days I have used it I have found it very convenient to use. No heating issue, no lag in flipping through the pages, opening of Apps etc. Response to commands is fast. On screen finger sensor works good as it responds fast enough. Hopefully the 5G functions would also work to our satisfaction. It is a very good buy at its price and it is made in India."
1,This particular model has a faulty microphone that you can notice while video calling and if you ask your 5 year old child to speak on the microphone the other side will hardly be able to hear anything. I exchanged my first phone and still had the issue you with the second phone so it is very very clear that this is the issue with the model itself ...to anyone who has purchased this particular phone I challenge them please bring your kid on a whatsapp call and ask the other other person on other side to listen and identify what the child is saying ..I bet they will not be able to to hear anything at all so good luck to all the people who have purchased this defective model. . This is not expected from a brand leader like Samsung
5,Good mobile handset with nice look
5,"Today Dt.06May2021, I have received it with awesome packaging by Amazon.Battery : For full charge (0% to 100%) it takes 2 hours 15 minutes as expected (15w charger not Bad).Display : Awesome display even it's Super AMOLED, HD+ resolution with 720 x 1600 pixels resolution.Camera : Very good.Software : One UI 3.1, Android 11Mobile Appearance : Excellent especially backside it looks amazing glossy finish.After usage couple of weeks,  its really great in terms of performance,  battery of this mobile. Very much appreciated below 20K price. One can buy without second thought."
5,Got this 8GB 5G phone at an unbelievable price. Here are my observationsPro's:-1. Big Larger Display2. On screen finger print sensor3. Expecting better battery performanceCons:-1. Though ordered a black phone received a white charger2. Either 2 SIM or 1 SIM + 1 SDSlot3. Could have provided a rubber silicon case
1,"I am facing problem while calling someone, the call gets connect but their is no audio from my side means the other person doesn't hear my voice .please  provide me the solution or replace it"
5,Battery back up is good last atleast 3 days with normal usuage.Camera is decent. Overall happy with the buy.
3,"Perfect things about the phone are weight is manageable, phone is slim, attractive look, camera is fine,The only and most important thing is the disappointing display quality (hd+). Expect much much better amoled HDR display at ₹21000.You can literally see the pixels with naked eyes.Second worst thing is you cannot return the product."
5,"Great productPros:1)excellent processor. ( can feel the change. My previous phone was samsung A5 2016.)2) Excellent battery backup. (Till date. Run 1day with all sensors)3) can't realize the 720 pixel display4) camera as usual maintains its quality.5) obviously 5G (don't know, waiting only)6)My favorite Secret folderCons1) To charge the phone it takes 2h normally. (major issue)2) absence of punch hole front camera3) expecting 64 or 108 MP primary camera4) After knowing 720 p display it may disturb you.5) I personally love side fingerprint reader.6)Samsung Please provide Headphone (no headphone, No cover)"
5,Excellent smartphone with 5g connection.... Especially samsung provides this.... It is really proper smartphone as it has SD750g processors.... It has one of the interesting features which is knox security special private protection.1. Build quality - super2. Display - hd+ sAMOLED3. Connection - 5g network especially4. Security - knox5. Camera- 48+8+5+5/20mp selfi6. Finally in display fingerprint....I love all the above features. I have become fan of Samsung m42.... Love it...
2,"Phone is not up to the mark,Display is very dull,Camera performance is ok ok not awesome or an excellentBackside is glossy finish so it's absorbing too much finger printsFor gaming it's goodToo many advertisements...Themes and wallpaper are not free... You will have to buy every item.. (Weird)Charging speed is fastBattery life is goodNot worth in this price range...."
5,* pro phone* sound is decent*  look is great* camera is best part* super dooper fast charger* good battery life* 120 hz work too good lag free* sound quality is decent* rapchik gaming experience
4,"NQA return policy is the biggest challenge IQOO put this in competitive market. Delivery was super fast. Here is the day 2 experience, will share more details after couple of days.One single word if need to say - all rounder.Pros:1. Awesome Performance2. Charger with 55W3. Decent Camera with and without light4. I read many reviews but when experienced FunTouch isn’t bad overall.Cons:1. Needs to be have AMOLED instead of LED2. In display biometric would have been great3. Water drop notch for front camera gives old look4. Battery drain bit fast seems 120hz is the culprit and don’t have option to set at lower refresh rate.I don’t want to judge about 5G bands provided by different handsets now a days, as we don’t know how and when it get sorted in future."
4,"Hi, bought it on 1st day of sale got it on 11 th no reviews were posted when bought,for this, now why i bought this?Because it doesn't come with miui, to be true, value for money hardware-wise product/s are still offered by Xiaomi, but 'miui' is worse software experince ever, no matter which processor you get, then there are ads...... Poco make this better as ads are not there but then it lacks camera quality,period. And it still got 'miui'(they (Xiaomi) even remove support for devices to early)Now coming to points why buy this?1. If you can ignore tear drop and ok with lcd display, then belive me display is quite nice with 120 hz refresh rate makes it premium (and even if you buy an amoled display under 20k you will not get AlwayOnDisplay, so it defeats the purpose)2. If POCO f1 speaker was ok for you then this will be also fine sounds nearly same in decibels,(no stereo speaker here)3. Camera specially the primary and selfie are outstanding in this price range and camera app is optimised perfectly, pictures are natural, hdr is actually the Usp here, and selfie are very detailed, wide angle is ok, macro- usable, lowlight primary and selfie do ok but if little lighting is there for subject hdr pulls the job nicely here( hoping future sftware update dnt mess this)4. Fast charge 55 w is pure epic and battery backup(easy 5-6 hr sot)5. OS is well optimsed and peform better than sd 860 with miui in poco, but gpu lacks so gaming is ok but nt as gud as sd860. Note:sd860 is rebranded 855 so its still couple of year old cpu.6. Better package than one+ nord ce(in all specs) and note 10 pro max(camera wise), (if you can ignore few funtouch OS issues)7. If you want call recorder that dnt announce call is getting recorded 🤣 ( India dnt require call recording announcement by law still google dialer do it and all brands put google dialer in most global varient of devices to save money on software development)Why not to buy?1. If you consume lots of content purely, dnt buythis get amoled display (period) plus stero speaker device.(note 10 /pro/max)2. 5G is really a gimmik dnt tempt for only that.3. Camera is not your priority (because it got good camera but since it got lcd screen it might look not upto the mark but trust me it is)/or want as a secondary device.4. Pure gaming (go for x3 pro poco only if budget under 20k)5. Funtouch os is far better than miui but still got bloatware and unnecessary system permisions.(can be removed though and permissions can be denied unlike MIUI)6. Plastic back (doesn't feel that premium in hand) looks gud but.UPDATE: received 1st ota update today(17 jun 2021), they gave may security patch, fixed 3rd party apps lag issue, they fixed sleep battery backup ( have to see since device was already giving quiet good battery standby backup)  and camera focus issue for close subjects now able to focus even on extreme close subjects, hdr looks improved alot in low light, so far things working good. This update shows the camera hardware is very capabale, as software optimisation is actually showing diff on camera results."

5,I think this phone is the best in its segment.But its not all perfect though.It could have offered more 5g bands and gorilla glass 5 instead of panda glass.Because i never heard of panda glass before.I really don't know which one is stronger.
1,Only hype . not good phone as price... Realme  x7 may be better.
1,Worst mobile....don't prefer to purchase those brands like Iqoo.....
5,"I have purchased IQOO Z3 on 8 June 2021 in the launch sale and received it today that is 11 June 2021 at the price of Rs 17490. I think it is an apt price to buy for a mid-range buyer. I have initially thought that I would have to shell out Rs 19000 or more for this product. But on receiving the product at the above price range I got extremely delighted.Though I have received the product today and my usage of 4-5 hour won't reflect the product experience fully. But whatever hour phone was with me. It was a wonderful experience. Right from touch, to OS, or camera everything is phenomenal. I would recommend everyone to go for it. At the above price range it better than even Oneplus CE Nord (though it is my opinion, it can vary for others) Screen though is not Amoled but has a refresh rate of 120 Hz and the UI is extremely fantastic.I hope you all will find this product a value proposition for you."
5,"It's a Good Overall phone with Excellent in Hand feel as it's slim and light weight and packs a good 4400 mah battery which gives pretty amazing battery life and 55w charging is just blazing fast needless to say.Display size is perfect but notch looks outdated, should have provided in display camera .There's no amoled but colors are punchy , no complaints and 120 hz is very smooth and well optimised.Speakers are pretty loud and earpiece is very loud and clear even at 50-60% volume.Network and wifi quality is also very good.Cameras are pretty good front n back both.Even in night they click decent photos.Processor is excellent and 5G ready , so that's a plus point.Even the UI has improved a lot now , compared to previous one's this closer to stock android look is amazing and very smooth and fast, liked the vivo ui for 1st time, it's the biggest improvement.The only con i could figure out is the outdated notch display , rest everything is perfect especially in hand feel."
5,Loved IT 😊❤️❣️
3,Just Okay Phone.Camera Quality Is Not Good
2,"Totally waste.There is no detailed description present in amazon as well as official website.In official website they mentioned it as indisplay fingerprint (But in reality it is side mounted and that is failed concept)This is LCD display no AMOLED(After purchase only i came to know)Camera is not as good ( Because of LCD Display)Night camera mode is just a gimmick.As mentioned it doesn't gives you 50%of charge in19mins. It takes almost 35mins to get 50%, (Tried charging the device from 0) but backup is really good and lasts long for a normal usageFor the price of 23k We dont get Amoled, Indisplay fingerprint, Fast charging (in the name they fooled us), No Good front camera.If it is under 20k We may consider this worth to buy.If you planning to spend 23k spend extra 6k and go for Oneplus"
4,"Prompt delivery by AmazonAbout productGood points:Nice camera..clear images... satisfiedNight mode...amazingFast...very fast charging...highly satisfiedProcessor.... smooth and powerfulGood light weight design... highly satisfiedVolume...clearBelow points can be considered while taking decision1. Battery. Could have been 50002. Volume loud but not pleasent3. Themes wallpapers needs to buy4. It's user interface could have been better. Samsung M31 is better than this.Minor difference in display..compared to Amoled display. Ok.Overall using bank offers as well as exchange,this is great deal.To sum up, better than other mobiles around 16/17k"
3,"Apart from processor, you will not find any other awe feature on this phone. Even the handset design feels 2019. And don't get me started on the FunTouchOS🤮.Along side having a bad UI, the themes and fonts are charged on the theme store🤦🏻‍♂️.There is nothing in the world that will make me use FunTouchOS ever again."
4,Mind blowing camera. Charging speed and battery backup is superb. Ui average.Little tall but it's very handy. Touch response awesome.Just 2 days review. Will update after few days.Few apps are especially Google Chrome not updating. Same reported tried multiple troubleshooting steps. Waiting for their update.Sound is average not even comparable with my 4 years old Asus zenfone 3.
5,"1st time to use IQOO brand, never experienced this much feel by using this phone with other brandsPros:Excellent cameraBattery back upCharging time is very lessDisplayWeight of phonePerformanceSound qualityAll games easy to handleNo heating issueVery premium lookCons:Out put sound ,it is lowNot found any other major cons,Overall good phone... Definitely feel good."
1,Primary Camera quality is totally unsatisfactory. If u r buying this phone for camera than please don't buy it.
1,It is clearly mentioned 7 day return. Still i was asked to explain the issue and the call went on for 30 minutes with amazon. Totally disappointed with amazon. Phone is not upto the mark it has lagging issue hence returning the product.
4,"Daam ke anusar ye smartphone bohot achha hai, saund ke yalava mujhe kuchvi complaint nehi hai ....Lekin iski performance bohoooot hi achha hai ..Very good product ❤️"
5,"Excellent phone! The UI is very good, clean and responsive! The specs are really good at this time considering the specs offered by competition at this price. Display is very good despite being LCD. I personally love the colors & contrast of LCD over contrasty AMOLED panels in this price range and it's totally an individual's choice. Trust me, the display is excellent! Yes, every phone has some cons but it really doesn't matter. No phone can be perfect! Specs wise, this is the best phone to consider right now under 25k after Poco X3 pro. Samsung's GW3 Camera sensor is also good! These days, majority phones are delivering good cameras! I generally use GCAM mods to unleash the camera's true potential. A good overall package in this price!"
5,It's literally the best phone in the market for this price bracket.Pros-1. Good looking design and very Vibrant display.2. Very fast processor. It's a delight for gamers.3. Amazing battery (Lasts entire day easily even after heavy usage and charges very quickly)4. Camera ia AMAZING. Couldn't imagine such high quality camera from a phone of this price. Very clear and sharp. Even in low light it takes very clear pictures.5. Great RAM management.6. No heating issues.Cons-Couldn't see any as of now.
1,"Phone for more or less value for money considering specs,Phone is a little bulky and thickMAJOR concern is, unlike other phone, this phone keeps asking so many(so many!!!) permissions, I feel this is a privacy/security issue as you can't keep reading each and every terms and conditions, it seems theg are trying to exploit people and their privacy by offering high-specs in low cost. I STRONGLY DOUBT THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF GATHERING SO MUCH OF PERSONAL DATA."
5,Amazing mobile......Pocket Friendly.....Latest Processor & Software ....5G Technology.......Good 64 MP Camara.....Side Mounted Fingerprint .....Big Screen..... Perfect Design and most importantly 55 w Charging Speed and Great120 Zh Refresh Rate... Everything is Awesome....Only concern is that battery has to be 5000 mah and Screen should be Amoled.Thanks Amazon for fast delivery.
3,"Camera Quality is Average.Display Quality is good.Battery Backup is good.Fast charging feature is awesome.Phone Operating is awesome.Unnecessary Application around 15, and even you can't disable them."
4,"Got my phone delivered just yesterday. Here is a one day review. Phone feels nice. Great camera. A little heavy but not bothersome. (Or maybe I think it's heavy because my last phone weighed practically nothing). Fingertouch sensor and facial recognition works fast and works well. The back body is not glass but appears glass. I like that, as one thing which I don't like is visible fingerprints on my phone. No heating issues. The touch is super fast. Good sensor.Only a few bugs like while using Netflix, for an initial 1 min or so, the video hangs a little. Never faced anything like that in any of my other phones. But I am sure company will get rid of it soon. Will update.Update:I have been using this phone for over a week now. Charges really really fast. Good battery backup. Goes on for more than 24 hours. Great camera. Night vision clicks some really good pictures. Overall phone is nice. I have reduced the refresh rate to 60hz. Phone is big in size but doesn't feel that heavy. Initially I have 4 stars but I am satisfied with it and would mark it 4.5 if not 5."
5,"Ordered this for my nephew, my main concern was pubg performance. Thankfully works butter smooth with no heating at all. Only concern is tons of pre installed app which can't be removed. Amazon delivered it within 24 hours of launch. Overall satisfactory purchase."
4,For Gaming One Of The Best Under 20K....Camera Is Not As Par!Battery Life Is Not Good!!Cannot Go For 12 Hours...
5,"Im one of those who ordered it immediately on the launch.However disappointed with amazon delivary, took 8days to deliver it.Recievedd the mobile with 30% charging which exausted in 3 hrs due to intial process of shifting data. As advertised charged 50%in 19 mins and later on slowed a bit eventually finishing the charging in 1 hr,Battery heats a little while charging. Screen is butter smooth, bright, refresh rate can be adjusted however i choose smart rate.Battery easily last for a day or more for a moderate user.Few of the preinstalled apps can be uninstalled.As of now happy with the purchase..No cons found..Though not 100% happy with camera however im not a ardent user of camera."
4,Good phone in all respect except worried about screen durability as Panda glass is used. Price is slightly more as it is 5g phone with all good features. In future price of 5g phone come down as we see lot of compition in mobile companies.
2,"First of allMy advice- Just don't buy it. 5G in India is all but a gimmick for now. It won't arrive any sooner than mid 2023. Buy a good phone with Super AMOLED display, Good built and design, good camera.Pros-1. Delivery was on time.2. Charging speed is fast as claimed by IQOO.3. Battery backup is also good4. 5G phone with two bands n77, n785. SD 768G is great6. Good for gaming7. 120 Hz refresh rate feels like butter8. I've not encountered any adds till nowCons-1. Weight is on a little higher side2. No AMOLED display3. Backpanel is fingerprint magnet4. Whole plastic body5. No premium feeling6. Old water drop noth7. Big chin on bottom and side bezels are significant8. Built and design isn't good9. Software experience is worst I've used. Funtouch OS 11 feels like it has been created by a kid. It's really worst. I've used MIUI, Stock Android, ColorOS, Realme UI, One UI and in my opinion Funtouch OS 11 isn't good for any phone.10. Too much bloatwareNote- I haven't tested the camera yet. I'll update about it later once I get to test the camera."
4,"Writing it after 3 days of usage.Display is good, 120hz refresh rate make it smooth. Viewing angles area also good. I'm able to watch 1080p videos in prime. Last free processor handle all day to day task. I'm not a gamer, so no comments on it. Battery performance and charging is good. I'm getting more than 1 day battery life. Camera is good in daytime, i didn't like the beautify mode eventhough its off. Also pictures are not oversatueated. Gcam producing better images.Problems:Unable to lock screen via power of button as clicking it take screenshot. Same with volume down button. Mighty be software glitch, but even after couple factory reset same issue. Due to the issue unable to power of the phone.Lot of pre installed apps, Adobe can be disabled and removed."
5,"Iqoo z3  delivered to me on 11 june , first of all i have tested the camera the camera quality is to good and it supports 1080p with 60 fps video recording and having stability in video while walking , all people wants pubg review i have played pubg for an hour in smooth-extreme the gameplay is too smooth but sometimes little frame rates drops  but that's not a big issue , the temperature after 1 hour gaming  is almost 41 degree celcius , the  battery does not drain too much , if someonw has lag issue in iqoo z3 you can have a cooler facing the mobile as well as you, the mobile gets full charge in nearly 50 minutes ,at last but not the least i can say u guys can go for it"
5,"Phones in last few years have become all about camera. Offer higher megapixel, show some night photography and you get a device for more than a laptop, 2 wheelers or even best of TVs. The madness had to stop! The sensible is here!Pros:1. Reputed superb quality Snapdragon processor2. Screen response rate automatically adjusts to your usage - upto 120hz!3. Good battery, superb quick charge & cooling ensures phone doesn't heat up - hence preserving life of the battery4. Good customization of OS, some v handy features5. Good placement of fingerprint sensor which is lightening fastCons:Just slightly on the heavier side (comparable to most phones though). Rest will know after more usageBut overall a serious contender for even 30k phones!"
5,Everything is fine but 3 major thing was not good..1. No Amoled screen.2. No punch hole front camera.3. Low bass its compromising sound system.............________But_________.........4. Battery🔋 Life is awesome.5. It's a gaming beast.6. Powerful performance.7. Hardcore unbeatable segment.🧐8. U have to go for it.9. Promising this was really osm..10. #Iqoo_india love from #Ranchi..🇮🇳It's worth and it's value for money . I'll get this at 20k.
1,It took 39 mins to charge 50% battery.Battery drains fast.Camera ok ok. Not so good.I have doubt about service centre as locations mentioned in phone for servicing are limited and not available in mumbai.Lots of inapp notificationsWould suggest another phone instead of this.
4,"Awesome phone with all required specs for user. It's been three days since I am using this and belive me , it's still 18% battery left after using music and browsing all stuffs on phone, few videos on youtube. 66w charger - one hour full charge from 31% intial day. Photos are exceptionally wonderful with superb clarity. I AM NOT A gamer , so haven't tried that. Was searching for a good phone from long time m glad I found this n bought it on launch day.."
3,"I bought the on day 1 of the sale. As usual Amazon deliver was good at my place. I was not very excited to open the phone as I didn't expect too much for 20k (8GB + 256 GB variant). After couple of hours use, I was very much Oki with the phone as mobile display was not that great which was my first impression, Camera was good for outdoor photography, but indoor it is not that great. Too many permission they ask for using IQOO mobile, almost compromising all the privacy(I'm not sure other brands get every detail like name, dob, sex, address, location,Geo location, search history, logs about your usage and share it to third party outside the country!). I was set back by reading the privacy policy. I checked my Samsung privacy policy, it was not to such an extent. Coming back to the phone, I charged the phone expecting quick charge with 55W charger to my disappointment it took an hour to Full charge. The phone is good performance wise but don't know about the longevity. For 20k it looks plastic and videos doesn't play full , black area in the sides. Overall I would say all shown in specs are true but there are lot of compromises which one should do."
4,Good phone hardware but need software improvement. Fonts of notifications and sms are too small. Bigger font option is required for whatsapp and sms. No option to increase notifications font size is annoying. IQOO must improve this in fun touch ota update.Battery drains early compare to Realme mobiles.No Gorilla glass protection.Auto hide side assist bar for regular apps is not available in fun touch.Amoled screen is missing.Rom is UFS 2.1 must be UFS 3.0
4,"Display, Battery, Performance is Good...etcEverything is Good except Camera.....poor clarity"
5,Really loved itOnly thing is 32 GB I can not understand about that
4,Good prodect or too let my delivery  so betifull
4,Good sound & value for money
5,good product
3,हेडफोन नहीं था
4,Super
3,Value for money.
4,Nice product in this price... Good quality and look is aswm... Punch hole Camera and display is very attracting. Camera is also perfect and battery capacity is very high. This phone is no doubt very much good.
1,"Don't go for this mobile as I face issue with network signal after 2days only and I tried call to customer care of amazone they said me it's issue with your sim card but as I ask my sim card customer care they said it's new updated sim card and and i have issue with both sim card which has different network then how both sim has issue in same time, every time costomer care give me some reason to do this that but yes in my mobile I feel it has some issue because of that it's network gone for more than hour and also it hang in between gaming and use as it has 6gb ram and good processor."
5,Beauty and the beast combination with snapdragon......
4,"Got the Note 9 Pro in Galcier White Colour on first sale itself. I skipped Note 8 Pro. Swift Delivery with Amazon. After spending a few weeks with it, here's my experience. I keep switching phones often and let's see if Note 9 Pro is the ideal phone.Design:Awesome design. I like the center placed punch hole camera, it gives a overall sense of symmetry. The Aura Balanced Design is premium. Glass Front & Back With Curved Edges. Plastic Frame. Phone comes with a silicon back cover in the box and a plastic screen guard pre applied on the screen. Looks really nice with the white colour but due to 20:9 aspect ratio and large screen, it is a tall phone, quite difficult to handle single handedly even with my big enough hands. Also I now need to buy jeans with bigger pockets because in my wardrobe I couldn't find a jeans that could accommodate this phone comfortably. Although It is a nice premium looking design but not practical due to being tall which hinders one handed usage. Also the camera bump is protruding a few millimetres but Xiaomi claims that the Camera module is also coated with Gorilla Glass 5 Protection so it should be scratch resistant to some extent.Display:Screen being an IPS LCD Full HD+ Panel is large at 6.67 inches with 20:9 aspect ratio, is tall and not too wide. Bezels around are very slim and the chin is minimal. Screen to body ratio is impressive. It's certainly big or tall in vertical terms. Quality wise the screen is good, brightness is satisfactory for indoor and outdoor usage but the screen is not as vivid or lively as AMOLED screens. Viewing angles are good. Little bit colourshifting can be noticed when viewing from different angles. No higher refresh rate though which everyone kinda expected. Touch response is good, not too fast or too slow even when playing PUBG. Brightness could've been more for better outdoor visibility under direct sunlight. Reading mode is there to filter harmful bluelight. Overall, display quality is good and satisfactory.Sound Output:Sound quality is clear and loud through the speaker, thought lacking on bass and instruments. Call quality is loud and clear as well. Earphone output is little disappointing. I have premium sounding earphones which sounded better on my previous phone but the sound output via the 3.5mm jack is quite low on the Redmi Note 9 Pro so you've to crank up the volume and let's not talk about the richness of the sound which is completely lacking. While playing PUBG Mobile with Earphone plugged in, I could barely hear the footsteps in the game and had to crank up the volume to max. Everyone should report this earphone sound quality issue to Xiaomi. Update: Low Volume Level in earphones has been fixed after OTA update but the richness in audio is still lacking.Performance:Performance is fine even on the 4 GB 64 GB Variant. Didn't see any lag or shutter while performing normal day to day tasks, thanks to Snapdragon 720G Chipset built on a power efficient 8nm Process. Now the big question, can it handle PUBG?Yes, you can play PUBG Mobile with Smooth & Ultra (40 fps) Combination and HD & High Maximum but the game is not properly optimized as it is a new chipset. I played PUBG for 2 straight weeks on Smooth and Ultra Graphic settings and noticed the game freezing in classic and other modes for a few seconds in almost every match.. Earlier I used to play PUBG in Smooth & Extreme (60fps) option on my previous phone so playing in Ultra (40fps) on Note 9 Pro feels little downgrade. Gameplay was smooth for most of the part but frame freezes quite frequently which made the gameplay not so enjoyable. Didn't notice any heating issues. Temp was mostly under control. Another problem I encountered with PUBG is the low sound output from the earphone (Ant Audio W56 or any other) plugged in. Xiaomi should rectify this issue ASAP!Update: Low Volume Level in earphones has been fixed after OTA update.Cameras:Talking about the camera quality, I am not impressed with the Note 9 Pro. The quality is average, default 12 MP shots from the main camera lack details when zoomed in and look oversharpened along with a warm colour tone and noise and other post processing artefacts quite visible even in good lighting conditions. HDR is a hit or miss most of the time. There's a new option in the camera app to boost colours similar to Chroma Boost feature found in Realme Smartphones. 48 MP shots look a little better especially in terms of details in comparison to default 12 MP Shots. Front camera quality is average as well. To be honest, I'm little disappointed with the camera output but it's not a major issue as I have a Nokia 808 PureView as my go to Camera Phone since 2014. You could install GCam Mod for better quality output as Camera 2 API is supported out of the box.Connectivity:Had no issues with WiFi or Bluetooth. It has support for NavIC, India's own satelite for navigation. No issues with location services.Though didn't notice a faster location locking using NavIC. Cellularr Network Strength I found is little low in my experience, because the same SIM Cards inserted in my other phone used to provide better network reception, as a result, the download speeds are somewhat lower on Note 9 Pro. Will test further and update here.Battery is rated at 5020 mAh and Xiaomi is providing 18W Charger in the box. If we remember a year ago, 18W was considered fast but this time it has a larger capacity battery than previous Note series smartphones. A full charge normally takes more than 2 hours which is not bad for a 5000 mAh battery. Everyone this time expected Xiaomi to provide a charger rated at 22W or more. The global variant ships with a 22W Charger. Why Xiaomi? Battery can get you more than a day depending on your usage so it shouldn't be a problem. It's good for long gaming sessions as well.Some really important features worth mentioning:It has 2 SIM Card Slots with a dedicated MicroSD Slot so it's a good decision on part of Redmi/Xiaomi. The charging port is Type C which I appreciate. Fingerprint Sensor is mounted on the Side Power Button and it's fast to unlock the phone. You have the option to choose whether to press the power button or just touch on it to unlock the phone. IR Blaster is another nifty feature to control various electronic appliances. It works well with my Set Top Box so no need of reaching the remote everytime I want to switch channels or lower the volume. Fortunately there is a notification LED next to the earpiece, though you only get a single white colour. Still I consider the notification LED as an essential feature.OS:It's running MIUI 11 on top of Android 10. I liked MIUI during Redmi Note 3 times when it was a clean UI and had no Ads or content recommendations feature inbuilt. Still It's packed with features and offers a lot of customization though the amount of bloatware is ridiculous. Thankfully almost all of them can be uninstalled which I recommend. Content recommendations and ads can be partially turned off. Just don't like that there's no option to uninstall the Mi Browser.So to sum it up, I would say it's a good phone for the price except for a few things.Pros:Premium Design.CGG 5 Protection Both Sides.Nice Display Quality.Good Sound Via Loudspeaker.IR Blaster.Good Performance.Less Heating.Very Good Battery Backup.Cons:Quite Tall So One Handed Usage Is An Issue.Protruding Camera Module.No 90 Hz Refresh Rate.Average CamerasPUBG Mobile Not OptimizedNetwork Reception & Download Speeds Should Be Improved."
1,The phone looks very good and premium but I noticed it lags and camera isnt that good..m facing hardware issues as well..on call the other person can't hear my voice .
2,Poor camera quality. Breadth too wide to grip well
3,Camera Protrait mode Not good but 48 MP cam GoodScreen protector pre-applied very bad quality (patch on screen )Interstellar black colour awsmeTouch also not good (Need Amoled Disply)Refresh Rate Very Low around upto 30 HZSide Mounted Fingerprint Sensor Really Faster18W fast charger - 47% to 100 % Battary Charge Time 1 Hr 21 MINWaste of money
3,I'm not satisfied with this mobile bcs internet speed was very slow.. Before this phone i use samsung galaxy Note 5..comparing to samsung note 5 I feel speed of the internet was slow in this phone and another prblm i found in this phone was wireless headphones was disconnect automatically...
3,Redmi note 6 pro is much better option as compare to this phone.Battery is goodLookwise ok.Charger getting heat within 20 to 30 min. Charging is also slow.Camera is also not so good as mentioned.Overall 3 points out of 5.Not a good option to purchase so wait for redmi note pro max.....
4,"Even when you are holding it in your hand, fingers keep touching scanner every now and then. Scanner placement is very wrong. Otherwise phone is good."
1,Redmi note 9 pro mobile after purchasing 2 days mobile display showing vertical shades lines and flickering.defective piece
4,Fingerprint reader is working with quick actionBattery life is also good but it takes more time to chargeCamera quality is also good and front camera is not satisfying meGood mobile for playing pubg with her graphics
2,"As a left hander i have a habit of controlling phone with left hand. but the company gave a fingerprint censor on the right side of the phone along with power button. so you have to learn using it from your right hand.  problem is also same with the notification bar. if you are using phone with left hand then you will obviously swipe the notification left. but it won't allow you to swipe the notification left. you have to swipe it right. this is so irritating.problem doesn't end here. it start hanging on the very 3rd day of purchase. and now its speaker gone mute with no reason. if you want to irritate someone, please gift this useless smartphone.and every time i plug in a earphone a message pop up displaying 'do not cover the earphone area and screen got blocked'. i don't why this kind of feature is there.camera quality is good but if you try to zoom the picture, it will pixelize.so disappointing smartphone."
3,Mmaxmum time camera  open problem
1,Display quality very very poor.. Edges you can find dull light background..  During call speaker quality is very very low in outdoor conditions.. While listening music equilizer support basic 5 band equilizer.. Out of 4 Gb memory left only 1.5Gb..means poor RAM management even no apps are running background.. Finally cheated Mi India with over hiphed redmi note 9 pro without basic phone features.. Camera quality also very poor with lot of noise in the picture pixels.. Hope Amazon will allow me to return this product. don't fall in Trap with hardware configuration in Paper.
5,Excellent. Nice phone. Thanks to Amazon first I received a defective product. Immediately they replace it and send me brand new phone. Thanks to Amazon
1,Touch screen in many spots not responding while gaming.
2,Had poor charging speed. Battery/ charger was faulty and had to return.Rest all good had no issues. Item returned and refund received. However lost some money in international transaction fees.
4,The phone is all over very good in this but I get little disappointed with the in-box cover which was provided by xiomi. They could have provide better quality cover in dark shade as the transparent cover gets yellowish in some days and the weight is little bulky as I am using one plus 6T as well which is too light in weight in comparison with note 9 pro.
1,"Please don't buy...Worst front camera and frequent WiFi dropping issue....1) Absolutely worst camera.. All images from main 48mp camera are grainy and blurry..Brought this phone on Very first sale just before lockddown began..Waiting for the lockddown to end so that i can ask for replacement...Even when I zoom photo very little, it shows that camera has failed to capture even a details.. Slight zoom breaks photo making it absolutely blurry...I doubt if the phone has 48mp or sensor is damaged... Better go for phones with Sony sensor and not Samsung...Even the photos taken from My redmi note 6 pro are sharper...2) Wifi issue: WiFi keeps dropping for four to five times a day.. I need to restart the phone often every day to reconnect to WI-FI...I REALLY don't know if xiaomi had put Enough testing and quality control on this phone... Seriously Xiaomi has absolutely disappointed me this time...Better increase ur bugget and go for POCO X2...Just waiting for lockdown to end so that I can ask for replacement from service center...."
5,Pros -- Good Battery Life- Awesome design- 720G processor is Fast and less power  consuming- Camera is Adequately Good- NAVIC is supported- Touch is very responsive- Side fingerprint is fastCons-- Mobile is little heavy (210gm)- 64mp camera should have been given- 60 hz screen- There are ads in miui but can be stopped easilyOverall the Phone is value for money.
1,Please stop using this phone. This is my experience this phone is throwing too much radiations that you will loose your eyes. I purchased this on 24 may till now my eyes are in pain. I visited Doctor today . He has given me medicines for next 6 months. I am requesting them to return this phone but customer care no is invalid. Please help me to return this phone.
1,"I bought this phone on May 26th sale, I have used it for two weeks nowSo what I have observed:1. There is nothing in this phone except bigger battery and side fingerprint2. They are advertising top gaming GPU, but the games like COD PUBG loads slower than Redmi note 83. Takes very long for full charge, 4-5 hours4. I have faced glitches while playing games, like sound stops or decreases on its own5. Camera stops and needs phone restartSo i would suggest to buy some other phone as it is not good for gaming"
1,I want to return this item not working properly
5,Awesome phone with nominal rate.Pros: 1. Good features and battery.2. Good for gaming(pubg)3. Android 10 is smooth.4. Fingerprint is located in comfort position. Fingerprint sensor response is really good.5. Huge display.Cons:1.bloatware apps.2. Battery lightly heats up when charging. (Quick charge 18w is reason I guess) if you remove backcase. Then it may cool down.3. Bit heavy 208 g. (While playing game I can feel it)If you manage cons then it's really premium phone to buy.I was iphone6s user. When I thought it won't match to iphone. But the phone doesn't disappoint me. I really happy with my purchase. It is also come with pre applied screen protector and transparent case. I never liked redmi UI earlier. Now Xiaomi really improved all features. Phone looks premium model. About performance it's not at all lagging.I bought 6 gb ram and 128 gb internal variant.Overall its worth every penny.Go for it.
2,"performance is very bad.. even when I opted for 6gb ram.lags, stucks many times.. annoying.camera is good and battery is fine"
1,Please don't buy camera is not working properly
1,"I've bought Redmi note 9 pro on the 1st sale. I've been having issues like 'voice disappearing during call', i. E.  The other person is unable to hear me after 1-2 min into the call , especially in primary sim slot. I've already submitted the issue as feedback.Also, let me know if anyone else is facing the same problem.Amazon is not accepting replacement. Buy this phone at your own peril"
1,Worst I have have seen till now. Don't even think of buying this kind of mobile. Not even 1 month completed the purchase of this mobile. Ex-Mobile is so worst if you change lockscreen wallpaper mobile will get hang you can't on the mobile. So many issues. So please don't even waste your time by seeing this mobile in amazon.
4,Battery performance 4/5 display 4/5 phone performance 4/5 billed quality 5/5 overall average device no any major issues my honest review
5,"Excellent.. 1st day sale.. 4th redmi set after 1s,3s prime, and note 6pro (2014-16-18 and now in 2020).. Previous one also bought 1st day 1st hour sale.. But this time, I have able to purchased the blue colour.. Very nice design and colour.. Its 2nd day and still 40% charge remains.. Awesome picture quality.. Very much happyOrdered 17-3-20, arrived 18th March.. But due to card payment problem rescheduled the order very next day in office address.. Finally received 19-3-20.. But very happy to purchase this phone"
1,My Earphones jack was defected. Due to non availability of wired earphones in the market as shops were closed during lockdown i couldn't check it during  the return period of 10 days. And now i am unable to even apply for refund or replacement.  Amazon is not even considering exceptional circumstances. Don't buy it from here since there are defaults that you may discover after 10 days but then you won't be able to apply for return or even replacement. The device i got was actually faulty.. nowadays its camera also won't open sometimes.. I am highly disappointed with Amazon's service.
5,"This phone is fantastic just wow it's as good as I expected , battery is almost 2 days , gaming experience is fantastic , display quality is awesome , best camera at this price , just go for this phone even if the price is 15000, amazing work #mibest"
2,"Good looking phone due to glass panel. After handling won't make it up to the mark as compare the price. The display lacks the response as compared to the same price tag mobiles in the market. Also, Mi claims FHD+ display but looks very outdated screen; It may be because of a low refresh rate. Face recognition for unlocking screen work slightly slower as compared with other brands. The placing of the rear camera looks very premium. But as per the current trade-in market, the company provided 48MP seems very outdated. Over the period, the rear camera will be getting lots of scratches, even if you have the protective cover to the mobile. The mobile comes with Fast charging by 18W, which is very slow as considering the 5000 mAh battery. To charge the mobile completely, it takes ~2hr. As per current trade, Mi should provide a 28W or 30W charger. The company offered Clear soft case, which is very cheap quality and it is not clear. It looks just some very cheap robber soft case. Lastly, the mobile comes with 3.5 jack for headphones, and people always prefer to buy a Bluetooth headset. I feel; instead, a 3.5 jack company should offer the dual speaker."
1,Don't buy this mobile even by mistake.Sure hangs 1 to 2 times a day.A lot of heat occurs when the mobile is used more.I am very sad and frustrated buying it
5,"I must say .. it's the best in this price range..Being a mi fan after 5pro this is my update to 9pro .. looking forward to buy the beast mi 10 when the sale will starts..Camera 4/5Screen 4/5Sound 5/5Battery 5/5Fingerprint Scanner 2/5Charging 3/5Ram/memory 5/5 (6gb/128gb)Overall a complete package of looks,camera,battery and performance..2 things lacks in note 9 pro - 1 is charger charged slowly and 2nd is finger print touch which is in the position where it do get touched unintentionally..Hoped that it contains the same camera like 9pro max in the same price but still its the best..Love u Mi"
5,"I waited 3 months finally got delivery I paid 1200 ... But mobile is good, it's amazing features fingerprint reader work smooth..Huge battery backup...Just a problem in sometimes when I unlock my mobile the screen did not show any icon just wall paper.. Please solve this software problem"
2,"It has both pros and cons.#Coming to pros :1. It has best quality of both the cameras front and back.2. Battery life is Excellent.3. Mobile Outlook is awesome.4. Side fingerprint sensor working fast and response is good. #Coming to Cons :1. Sometimes while opening camera it shows ""can't open camera right now, "" Error on the screen.2. While attempting the call by using Bluetooth headphones sometimes call has been disconnected and hanged.3. Front camera on the screen disturbs as it seems in between the screen, while playing pubg and any other games i feel bad gaming feel."
4,Superb... Smartphone value for money....Feels like it looks awesome and crispy displayShould and could buy.... 👌But very demanded phone in flash sale😁✌and finally one more the face unlock won't 100% work at night😞
1,The phone got hung up while an incoming call was done. The entire screen got black. Could not do the operation to recieve the incoming call. This happened thrice within two weeks of purchase. Seems some defect in the phone. Did not expect such a bad product from Redmi . I m a regular user of redmi phone. My earlier redmi note 5 pro is working fine for last two years and no such issue with my earlier phone. Redmi needs to ramp up the quality of their mobiles. seems they are compromising on quality after achieving success on the brand earlier. This is not good. Shame on redmi for fooling customers.
1,Lo quality product and old features mobile phones
1,Battery Issue.... Phone is Heating during Charging and During Running Application.
1,Facing heating issue while using camera app and general usage in 60hz refresh rate if I use 120hz it gradually heating issue increase please solve this problem
5,"My first time buying a OnePlus phone and I really like the finish of the one. Camera is excellent, Android 11 is very smooth to use, functions are fast.Just my first day of usage so hard to be critical of anything. The downside for me is that there is no place expand the memory."
1,Within 10 minutes of usage. It’s felt like over heat. I can’t experienced any mobile like this.
2,"Iam OnePlus user since 4 years, I exchange my one Plus 7 pro mobile with OnePlus 9 R Not expected From One Plus, quality is not good, Look like cheep mobile, camera quality also not good, one Plus 7 pro superb mobile, totally iam disappointed with 9R."
1,I don't why no reviewer is speaking about it. It was heating with a normal usage.
5,After 5 days of usage writing this review.1. Best camera quality for the price2. Snapdragon 870 is doing its best in speed with 120Hz display. - Best3. 65W charger takes only 35 min to charge 100% from 15%. - Best4.  Fluid amoled display is awesome on its smoothness. - best5. Lake blue colour is simply awesome 💙Issues1. Facing very lite heating issue.2. Found a bug and informed OnePlus customer service which is if we turn on call recording on call it indicates opponent also that we are recording call. They told they will correct it in next update. Hope this will be cleared but not sure.I give 95/100 for this mobile.
4,"I am writing down this after using for a couple of days. I got the carbon black one with 12GB RAM.  Overall the device is good, and honestly is the reskin of one plus 8T with lower price 😁.  I will list down the pros and cons -pros -1. With Oxygen OS 11, the overall user experience is quite smooth. You will get an update as soon as you finish setup.2. The Warp 65 fast charging is fine, takes around 35 mins for one full charge.3. The screen to body ratio is good.4. The matt finish on the back side is awesome.Cons -1. Battery drains a little fast, not sure if some future updates will fix it.2. Rear Camera is ok, can be better.3. I would have preferred popup front camera, rather than the punch hole.4. For dual apps, I would have loved to see the option for all apps. Right now it has support for few.5. support for few more 5G bands will be good to have."
3,"Writing after 4 Days of use1. Heating Issues -you will start noticing from the very first use2. Battery - charges 0 to 100 in just 35-40 mins but also drains so fast. Need to Charges twice in a day after using whatsapp, some browsing, calling.3. Camera - Not very good. Less than as expected. Think twice before buying if you are camera enthusiastic.4. Smooth- 120hZ and 60hZ both condition works well. I found it smooth to use and open apps5. Snap 870 processor really works.6. Other Oneplus features works good.7. Not a flagship phone.Money and Decision is yours..!!Thanks"
3,"I have recieved this new phone yesterday. Since I have started using its been heating all the time, while on charge, playing games etc.. All other things are pretty good."
1,"OnePlus 9r is best of both world that you get from samsung and apple. I would rate full 5 stars for mobile except camera and heating issue. Also, the delivery experience while exchanging mobile turned out to be worst. Hence rating overall 1star for the bad and worst humiliated experience. Now I'm afraid to order again from Amazon."
1,"Worst phone by one plusHeating issues :yesBattery drain : yesPhone hang or crash : twice in a dayPhone needs a restart daily else it will stop working. Once it's restarted all settings changes to default.Dissatisfied, disappointed by one plus"
1,"HiPlease consider this message with a serious note the One Plus 9R which was bought on the above mention date got hanged and did not open exactly on the 13th day of buying it. The replacement policy was only for 10 days and my phone showed prblms from the 13th day. I took it to the One Plus Care Centre and they said it needed an update i waited for 3 days for the 'So Called' update to arrive but after 3 days the Care Centre informed me that this phone needed a Motherboard change when i ask them to replace the phone, they said that the care could not replace it for a new one because i had bought from amazon. They are now suggesting to replace it through amazon only. Is this what i bought a 40k One Plus phone for? If i can only tag the Oneplus company people in this!!!!!What kind of mobile phones do they sell???And also i want to claim a replacement of my phone from Amazon....i just dont care if the 10 days return policy is over.... I just want to say that i bought a 40k worth phone from you guys... And that it doesnt work...been waiting for more than 7 days now....with a ""Dabba"" phone in hand..... Is this the kind of service you provide??? I really would like you to have my phone replaced at the earliest Reply back soon......"
5,Review after 3 days usePros1) Build quality is awesome with aluminum frame and mate finish carbon black2) Display full HD+ Amoled screen display with 120hz refresh rate gives you the smooth experience3) The Snapdragon 870 processor will gives you good gaming experience4) Main camera is doing good performance with good picture quality and nightscape video is awesome and camera features were good5) usb-a to usb-c 65wat charger helps to full charge in 30 minCons1) It has heating issue after using phone for 40 min continuously2) Batery drain so fast as iam a heavy user it last me around 15 hours3) macro camera Is doing a worst performance
5,"An overall decent phone. The clean software experience would be the reason to choose this instead of Mi 11X or IQOO 7. Hardware wise it's more than capable. The camera I would say , is decent. It depends on your photography skills. The sensor specs only matter so much, I would say invest some time in learning photography. Check the photos attached. If you are a power user , this is one of the best value for money phones at this segment. For the custom rom folks , the kernel is open sourced, so in a year can expect decent ROM. I think IQOO bootloader is not unlocked so keep that in mind."
1,"First of all, it is hearing every time I use camera and play games. And picture quality is much below average. I previously owned Oneplus7 T and I had to sell that in order to buy this one. It was a wrong decision. The sensor is so bad and whenever I click a photo it is never detailed but only superfluous. I am disappointed."
1,Disappointed. This was my first purchase of oneplus phone and I was so eager to get a hand on it. But seriously there is need for improvement. Battery is like a candle as it is draining easily. Product has no premium finish. Also the display is not up-to the mark. They're claiming it as a gaming phone and sorry to say that you can't use it as a gaming device. Also the camera is average. Please don't go for it as there are lot of other good smartphones in the market with same set of features for 40k. Big no from my side. One plus Nord is better than this and I would recommend One plus should call back entire.  9R series.
5,From One plus 3Then One Plus 6And Now One Plus 9R...Always Launched and Booked😎😎😎No issues ever.
1,Battery issues
5,"As I'm a OnePlus user for more than 4 years now I purchased the OnePlus Plus 9 Pro on 30th March and loved it.And got the 9R for my sister and she loved this phone.I would say it's better to get 9R over 9 else buy the 9 Pro.Camera on the 9R is not as people are saying that it's bad. It's decent for the price. A normal person can't tell the difference btw.Screen is beautiful, phone looks premium."
5,"Okay, First of all, I was using oneplus 6 before and was planning for an upgrade, and eagerly waiting for 9 series. I decided to buy Oneplus 9 first, then I came to know that it wont have OIS stabilization. Then I planned to go for Oneplus 9 pro, but !! Insane heating issues and battery draining problem.Why should I waste money for such a phone, and finally I bought Oneplus 9r . Folks Hazzelblad is just a gimmick, Anybody using Oneplus 9R can get the same output using Google camera in OP9R !!Speakers are really good, Dolby Atmos, Cameras are above average+ , Super stable video mode gives you iPhone like stabilization, gaming is supercool, I bought 12/256 varient, and its super snappy, butter smooth. The only struggle I'm facing right now is the availability of accessories like tempered glass and back cases (official glass and cases are really expensive) , and we know this is a new model launched days before, so hopefully it'll sorted soon !!"
1,Worrest decision taken by OnePlus not providing 5G network bands in india. Only one 5G band in OnePlus 9R. Before they said we will provide other 5G by update. I want my money back. I will take legal action
5,"Review (8GB):This phone has very good performance. I ordered lake Blue its looking Stunning. love the device.Pros:=> Great performance/speed for SD 870 processor=> Battery life is fine=> Gesture control, Finger print scanner is nice=> Good cover provided with the phone, that really helpsCons:=> Heating while charging the phone. May be because of fast charge effect, OnePlus should look into this. After 100% charge, it automatically get cooled. no heating issueAs others are complaining there is=> No display tint issues=> No heating issues while using the phone, gaming etc. But noticed while charging=> No charging issues, within 10-15 mins 60-70% chargingRear Camera is good. Getting good pics in portrait mode. i will add few pictures soon."
1,"I just switched from OP6.Unlike when I brought the OP6, when I had zero complaints. I'm having many issues with the OP9R from day one.Things to note:1. The display has some major issues, there's an off-axis pinkish tint to whites and grays, which is quite annoying, and almost all the devices seem to affected with this as per OnePlus forums.2. The Camera are just mediocre, and I find the OP9 Camera much better than this. Even though OP9 lacks OIS, it almost always catches better pics and has better focus and stabilization in videos. Like MKBHD said, the Macro and Monochrome sensors are just garbage.3. The whole of the phone, particularly the backplate vibrates on playing sounds, it's pretty annoying and makes the phone feel cheap.Good stuff:1. Warp Charging is unbelievably fast.2. Other than the off-axis color shift, it's a great display.3. The phone is very snappy, added to the 120Hz display gives it a very confident smoothness.Overall:I think OnePlus put very little effort to this phone, as if they made it just to satisfy the Indian customers to complement the OnePlus 9 series. Their quality control seems to be quite bad, as OnePlus forums is full with issues with this device. I have a very unpopular suggestion, buy the OnePlus 9, it's only 7K more (SBI Credit Card). You get a newer and efficient Chipset, a substantially better camera. Having OIS gives no seeming advantage to OnePlus 9."
1,"I got a defective phone, it is struggling in moderate to weak network areas. Data Speeds are not even 20kbps. Highly disappointed. As the pic depicts, mobile data error icon can be seen 90% of my day usage. It is very weird. I switched from samsung a50 to OnePlus. it gave me excellent data speeds even in poor network area. I will update my review after one month."
1,Got a defective product and amazon is not ready to exchange it saying please contact manufacturer for warranty.
5,"The OnePlus 9R is a fair proposition in terms of the phone's pricing. For Rs 39,999, I get great performance, along with a very fluid and clean software experience. The photography, especially in low light, might not be spectacular, but it's still pretty good. Fast charging, decent battery life, and an attractive design contribute to the OnePlus 9R being a great purchase decision."
5,"Ordered Carbon Black; 12GB+256GB variant.Recieved a day early, on 19 April 2021.First Day Review:This phone is basically an 8T but with a Snapdragon 870, at a lower cost, but that doesnt mean they skimped on quality.So far from 1 day of use, this phone has been incredibly snappy and intuitive. Switching over from a Galaxy Note 8 was a piece of cake, although it took a good few hours to transfer the data.Charging is really quick as you would expect from a 65W WarpCharger.Camera quality is satisfactory in Auto mode, and gets better in Pro Mode with manual control.Speakers are loud and clear, and there is enough stereo seperation that it doesnt feel too unbalanced.Screen gets really bright and colours are accurate, haven't run into any rainbowing, Black Crush or Purple tinting issues. The 120Hz refresh rate also adds to the snappiness feel of the phone.Gaming is really enjoyable, especially those game that take advantage of the features like haptic feedback in COD Mobile. Speaking of which, the haptic motor (vibration) feels super crisp and tight, giving it a premium experience.I had gone for the Carbon Black, and the matte finish on the back glass is exactly what I had hoped for, and the matte finish also has an advantage of repelling fingerprints.So far the phone has been awesome, and I recommend it 10/10.Will update this review if I notice anything off :)"
4,"The only reason I went for Oneplus 9R is that I have been using Oneplus 5T from last 3+ years, the phone is perfectly fine till now and I always wanted to go with Oneplus for the upgrade after using Oneplus 5T and for its great user experience.Coming to the Oneplus 9R, I am not totally satisfied with the phone as I had higher expectations on Oneplus 9R. With the given features and upgrades I feel the phone is not doing so great. When you compare this phones with the similar range of phones from other brands you will have different opinions and thoughts.Pros:- Display quality is very good, with Fluid AMOLED Display and 120 Hz refresh rate display it is buttery smooth- Built quality is great, with aluminum body and Front and back Gorilla Glass 5 protection. Feels premium in hand- Phone speakers are doing well, sound is crisp, loud and with more details- Handset microphone is also great, Can hear the exact voice of the caller and it's clear and loud- Performance - Qualcomm 870 Chipset is doing well, phone is running smooth with no lags so far.- Front camera is good if you compare with other 16MP sensors on other phones.- As usual clean UI experience with Oxygen 11 OS.Cons:- Minor heating issues.  Felt phone was heating up during initial setup, while moving the files from old phone to new one. first 2-3 days felt phone is getting warmer with normal usage aslo and during the time of charging. I feel the heating issues resolved after receiving the first OS update or who knows the phone might be settling down after few days of usage.- Primary camera(s) is not up to the mark, photos can be seen only better in pro mode, videos are little better and front camera is OK. Lots of additional and unnatural colors are being added to the shot. There is no much clarity when you zoom and no details and images are scattered. Camera is not good with the hype which Oneplus created.  I wish Oneplus would be able to fix the camera issues with some good updates if hardware supports and if not then that's it.-Battery backup - Battery drains very quickly with the 120Hz refresh on, battery lasts only for 1 day with full charge and optimal usage. But the good thing is, it charges very quickly as well with 65W Warp charger. from 6 to 100 % took 49 minutes to charge.Overall, if you want to go with the display and performance other then Camera quality and some other issues which I highlighted, then you can go for it and if you are an Oneplus fan.NOTE: Whoever wants good Camera, they might think twice before purchasing this phone. You will get way better camera phones than Oneplus 9R under 40K (38 with discount)."
2,"OnePlus did a blunder with this one. Battery quality is very bad. And it's charging very slow. I'm not sure it's some unit problem or software issue, so I've requested a replacement, but it states over 1 hour to full charge when it's already charged 60%. The charging rate is very low as well, and battery deplete very fast, I can say it depletes faster than it's charging rate.Screen quality is great.Sound quality isn't very good either, it has very less max volume, I literally had to keep it at full volume always for a decent sound.As for heating issues, as everyone else is stating, it's over heating a lot! While normal usage it overheats, let alone any power playing.Honestly, I feel OnePlus made a blunder here. I was really looking forward to this device. Let's see how the replacement unit feels.Edit - battery seem to be performing better after replacement. However, still have issues like overheating and speaker sound."
4,"I have an OnePlus 3 and an One plus 8 and this this my third purchase of an oneplus phone in the family.A bit disappointed to hold the phone at first after using OnePlus 8 for almost a year now. First, the lack of curved edges deprives you of a smooth navigation gestures especially with the cover on. Further, it is not the slimmest phone in this price catagory. But not so heavy.Full marks to the Super-AMOLED display, which is super cool and crisp. Even in broad sunlight, it is visible because of the 1,100 nits it offers. Build quality is very premium. Ergonomically well designed. Perfect for one-handed opraration. The front and rear is of corning gorilla glass 5 and the frame is metal (where as for the OnePlus 9 the frame and rear are of plastic!!) Lucky me! So it looks very elegant. But no IP rating for water proof is disappointing. But company says it is water proof. The insulation in the SIM tray is an evidence.The phone is superfast with a great sensitivity for touch and swipe gestures with the Snap Dragon 870 processor. 120 hz refresh rate is super smooth. Gamers would love it with a top-notch haptics (vibration features) and with the 244 hz touch sampling rate.Battery charging is very fast too. The juice holds up for quite long because of the better power management by the latest processor and the LLDR 5 RAM. Delightful!! Occassional warming yes during heavy games. That's normal. Camera is decent. Front camera is 16 MP should be a 32 in this price range. Avoid beautification option as you may look like a cartoon. Rear camera takes above average photos in day light. But below average during low light/ nights especially the wide angle camera. But it has optical image stabilisation even the OnePlus 9 doesn't have that. So shaky hand fellows don't worry for the blur. Videos are of best quality. Best in this category. With a good video editor and skill you can make cinema like videos but the stabilisation is not-so-good in the nights.Stereo speakers are of very good quality. It is loud and doesn't crack even at high volumes. Call quality is decent. Not comparable with iPhones though. And Dolby audio is very enjoyable with headphones. With a good quality earphones/ headsets, I assure it is not less than a immersive audio experience especially for games.'Flip to mute' and 'raise the phone to answer' features are missing. Don't know why. It is just a OnePlus 8T with a good looking rear camera console with Rs.3000 less. Even the cover of 8T suits perfectly on this.So overall I am satisfied if not delighted. My OnePlus 8 is still better I feel. But this is the best in this price range. Better than the vivo x60, Mi11X pro or even the samsung S20 FE especially for the build quality and the premium feel it gives. Also the oxygen OS is best out of all android OS'. Also the in-display finger print sensor and the face unlock, I have not experienced  anything faster, prompter and more acuurate in recent times with anyother gadgets!! But the phone has only one 5G band. Suggest not to use the cover supplied with the box. It gives a kinda smoky look and makes the phone look bulky. But withstands accident falls. I have ordered the sandstone bumper case from the OnePlus store. Lake blue colour variant is awesome. Best of all the colors of all the OnePlus phones till today in my opinion. Catches not much finger prints or smudges like the 8 series. Scratch proof. Phone comes with a pre-applied scratch gaurd sticker. So no extra purchase required. Charging cable is a bit shorter than OnePlus 8. Type C charger with 65W charging adapter. 0 to 100 in 50 minutes. One significant change here is the data transfer to and from computer is quite faster than my OnePlus 8 also using OTG. Adaptive brightness they have got it right this time. In previous Oneplus devices, it was irritating. I have become loyal to OnePlus because the life of OnePlus phones is quite long compared to any other leading brands. My OnePlus 3 still stands formidable after 5 years. One star less just for the absense of curved edges display and a not-so-slim thickness. Else this phone is very good. Though corner of my mind says the price should be 10% lesser.P. S.Not encountered any overheating or battery draining issues as highlighted by some users. May be because I bought the phone after the release of first software update  and updated before writing this review. If you are not a fan of flagship processors and not a gamer, go for the OPPO F19 Pro with half of this price. Slimmer, lighter and with 3.5 mm jack."
1,Worst camera...  even a sub-10k phone will beat this phone in camera segment.I never expected such poor quality camera in a flagship killer brand..... first and last OnePlus phone. Congratulations for losing your customer.
1,Heats like hell. Initial set up heats up mobile.. 7nable to hold even after using a back case.. Same with games/camera/video streaming apps. Difficult to hold in hand. Needs an urgent fix.
4,"I have been using Realme 2 pro for the past 2 and half years and I felt like I needed a upgrade and bought OnePlus 9R, have to say it's a worthy upgrade and the speed is amazing. Everything is super fast and 120hz refresh rate is cherry on the top. Camera is okaish nothing that great. There are some heating here and there while using apps. Battery is okay as well. If you are using heavily it will not last you for a day, with normal usage it will easily last for a day. Also the phone fully charges in 40 minutes thanks to the 65w fast charging. OxygenOs is good nothing that great. There are lots of booklets inside the box, I hope next time OnePlus reduce that and instead add a usb c to 3.5mm jack adaptor. This is the first time I am using a OnePlus phone and I am really enjoying every moment of it and I would recommend this phone to everyone who is planning on upgrading their phone."
1,"I never expected that OnePlus phones will be having heating issue. With my device OnePlus 9R 12GB, I faced this issue and highly disappointed 😞. I even bought OnePlus Buds Z as well and Bluetooth droops very often."
1,"Just recieved latest flagship phone but disappointed with quality of product at 39k price tag. It's heating up within use of 30 mints even when it gets charged up completely. Batery draining in short time even with normal use of watsapp, accessing mails. Weirdest things I have noticed that you feel the sound viberation from back side when while calling to someone and it's wrost when you play music. It give you a feel poor quality product."
3,"Here's my final review after more than one month of continuos usage of this phone.Charging speed: 5⭐Display : 5⭐Touch response and feel : 5⭐  120 hz display feels and looks butter smooth.Battery life: 3⭐ (Even in 60 hz refresh rate, battery doesn't last for a day).Back Camera (in daylight):  3⭐ (because of very bad skin colour reproduction)Back Camera (in night): 5⭐Front camera: 2⭐ (my Mi A3 takes way better selfies).Ui and themes: 5⭐Fingerprint reader: 5⭐Audio quality (Call/Music): 4.5⭐Performance: 2.5⭐ (heats up really fast).Build quality and looks : 5⭐(it won't break easily if fallen accidentally.)Internet speed : 5⭐"
1,Extremely worst battery.. battery drain s very quickly.. mobile also average camera
1,Phone was getting heat when charging and continuse use for 30m any application not expected this from brand like One plus.
5,"Review after 7 days of extensive usage. • I would say the performance you are going to get one oneplus and that OxygenOS touch you gonna get from knowhere. It's too smooth to handle after using this you'll find thise ""IOS"" devices are lagging cuz they aren't having 120 Hz display even the price for iphone 12 is almost double the price of oneplus 9R.Pros: • Snapdragon 870 which is smooth as hell either it be for video editing and redndering or it be for playing games. Even the ""Call of Duty"" runs like water buttery smooth at max fps. • Tested this device while playing games on it like COD/Free Fire with max Resolution and FOS and would say thermals are very good it won't heat up after almost an hor of gaming temp was still maintained to be as 40°C in a Non AC room. • Video Stability and recording best in the market if you turn night mode on even in the dark scenes it is well lit up no one can guess it was shooted in night. Video potrait is best for content creater the bokeh effect is mouth watering for the content creators the bokeh youll get is as similar as you'll get in a dslr camera but the surrounding should be well lit up. • Oxygen OS it is the best operating system I've seen on an Android device unlike other OS available for Android. • User interface is best thing of oneplus devices you can't get rid of it's addiction even you'll start hating IOS 😅 not actually but it's the best UI I've ever used • You'll get 5g support so you don't need to worry about future upgrades. This will work smooth. • Design and placement of Camera Module is the best the oneplus have done ever while it's completely subjective, but youll get 🦍 Glass 5 protection on front and back along with a aluminum chasis/side frame it's a well built device simply rigid and feels premium to hold. • Haptic is best in the price range. • Dua Dolby Stereo Speakers make it loud enough to consume your content at any place • Full day power just in few minutes this device comes with a 65W wrap charge which will charge your device in just the time span of 30/35 mins. You'll never fall short of power either it be powerful performance or the power interms of battery. • Oneplus's Fluid Amoled display is best screen I've ever seen smooth responsive and vivid best for Netflix, lovers xD.Cons: • There are some bugs oneplus need to solve it as it isn't justified for this kind of flagship devices. I'm mentioning few of them oneplus pls act accordingly. • While using YouTube  the framerate drops I don't know it's a google fault or what but even the notification bar seem to be freezing while scrolling down as to like 90fps. There are few more applications like Google photos application which I've discovered uptil now. • Phone get warms outside it might be due to the electronic devices catch too much of heat radiations from Sun rays. • Oneplus pls provide One-Hand mode as soon as possible as the device is having a large form factor it's quite not possible for using the device single handedly even if I am having really large palms and long fingers indeed, I am just thinking anout those girls having small cute palms and fingers💅🤣😅. • Now jumping to camera section one plus needs to work on the picture capturing algorithm the problems faced were like... • 1) Sometime captures undersaturated photos in potrait and 2x Zoom mode. • Need to work on the algorithm of focusing as it hunts for focus sometimes in the darker. • Basically Camera needed to be well optimized by oneplus in few aspects rather say camera performance is awesome just few bugs are needed to be solved. I've attached few pictures you can refer to those.Conclusion: • If you want a well built phone with best processing speeds and Video Capabilities you can opt for it it's is the best device in my terms under 50k budget but few bugs and improvisation are required & I hope Oneplus will donit sooner or later.Thanks for reading my review."

5,"Nice mobile prices 12,450"
1,"Body sensor not working. Was late by 2 days to find out this defect and so could not use ""return"" option.Due to body sensor problem, phone display never gets off while talking and so when brought close to ear, buttons like mute, hold gets activated while speaking.The basic function, which is to talk to others on phone becomes troublesome. Everytime have to very careful of holding position to make sure phone is not touched on body. Hate this and feel cheated/dejected.Cannot return as well."

5,Fantastic
5,The phone is excellent but if the front and rear camara should be high and should be their dark mode compalsary but it should be added fastly and should give ear phonesonly main default is not nice camara should be high because the less cost mobiles will take more tean agers so they do moor selfies so it should increase and oppo is the selfie expert but this phone no selfie expert camara for next phone it should increase .Imay think I will increase
1,This product received wrost.. In this item some useful applications not run..Order canceled but no cancelation status and pick up status updating by Amazon..No any contact provided by Amazon..Realy disappoint..
2,This product details said there is a earphone and screen protector.  But i didnt get that
1,Don't buy it from Amazon the return service of Amazon is very bad..disgusting they never think customer problem no one in call centre never call you return policy and service is very poor only benefit looking cite ... don't buy anything from amazon.. in future I never buy electronics items from Amazon... flipcart is most trusted than amazon
3,"I like the product. But as compared to my other phone Realme X2. I found the lag in processing in some of minor things also. It is having 6GB RAM then also the having some processing issue. I don;t like the product. Even after this specs, the things are getting lag."
4,Nice mobile in this Price 👌👌👌👌..
5,Very nice phone for Rs.12500/-
4,Nice product...but there is no C pin charger  thts only one prob in this product...
3,Headsets are missing in the phone box...where are the original headsets...its normally included in phonebox??
1,The phone lags a lot right from the box. You have to swipe 3-4 times. Apps get hung. Never seen such a pathetic phone.
4,"Good product  but as compared to Mi note 8 its not Good . If you want to rought use for bussiness purchase.. Provessor is slow , not for gaming. But want you tube and surffing it's usefull. Another all thing is good .I don't have time for upload pics , but this review is enought.Product is same as photos."
1,"i have received the waste and damaged products and i chasing the customer support from last 10 days no solution upto now waste of money on  amazon ,waste of time on amazon ,and i customer of amzaon from last 5 years and i am a prime member this is the services i am getting"
5,For the money an excellent phone. My usage is mostly for mail and messaging. Bit of browsing and reading. The battery lasts for two days in my use. I bought one and then I was very happy with it and I bought another of the same.
1,"Screen quality is very poor , camera is also nearly poor, all over the phone is worst. I ordered this phone by choosing the no cost emi option of Bajaj , but they are also taking the processing charges of Rs.174 on every instalment.So please don’t use Bajaj’s emi option for ordering this phone. Thanks"
3,Updating after 4month :-screen recorder not available..which is default function of every android now a days..-Charging draining faster but charging gaining very slower.-its not a 21st century phone .. so many basic features missing Day 1: experience:-Most important : it will not redirect the link into the present app in mobile .... It will open link every times in default browser..Eg: if I got any Facebook /insta /Twitter link and I already have installed these app then it will not asking me to get open with app instead it will redirect to browser and again I need to login... So so poor technology1.processor looks slow while setup and configuration my account data restoration as compare to redmi note 7 (same price older version phone than this)2. Camera quality is very low both back and front ...capture blurred images..not focusing the face even after setup manually.3.  Not value for money.. I think I made mistake to choose oppo brand .. I compare all the feature with redmi.. redmi looks far better than this..4. No front flash light available to click in night5. Looks slow to handle multiple apps compare to redmi6. Please don't buy this phone..this is so poor technology phone..
5,I have been an user of nokia 6.1 as it started to face issues I have opted for this one. After using premium phones like Xperia and Nokia I feel the fabrication is not upto to the standards. Helios processing a little slow.Banking apps a little stretched due to the size of the screen. Rest all a good buy.
1,"I couldn't like it bcoz of its poor water resistence quality.I bought it on Dec.2020 but the working system of this disturbed on March 2021,within a period of 2-3 months.It is great loss .It mars  the Credibility of the Company also.I wanted to purchase one more but the damage has spoiled my mood n faith.I want compansation for the loss.It would be of great support n credibility of the company if it exchangeg the mobile OppoA31,Mystery or mend it properly without my loss.If the company do this favour,it would be a gentl step towatds customer care n service as well as the establishment of strong credibility n capabilitu of the Company."
1,"1. Phone don't have type C charging2. Dual app not possible for all app like redmi phones3. Charger is normal 5v 2 Amp so no fast charging.4. Not for multi tasking people.5. Camera and sound average6. Processor and touch very slow7. Only 6GB RAM AND 128 GB ROM is good  in this phone.8. Also it's not showing dual 4G9. Battery is only 1 day at normal uses.10. Display dpi is also very low.11. Can be treated as entry level phone.12. WhatsApp Camera function is abnormal, don't waste money on OPPO A31"
3,Complete phone feature is best except battery charging problem.
5,Phone is a perfect package ..Quality of product is best in classCamera is just right for this price point and as required......seller is a professional guy quality and packaging is best of best
4,Very Nice And smoothly phonelooking good
5,Battery backup is awesome .. performance is decent you can play high end games in medium graphics there is no issue with that😊😊...
4,"I brought this mobile for online classes and it is totally value for money.Battery comes for 2 days or atleast 1 and half days for above average use.Camera is average. I use it to take pics of notes and it works well. But not good,  if you love taking selfies or outdoor photography.Display is good and phone works smooth without any lag while multitasking with different apps, but I don't think it is good for playing high-end games like public."
4,"Liked it's battery life, looking and overall performanceDisliked the camera and display.(Plus I felt some issues when updating Google apps)***Good budget mobile specially for gameplay"
5,Everything is perfect except camera... Camera is ok ok... But at the price of 7249 no complaints...

5,Best performance mobile phone under 10000 and the battery life is awesome. Fingerprint reader is also good. Overall this a perfect low range mobile phone.
5,This is the best phone under 10k and you will not regret it.
1,Device heating a lots and hanging
5,"This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt."
5,"Best camera, very good battery life, eat body material, average weight, best performance,  best display."
1,3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera. In very disappointed  with this kind of front camera. Need refund.
1,"Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom."
1,"The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller."
1,"I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.Face unlock very slow.Heat issue which charging and heavy usageFull charge takes more than 3 hrsWould not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phonego with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality"
1,"Software is no working. No sounds in media, cant attend calls, every 5 mints phone gone to switched off and even though no retraining option."
2,"Phone camera is not good , samsung says it's 64 mega pixel but its photos like 8 megapixels .photo detailing are not good  . Also processor is not Upton the mark it's some time slow and hang in multi function use . While using keyboard , keyboard hide automatically for 1 second . My mobile variant is 6 GB 128 GB. Don't waste your time and money ."
1,"Camera front is worst, not up to the mark. Waste of money. ,"
3,Not a Samsung performance. It seems it was launched without proper test n trials. I already had M30 so decided to buy M31 (6GB). But got shocked to see the poor performance n battery life. The 64MP images can't be sent easily to someone on WhatsApp. Camera give errors now n then. Battery life worst then M30 which has 5000mh. Mobile heats on charging.
5,Mind blowing  camera real monster battery look awesome and fist first launch first hand
1,I purchased this phone by seeing 64 MP for camera usage but M31 was the worst phone with camera quality.. Front camera is 8 and back camera was 16 MP not more that that.. there is no return option only replacement(Good game was playing by samsung &Amazon) please dont buy this mobile and dont waste your money... Heating problem while charging.. etc  i am really  very frustrated with this phone quality.. i lost my money by buying this phone..😔😔😪
5,"1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍"
4,"HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks."
1,"Not satisfied with the qualityDisplay quality is no adequateBody is made of plastic like materialI was using MI like 6 plus pro then 7 plus proFor a change I have purchased this product, the quality is not up to the mark when comparing to my old redmi note seriesThe sound quality is very worst.While making call with full volume it is not clear from the day of purchase.I am planning to go back to MI againWorst phone pls don't buyNot value for money"
1,Phone is very slow my opinion is west ur money
1,Average
1,"I purchased this as soon as it was launched and its one of the worst decision that i made. Selfie camera is blurry and clicks yellow pictures, phone lags in playback video, all of a sudden, video will disappear and only sound continues to play, back camera isn't that great as hyped, its very low in quality, body of the phone is more like a plastic and very low quality material, overall very dis-satisfied with the product. Amazon has agreed post diagnosis saying its a faulty piece  but does not give refund"
1,One of worst mobile and one of the worst brand. Better to purchase any other brand except Samsung.1. Heating issue2. Second sim works on 3g.3. Even its 6Gb ram works like 2gb ram phone.When I called amazon customer care they said I have to go to service center for this and they are telling to check through app.Its a f***ing phone please please please don't waste your money.And this is my last ever purchase from amazon.
2,"Cons:Button position (power& volume) too highFingerprint reader too highHeats up a lot.Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours & 28 minutesSpeaker volume low.The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls.Pros:Feels lightweightNice display.The camera is decent.Update 1:Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer.Update 2:Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement.Update 3:Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality. I have to put the call on 100% volume to be able to hear at least a bit."

1,"I bought this mobile in last Friday , it is not working from 6th day.  Unable to receive calls and if unexpectedly I received a call not getting  sound and I can't here the opposite person voice or my voice to them. When I try to call someone automatically network is getting disconnected and it's reconnecting automatically in few minutes. I expect this might be  software issue , I have gone through lot of reviews ,maximum number of people who buyed this mobile facing this issue.Unable to replace the mobile also as it is not showing any option to me."
1,"Worst mobile was I got , Samsung m31 taking more time for charging 100% , it's almost 4 hours for charging , and after that 20 hours battery I'll train 0% its waste of time compare to other fast charging mobile , and camera worst"
2,"I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed!I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung!I so miss my POCOFirst the pros1. The brand name - if you think it is one!2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos4. Build - seems decentCons:1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates meAnyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me nowWhat a waste of Money this has been"
5,Received it on time within 24 hours thumps up to amazon. Now Product. Done all the settings. I am using samsung after a long gap of 8-10 years. After Samsung Grand I had stopped using. So setting done now data transfer Samsung's smart switch option is fantastic. Everything I wanted to transfer got it. No problem at all .Now SIM transferred. Done OK it is dual 4G VOLTE and above all it is having separate slot for micro sd card. Effortless working.Now Camera. It has got lot of options. All I have not yet tried but for sure I have checked the quality of the photograph and the night mode is superb. What else you want to know rest of the things are written in detail and is true. Working very fine. Proud to won it. Nice Product. Samsung should keep competing iPhone
1,"What is this samsung,i didn't expect from you.plastic body is ok we can use cover.Corning gorella glass 3 is ok we can use tempered protection.Even 3 hr charging time is ok we can charge during night.But Overheating how can we deal with them !this price range other companies providing super fast , cool processor like snapdragon 730G.& What you do fooling customers."
5,Nice phone in this price range
2,"Cons:1. RAM. Claims to be 6GB, whereas my 2year old phone with 4GB RAM has much smoother display2. Battery Charging. Claims 15W fast charging. Takes more than 2 hours to charge the phone.Pros:1. Good cameras2. Perfect screen sizeI bought it as a great deal from Samsung, but it is a BIG dissappointment. And they say it cannot be returned. Total waste of money for me. Redmi Note pro 8 is much better than this at same price."
2,"1) claims 21 hour of internet usage timing, i started using it after 100charged  but it barely last for 24 hour with 5 hour of heavy usage and even turned mobile in bettery saving mode.  so what is the point of carry that much heavy 191gm device all around.2) phone heats a lot while its charging ,like you can't even touch it at some point.3)internet bandwith speed in mobile as well as in wifi is not good. i had a samsung galaxy note3 where i get fast internet with same network. wanted to return this device but they had a very strict policy so you cannot return, you can only replace it.  even i am trying it for replacement it wont let me as i have to download balencco app and this app never say your phone is not working fine. i could have spend my money in buying other phone.bought on very first minute of release but al excitment turned down after seeing actual performance."
1,"i am a Big fan of Samsung products, but today i got a dead phone, first i thought it don't have charging so try to charge the phone but no response,i am really really disappointed today. but thanks to amazon the responded quickly and ordered a replacement. but now i am worried about phone performance now. how i am going to handle if future same problem arises. before buy think again."
1,"Worst experience ever, camera quality not better 5out of 2, battery down very fast, max 3 hours taken charging 100% ,sometime WhatsApp hangups.108 gp free storage but mobile heating high, fingerprints only 3 finger available,  not better fingerprints,  I am the first buyer before launching. Over all don't buy this m 31. No extra protection, no additional option,  very simple mobile,not worthiness of money,"
1,"First time met very bad experience from Samsung phone, camera quality is very poor. Front facing camera not good at all. Not comfortable with 6000mahbattery life.Amazon.india  just destroyed their Goodwill by selling this product.I purchased this phone for my friend. And now he is angry on me....Dear customer please avoid to buy this product."
1,Very poor performance.. camera is ok not bad . But very slow net speed .. opening app time is relatively fast but after internet is very slow .... my old mobile Samsung on max is much faster performance for loading web page than Samsung m31 .. this phone taking much more time to open any web site ... remaining everything is ok ..Fast changing is not far like they said .. 30 mins charging it charging 20% but my old Samsung is 30% charged at same time . I have found this two major drawback.
4,I ordered in first sale after comparing all the phones at this range and i am satisfied with this phone but want to discuss some pros and consPros:1. Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also.2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️)3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex
5,"Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device. You can always drop them on the comment)"
1,"Dear Amazon Team,I have been delivered faulty product from UP. It is just 15 days from buying the product and it was showing hang issue. and now this phone is dead and restart itself. No customer care is replying. Very poor service. Need replacement of the phone immediately."
5,"Delivery was fast, packing was good, phone started quite unusual that applications were not even downloading on wifi, later after a couple of restarts it's good now. So thumps up , happy so far ."
3,It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display & mammoth battery.Pros :1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself )2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.3. SAR rating - lowest one4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )Cons :1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet )2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great3. Not so great processorWho can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery & Samsung branding.
3,"I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.Pros:1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.Cons:1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better."
5,"The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screenIf you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colorsI am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos. I am hoping battery performance wl improve in few daysCamera pictures are goodLots of bloatware come with Samsung so had to uninstall/ disable them manually"
1,This phone is useless. Life is no more than 6 months. Don't buy this phone. I have purchased this phone and it stopped working in 4th month and no customer care is available.
5,"No finger sensors in this phone ,camera is good ,battery is good, smooth run,charge very fast,display is good,face unlock good"
5,The battery is excellent at the current price point and the camera quality is very good. No Finger sensor only face lock feature which is quite responsive.
5,"Great product by redmi, but I request to redmi please don't make fake sale"
1,Never buy chip quality battery drain issues don't buy
4,"Previous owner of Redmi 7 2gb 32gbRedmi Note 10 4gb 64gb was blazing fastIf you aren't able to buy this wait till Xiaomi release the same in poco with 6gb ram for the same price, like they did with Redmi power with a downgrade in camera, They won't remove the 48mp camera, They may decrease or remove the remaining cameras in poco version of resmi note 10About Amazon sale I logged in to amazon.in in my pc and clicked on join wait list around 12:02, then opened the app and booked the phone I was in queue for almost 20 to 25 minutes, the next step was payment which was a pain in the head, no COD, Note: only upi ids with number@ are accepted, I added a card Note: Check if ecommerce payments is enabled for your cardIn the allocated 15 minutes the order was booked but payment failed, thankfully I was allowed to pay againAlso while I was waiting in queue I got an option to buy the phone 2 ways, lightning deal - 11998, Regular price - 11999 (in Amazon App), I think lightning deal is for those who want to claim offersFirst of all, i bought this phone for basic use online payments, govt apps like Twallet, Tration, Tappfolio, MyGHMC, Digilocker, Aadhaar, Hpgas, Bharatgas, Hmwssb and much more all of them mostly dual appsI am a pc user so I don't use my mobile for gaming or streamingPros:Display : The display is crisp and clear better than my Redmi 7 (not comparing LCD with Amoled)Touch: The touch response is good it's fast, I can type fast in this phone no lag thereMobile data: 4g Data connectivity is superb I can feel the difference between my redmi 7 and this, mostly the download speedFeel: In hand feel is also good, the weight is lessCamera: Best in the segment (obviously if you don't use the stock app)Price: considering how this is priced more than Redmi Note 9 (10999), I am not angry this too will cost the same after 6 months probably will be on exchange and discount by August independence day sale.Cons:Battery: Being amoled this shouldn't consume so much battery, hope Xiaomi fixes this with an updatePlastic back: glossy back (should have come with matte or rough panel for better grip) and little bit of vibration while playing the speakers especially on top near cameraStereo speakers: yep more like dual speakers than stereo (then again Xiaomi never claimed that they support Dolby (Oppo has them and they sound awesome)Verdict: I was waiting for this from almost a year, from the launch of Redmi note 8 and my analysis went way deep, I was looking at Samsung for amoled, Redmi power for stereo speakers and good battery, Poco varient of Redmi note 9 for the processor and decent in the box fast chargerThis covered almost all of them (not fully though)Finally this just serves my purpose, I still aim to buy a good PC, Nothing can beat a desktop ( I wish remix os and phoenix os were as competitive as Windows, remix went out of play long back."
5,"Finally, Xiaomi has decided to design for its Note series of mobiles. This mobile phone is definitely going to be and head Turner when you pull the mobile out of the pocket. It has an almost 1mm protruding camera module on the rear of the mobile. I have bought aqua-green color which has these light gradient shade. The colors are up to your personal preferences.The phone has a matte finish at the back so it is definitely not a fingerprint magnet. It also doesn't feel very heavy and is very easy to hold firmly.🎯DESIGN and DISPLAY:******************************This 6.43-inch display with the Full HD Plus resolution is really good along with a punch-hole selfie camera that offers a seamless user experience.The brightness can go up 1100 nits peak so it is definitely not a difficult thing to use it under sunlight. Xiaomi provided this model with the Widevine L1 DRM certification support for this mobile. So, playing HD videos on an ott platform won't be an issue.Z-axis haptic motor used in this mobile throws more realistic vibrations while playing games. I tried it extensively with a couple of games, the experience was really satisfying. Kudos to Xiaomi for throwing in all the sensors on this mobile especially for not giving up on the remote control sensor.This mobile comes with a lot of preloaded apps like Facebook, LinkedIn, MI remote, MI credit, MI Store, MI pay, share m, etc. Out of these, you can uninstall a couple of apps and you have to live with the remaining apps for the rest of the life.🎯PERFORMANCE:**********************The fingerprint sensor is very sensitive and highly responsive that even if you touch the sensor unintentionally you will end up unlocking the phone. It is that fast. Games like Asphalt 9 and Call of Duty worked excellently without any lag or freezing. This mobile would definitely outscore any mobile under this budget easily.It took 25 to 35 minutes to charge the mobile from 0 to 75% using the 33 Watts charger which came along with the mobile.🎯CAMERA:**************It comes with the 48-megapixel F/1.79 main camera with Sony Sensor and an 8mp ultrawide camera and the remaining two are the macro and the depth sensor.The main camera will let you shoot 4K 30fps video and 960fps 720 p video. When provided with good lighting conditions the main camera gives you a decent output and the Portrait mode also did a good job by blurring out the background gently.The low light images were average and it was decent enough for mobile phones with a budget of 15k.Coming to the selfie camera The Portrait mode worked excellently and the pictures were on a little warm tone than a natural skin tone. If you don't like the warm tone on your selfie pictures then you can fix it through editing apps from Play Store.🎯VERDICT:**************This mobile offers Rock-solid performance for everyday tasks along with very good battery life. This mobile phone comes with MIUI 12.5 so you don't have to worry about future updates for at least the next two years. With AMOLED display and the stereo speakers along with IP53 rating, this has to be the most competent mobile phone under 15000 and a good value for money.I have a YouTube channel: Gizmofeatures (You can also find the unboxing and impressions video there). When Comparing with Poco M3, Moto G10 Power, Samsung M12, you can pick Redmi note 10 any day. It is the best among these Four."
1,"This mobile i used only 3 days and mobile start sucking, and this mobile stuck 6 time in one day.. Most Worst mobile in my life 😣"
1,HERE I HAVE UPLOADED THE VIDEO ABOUT THE ISSUE WITH MY NEW MOBILE.FROM THE FIRST DAY TOUCH SCREEN NOT WORKING PROPERLY
4,It has good specifications.... Cut 1star bcoz of bad tactics by redmi.... They told base variant will start with 12k but didn't launched it.... Then I have to buy 14k variant.
4,Satisfied with this product. Best phone under 14000.Camera quality is also good. Battery performance is superb coz of 33w charger 🔋🔌. Finally it is a good phone as per my opinion.
3,I am not impressed with this phone. Samsung phones have better amoled display. Sound quality not good and not loud too. This phone hangs a lot. Camera quality very bad. I have owned previous phones of mi and they are much better than this. Pls go for note 9 pro in the same budget or realme.
5,Best phoneEver
4,Everything is good in the phone..I use redmi note 10 for 1 day...And review itI found i issue with this phone that is fingerprint sensor does not work properly it slwo or some time Tap fingerprint sensor for 2-3 time for useAbout a camera very good...Front camera is also good..I will edit review after 10 day of use...In shot very GOOD PHONE
1,Phone display has been breaken. It is mentioned as gorilla glass. It has fall down from just 6 feet. Y it is broken?. I will go to consumers courst. Please guide me
1,Redmi note 10 software is very bad xiaomi please fix software problem's Improve the camera & build quality is not good & battery drain very fast.  I AM BIG FAN OF XIAOMI MY FAVORITE COMPANY
5,I pay 100rs extra for one-day delivery it took less than 20 hours.. And after 7 days of using I would say this the best budget smartphone to this day.. There is another variant that comes in 12k you can wait for that or simply buy this at 14000 it comes with a back cover and a screen protector battery backup is awesome but a slight heating issue I'm am getting...
5,"Good picture quality. The 48 Mp camera works fine and so does the selfie camera in potrait mode. Sometimes the pictures are sharper than required. The charging is fast. Got full charge in 2.5 hours of fast charge. Overall build quality is good, not too heavy as compared to previous models. The plastic phone case provided prevents from ususal bumps and falls. The sound quality is decent and so is the video quality in full HD. Gaming performance is decent too, got to play need for speed in medium setting without crashing the app. Really happy with the purchase."
1,"Mobile is lagging. while I scrolling screen is not moving, I noticed it several times,it is very slow while playing games. product is not up to the mark in this price segment"
1,Battery is very bad ...battery is draining when even phone is on sleep mode .
1,check wether both the speakers are working or noi got the manufacturing defet in a piece wich they have senteven the headphone jack also not upto the mark wich give you sound only in one ear bud
5,"We loved it always, coz it's a no 1 brand.Exellent camera."
1,Toatl vest of money. The mobile having touch issue. Half Touch is not working. I suggest you all please do not buy Redmi Note 10 series. Please please please
1,"Very disappointed with the redmi product.Touch sensation problem. Sometimes some parts of the screen doesn't work on touch. I tried my best to get this latest product, but never expected such waste of money."
1,"The sd678 processor with 6GB of ram fails to keep up with everyday stuff like composing mails and browsing. Screen freezes at times, and touch response is far from adequate (and no, it is not because of the the protective film).Camera is average for this price range.The only good thing about this phone is its amoled display.It comes with the usual miui bloatware, but can uninstall/disable some.I understand these phones are not meant to last, nor do I expect flagship level performance for 14k; but this phone fails to perform even basic tasks where sub 10k phones ace.The finger print sensor is well placed amd fast, but often fails to work.There's no way to turn off fast charging, so expect your battery to give up soon."
4,Display is very good  10/10Camera is good for the price 8/10Battery is very good 10/10Lightweight and very slimPerformance is decent not the best 7/10MIUI is very laggyBack panel quality is not goodDual stereo speakers not the loudest but ok
1,Don't purchase this phone battery problem and phone is running is slow
1,After 5 days used . Nice design but performance is not up to mark and lagging . App crashes . Lot of adds which is irritating. Best buy Oppo or Realme.
2,i have used this smartphone for couple of days and what i came across cons and pros will share1. display : best in this price range no doubt about that crisp colors little saturated as its amoled panel for viewing is a pleasure of eyes2. Speakers : i didn't liked it yes u heard it right its not good the highs as high vocals are not clear its like its been suppress the quality is not like stereo speakers type its same like single speaker its like u can heard the music but not the vocals the base is killed3 Battery : Not seems to be 5000 mah coz of 11nm chip its drains like hell even surfing would suck the battery juice like hell and phone heats up a lot yes it charge as fast as advertised apart from that nothing is good might be an update would resolve this issue have to wait and watch4. Camera : its good in the price range 48 mp does it job ultra wide macro depth are satisfactory not good not bad does there job colours are not accurate but it does happen low light pictures are ok not as advertised. camera gives good result in good light or in moderate like in room bit not good in low light or at nightselfie camera is good takes good shots edges in portrait are quiet well managed same in low light not good enough5. Built quality nice all plastic very light and easy to hold and operate with one hand if u have big hands but very light coz of all plastic body gorilla glass 3 is used but will never be tested as we always use guard so nothing to talk about itin short its up to you you want it or pass on
1,"after 6 days use  :1. 2 sim+sd card, good2. width just 74mm, then its thin and comfortable in hand, good3. battery is good4. camera is ok (in this range price) but selfie isn't bad5. finger is side and fast6. face unlock is fast7. it's not bulky like m12 Samsung8. speaker is good9.

5,Iam not big fan of #MI before this phone. Front camera was really nice having wide angle photography as well as from back camera. Battery was best overall this is nice phone for gaming also
2,"Not a good phone i donot know why it is hypedI should have purchased moto g30 ir waited for HuwaeiProblems:1.camera is not good2. Volume automatically decrease and increase3.

1,"I am facing touch problems. To type this review I struggled lot. Games worst , some times very difficult to answer phone calls"
1,Aftwrv2 days of uses review is that Even though camera is good but when you make Video call either through Whatsapp or Duo your video image looks  that you are using some VGA camera. don't whybthwre is a difference in selfie video and video through whatsapp which uses same camera properties.Better to go with  Samsung
1,It will make you feel blind as this phone blurs fonts and apps while we scroll it... didn't like it..I made a replacement also but still the problem is same in that new one too
1,"There is some serious issue with this recently launched phone. Replaced product again shows the same touch screen problem, have to touch multiple times. How can the same issue is coming in the second phone too, unless their is some bug. Please do not buy this phone. A BIG NO NO NO TO THIS PRODUCT."
2,"1.Camera have lot of issue, front camera become completely blur during video call on low light.2. Primary camer sensor works poor on video recoding it takes time to focus on item3.

1,Battery Issue.... Phone is Heating during Charging and During Running Application.
1,Facing heating issue while using camera app and general usage in 60hz refresh rate if I use 120hz it gradually heating issue increase please solve this problem
5,"My first time buying a OnePlus phone and I really like the finish of the one. Camera is excellent, Android 11 is very smooth to use, functions are fast.Just my first day of usage so hard to be critical of anything. The downside for me is that there is no place expand the memory."
1,Within 10 minutes of usage. It’s felt like over heat. I can’t experienced any mobile like this.
2,"Iam OnePlus user since 4 years, I exchange my one Plus 7 pro mobile with OnePlus 9 R Not expected From One Plus, quality is not good, Look like cheep mobile, camera quality also not good, one Plus 7 pro superb mobile, totally iam disappointed with 9R."
1,I don't why no reviewer is speaking about it. It was heating with a normal usage.
5,After 5 days of usage writing this review.1. Best camera quality for the price2. Snapdragon 870 is doing its best in speed with 120Hz display. - Best3. 65W charger takes only 35 min to charge 100% from 15%. - Best4.  Fluid amoled display is awesome on its smoothness. - best5. Lake blue colour is simply awesome 💙Issues1. Facing very lite heating issue.2. Found a bug and informed OnePlus customer service which is if we turn on call recording on call it indicates opponent also that we are recording call. They told they will correct it in next update. Hope this will be cleared but not sure.I give 95/100 for this mobile.
4,"I am writing down this after using for a couple of days. I got the carbon black one with 12GB RAM.  Overall the device is good, and honestly is the reskin of one plus 8T with lower price 😁.  I will list down the pros and cons -pros -1. With Oxygen OS 11, the overall user experience is quite smooth. You will get an update as soon as you finish setup.2. The Warp 65 fast charging is fine, takes around 35 mins for one full charge.3. The screen to body ratio is good.4. The matt finish on the back side is awesome.Cons -1. Battery drains a little fast, not sure if some future updates will fix it.2. Rear Camera is ok, can be better.3. I would have preferred popup front camera, rather than the punch hole.4. For dual apps, I would have loved to see the option for all apps. Right now it has support for few.5. support for few more 5G bands will be good to have."
3,"Writing after 4 Days of use1. Heating Issues -you will start noticing from the very first use2. Battery - charges 0 to 100 in just 35-40 mins but also drains so fast. Need to Charges twice in a day after using whatsapp, some browsing, calling.3. Camera - Not very good. Less than as expected. Think twice before buying if you are camera enthusiastic.4. Smooth- 120hZ and 60hZ both condition works well. I found it smooth to use and open apps5. Snap 870 processor really works.6. Other Oneplus features works good.7. Not a flagship phone.Money and Decision is yours..!!Thanks"
3,"I have recieved this new phone yesterday. Since I have started using its been heating all the time, while on charge, playing games etc.. All other things are pretty good."
1,"OnePlus 9r is best of both world that you get from samsung and apple. I would rate full 5 stars for mobile except camera and heating issue. Also, the delivery experience while exchanging mobile turned out to be worst. Hence rating overall 1star for the bad and worst humiliated experience. Now I'm afraid to order again from Amazon."
1,"Worst phone by one plusHeating issues :yesBattery drain : yesPhone hang or crash : twice in a dayPhone needs a restart daily else it will stop working. Once it's restarted all settings changes to default.Dissatisfied, disappointed by one plus"
1,"HiPlease consider this message with a serious note the One Plus 9R which was bought on the above mention date got hanged and did not open exactly on the 13th day of buying it. The replacement policy was only for 10 days and my phone showed prblms from the 13th day. I took it to the One Plus Care Centre and they said it needed an update i waited for 3 days for the 'So Called' update to arrive but after 3 days the Care Centre informed me that this phone needed a Motherboard change when i ask them to replace the phone, they said that the care could not replace it for a new one because i had bought from amazon. They are now suggesting to replace it through amazon only. Is this what i bought a 40k One Plus phone for? If i can only tag the Oneplus company people in this!!!!!What kind of mobile phones do they sell???And also i want to claim a replacement of my phone from Amazon....i just dont care if the 10 days return policy is over.... I just want to say that i bought a 40k worth phone from you guys... And that it doesnt work...been waiting for more than 7 days now....with a ""Dabba"" phone in hand..... Is this the kind of service you provide??? I really would like you to have my phone replaced at the earliest Reply back soon......"

5,"An overall decent phone. The clean software experience would be the reason to choose this instead of Mi 11X or IQOO 7. Hardware wise it's more than capable. The camera I would say , is decent. It depends on your photography skills. The sensor specs only matter so much, I would say invest some time in learning photography. Check the photos attached. If you are a power user , this is one of the best value for money phones at this segment. For the custom rom folks , the kernel is open sourced, so in a year can expect decent ROM. I think IQOO bootloader is not unlocked so keep that in mind."
1,"First of all, it is hearing every time I use camera and play games. And picture quality is much below average. I previously owned Oneplus7 T and I had to sell that in order to buy this one. It was a wrong decision. The sensor is so bad and whenever I click a photo it is never detailed but only superfluous. I am disappointed."
1,Disappointed. This was my first purchase of oneplus phone and I was so eager to get a hand on it. But seriously there is need for improvement. Battery is like a candle as it is draining easily. Product has no premium finish. Also the display is not up-to the mark. They're claiming it as a gaming phone and sorry to say that you can't use it as a gaming device. Also the camera is average. Please don't go for it as there are lot of other good smartphones in the market with same set of features for 40k. Big no from my side. One plus Nord is better than this and I would recommend One plus should call back entire.  9R series.
5,From One plus 3Then One Plus 6And Now One Plus 9R...Always Launched and Booked😎😎😎No issues ever.
1,Battery issues
5,"As I'm a OnePlus user for more than 4 years now I purchased the OnePlus Plus 9 Pro on 30th March and loved it.And got the 9R for my sister and she loved this phone.I would say it's better to get 9R over 9 else buy the 9 Pro.Camera on the 9R is not as people are saying that it's bad. It's decent for the price. A normal person can't tell the difference btw.Screen is beautiful, phone looks premium."
5,"Okay, First of all, I was using oneplus 6 before and was planning for an upgrade, and eagerly waiting for 9 series. I decided to buy Oneplus 9 first, then I came to know that it wont have OIS stabilization. Then I planned to go for Oneplus 9 pro, but !! Insane heating issues and battery draining problem.Why should I waste money for such a phone, and finally I bought Oneplus 9r . Folks Hazzelblad is just a gimmick, Anybody using Oneplus 9R can get the same output using Google camera in OP9R !!Speakers are really good, Dolby Atmos, Cameras are above average+ , Super stable video mode gives you iPhone like stabilization, gaming is supercool, I bought 12/256 varient, and its super snappy, butter smooth. The only struggle I'm facing right now is the availability of accessories like tempered glass and back cases (official glass and cases are really expensive) , and we know this is a new model launched days before, so hopefully it'll sorted soon !!"
1,Worrest decision taken by OnePlus not providing 5G network bands in india. Only one 5G band in OnePlus 9R. Before they said we will provide other 5G by update. I want my money back. I will take legal action
5,"Review (8GB):This phone has very good performance. I ordered lake Blue its looking Stunning. love the device.Pros:=> Great performance/speed for SD 870 processor=> Battery life is fine=> Gesture control, Finger print scanner is nice=> Good cover provided with the phone, that really helpsCons:=> Heating while charging the phone. May be because of fast charge effect, OnePlus should look into this. After 100% charge, it automatically get cooled. no heating issueAs others are complaining there is=> No display tint issues=> No heating issues while using the phone, gaming etc. But noticed while charging=> No charging issues, within 10-15 mins 60-70% chargingRear Camera is good. Getting good pics in portrait mode. i will add few pictures soon."
1,"I just switched from OP6.Unlike when I brought the OP6, when I had zero complaints. I'm having many issues with the OP9R from day one.Things to note:1. The display has some major issues, there's an off-axis pinkish tint to whites and grays, which is quite annoying, and almost all the devices seem to affected with this as per OnePlus forums.2. The Camera are just mediocre, and I find the OP9 Camera much better than this. Even though OP9 lacks OIS, it almost always catches better pics and has better focus and stabilization in videos. Like MKBHD said, the Macro and Monochrome sensors are just garbage.3. The whole of the phone, particularly the backplate vibrates on playing sounds, it's pretty annoying and makes the phone feel cheap.Good stuff:1. Warp Charging is unbelievably fast.2. Other than the off-axis color shift, it's a great display.3. The phone is very snappy, added to the 120Hz display gives it a very confident smoothness.Overall:I think OnePlus put very little effort to this phone, as if they made it just to satisfy the Indian customers to complement the OnePlus 9 series. Their quality control seems to be quite bad, as OnePlus forums is full with issues with this device. I have a very unpopular suggestion, buy the OnePlus 9, it's only 7K more (SBI Credit Card). You get a newer and efficient Chipset, a substantially better camera. Having OIS gives no seeming advantage to OnePlus 9."
1,"I got a defective phone, it is struggling in moderate to weak network areas. Data Speeds are not even 20kbps. Highly disappointed. As the pic depicts, mobile data error icon can be seen 90% of my day usage. It is very weird. I switched from samsung a50 to OnePlus. it gave me excellent data speeds even in poor network area. I will update my review after one month."
1,Got a defective product and amazon is not ready to exchange it saying please contact manufacturer for warranty.
5,"The OnePlus 9R is a fair proposition in terms of the phone's pricing. For Rs 39,999, I get great performance, along with a very fluid and clean software experience. The photography, especially in low light, might not be spectacular, but it's still pretty good. Fast charging, decent battery life, and an attractive design contribute to the OnePlus 9R being a great purchase decision."
5,"Ordered Carbon Black; 12GB+256GB variant.Recieved a day early, on 19 April 2021.First Day Review:This phone is basically an 8T but with a Snapdragon 870, at a lower cost, but that doesnt mean they skimped on quality.So far from 1 day of use, this phone has been incredibly snappy and intuitive. Switching over from a Galaxy Note 8 was a piece of cake, although it took a good few hours to transfer the data.Charging is really quick as you would expect from a 65W WarpCharger.Camera quality is satisfactory in Auto mode, and gets better in Pro Mode with manual control.Speakers are loud and clear, and there is enough stereo seperation that it doesnt feel too unbalanced.Screen gets really bright and colours are accurate, haven't run into any rainbowing, Black Crush or Purple tinting issues. The 120Hz refresh rate also adds to the snappiness feel of the phone.Gaming is really enjoyable, especially those game that take advantage of the features like haptic feedback in COD Mobile. Speaking of which, the haptic motor (vibration) feels super crisp and tight, giving it a premium experience.I had gone for the Carbon Black, and the matte finish on the back glass is exactly what I had hoped for, and the matte finish also has an advantage of repelling fingerprints.So far the phone has been awesome, and I recommend it 10/10.Will update this review if I notice anything off :)"
4,"The only reason I went for Oneplus 9R is that I have been using Oneplus 5T from last 3+ years, the phone is perfectly fine till now and I always wanted to go with Oneplus for the upgrade after using Oneplus 5T and for its great user experience.Coming to the Oneplus 9R, I am not totally satisfied with the phone as I had higher expectations on Oneplus 9R. With the given features and upgrades I feel the phone is not doing so great. When you compare this phones with the similar range of phones from other brands you will have different opinions and thoughts.Pros:- Display quality is very good, with Fluid AMOLED Display and 120 Hz refresh rate display it is buttery smooth- Built quality is great, with aluminum body and Front and back Gorilla Glass 5 protection. Feels premium in hand- Phone speakers are doing well, sound is crisp, loud and with more details- Handset microphone is also great, Can hear the exact voice of the caller and it's clear and loud- Performance - Qualcomm 870 Chipset is doing well, phone is running smooth with no lags so far.- Front camera is good if you compare with other 16MP sensors on other phones.- As usual clean UI experience with Oxygen 11 OS.Cons:- Minor heating issues.  Felt phone was heating up during initial setup, while moving the files from old phone to new one. first 2-3 days felt phone is getting warmer with normal usage aslo and during the time of charging. I feel the heating issues resolved after receiving the first OS update or who knows the phone might be settling down after few days of usage.- Primary camera(s) is not up to the mark, photos can be seen only better in pro mode, videos are little better and front camera is OK. Lots of additional and unnatural colors are being added to the shot. There is no much clarity when you zoom and no details and images are scattered. Camera is not good with the hype which Oneplus created.  I wish Oneplus would be able to fix the camera issues with some good updates if hardware supports and if not then that's it.-Battery backup - Battery drains very quickly with the 120Hz refresh on, battery lasts only for 1 day with full charge and optimal usage. But the good thing is, it charges very quickly as well with 65W Warp charger. from 6 to 100 % took 49 minutes to charge.Overall, if you want to go with the display and performance other then Camera quality and some other issues which I highlighted, then you can go for it and if you are an Oneplus fan.NOTE: Whoever wants good Camera, they might think twice before purchasing this phone. You will get way better camera phones than Oneplus 9R under 40K (38 with discount)."
2,"OnePlus did a blunder with this one. Battery quality is very bad. And it's charging very slow. I'm not sure it's some unit problem or software issue, so I've requested a replacement, but it states over 1 hour to full charge when it's already charged 60%. The charging rate is very low as well, and battery deplete very fast, I can say it depletes faster than it's charging rate.Screen quality is great.Sound quality isn't very good either, it has very less max volume, I literally had to keep it at full volume always for a decent sound.As for heating issues, as everyone else is stating, it's over heating a lot! While normal usage it overheats, let alone any power playing.Honestly, I feel OnePlus made a blunder here. I was really looking forward to this device. Let's see how the replacement unit feels.Edit - battery seem to be performing better after replacement. However, still have issues like overheating and speaker sound."
4,"I have an OnePlus 3 and an One plus 8 and this this my third purchase of an oneplus phone in the family.A bit disappointed to hold the phone at first after using OnePlus 8 for almost a year now. First, the lack of curved edges deprives you of a smooth navigation gestures especially with the cover on. Further, it is not the slimmest phone in this price catagory. But not so heavy.Full marks to the Super-AMOLED display, which is super cool and crisp. Even in broad sunlight, it is visible because of the 1,100 nits it offers. Build quality is very premium. Ergonomically well designed. Perfect for one-handed opraration. The front and rear is of corning gorilla glass 5 and the frame is metal (where as for the OnePlus 9 the frame and rear are of plastic!!) Lucky me! So it looks very elegant. But no IP rating for water proof is disappointing. But company says it is water proof. The insulation in the SIM tray is an evidence.The phone is superfast with a great sensitivity for touch and swipe gestures with the Snap Dragon 870 processor. 120 hz refresh rate is super smooth. Gamers would love it with a top-notch haptics (vibration features) and with the 244 hz touch sampling rate.Battery charging is very fast too. The juice holds up for quite long because of the better power management by the latest processor and the LLDR 5 RAM. Delightful!! Occassional warming yes during heavy games. That's normal. Camera is decent. Front camera is 16 MP should be a 32 in this price range. Avoid beautification option as you may look like a cartoon. Rear camera takes above average photos in day light. But below average during low light/ nights especially the wide angle camera. But it has optical image stabilisation even the OnePlus 9 doesn't have that. So shaky hand fellows don't worry for the blur. Videos are of best quality. Best in this category. With a good video editor and skill you can make cinema like videos but the stabilisation is not-so-good in the nights.Stereo speakers are of very good quality. It is loud and doesn't crack even at high volumes. Call quality is decent. Not comparable with iPhones though. And Dolby audio is very enjoyable with headphones. With a good quality earphones/ headsets, I assure it is not less than a immersive audio experience especially for games.'Flip to mute' and 'raise the phone to answer' features are missing. Don't know why. It is just a OnePlus 8T with a good looking rear camera console with Rs.3000 less. Even the cover of 8T suits perfectly on this.So overall I am satisfied if not delighted. My OnePlus 8 is still better I feel. But this is the best in this price range. Better than the vivo x60, Mi11X pro or even the samsung S20 FE especially for the build quality and the premium feel it gives. Also the oxygen OS is best out of all android OS'. Also the in-display finger print sensor and the face unlock, I have not experienced  anything faster, prompter and more acuurate in recent times with anyother gadgets!! But the phone has only one 5G band. Suggest not to use the cover supplied with the box. It gives a kinda smoky look and makes the phone look bulky. But withstands accident falls. I have ordered the sandstone bumper case from the OnePlus store. Lake blue colour variant is awesome. Best of all the colors of all the OnePlus phones till today in my opinion. Catches not much finger prints or smudges like the 8 series. Scratch proof. Phone comes with a pre-applied scratch gaurd sticker. So no extra purchase required. Charging cable is a bit shorter than OnePlus 8. Type C charger with 65W charging adapter. 0 to 100 in 50 minutes. One significant change here is the data transfer to and from computer is quite faster than my OnePlus 8 also using OTG. Adaptive brightness they have got it right this time. In previous Oneplus devices, it was irritating. I have become loyal to OnePlus because the life of OnePlus phones is quite long compared to any other leading brands. My OnePlus 3 still stands formidable after 5 years. One star less just for the absense of curved edges display and a not-so-slim thickness. Else this phone is very good. Though corner of my mind says the price should be 10% lesser.P. S.Not encountered any overheating or battery draining issues as highlighted by some users. May be because I bought the phone after the release of first software update  and updated before writing this review. If you are not a fan of flagship processors and not a gamer, go for the OPPO F19 Pro with half of this price. Slimmer, lighter and with 3.5 mm jack."
1,Worst camera...  even a sub-10k phone will beat this phone in camera segment.I never expected such poor quality camera in a flagship killer brand..... first and last OnePlus phone. Congratulations for losing your customer.
1,Heats like hell. Initial set up heats up mobile.. 7nable to hold even after using a back case.. Same with games/camera/video streaming apps. Difficult to hold in hand. Needs an urgent fix.
4,"I have been using Realme 2 pro for the past 2 and half years and I felt like I needed a upgrade and bought OnePlus 9R, have to say it's a worthy upgrade and the speed is amazing. Everything is super fast and 120hz refresh rate is cherry on the top. Camera is okaish nothing that great. There are some heating here and there while using apps. Battery is okay as well. If you are using heavily it will not last you for a day, with normal usage it will easily last for a day. Also the phone fully charges in 40 minutes thanks to the 65w fast charging. OxygenOs is good nothing that great. There are lots of booklets inside the box, I hope next time OnePlus reduce that and instead add a usb c to 3.5mm jack adaptor. This is the first time I am using a OnePlus phone and I am really enjoying every moment of it and I would recommend this phone to everyone who is planning on upgrading their phone."
1,"I never expected that OnePlus phones will be having heating issue. With my device OnePlus 9R 12GB, I faced this issue and highly disappointed 😞. I even bought OnePlus Buds Z as well and Bluetooth droops very often."
1,"Just recieved latest flagship phone but disappointed with quality of product at 39k price tag. It's heating up within use of 30 mints even when it gets charged up completely. Batery draining in short time even with normal use of watsapp, accessing mails. Weirdest things I have noticed that you feel the sound viberation from back side when while calling to someone and it's wrost when you play music. It give you a feel poor quality product."
3,"Here's my final review after more than one month of continuos usage of this phone.Charging speed: 5⭐Display : 5⭐Touch response and feel : 5⭐  120 hz display feels and looks butter smooth.Battery life: 3⭐ (Even in 60 hz refresh rate, battery doesn't last for a day).Back Camera (in daylight):  3⭐ (because of very bad skin colour reproduction)Back Camera (in night): 5⭐Front camera: 2⭐ (my Mi A3 takes way better selfies).Ui and themes: 5⭐Fingerprint reader: 5⭐Audio quality (Call/Music): 4.5⭐Performance: 2.5⭐ (heats up really fast).Build quality and looks : 5⭐(it won't break easily if fallen accidentally.)Internet speed : 5⭐"
1,Extremely worst battery.. battery drain s very quickly.. mobile also average camera
1,Phone was getting heat when charging and continuse use for 30m any application not expected this from brand like One plus.
5,"Review after 7 days of extensive usage. • I would say the performance you are going to get one oneplus and that OxygenOS touch you gonna get from knowhere. It's too smooth to handle after using this you'll find thise ""IOS"" devices are lagging cuz they aren't having 120 Hz display even the price for iphone 12 is almost double the price of oneplus 9R.Pros: • Snapdragon 870 which is smooth as hell either it be for video editing and redndering or it be for playing games. Even the ""Call of Duty"" runs like water buttery smooth at max fps. • Tested this device while playing games on it like COD/Free Fire with max Resolution and FOS and would say thermals are very good it won't heat up after almost an hor of gaming temp was still maintained to be as 40°C in a Non AC room. • Video Stability and recording best in the market if you turn night mode on even in the dark scenes it is well lit up no one can guess it was shooted in night. Video potrait is best for content creater the bokeh effect is mouth watering for the content creators the bokeh youll get is as similar as you'll get in a dslr camera but the surrounding should be well lit up. • Oxygen OS it is the best operating system I've seen on an Android device unlike other OS available for Android. • User interface is best thing of oneplus devices you can't get rid of it's addiction even you'll start hating IOS 😅 not actually but it's the best UI I've ever used • You'll get 5g support so you don't need to worry about future upgrades. This will work smooth. • Design and placement of Camera Module is the best the oneplus have done ever while it's completely subjective, but youll get 🦍 Glass 5 protection on front and back along with a aluminum chasis/side frame it's a well built device simply rigid and feels premium to hold. • Haptic is best in the price range. • Dua Dolby Stereo Speakers make it loud enough to consume your content at any place • Full day power just in few minutes this device comes with a 65W wrap charge which will charge your device in just the time span of 30/35 mins. You'll never fall short of power either it be powerful performance or the power interms of battery. • Oneplus's Fluid Amoled display is best screen I've ever seen smooth responsive and vivid best for Netflix, lovers xD.Cons: • There are some bugs oneplus need to solve it as it isn't justified for this kind of flagship devices. I'm mentioning few of them oneplus pls act accordingly. • While using YouTube  the framerate drops I don't know it's a google fault or what but even the notification bar seem to be freezing while scrolling down as to like 90fps. There are few more applications like Google photos application which I've discovered uptil now. • Phone get warms outside it might be due to the electronic devices catch too much of heat radiations from Sun rays. • Oneplus pls provide One-Hand mode as soon as possible as the device is having a large form factor it's quite not possible for using the device single handedly even if I am having really large palms and long fingers indeed, I am just thinking anout those girls having small cute palms and fingers💅🤣😅. • Now jumping to camera section one plus needs to work on the picture capturing algorithm the problems faced were like... • 1) Sometime captures undersaturated photos in potrait and 2x Zoom mode. • Need to work on the algorithm of focusing as it hunts for focus sometimes in the darker. • Basically Camera needed to be well optimized by oneplus in few aspects rather say camera performance is awesome just few bugs are needed to be solved. I've attached few pictures you can refer to those.Conclusion: • If you want a well built phone with best processing speeds and Video Capabilities you can opt for it it's is the best device in my terms under 50k budget but few bugs and improvisation are required & I hope Oneplus will donit sooner or later.Thanks for reading my review."
1,The product just overheating.. it is unbelievable from such great company production devices.  Here the cost does not matter but product quality is matters.1. builtin Alex is not working2. Average camera3. Overheating.I have been one plus 6t device since 2.5 so far single problem face.. I just upgraded to one plus 9 but it seems to be the worst decision. I did it as I am feeling now.
1,"Just got d phone today... frm day 1 too much overheating issue... Not possible to use...Also battery issue, 20% battery drained out in 15 minutes..."
4,One day delivery. Very fast. Kuddos on that.The phone is amazing. No complains so far. 3 days of heavy usage to check battery camera music everything.Would definitely say one of the best cameras. Sound could have been louder but not at all bad. Battery is excellent. Interface touch smoothness WOW.Didn't give 5 stars as always scope of improvement. But overall go for it. Remain a one plus fan
1,SENDING USED PRODUCT TO CUSTOMERSI BOUGHT IT WHEN I OPEN GALLERY 100 OF IMAGES ARE THERE ALSO MINOR SCRETCHES ARE
1,Oneplus is cheating us on 5gLook at the price 55000Don't go blindly friendsInstead Oneplus i am choosing Samsung
1,Network performance not good  and camera performance very Bad compared oneplus 9 and Samsung a71 both  are equally  and one plus 9 price to hight
1,"Strange change in features, automatic call recording feature has been withdrawn. Returning the phone"
1,"Dear Buyers,I bought this phone for my younger brother as his birthday gift. I was outside the city when I got this delivered to him. He was facing issues with this phone from the first day, but he didn't inform me since I gave him a gift and didn't feel like complaining about a gift. It's only after I met him I came to know that :1. This phone has serious heating issues. Gets so much hot while charging that a human hand can't hold it.2. Battery Draining issue. The battery doesn't last more than 5 hours after 100% charge with normal to low usage. If you keep the phone and stare at the battery percentage, you can actually see it going down in front of your eyes.3. Overrated camera. The amount paid for this phone doesn't justify the quality of the cameras, and the entire thing is overrated.4. I would clearly recommend buying an iPhone 11 instead. Way better battery life, camera, durability and software experience.I tried returning the phone immediately, but amazon did not accept the return and asked us to run some tests. On running the test they advised that the phone is perfect and we might be not using it right. Beautiful isn't it? And now we are stuck with this worthless heating brick."
5,"- SD888 - Superfast Processor- Real feel of 120 Hz Fluid Display- Charging - 0-100 in 35min !!!- Battery Usage: Screen on 120Hz (  Total 4 Hours ) : (2 Hours screentime, on wifi, video streaming,  including 30 Min Call Of Duty gameplay = Battery dropped from 100 to 70)- High-quality speakers ( Really Loud !! )- Decent Cameras - ( Don't expect too much Hasselblad hype )- Clean and Smooth UI - Oxygen OS."
1,This product is not worth the price. I have to return it. It heats a lot and camera quality is also not good.
1,i received mobile today on 21/04/2021 i chrged the device full and within 2 hour the battery percentage came 70 perctenage and i dont thin it will last all day
1,"Camera is not really great, battery draining too fast,i didn't expect this from one plus, loudspeaker for calls is not so high ,u can't listen if there is disturbance outside, but speaker for music is awesome effect, need to improve many things, battery is heating too much while using camera or for using in hot sun, u should improve this,if u lift ur phone from rest,all mobile shows fingerprint scanner to unlock,but one.plus is not showing that ,u should double tap or press the lock but it annoying for this, typing has also become difficult for me compared to my old mobile, sliding is also not good if u use this while texting, first it was to take about 50min to charge fully,now after 4 5 days it's taking 30 35min"
2,"Positive - phone is fast, no hang or lag, smooth operations and usageCons -Below average camera qualityVery bad battery performance. The bettery drains like anything, you feel the anxiety while using.I was not able to write the review of this phone for almost 4 days after the launch, clearly shows amazon and oneplus wanted to trick people buying this.Conclusion - not worth buying"
2,"Initial review after 2 days of use.Look and feel is great.Function smoothly without any lag.Faced heating issues even if slightly overloaded, big disappointment.Warp charge works very well, however battery is draining faster than usual.Camera is good on first impression, yet to explore more.Overall, doesn't looks like a good deal considering the price.---------------------------------------------Further reduced the rating to 2 star after extensive use of 2 months.1. Phone keeps heating even while not in use and background app restricted.2. Phone heats while charging and disable many features until temperature comes down.3. Hassalebald has only given name, seems like just another ordinary camera.4. Charging was good initially but after updates it takes more than an hour to fully charge.A basic 15k smartphone can be easily compared to this so called flagship killer. Strongly not recommended to buy."
1,"हर्षद मेहता की तरह चुना लगा दिया,हेसल ब्लेड का कैमरा बोल के । कभी मत खरीदना3 घंटे मैं 100 परसैंट बैटरी खत्म"
1,"This is the first time I am very disappointed with One Plus. We have three One Plus models and were very happy with the build, performance , camera etc. But this time One Plus 9 series disappointed. Firstly, heating issues and while switching on the mobile for first time the touch was not working at all."
5,"First things first the display is awesome with excellent brightness, Camera is top notch with 8k recording at 30fps and 4k recording at 30 & 60fps. 4500mah Battery is a beast and charges within 20mins atmost and it lasts easily for about 24hrs for a normal usage. I used the mobile for a whole day for gaming,video recording,with mobile data & WIFI on alternatively and still after 24hrs battery balance is 37% . Multi Threading is ultra smooth in this mobile as mine is 12/256 gb version and neva gets slow in any circumstances. These are so far my observations for the past 3days of my mobile usage. As of now there are no flaws with this, will update if any. Final verdict is flagship killer,if you can afford dont look back n  go for it..."
2,After usage for 2 days I am writing the review ...Heating issues are significant not even able to click pics while heating..Battery discharging Faster ..not lasting for even 8 hrs with moderate usage..Overall Not satisfied..Not expected such issues from one plus Premium phoneAmazon customer care are not replacing it.. Feeling cheated!! Waste of Money!!
4,"One plus is always good in terms of performance, display and charging. This model is marvellous in terms of charging speed. Battery backup is decent when you are using 120 Hz refresh rate. OS is very clean but you will not get many customised option as it is like a stock android. Call recording function is useless but it is privacy policy u can't blame OP for this.Camera is not as hyped by OP , hasselblad is ordinarily working. Still camera is good enough since last versions. May be future updates will do much better as hardware specifications are good enough. Front camera is ok type they must have given atleast IMX 586 in that. At this price, when u are getting SD 888 , very fast charging, Sony IMX 689 and 766 sensors, this price is good. But they should have given OIS, more 5G bands.People say that wireless charging should be given like in overseas versions. What is the use 15 watt or 30 watt wireless charging when you getting 65 watt charging. Wired charging is much quicker than wireless. So wireless charging under 30 watt will be worst.Vivo X60 or Pro may be better in terms of camera but still they are using SD 870 only. Just 33 watt charging. They are using Sony IMX 598 only.  Somewhere you are getting better but u can't beat this in terms of batter charging and performance.No heating issues I have faced when used this almost 3 hours. Design is ordinary dont look like a flagship, Color is good. Extremely light weight and handy to use.It is good to buy."
1,"The product just overheats and Battery drains in few minutes, Totally not worthy..."
1,"Guys my humble request...pls don't purchase this one plus 9.. Very worst.. Didn't expect from one plus...1. Within a 10 minutes of using getting OVER HEATING.2. CAMERA is worst.3. Network issues( • while connecting with Wifi, not getting a proper speed wic wifi having 150mbps. In this mobile we getting only 189kp. •Mobile network also worst.)4. Call is getting tooo lag..5. Look of the phone is very average.6. Screen clarity is gud.7. Builtin alexa is working gud.8. Sound clearity is gud.9. Overall worst phone at high price.10. Dont go for this one plus 9Thank you"
1,Over priced phone..very ordinary look..not amoled screen..OIS is a must in today's time which even every ordinary phone is providing. It is not expected out of a flagship phone.One plus !! You were always known for value for Money phones. I would expect you to provide OIS and good 5G bandwidth atleast as a update in future.
1,Sound is not coming through Bluetooth headset for this device
1,"One plus lost its credibility after one plus 9 release.One plus 9 is only hype and worth for the money you pay .One plus 9 is having plastic body like other substandard mobile in the market .One plus 9 does not have wireless charging for only products available in India .One plus is having only two cameras where as one plus R and one plus is having four cameraOne plus 9 is having 5G band - only two 5G bands. The customer care has been fooling us that it will upgrade to 4 5G band. Later on it has confirmed by one plus communication that the software upgrade will not enhance 5G II bandS to IV BANDSI am one of the admirer of one plus product quality  .However , it has diluted after the new release of one plus 9.What for we are paying ??????"
5,"Hey .Today I'm gonna review the Oneplus 9 5G .Ask me any questions you have directly , and I'll try to answer them all. 🙏Okay so let's start :The phone looks quite good , its thin but a bit less wide , I use an iPhone 12 Pro Max , and it's around 1-2 cm less wide . Not a big issue .Screen is fluid , no problems at all . I have used oneplus 7T so I've trust over this brand .Battery :The 65 watt charger does what it's meant to . The cable is a USB C To C . Not the old usb to C . Charges in around an hour .Camera :In my opinion , the biggest selling point is the camera here . Looks good , with a tinge of extra saturation . Way better than the older ones . Gives a lot of independence too .PUBG :ALot of people buy oneplus devices for games , and comparing to my iPhone , this device gives a good competition . 90 fps is an advantage over apple , but rarely devices give 90 fps , maybe in tdms but not in classics . No lag , but you will see some frame drops , but which device doesn't have frame drops ! Even the iPhone does .Competitors :I needed to purchase this for my mother , so Need to share why I went for this .There's IQOO , Asus and Oneplus in this range which are worth buying . I have been using one plus so I trust them more , they have a local service center too , something which I lack in my iPhone experience .I don't trust vivo much , IQOO is a developing brand , it's op for sure , but still couldn't gamble . The Oneplus gives better cameras than any other , which is the main reason I got this , as camera usage is a lot .People with similar budget with just gaming budget can go for rog , but if you need a family phone , this guy packs nearly everything .*You also get stickers and a red cable club card , which is something I like .CONS :Oneplus really needs to deal with the software issues . There's always some thing left to patch after the release , which sucks .The dialer has that annoying annoucement during recording , and that really can make you go deaf XDOverall , could go for rog if needed a gaming phone , but since a lot of my family members use this device , I went for one plus .Thanks for reading , I hope I helped you :)"
2,"The OnePlus 9 Software is a real Downer! If you're like me, then you would have gone by with the OnePlus 9 reviews and marketing press releases! Truth be told - Even after the update the phone has major flaws in software in the Alarm setting and interface! At the price charged the Camera is a real Downer! I feel cheated. This was to be a phone I could trust and hold on to for good,sadly now I need to possible buy another brand and chuck OnePlus for good! OnePlus is this ethical? You're marketing was just hype!"
5,"888 is way too fast.65 watt charging is awesome.120hz display is buttery smooth.Ram and Storage are also very fast.Rear cameras are awesome, best in this price segment.Front camera is very average (didn't liked it).Battery backup is also average, but the charging speed cover it all. If you're a moderate user you will get whole day backup.Oxygen OS is just amazing. It's the cleanest UI I've ever used and have lot of customization features too..No heating issue faced till now, it just became a little warm(very little) in booting. Other than that I played Asphalt 9 and COD mobile they were buttery smooth.Final rating from my side 9/10. ( One marks less coz take a lot of selfies but selfie camera turned out to be a disappointment for me).Go for it, awesome device, you will love using it."
5,I am using this phone from last 5-6 days. I listened very much about heating issue but after using this phone I am saying you truth I am also getting this problem but after updating the latest updates you will not goona face this problem again. But if you are working in direct sunlight for more than 1-2 hour you will get message of high temperature but in 2-3 minutes it will restore to normal.so here Is truth and phone is really amazing
4,"Using since past 3 days, good speed . No lags when multiple apps are opened. Amazing battery life, single charge is enough for more than a day. Wrap charge is superfast. 20 min for 45% to 100% charging. Camera's are good. I was using LG G7 ThinQ before. One plus 9 camera is not as good as LG. But still works well. Will post more update after a month usage."
2,"It doesn't match the quality that I have come to expect from OnePlus phones. I am graduating from OnePlus 6t. And definitely not expected based on the money you end up paying. There is nothing really special in the camera, atleast one doesn't notice a visible change except for the filters. The phone heats up like crazy even with simple operations like a video call (even after the latest Software update). Battery life is decent but not super sturdy as you would expect in a new phone, I can see this becoming a problem in the months to come.The good things are the performance, the gesture control, the ease offered by OnePlus switch."

1,I am using OnePlus since 2019. Just for the upgrade I bought OnePlus 9 5G but after all not a good option and not much happy with phone performance. Facing a lot of issues like-Heating issue is too much.battery life is not so good.Taking too much time while chargingCamera quality is average.
5,Excellent mobile . Charging is up next level. Super quality.
5,Product is good and provides similar performance as shared by one plus for 12 Gb Ram 256 Gb ROMAfter using one plus 7 pro and looking at 8 series I expected very little changes in 9 buy this cross my all expectations .Gaming.mode does not give any glitches or pixel issues .. performance is very good . Although battery gets drained but that depends on type of usage .Over all camera performance is best I have observed in this segment and Hasselblad camera breaks boundaries viewing clarity
4,"People should've waited for the updates. Phone has improved alot and still recieving updates.  Battery lasts for 1 day, its subjective. Depends on usage.  Fast charging🔥Camera puts out great quality if you turn on High Resolution from top.No heating issue now, everything is sorted. But camera needs alot of improvement it's slow in clicking.But to be honest there's nothing you'll hate about the device, You are paying this much for the camera and the OS. For camera prefer the Pro bcs of OIS. OP9 has stabilisation mode but not that effective. Great phone, if not camera go for the 8TBattery update- Initially you won't see good battery life, bcs new device takes time to understand your usage pattern and then it optimises the phone. 1st day 10% dropped in 15 mins. But now 10% drops in almost 45-60 mins. Decent battery+ Crazy charger= Satisfactory 1 day usage."
5,"I m oneplus phone user from a long time. I have used oneplus 3,6, 7T pro and now this. I m writing this review after using it for 2 days.Received phone 1 day before promised date. I bought this phone at 51999₹ with SBI credit card.Phone box contains phone with applied screen guard, back cover, charger and C to C cable for charger. You can't connect this phone to your laptop if you don't have C USB port in your laptop. You have to buy C to USB cable. Luckily I have one from my old phone.Phone is light is weight w.r.t. 7T pro which is a plus point for guy like me who carries the phone in front pocket. Also the screen size is appropriate, not too large and not too small.Phone is slim like one plus 6 and screen is flat and round at the edge like 7T pro. Front camera is not at centre, which I don't prefer.Battery looks good so far. Charging from 5% to 90% in 20min. I m using phone continually for last 2 days and I have to carge the phone twice. So I would say it's plus.I m not a game person but played game to check it's performance and found better than last phone.Cameras are really good. Both front and back camera are best. I m not a photographer but for amature like me it does job more then required.Cons for me:-1. No USB to C cable for laptop connection2. One plus phone app is not there, phone is using Google phone app, same goes with messaging app. Which is may be due to inbuilt Alexa.3. Heating of phone while charging and while using for long time, but that's what u expect when u have this much large battery.Overall really good phone within its price range with flagship brand."
2,"Average phone, esp given the hype given to it prior to the launch. Not at all a value for money. Prefer samsung or an iphone.Even lower priced phones from Samsung have far far better camera than this one.It is ridiculously over priced with the value it provides.Only positive is a wrap charger. Other than that it is an average phone.Speaker - 👎🏾Camera - 👎🏾👎🏾Pricing - 👎🏾Battery & charger - 👍🏾"
5,"AFTER ONE MONTH REVIEW1.Camera is great.I)OIS is not an issue as youtubers were saying.2.Neither overheating, temperature remains as it is on other devices it's just software glitch on apps like ampere3.gaming is so smooth that you will need few days to get used to (Cod Mobile,Pes2021,Kof, Pokemon go) even if you're pro.4.80percent battery can last 4-5 hours screen on time and 8-10 hours otherwise.5. Stereo speakers are good6.Screen quality is far better than previous OnePlus devices, Looks like samsung device from front because of samsung screen.7.Price is 6k -8k higher Just because of hasselblad logoOverall great phone go for it"
1,"I have been a OnePlus user since the original OnePlus. Never have been so much disappointed in a phone than this one.The first piece I bought - the battery heated up to 43 degrees and I couldn’t hold the phone. Got it replaced in the off chance that I had received a faulty piece.The second one - similar issues. Worse, the battery backup is pathetic. What use is a 30 min Warp charge if 80% of the battery drops down to 30% in half an hour of normal usage.Cons - Heating issues, pathetic battery life.Pros - None that just such a price point."

5,This is an awesome phone from oppo at rs10000 i love this phone very impressive features are given by oppoNice camera we can take superb photos . fingers print face id is available in this oppo a5s.its really awesome phone 😍😍😍😍😍
1,Box doesn't contain headphones
3,"The phone comes with 4gb RAM and talks about clocking excess of 2 GHz clock speed. The camera is ok and gives out decent pics. Battery life is good but sadly, no fast/dash/vooc charging available.PUBg games works on Low settings so very big disappointment here. Too much lag when try to change the Graphics settings. I would say the product description was very misleading in claiming that Games are supported.Keeping the price in mind, I would say decent phone but not worth going for if you wanted specs to match the performance."
3,"I am getting issue with my phone, issue started after return window close on 26th August voice Eco starts and sometimes videos become blur. Complaint on 4 or 5th SEP. to amazon cce said return window close have to go to service center, there Eco issue resolve but getting that video issue at times now new issue starts. When recieve call light didn't turn on automatically have to check phone after listening ringtone. I think there is some manufacturing in it, tired of visiting service center again and again. Amazon team you have to do something."
1,"i purchase it on 18 and i got the delivery on 19. And on 27 the phone screen stopped working. We cannot see any thing on the screen. We can only here ringtone, but nothing on screen. Also now the speaker is also having problem. Speaker is blasted (phat gaya hai). I have removed the sim and started using old phone now.I think the Amazon and the supplier have shipped me a used or refurbished phone. Instead of a new one. And big problem , is that i cannot even return it now. And now this phone is totally turned off. Cannot see if it is charging, or not, cannot see anything on screen. Now amazon is telling me to contact manufacturer for this.I am not paying any thing for this."
1,Headphones is missing. Worst experience.
5,Nice & value for money
4,Everything is just awesome about this phone... Every penny is a worth.. The look is premium and it runs so smooth.. No complaints so far.. Touchwood... Oppo is always trustworthy
2,"The screen resolution of this phone is very poor.At a glance it looks like a 5 inch phone.U will find difficult to use this phone if you go out of your house in sunlightPicture quality is not good as claimedYou find difficult to read the contents on screen because resolution of the phone is not at all good.Battery life is good.Sound quality is also not goodBetter, try for some good brand phone"
5,Super phone.... Nice display.. camera clarity and nice features...Phone design is very nice...If u need a budget friendly classy mobile go for it
3,Can't revive full associers with the phone like ear phoneI always revive by oppo product but this time not revive with the order it's not good sign I  not happy with the product and seller I want to return it
1,After using 10 days product performance was not felling well. It's worrest performance and if any updates will phone will not start up only sleeping mode. My complete review was oppo A5s mldel was failure
5,I am writting this review after using the phone for one month. I think I made a good decision opting this one as it is worth every penny spent on it.Pros:-1. Aesthetically wonderful2. Battery life of 1.5 days with full usage3. Screen resolution is very good4. Front camera is niceCons:-1. Fast charging not available
4,"Awesome, working wellUsing since 5th May 2019."
3,"Ok phone, my earlier Moto g5 was faster than this phone. When I click on any icon on the screen there is 1 sec delay already..... little slowness. Notifications are not displaying on top as icons because of the camera on the top bar. We need to swipe down always to check any notifications. I feel Pure Android phones are better from the usability point of view."
4,Satisfied with the product but handset not received..
4,Supper mobileValue for money
4,Best exchange offer by oppoI buy with exchange just 6800
5,"This is a perfect phone for light usage. I bought it for my father who mainoy uses his phone for YouTube, some web browsing, calling and official apps.The network reception is good, call quality is amazing.The camera is more than what one would expect considering its price and does it's job decently.The battery easily lasts 1.5 days with light usage.The screen is big but not very pixel dense but great for its target audience.Go for it if these are the things you are looking for."
1,My phone display cracked with a minor drop. The phone build quality is very poor. Fingerprint reader sometimes works & sometimes not.
1,Waste product. Encountered many faults after one week of phone delivery like camera and flash light is not working. Service center in nellore is not responding properly. Its very unfortunate that moving around service center within 10 days of phone purchase.Very disappointed. Even after one month the company has not done service. Worst service and worst product. Plz dont buy this phone.
5,"The fingerprint scanner is less responsive but the look of mobile is quite good. Best if you are not a gamer. Good for normal usage. Good battery backup, runs whole day."
1,I gave early 5 rating to this after using a week. Surpringly it stopped working after the very next day of return expired. Now I am in oppo service center. Waiting for my mobile service. Very disappointed.
1,"I owned Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 and that was way better than this phone in terms of price, camera, quality everything..This phone is very slow and has pathetic camera quality, no stabilization, only Max. 1080pIf you have low budget then only consider this!!"
5,this phone battery last for 3 days maximum if you charge it for full and used only for looking chats and for looking time....but if you use it for gaming too it last for about 18 hours after the full charge .its fingerprint sensor is good not so bad .its a good product.please do buy this phone as many of them need a phone for there online classes its ow cost but its last long
5,Nice mobile.i loved it. too good mobile .front camera is nice.lookwise superb.
5,I think this oppo mobile is the best to use for me1. I LIKE the camara2. Finger print lock.
4,"Fingerprint is ok. When the phone is used normally, the battery runs for a maximum of 2 days.If you are using online, the maximum will last for 18 hours.You can use it comfortably for 24-25 hours on offline use.If the price of this phone was up to 9000 then it was fine but buying it above 9000 is not right."
1,Camera Quality is very bad.Camera is very ordinary.I am very disappointed.Picture quality is not good.Don't buy this mobile.
5,"Very nice in all aspects , I value for the offer and price comparing the quality,Excellent, the only con is the weight feel a bit heavy and no head phone in box"
4,Not using for a long time hardly two week. So cannot comment so much but so far so good till now. Charging time phone is getting hot some times and picture quality is not fully clear.
5,Smart phone for aged group since the UI is quite simple.. I appreciate the simplicity of Oppo Phones as even new smart phone users can find it useful..
5,"A flagship experience in mid range price ✌️With Knox security (Samsung Pay, Secure folder, samsung pass, alt+z switch), Bixby (voice, dictation, routines and vision), Improved samsung notes, massive 7000 mah battery, Super AMOLED Plus display, Exynos 9825 (better performance than Snapdragon 765, but not THAT suitable for professional gamers), Very intuitive Ul(android 11) and UX(OneUl 3.1), 25W fast charging, USB-C to USB-C cable(charger brick included) and 60 Hz refresh rate (compensated for super amoled+ display), this phone is worth spending on..Only cons I found is its weight, width and height which takes a few days to get accustomed to; and around 2 hours for full charge..The looks are a bit compensated for the grand features, but overall experience is superbThe device heats up when used heavily but thats not a problem (be optimistic- this heat up checks the heavy usage so that we can spend some time in the REAL world with family and friends"
1,Camera quality bad. This phone throw in road side any body not pick. Money value is rs0 this phone. Bad
5,Awesome phone 📱Awesome camera 📷Awesome processor 😍😍awesome battery 🔋😍It is tha Incredible phone ideal phone for all students...
5,Good phoneDecent look and looks stylishCamera and battery quality are super goodGood phone in this range 👍But delivery service is not good
1,Dont buy.. after 10 to.15 mins gaming phone lagging too much
2,Not good phone stopped working after some time so i didn't suggest you this...
2,"Worst product, not as expected its not even a month and ut hangs so much! Its front camera is just worst, only it's first look is good nothing else. Don't go for it!! Redmi note 8 and even note 5 is much better than it!😤 Completely disappointed 😤😤😤"
2,Here my product review after usage of 3 months.Cons:If you bought this mobile you can't exchange. I have tried but not able to exchange my device.Please check by clicking the exchange option and you can take the decision.Now you can understand why you should not by this mobile.Gaming - Mobile heating and lagging when you playing high graphics gameBattery - 5020mAh battery. Moderate performFor charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100.Macro camera - useless featureFront and Rear camera - Not good compare with realme 6000rs mobile camera.UI is fine but consuming more ramMany pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app).I suggest please buy some other brand don't waste your money like me.
5,Totally impressed by the built and looks. For 13k I thought of getting realme 6i but the stocks barely last..!So I decided to get this phone. The phone is great and smooth. Gaming experience is also good but not as good as g90t.G85 is a decent processor with great daily life performance!If 12k is your budget go for it..Or 13k..realme 6i and 14k... Go for poco m2. Scarlet red looks stunning!!
5,Awesome product 💎Value for money 💵Best in segment📱For normal usage this one is the best 🙌Long battery life 🤳 when compared to other smartphones.Camera is ok for this price📸Charging is comparitively slow it takes 2 - 2 and half hrs or more to get full charged.🕕 Overall its best for the price  👍
5,"Hi I am writing this review post usage of 7 days,1. The Dsiplay is perfect better than Samsung M21 in the similar price range. The display is Full HD+ whereas its counter parts are not offering that.2. The camera scores over its counter parts whereas not much variations available in Selfie but fantastic at this price.3. The specifications are more or less similar to Mi Note 8 except the processor, it's Helios G85 in this one whereas its Qualcomm in Note 8 i.e 625.4. Note 8 had 4K video capture option but not with the latest  Note 9.5. The battery stays long as promised as I am not a gamer the battery lasts for over a day and half.6. This had P2i protection towards splash but not with Note 8.7. To conclude I shall recommend this phone as no brands available at such good price.Thanks for reading god bless . Enjoy"
3,"My Mobile phone has some screen issue. On completely black wall paper or black background there's a permanent white dot (like screen is defective) on the screen but i requested for the replacement soon device will be replaced. Although device is preety average, ram management is not that good.go for the snapdragon rather than mediatek.Pubg lags sometimes on medium settings and there's a ton of preloaded apps from which some apps you cannot uninstall.there are several options in the market other than xiaomi. So,choose your device wisely."
4,Very nice Phone.. smooth performance.. charge service decent.. screen quality superb.. sound ok.. but body vibration issue is here.. in speaker mode or at time of calling body vibration present.. no notification light.. overall decent performance at this price.. phone support only 18 watt fast charge. But charger support 22.5 watt..
4,Ultra wide shots
5,Nice color as of now working fine no hang or lag front camera is awesome sound loud and clearNetwork connectivity is also strong .......Go for it if you have budget of 12000 if you can add more 2000 then go for redmi note 9 proCHARGER NOT WORKING AFTER 20 MIN OF CHARGING ORDER FOR REPLACEMENT ..THANKS AMAZON FOR REPLACEMENT
4,"Good Phone----MI Mobile is OK .Battery is ExcellentProcessor is Very FastCamera Not Upto MarkThis is not 48 Megapixel CameraReally Good Camera But Not 48 MP , Selfie Also is not Upto MarkDisplay Quality is Very Good , Colour is Punchy (1080) PSound Quality is Nice  , But Note this is Not Dolby Atmos"

1,This product is not good at all.I request you to not buy this product.I have problem with this device & I did not get any resolution.
4,Nice phone
1,I brought this phone. Flash is not working properly. No intensification in flash. It working like touch is on. I complained to customer care. They sent AC repairman. I said he is AC repairman they said he is all in one. He just reset the phone and said now it works well but there is no change in previous result and the one after reset.
1,"Misguiding information!!!!!!In the banner it says ""Made in India"". But in reality it is ""Made in China"". It is a blatant attack on trust. This can't be tolerated!!Beware of misguiding information...."
1,Price is too high compared to specsShould have gone for m21
5,Awesome mobile
5,Ultimate 📷..... 🔋 backup is very good.....👌
5,Awesome product..go for it guys..delevery and packing is also good..i got it only in two days
2,Looks premium and mi claims that it has quite a lot of features. Has a better IR blaster for remote accessibility. Only the camera is the best in the price range and other aspects it’s a Piece of shit.Kindly don’t buy Becoz it’s worth only for 8-9k Move to Samsung or any other phone. Fedup with the performance of the phone in the very first day. The 2stars are only for the camera Quality and IR blaster. Phone lags much and Gaming performance is too poor and way of handling this phone requires a lot of patience as it loads for longer time for some of the app details. Battery last better and Camera quality is good that’s all. Not worthy for 13.5k.Pls don’t buy it if you expect performance from this phone or if you think you can have better features phone.
4,Good for this price range..
5,"I brought this phone for my youtube channel review,I thinks that it's a great part product for me because it's Four cameras on the back, punch-hole on the front , camera is perfect, It's me changed my status and one of the best phone i ever had review in last few days  phone capacity 128GB killer memory, Good battery it last 1 to 2 days with normal used. However, Mobile legend has a lot of frame drop when you set it into High Graphic but still manageable when you set to medium graphic. So sad, I thought this is much better compared to lasted redmi phones,The quad-camera setup is almost the same as on the Note 9S but with one small difference - the 5MP f/2.4 camera has been swapped for a 2MP f/2.4 one with autofocus, which is a very welcome feature because it makes macro photography that much easier.The main camera has been borrowed - 48MP with f/1.8 aperture as well as the ultra-wide unit - 8MP with f/2.2 aperture. The ultra-wide's sensor is quite small measuring at 1/4.0"" with 1.12µm. And, of course, the 2MP depth sensor, which serves more of an aesthetic purpose than functional one.Ｖｉｄｅｏ ｒｅｃｏｒｄｉｎｇUnfortunately, the phone supports video recording only up to 1080p at 30 fps. There aren't many modes in which you can shoot in either. A cinematic aspect ratio is available to add some dramatic effect to the video, but that's pretty much it.The Full HD video itself is a bit on the soft side and the dynamic range seems a bit too narrow. You can't see anything in the shadows and clouds in the sky are just a tad brighter than they should."
1,"Selfie Camera Not As Expected-Picture Quality Very Bad, Appearing Small Dots On Entire Face During And After Selfie Clicks.Rear Camera :Rear Camera Picture Quality Nice But Detailing Not good."
5,Nice camera quality
1,"PROS- 5000 batteryAVARAGE- processor( the mediatek processor hit a lot)CONS-CAMERA( it is fake, works like normal 16 MP camera, it is just for advertisement).CHARGER( though company says it is of 22.5 W, it takes a lot of time to charge) .ADVERTISE( you all know how the adds disturb you every time)."

3,"Product is not super value for money. Back panel plastic quality not so good.Camera perform great in daylight condition and ok in low light.I have also note 9 Pro I think that is super value for money under 14000 if you budget permit then go for it. By paying extra 2000 rupees for redmi note 9 Pro you got great build quality with back side glass, UFS 2.1 rom for storage and to great camera."

2,Phone Performance overroll good but charging speed is too slow it's take more time to charge my phone 35 to 100 percent charge on a 3 hours i am not satisfied. I am student and going to college in morning but phone take to more time to charge its 1 hours take to 30 percentage on charge. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
4,Very good phone powered with battery and performance at this Price .But the problem is the Camera clarity.I compared it with MI A3 48 MP camera with this and was very Disappointed...No other problems
1,Don’t buy this product .Image quality is below average comparing with the specification. Useless camera.And there is NO RETURN POLICY and replacing with same mobile is big headache .DON’T buy this mobile
4,"Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps."
5,Awesome
5,Best buy at this price! The display quality is amazing and I do not have any complaint with the camera too. There is no other phone available at this price which comes with 4GB ram. You should go ahead with this.
1,"Very bad experience from Amazon. Very bad camera quality of the phone. I want to return the phone, but amazon is not taking back the phone. I don't want to purchase any product from amazon further. Leaving amazon app permanently"
4,i didn't upload photo ....for any reason but it is not up to the mark .1.display 4/52.cam 3/53.fing sens.. 4.5/54.processor 3/55.build quality 3.75/5back panel is not good looking coz some self design as per my opinionin this price segment rs 9000 is good enough
5,Good product value for money but ordering is too difficult within one minute soldout
1,This phone is not value for moneyIts a downgraded phone of earlier phone launched in india.The camera is worst i ever seen in any redmi phone.Battery is ok.The display quality is very bad not hd. Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.Dot notch display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera.Recently i am using redmi note 5 pro. And this phone is just downgraded phone by redmi .you cannot imagine low light photography in this phone.The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.If you really need a phone there are many options in the market.If you are taking phone for the first and a beginner you can go for redmi 9 prime.
5,Good mobile
3,"Processor is bit slow, camera is below average except that everthing works fine. I personally don't like MIUI because of lots of ads and bloatwares. But, good budget range phone if you ignore/adjust this issues."
4,Overall its good and satisfied for the price.Pros:1. Good Battery.2. Best budget phone for 8999 with 4GB RAM and 64GB Internal Memory.The only drawback i felt is Camera.If you are looking for a better camera I would suggest to pick some other model.

5,Good product. Value for money phone. Everything is average. Display is good. Battery life is also good. I bought it for a employee of mine. Overall a good phone. 4/64 combo is hard to  find in this price range. Exceeded my expectations.
5,GOOD
1,Worst product ever as the camera quality is very poort rear as well as front. Amazon was not ready to take the return as they have a new policy now which is replacement policy so they will get you a replacement but won't take it back. Bought that in sale as had heard from friends that redmi phones are good but it ain't. Will suggest not to buy at all from Amazon as it's better to go and buy from the store atleast they take 500rs and will exchange the product. Speaker is poor you can not hear properly on speaker at all. Product is not worth in this price range as one can get better options by payin 1000-2000 bucks extra.
3,G35 is ok for day to day usage not highly capable..
1,"It is a just ok kind of phone. Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use. It is completely waste of money. Do not buy this mobile."
4,Good
2,I was having Samsung before same 4gb ram and battery back was very good but in redmi with out much of space or app ram speed is very very slow and battery back up draing with a day so not happy with the redmi product .I can return to Amazon with in 7 days but unfortunately our building is effected with covid possiitive so totally issulated no one should have contact with us so can't able to send the return mobile
4,Overall good mobile...But Camera not good as expected.Overall Performance is good .Value For Money
1,"Redmi9Too many disadvantagesCamera quality is worst:both front and rear.Processor is very slow.Body is plastic and which is uselessDisplay quality is very badMicro usb charger: this wonder, since all model new phones are coming with c-port, but this phone with old model micro usb port.Video calling is issue.Heating issue during charge aswell as during the call,You can't video call and many more issue.And you can't return the phone in Amazon.Totally this phone is gutterchap quality."

3,Charging Adapter came with phone turned out to be defective. stopped working after 2 weeks of purchase.Don't know how to return the adapter or how to claim the warranty on adapter alone.Phone is working fine so far and looks good
3,"Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3. Under 9000 INR4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)5. Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5. Building quality is poor. As well as camera are very dissatisfied.6. Useless camera bump for 2 poor camera only just for marketing showing 3 circles.7. Loaded with bloatware and adware. Unauthorised data transfer to China.If possible go for Motorola E7 around the same price and you will have great experience with Snapdragon and clean android experience."
1,"My suggestion for everyone who is thinking to buy redmi 9, please don't buy.Redmi is a very trust brand but not redmi 9.I purchased this phone 3weeks ago, first it was in good condition, after 3 week it started to hang every morning, after 4 days the phone completely shutdown.I don't know what to do, before getting one month this happened.It's getting really hurt to use this phone."

5,Awesome camera Awesome battery Awesome display  ....Super clear ZoomSuper Macro sensorSuper ultrawide angleAtlast Thanks Samsung for 730G
1,"My review after three months use:I am reducing it to one stars after three months use. Initially I gave five star. Reasons of giving one star is:1) the phone is over priced and it's actual price should be not more than 13-14K.2) occassionally it's back panel heats up.3) design is poor, especially at the back camera panel space above the flashlight is unutilized and don't look premium. Much cheaper mobile phones have better design.3) the whole body including screen, back panel and camera panel is very sensitive to scratches. You have to cover with phone case and screen guard immediately otherwise your phone will give a dirty look full if scrates after one week use.3) no IP rating. Forget water proofing, not a trace of water resistance. You have to prevent it from humidity and sweating.4) screen refresh rate is poor in comparison to other phones available below 10K range.Following was my review after almost one week use. __________________________________At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory. Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced."
1,"Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000. I have  doubt  its not 7000 man battery its like 2000 or 2500mah. Heating  issue also faced during  charging."
1,"Genuine Feedback to samsung and all buyersNot Upto the Mark..Battery is good, but mobile is very heavy.. not handy for one hand operation.. if you use it continuously then you feel pain in your  hand, designed is out dated, poor quality material.. camera is just okay..I am not happy overall performance of this phone at this price band...Mobile should be perfect for 15-16k price band..Lookwise not goodDisplay qaulity is just good not bestSound quality is goodCamera not much good that I am expecting.Big screen which perfect for movie watcher.. but after 30 minutes you feel pain in your hands.I bought Electric blue colour, it's look like samsung old samrt phone .My request to Amazon, is it possible to return this mobile. Then help me for return...I am not happy with overall performance of the phone..."
5,"Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage"
1,"There's something wrong with the new Samsung M51 mobile. Many other users are also facing the same issue. We are unable to connect through Wi-Fi on Samsung M51.Meanest Monster Ever ... HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi.Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says ""Incorrect Password"".I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1. Forget the connection and reconnect again.2. Update the phone s/w to latest version.3. Reset Settings4. Reset Network Settings5. Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened. Instead a replacement of this phone should be there, I have not even used it for more than an hour.Last year I ordered an MI phone from Flipkart, the battery was getting drained very fast. Within the next day, the phone was replaced without questions asked.Dissappointed by Amazon, the way they are handling this issue.Don't spend your hard-earned money on this phone. Unfortunately, if your phone turns-out to be faulty, then there is a never ending process to take care of issue."
1,"Usually I don't write the reviews, but this time I couldn't resist myself from doing so.First of all, I am a Samsung hater, but my wife didn't want a chinese brand phone, so I had no option than to go with Samsung. Therefore, this review may look like bias, but believe me, it's not.Doesn't look like a 27K phone. Screen looks so dull compared to my 3 years old one plus 5t phone. UI is boring. Stock android would have been appreciated. 3 finger screenshot feature is not available (though there are other ways, this one is easiest). Out of 8Gb 3.2Gb RAM was showing as used out of the box. Out of 128Gb , 32Gb was showing as used. Neither of the camera was impressive. There are some default apps (bloatware) which are absolutely useless. They didn't even provide the silicon transparent cover with the phone. The only good thing about this phone is - it is very bulky (this is not the sarcasm, I really like bulky phones)Anyway, I won't be using this phone, but feeling very bad that I spent this much of money for such a cheap phone 😥"
1,"Call quality is poor. When loud speaker is on, Cannot hear properly on the other side, call is muffled or breaking. Do someone else face this similar issue ? Is there any way to fix. I could not raise a ticket to contact either Amazon or samsung. Camera quality is also average.  Hated it.Updated review after 20 daysStarted facing charging issuesStopped charging suddenly, don't know what to doNo more replacement from AmazonNice lesson learnt:1. Don't fall into the trap of extensive hype of a product2. Don't believe youtubers reviews just before experiencing atleast 30 days of usage.3. Don't buy a product on its first day of launch4. Read the return and replacement policy thoroughly before buying."
2,"I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6. Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7. When Sealed Package open then phone display contain so much dust. Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8. Gorila Glass 3 protection under 25k i.e out dated glass protection after using 2 days with full care i got one scratch mark on display.9. NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10. Audio output in my boat rockers bluetooth headset with this phone is not as much as lound as compare to my previous phone Redmi Note 7 pro.11. Without using phone it take 2 hour to charge but when you use it frequently then it take 2.30-3 hour to charged it full from 0-100%.12. Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13. No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good. When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4. Till now Ram management is goodTo much hype created every where for this phone and due to this many user like me has purchased this phone but this phone under 25k is really not value for money. I am going to resale this phone. There are so many phone below 25k with best facilities as compare to this Samsung m51.Conclusion : Phone is overpriced and performance is average"
1,"1.On playing games, sound is too too less.2.Flash light too dull3. 7000Mah battery, all fake battery only last one day or one and a half day max4. There is no Broadband speed  indicator5.live wallpaper option not goodBetter avoid this phone, dont fall for advertisements"
5,"This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8. If you need all trending features to be covered in non Chinese mobile,THEN GO FOR IT... ALSO TRY TO UPDATE TO LATEST SOFTWARE ONCE AFTER SETTING UP YOUR MOBILE, OTHERWISE HEATING ISSUE WILL BE THERE."
5,"After using for more than 2 day's I must say, snapdragon 730g works wonderful .CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mega Pixcel and more feature in selfie camera.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also."
5,"My take after using the handset for 4 days:1. Display: Superb. Big, crystal clear, bright and everything you can expect from a samsung super amoled plus screen.2. Camera: Very good. Night mode could have been better.3. Sound: Speakers: Better than average, earphones: good4. Battery: Very good. But expected more backup from a 7000 mah battery. Had to charge it once a day for the last 4 days.5. UI: The one-ui provided here is different from the one provided in A series. The one that comes with A series phones like A50 etc is more user friendly and has more features like Secure folder, timer etc. Also, the Samsung notes app in A series is far better than the one provided here. In this price, an UI at par with the leading A series phones is expected.6. Processor: Good for normal use.7. Finger print unlock is fast and smooth.8. No case/ back cover and no earphone.9. A bit overpriced."
2,"It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos. When photo is clicked with lens covered completely,  it shows hundreds of white spots in image, same happens with pro mode too. (This is not regular image noise)"
1,"I have been using this from starting. Ordered on 18th sep and get this phone very next day 19th. Here is my overall review.1. Battery - tremendous and optimization is on next level2. Display - It's great display ever.3. Speed - faster then ever ( compared to my other phones )4. Gaming - Very powerful no laging ( played COD, Hitman Sniper, Asphalt 9)But wait, in the meantime I've faced some issues on the phone as well.1. Voice call - call is fine but when call is placed on speaker children voice could not be heard by other. On normal call it's perfect but on speaker it's not. Adult voice can be heard from a distance but children voice can't. even the phone is just near the face. This issue can lead you the problem while you're on whatsapp video call as well. First I thought it was just whatsapp issue but after certain test it's major issue on voice call. Tested with safe mode and also after factory reset (without any other third party applications)2. Fingerprint sensor - It's fine and fast. But wait. you need to setup both hands fingers so it's easy to use. Maybe if the finger print sensor placed on in-display then it's better than this but if you map with both hand fingers and thumb then it's easy. Other wise you've to wait for 30 seconds if the finger not matched for 5 times.3. Galaxy Apps - Disable it otherwise unnecessary apps and bloatware will be install automatically.4. Knox - It's displaying secured by Knox but secure folder is not there. Which should be.I have replaced the product but still the microphone issue is there so plz be carefull with this."
3,"1. NO secure folder option, This phone SUCKS.2.Processor is old same as A80 (launched in April 19)2. Display is Good3. Back Panel (it's plastic wanna be glass;) , watch it on the first and last time at unboxing cause it won't be same anymore)4. Not Camera monster it's a camera average, they show 64 MP its 64 MP, which takes 3-6 seconds for one snap. Till then moment is already gone.5. Battery works only for a day.For 27K it doesn't worth it.Don't buy it, seriously."
4,"Initial experiences:- Adaptive brightness/ Ambient Display: Frequent screen flickering and unstable; had to disable.- Fingerprint Scanner: Poor quality, frequently asks you to wipe..- No preapplied screen film or back-case supplied.+ Nice AMOLED panel and crisp viewing experience.+ Not bulky or uneasy to hold contrary to common perception.+ Biiig battery which lasts looong.+ Good reception and call quality.+ Not Chinese+ Better than Oneplus Nord (don't look at 5G, let our 4Gs work efficiently as of now!)+ Top notch performance."
5,"First impressions: the celestial black colour looks really good and elegant. Looks better than in pics or videos. The phone feels solid in hand. The screen is large and great quality punchy colors. The screen is also very bright.Performance too seems good except that the real performance will be known a while later as Samsung mobile tend to slow down with time. The back is a fingerprint magnet, so a case is a must.The battery is really a beast and charger is decent too. Battery easily lasts 2 days with average use, even with heavy use it lasts one and a half days.Camera Performance is great at this price. The pictures and videos come out great.I got the 6gb variant with hdfc offer and with HDFC smart buy, the price should come down to 22000. Its a great phone at this price. Most of the cons mentioned in online reviews are not for me. I am happy with this phone.Why I preferred M51 over Nord? M51 ticks all the right boxes for me. A great screen for watching videos, good casual gaming, a great battery lasting at least 2 days, a better camera, 128 gb storage with microsd card support  and at a price which is Rs. 3000  cheaper. I already have Samsung and Oneplus phones at home. So I can say with confidence that you won't go wrong with any of the brand.My overall first impression is that its a great phone with almost all things that one may need at this price. Will keep updating."
3,"Camera - GoodFast charge - GoodDisplay - AwesomePerformance - GreatBattery Backup - It's Not Like 7000mah, Average ( Like 4000mah ) Need Optimization2-3 times Play Store Getting Crashed....Otherwise Good to Buy.......Amazon very good Delivery.......NoEarphone And Softcase"
1,"I have ordered this mobile on the first day of the sale at 12 o clock sharp. Yes there are some good features, But let's talk only about the CONS. The reason for talking about the CONS as the PROS are talked by other friends.  1) Vibration of the mobile is more and can't hold the mobile for longer time.  2) Mobile is higher priced compared to other same configuration devices and no tempered glass or case has been provided.  3) Guys Please check the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR Value) before buy any mobile and in this its more which affects Head and Body and not good for health.  4) Weight of the mobile is MORE and finally I won't recommend this."
1,I received the phone on the very next day of the sale.Unfortunately I am facing issue with loudspeaker and mic. So the primary thing of a phone (calling) is not working properly.Even after replacement facing the same issue.
4,"Charging and display quality is good..No hangsHeating is not obsereved during charging or using mobile.Diasble galaxy store otherwise bloatware is installed continuously.I didn't find mobile is heavy , weight management is excellent. Otherwise it's as usual normal android.. phone.. camera I didn't like much both front and back useless. I purchased this phone esp for display and battery. For small hands mobile is bit tall not width wise..Macro photo lots of granules seeing.. I think in my phone macro lens is defective.. speaker output is not good. 3.2 gb ram used out of 8 gb by default .."
5,Great phone with good battery life the battery usually lasts for 2 days on light usage and charges super quick
5,"Pros:1. Value for money buy at 23k considering the offers.Try to get it at this price range by bank offers being offered.2. Camera is brilliant.Compared to OnePlus Nord and others in this price range.3. Snapdragon 730G optimized very well.Processor is snappy.Compared to other brands (realme 7 pro, one plus nord), it gives faster perfomance as it has been properly optimized.4. Battery is the top selling point for this phone.I have to take office calls for 5/6 hours a day, including webex meetings with wifi always on.It still last me 1.5 days.5. Display is excellent even though it is providing 60 hz refresh rate.Amoled display of samsung is brilliant as always.Cons:1. Back is plastic. Does feeling like a 25k phone.But as 7000mah battery had to be adjusted in a compact way, samsung had to compromise  with the design.2. 4k/1080p videos can't  record in 60fps.Doesn't  bother me much, it depends on your preference."
1,"Samsung delivered defective piece and had to gone through replacement cycle. Believe me, on Amazon getting replacement is not easy.  It was a manufacturing defect.Do see your phone thoroughly, as soon as you receive to check for defect.*** Amazon has no return policy on electronic items, even if product is damaged. They dont care. ***Finally after getting product :Camera, User Interface : GoodHeavy (because of mega battery). Its a big phone, so personally I am not finding it handy.Battery life : still need to find."
5,"This is the best phone in 25000 segment  730G processor with 7000 mah battery with 25w fast chargingThe display quality is amazing as it is S amoled panelThe 64 mp camera captures amazing details it also has night mode and slowmo, hyperlapse, one take, macro camera is not good tho . It tried fortnite it can run on medium graphics with 30fps limit and its pretty smooth thanks to 730G . The front facing camera quality is very good  i have attached pic of  ram usuage with no background app running one thing i didnt like was u cannot zoom in when u set to 64mp camera mode and it is filled with unnecessary apps like daily hunt and many others"
3,"Well, as compared to the same feature range phones. The price seems to be 2-3k high. But if you are bored of charging your phone every 6 hours, you have a relief here with 7000 mAh battery, which doesn't  disappoint you.  I choose primarily for the battery and it lived up to the point that it stated. With playing 1 hour of playing COD, using hotspot for a full day and browsing it lasted for more then 40 hours and there is a battery saver mode too, which will last for a week if you are travelling out and need to use phone for only call and minimum usage.But, if you are a non-stop gamer it will last a day depending on the usage.Pros:Display is good, performance is fine, battery is stand out. The camera is also good and bixby vision is cool. Many edited features come with the camera, that is added advantage. Sensors are good and fast too. The weight is well balanced, you won't feel the weight after a day's usage. Charging is quite quick. Rest of phone's features are fine.Cons:Plastic built body, no tempered glass or case is provided within the box. The speakers are located at the bottom which is uncomfortable if we hold the phone in two hands and watch videos or play games. In dark, the screen display may cause some burden to the eyes, which I did not face earlier. The background apps keeps running until you close them or optimize the battery which will automatically close all the background running appVerdict:Little high-priced, very good battery and a satisfactory performance."
3,"Awesome phone..all good reviews..1.definitely heavy, what else u can expect with huge 7000 battery, yet manageable.. u cant hold and watch movies or matches for long u need a stand..have to use Bluetooth or wired headset while talking as its heavy, u feel it slips off2. Stunning display amoled at its best..watched Enola holmes3. need back cover else scratches will be evident glaringly and lose its premium feelMost important worrying fact is SAR value at 1.3, the only fact I am disappointed with samsung..u can check dailling *#07#..ps samsung are valued for low sarAudio loud speaker I am not satisfied"
1,"Ibought it for 24,999 but now it's 19,499. Cheap phone but samsung looted me. Be aware of foreign countries. Either is Chinese or any other."
1,"I have been using Samsung Phones ever since they ventured into Smart Phones. I had privilege of using majority of Samsung Phones like Galaxy S2, Samsung Grand, Samsung S6, Samsung S9+, Samsung Note 3 and Samsung S10.When Samsung launched M51, like many I think I am also fooled by aggressive marketing campaign and youtube reviews by youtubers like Technical Guruji (I unsubscribed his channel due to fraud review)Why I purchased this phone because ofBrand SamsungExpected Good Camera SetupExpected Good Build QualityExpected Good PackagingAnd for this I have paid good price of INR 25KWhy I am disappointedBuild quality is quite inferior it's cheap plastic that use to come in phones like Karbon or Lava in 2012-2013.Camera setup is quite average, they say it's triple camera but picture quality is not so great, night shots are average, I think if you buy brands like Xiaomi you get better pictures by spending less amount. Probably that's why Samsung is marketing Single Take feature, which I think won't work if camera is average.Packaging, after paying INR 25K one expects box to include stuff like Phone Cover as these days majority of manufacturers, but here it comes with cheap quality of Box, that has nothing but a cheap charger with very poor quality of packaging, now a days many manufacturers are also putting the screen protectors at cheap cost, Samsung should take a note.Phone weighs quite heavy and is not easy to use with one hand, this is something nobody is telling, probably thats the only reason Samsung has degraded the build quality.What is good about this phoneBattery - Certainly that's the only feature for which I paid INR 25K. But are you willing to pay this much for a phone that's more of power bank.Headphone Jack - Samsung has retained it, and it's output is pretty good.Apart from that phone has same processor like Samsung A80, which comes with better camera setup and better build quality.Therefore I feel Samsung is over charging customers for this device and it should not cost more then INR 15K - 18K.So if you are only looking for battery and headphone jack then spend money on this one and If anyone wants to contact me I am ready to resell mine at 20%  discount.I wish they had option of giving zero stars.Amazon I am sorry this is my worst ever Amazon shopping experience which I regret everyday when I see what I got."
5,"EDIT : I have added 7 days battery usage video, please use that as new reference for battery usage.Original :Before you read the review, please know that I mainly use my phone for productivity and social media. I do not game heavily or photograph heavily.To me the best part about it is the display. I've never used an OLED display and moving from standard LCD to OLED is magical. The system wide dark mode support makes everything look sexy black!The battery is super powerful, although I've to use it for more days to give a better review. From what I experienced, you can easily get 12-15 hours of screentime at least, spanning over 2 days. The charging is as advertised, taking around 2 hours for a full charge.I'm not a camera enthusiast beyond some selfies and occasional landscape photography when I travel. The camera provided satisfied my expectations. Please look at same photographs attached, bearing in mind that light conditions were not optimal and I'm not an expert at the art. Also, it has Cam2 API support, so you can install a Google Camera mod and tweak the settings to your liking.This phone is worth it for the display and battery for me. It has everything I expected. Only disappointment is that it doesn't come with a cover or screenguard, while other manufacturers provide that even at this range."
3,"After 48 hours of usageVery much excited when I saw the specs. but!!!!Pros:1. Display2. Procesor  SD730G3. Camera4. Fast chargingCons:1. audio not loud getting crack sound in speaker mode2. Battery (it's 7000Mah) but discharging quickly(I didn't play games, I used it only calls, and YouTube). I felt like its a 4000Mah.3. Backside material looks very cheap. attracts lots of fingerprints4. Price is very high.5. Back case is not provided. (Phone is slippery need to handle with care or buy back case).After all, I feel this phone average for this price. (*** stars)if the price is 19999/- with this specs my price is (***** stars)"
1,Phone heats up while using camera for few minutes.Writing this just in one day of usageOther feedbacks in few daysHeating a lot.. worst ever experience  with Amazon
1,"I bought Samsung M51 on launch day itself! Within 2 days of usage, screen started flickering. Even Samsung customer care said that it's faulty screen"
1,"This mobile phone have many problems such as WiFi  issues  , Bluetooth issues,  saving pdf issues , sometimes light sensors not works , app is not working  ( showing many times) .This OS is CORE version  not as A series galaxy smartphones.I think in m51 is a experimental device by Samsung  .Samsung  inserted many apps from A series  maybe  this creates  problems  , because  its OS is core .Before purchasing M51 keep this things in mind  .I recognized after 17 days of using this .I mean to say , it creates problems after 17 days of using  .And now I am unable to return this mobile M51 .Service center told me this , its a OS problem  , after few days all m51 smartphone will get Software updates  .  Or to submit M51 to Service center  to get value of this smartphone  as a coupon,  which I will redeem coupon in exclusive Samsung showrooms  ."
5,GOOD OVERALL PHONEBATTERY IS HUGE USING PHONE FROM 7 AM ( 100% ) BATTERYPLAYED GAME FOR 50 MINUTEINSTAGRAM FOR 40 MINUTEMANY CALLS TOODID MAILING & TEXTING ALSO IN WHATSAPPWEBWHATSAPP IS ON FROM 9 AMWORKING FINE TILL NOWCAMERA IS WONDERFUL & WILL TRY ASPHALT 9 & THAN EDIT THIS REVIEWAT 5.20 PM ITS 76% BATTERYNow after use of many daysPhone works the same just one problem some time phone get disconnected automatically i don't  know if it is problem of phone or something else overallMust buy product for sure
5,Straight to the point :Purchased in first saleReceived : 20sep2020- Really heavy can start wrist pain if not used properly (but including 7000mah in this weight is surprisingly excellent. Kudos to samsung)- Headphone jack is a boon ...although I use TWS but a headphone jack is a must.- Battery can be stretched more than 1.5 days with normal usage. But initially need to disable every background app to get optimized battery life.- Glastic back panel is shiny but will not give premium feel.- Fingerprint is decent but getting used to side mount will take time.- Not for osmo mobile 3 (which I have tested and also try to upload video) uncomfortable to load and unload.- Excellent camera and video esp macro- Selfie cam is also good- Requires some adaptor to charge old phones. Mi cable is good converter & charging cable for usb mini- Speaker is average- Bloatware is there but can be disabled ...- 6gm ram and snapdragon processor does the job efficiently.- No hapticsA nice decent phone from Samsung.Pro Tip : Never buy a phone on the basis of whats new always buy on the basis of what you need. You can if you've extra bucks ;)Unboxing will be soon available on YouTube : IemMihir.Don't know but my initial review was deleted and I had to write this again.
1,"As mentioned by Samsung 7000 mh battery but battery drains very fast at the end of day when I am using internet,watching videos. Battery needs to carry for two days at 7000mh but it is not carry one day also. Please do not buy this product. Display is also very bad super amoliad  Display is fake some times video shows red faces. It is not zero edge after full Display video get cutted from the edges of phone display. Speaker sound is third class not upto the mark what we expect from Samsung. Handset provided doubly atmos but when I use headphones also can't find atmos experience. Very bad handset on this range better you can buy Samsung m31s for that.I provide 1 out of 10 ratings for this set. Its a garbage set."
5,"I purchased it on 18 September on 12:01 pm with no delay as I wanted to buy this amazing phone by Samsung. Surprisingly  it was delivered on the same day within 6 hrs. Now I have used it for almost a week and can give my overview about the phone. I will provide you the main pros and cons of Samsung M51PROS:#SuperAmoledPLUSdisplay believe me it is one of the best display I have ever seen on mobiles. You will love the premium quality while watching video and seeing photographs infact reading on this mobile feels great.#Camera: Amazing camera quality it gives natural colors, dynamic contrast ratio is better than the phones come between the price range of 30 to 40 thousand. Daylight images are just magical. 64mp camera is just awesome. 12mp macro lense gives you amazing details. Wide angle for selfish lovers where you will get most of the function get works automatically. One take picture is just amazing too. I can say you will not get such camera performance  in other phones even if you choose any phone having price beyond 40000.#Battery: Believe me if you are a normal user your battery will not get ended before the third day. If you are moderate users of phone it will give you atleast 2 days of battery backup. And if you are a hard-core mobile user you will not able to drain this battery in one single day.#UserfriendlyOneUI: what a lovely UI, very smooth , no confusing icons, better placement of folders in my files. Categorization of items by samsung is awesome anyone can use this with no difficulty. Your pics, videos, recordings, documents  everything will be kept in right place and believe me it will make you so happy as you don't have to find anything here and there.#Snapdragon730G: what a great thing to have both thing in your phone one the brand Samsung and another the processor snapdragon. Yes this processor  made M51 a great choice. Snapdragon helps to improve your gaming performance plus it also helps in smooth functioning  of different apps. No lag while viewing videos, playing games and making calls.CONSLook these are my point of views may be the cons don't have any value for most of the users.#Size: The size of phone is 6.7inch which can be a bit big for many users especially having small hands. Besides, bike riders who use to go offices daily may find this phone challenging while keeping inside the jeans pocket.#Body: the body of phone is glastik and it is so scratchable that means you have to buy the backcover as soon as possible. Using backcover and tempered  glass is advisable. This is not a big cons as now a days we all use back cover in all phones so don't take it as negative one.Hope you will like the review and it will help you give you idea of purchasing the phone."

5,"Happy to write 1st 100% Satisfied product review regarding Tecno Spark 7 Pro (Magnet Black 6GB RAM 64GB Storage smart phone). Liked Unique features like Kids Mode, Special functions, FREE from Harrassment filter for Spam calls and SMS, chip-assisted protection, Display Eye care setting, Truely worth of price satisfied with its features. Competes well with other top branded phones."
5,"Been using it for a few days and specs really hold up. I had just bought this as it was good value for money phone I could find with 4GB+64GB. But after using it, I realized the other features like the display, battery backup and camera are all great. Screen is highlight!"
5,"I was slightly skeptical about buying Tecno but after seeing my friends use it, I went ahead. After using it for a few days I realized why Tecno is so popular. I was never into clicking pictures, but after seeing the camera in this phone, I have begun trying my hand at photography. I feel the phone does the job more than I do. Best camera ever."
5,"I loved the camera on this phone. You can check from the pictures in my review that how amazing pictures you are able to click. This phone has a whooping 89.5% of screen to body ratio. I'm a huge gaming buff and watch a lot of movies and series. The big screen is such a delight to watch on. Also, the 180hz processor makes gaming smooth. Overall, I love this phone."
5,"I bought the phone after a lot of research,as i wanted a value for money all rounder and boy there are so many options...This one has it allLOOKS -9/10 -Looks stylish,suave,upmarket and yet simple.CAMERA- 9.5/10 - Fantastic camera at this price , both pictures and videos are amazing with great ai featuresBattery,Display - 9/10Go for it if you want a vfm all rounderCONS-1.Not really a con but it has single front flash whereas the specs mentions dual front flash,so though usage wise it's not at all an issue but you expect better communication.OVERALL-9.5/10 -- GO FOR IT!!!"
1,"Not dual front flash,Only single flash"
4,"Amazing finishing, great speed worth for money."
5,The phone works well without any performance issues like time lags or apps hanging midway. The screen resolution is excellent and gives a crisp viewing experience with bright colours and good clarity. The camera has an excellent resolution and is able to take equally vivid photographs during day and night-time. I would absolutely recommend this phone to anyone who’s looking for a seamless experience at value-for- money prices.
5,"After a month use:Happy With:-Battery Life: one time charge for more than 1 Day- camera quality: 100% satisfied with the photos with good detail- Screen good for watching movies netflix, watched all episodes of Family Man 2 on this phone. Brightness and good color- so many colorful theme options"
5,"This phone is super cool, and I think 'xiaomi' , 'oppo' or 'vivo' like brands will not provide such a phone for even 16K bucks.Its a super gaming smartphone. The battery life is awesome. The phone doesn't heat even if you play games for 6 hours (I'd tried playing about 4 hours myself, and the result surprised me) . Even all the features are of superior quality. The camera is like samsung galaxy worth 45K bucks. There is such a huge amount of features I can't even state here. Suggesting everyone to buy. 😇😇😇😄😄"
5,"I was the first person to buy a Tecno in my family. And once, others saw the performance, this is the third Tecno phone. And as usual, Spark 7 pro also hit the bull's eye in terms of value for money. The camera works amazingly video calls and even for clicking pictures in the night. Best buy ever!"
4,Nice mobile to use that. Back camara excellent. Front cam not bad. Need to improve some settings. In Mobile hotspot settings not able to manage connections.Have a good battery. But slow charging.
5,"I urgently needed a phone and I bought this phone after being recommended by a friend. It seems to have everything in it. Amazing AI camera, long battery, great display etc. Moreover, it's Andriod 11. What more can I ask for? Check the pictures I posted. The camera captures great light and has sharpness. I am a happy Tecno customer."
1,Please if you found delivery by appario private limited... Please don't buy... I got 2nd hand mobile and returned. Mobile is okay okay... But I will recommend to you go with redmi not 9... Looks great... This techno looks like dagar.....youtube videos not looks good.
5,"I love the specs. I had just bought this as it was cheapest phone I could find with 4GB+64GB. But after I recieved it, I realized the other features like the display, battery back and camera are all amazing. This phone is clearly the best phone for 10k."
4,Good Mobile Phone
5,"Hello Friends,I giving first time feedback and 5* to this mobile phone for overall performance and value for 💸 with best features."

5,I wanted a gaming phone and all the other options were very expensive. I went for this and I think I have had the smoothest gaming experience ever. I face no issues like heating up and lagging. It feels like any game on this is a cakewalk. The battery also supports several hours of gaming.
5,Budget
1,"I am not happy buy the mobile in amazon.Whats in the box:- Handset, Earphone, USB Cable, Sim Tray Ejecter, Pre-applied Screen Protector and Protective Case, Booklet with Warranty Card and Quick Guide"

1,There is no headphone in the box... unsatisfied 😟 disappointed ☹️
2,"It's an average phone. Quite on the pretty side. ONLY those who are looking for a budget phone can think of purchasing this one. The camera is very average, but the functions & controls of the phone are smooth. It's very lightweight - that's a plus!"
5,Its a really very amazing and a nicely working phone..the camera quality and battery is also very good🤩😊.liked the product very much
4,Nice phone value for money but in inbox there is no earphone and screen protector receive being a regular customer of Amazon i am  unhappy there was  clearly written that these items are included in inbox.
1,"when i ordered this phone , headphone is free with phone but received order without headphone"
3,i have recently bought this phone..on 18 may 2020.. delivery is good but there was no headphones in a box.features r awesome nd phone is working gud.but camera quality is bit bad.
1,Worst mobile . I never expect from oppo such a low grade mobile. Touch is not working. Phone hanging. No return and replacement option.  From Amazon I got bad experience. Don't buy this mobile. Waste of money.
5,"Nice mobile prices 12,450"
1,"Body sensor not working. Was late by 2 days to find out this defect and so could not use ""return"" option.Due to body sensor problem, phone display never gets off while talking and so when brought close to ear, buttons like mute, hold gets activated while speaking.The basic function, which is to talk to others on phone becomes troublesome. Everytime have to very careful of holding position to make sure phone is not touched on body. Hate this and feel cheated/dejected.Cannot return as well."
1,It is roadside product with dusty display. When called Amazon customer care she deny to replace item. Don't buy anything from Amazon. Amazon only sells defective items. I returned many items and this was very useless response. She also disconnected call.USELESS AMAZON
1,This mobile was used by someone else.I have got someone else's mobile.I am not happy for this mobile.I will not do return this mobile.Because the reason of I give gift for other person.
4,"Better to value for money , quality is as per shown ..And fast delivered by amazon."
1,Earphones not received in a phone box
5,"Oppo always exports premium quality mobiles. Let there be no such features like other mobile but i phone also doesn't export such features at high price, then?I have attached some pictures also you can check them incase you wanna see the picture quality.Hence you can buy this without any tension.Amazing mobile's camera and body quality and display is also good.Go for it I suggest. 😃"
5,Fantastic
5,The phone is excellent but if the front and rear camara should be high and should be their dark mode compalsary but it should be added fastly and should give ear phonesonly main default is not nice camara should be high because the less cost mobiles will take more tean agers so they do moor selfies so it should increase and oppo is the selfie expert but this phone no selfie expert camara for next phone it should increase .Imay think I will increase
1,This product received wrost.. In this item some useful applications not run..Order canceled but no cancelation status and pick up status updating by Amazon..No any contact provided by Amazon..Realy disappoint..
2,This product details said there is a earphone and screen protector.  But i didnt get that
1,Don't buy it from Amazon the return service of Amazon is very bad..disgusting they never think customer problem no one in call centre never call you return policy and service is very poor only benefit looking cite ... don't buy anything from amazon.. in future I never buy electronics items from Amazon... flipcart is most trusted than amazon
3,"I like the product. But as compared to my other phone Realme X2. I found the lag in processing in some of minor things also. It is having 6GB RAM then also the having some processing issue. I don;t like the product. Even after this specs, the things are getting lag."
4,Nice mobile in this Price 👌👌👌👌..
5,Very nice phone for Rs.12500/-
4,Nice product...but there is no C pin charger  thts only one prob in this product...
1,"i have received the waste and damaged products and i chasing the customer support from last 10 days no solution upto now waste of money on  amazon ,waste of time on amazon ,and i customer of amzaon from last 5 years and i am a prime member this is the services i am getting"
3,Headsets are missing in the phone box...where are the original headsets...its normally included in phonebox??
1,The phone lags a lot right from the box. You have to swipe 3-4 times. Apps get hung. Never seen such a pathetic phone.
4,"Good product  but as compared to Mi note 8 its not Good . If you want to rought use for bussiness purchase.. Provessor is slow , not for gaming. But want you tube and surffing it's usefull. Another all thing is good .I don't have time for upload pics , but this review is enought.Product is same as photos."
5,For the money an excellent phone. My usage is mostly for mail and messaging. Bit of browsing and reading. The battery lasts for two days in my use. I bought one and then I was very happy with it and I bought another of the same.
1,"Screen quality is very poor , camera is also nearly poor, all over the phone is worst. I ordered this phone by choosing the no cost emi option of Bajaj , but they are also taking the processing charges of Rs.174 on every instalment.So please don’t use Bajaj’s emi option for ordering this phone. Thanks"
3,Updating after 4month :-screen recorder not available..which is default function of every android now a days..-Charging draining faster but charging gaining very slower.-its not a 21st century phone .. so many basic features missing Day 1: experience:-Most important : it will not redirect the link into the present app in mobile .... It will open link every times in default browser..Eg: if I got any Facebook /insta /Twitter link and I already have installed these app then it will not asking me to get open with app instead it will redirect to browser and again I need to login... So so poor technology1.processor looks slow while setup and configuration my account data restoration as compare to redmi note 7 (same price older version phone than this)2. Camera quality is very low both back and front ...capture blurred images..not focusing the face even after setup manually.3.  Not value for money.. I think I made mistake to choose oppo brand .. I compare all the feature with redmi.. redmi looks far better than this..4. No front flash light available to click in night5. Looks slow to handle multiple apps compare to redmi6. Please don't buy this phone..this is so poor technology phone..
5,I have been an user of nokia 6.1 as it started to face issues I have opted for this one. After using premium phones like Xperia and Nokia I feel the fabrication is not upto to the standards. Helios processing a little slow.Banking apps a little stretched due to the size of the screen. Rest all a good buy.
1,"I couldn't like it bcoz of its poor water resistence quality.I bought it on Dec.2020 but the working system of this disturbed on March 2021,within a period of 2-3 months.It is great loss .It mars  the Credibility of the Company also.I wanted to purchase one more but the damage has spoiled my mood n faith.I want compansation for the loss.It would be of great support n credibility of the company if it exchangeg the mobile OppoA31,Mystery or mend it properly without my loss.If the company do this favour,it would be a gentl step towatds customer care n service as well as the establishment of strong credibility n capabilitu of the Company."
1,"1. Phone don't have type C charging2. Dual app not possible for all app like redmi phones3. Charger is normal 5v 2 Amp so no fast charging.4. Not for multi tasking people.5. Camera and sound average6. Processor and touch very slow7. Only 6GB RAM AND 128 GB ROM is good  in this phone.8. Also it's not showing dual 4G9. Battery is only 1 day at normal uses.10. Display dpi is also very low.11. Can be treated as entry level phone.12. WhatsApp Camera function is abnormal, don't waste money on OPPO A31"
5,"Great product by redmi, but I request to redmi please don't make fake sale"
1,Never buy chip quality battery drain issues don't buy
4,"Previous owner of Redmi 7 2gb 32gbRedmi Note 10 4gb 64gb was blazing fastIf you aren't able to buy this wait till Xiaomi release the same in poco with 6gb ram for the same price, like they did with Redmi power with a downgrade in camera, They won't remove the 48mp camera, They may decrease or remove the remaining cameras in poco version of resmi note 10About Amazon sale I logged in to amazon.in in my pc and clicked on join wait list around 12:02, then opened the app and booked the phone I was in queue for almost 20 to 25 minutes, the next step was payment which was a pain in the head, no COD, Note: only upi ids with number@ are accepted, I added a card Note: Check if ecommerce payments is enabled for your cardIn the allocated 15 minutes the order was booked but payment failed, thankfully I was allowed to pay againAlso while I was waiting in queue I got an option to buy the phone 2 ways, lightning deal - 11998, Regular price - 11999 (in Amazon App), I think lightning deal is for those who want to claim offersFirst of all, i bought this phone for basic use online payments, govt apps like Twallet, Tration, Tappfolio, MyGHMC, Digilocker, Aadhaar, Hpgas, Bharatgas, Hmwssb and much more all of them mostly dual appsI am a pc user so I don't use my mobile for gaming or streamingPros:Display : The display is crisp and clear better than my Redmi 7 (not comparing LCD with Amoled)Touch: The touch response is good it's fast, I can type fast in this phone no lag thereMobile data: 4g Data connectivity is superb I can feel the difference between my redmi 7 and this, mostly the download speedFeel: In hand feel is also good, the weight is lessCamera: Best in the segment (obviously if you don't use the stock app)Price: considering how this is priced more than Redmi Note 9 (10999), I am not angry this too will cost the same after 6 months probably will be on exchange and discount by August independence day sale.Cons:Battery: Being amoled this shouldn't consume so much battery, hope Xiaomi fixes this with an updatePlastic back: glossy back (should have come with matte or rough panel for better grip) and little bit of vibration while playing the speakers especially on top near cameraStereo speakers: yep more like dual speakers than stereo (then again Xiaomi never claimed that they support Dolby (Oppo has them and they sound awesome)Verdict: I was waiting for this from almost a year, from the launch of Redmi note 8 and my analysis went way deep, I was looking at Samsung for amoled, Redmi power for stereo speakers and good battery, Poco varient of Redmi note 9 for the processor and decent in the box fast chargerThis covered almost all of them (not fully though)Finally this just serves my purpose, I still aim to buy a good PC, Nothing can beat a desktop ( I wish remix os and phoenix os were as competitive as Windows, remix went out of play long back."
5,"Finally, Xiaomi has decided to design for its Note series of mobiles. This mobile phone is definitely going to be and head Turner when you pull the mobile out of the pocket. It has an almost 1mm protruding camera module on the rear of the mobile. I have bought aqua-green color which has these light gradient shade. The colors are up to your personal preferences.The phone has a matte finish at the back so it is definitely not a fingerprint magnet. It also doesn't feel very heavy and is very easy to hold firmly.🎯DESIGN and DISPLAY:******************************This 6.43-inch display with the Full HD Plus resolution is really good along with a punch-hole selfie camera that offers a seamless user experience.The brightness can go up 1100 nits peak so it is definitely not a difficult thing to use it under sunlight. Xiaomi provided this model with the Widevine L1 DRM certification support for this mobile. So, playing HD videos on an ott platform won't be an issue.Z-axis haptic motor used in this mobile throws more realistic vibrations while playing games. I tried it extensively with a couple of games, the experience was really satisfying. Kudos to Xiaomi for throwing in all the sensors on this mobile especially for not giving up on the remote control sensor.This mobile comes with a lot of preloaded apps like Facebook, LinkedIn, MI remote, MI credit, MI Store, MI pay, share m, etc. Out of these, you can uninstall a couple of apps and you have to live with the remaining apps for the rest of the life.🎯PERFORMANCE:**********************The fingerprint sensor is very sensitive and highly responsive that even if you touch the sensor unintentionally you will end up unlocking the phone. It is that fast. Games like Asphalt 9 and Call of Duty worked excellently without any lag or freezing. This mobile would definitely outscore any mobile under this budget easily.It took 25 to 35 minutes to charge the mobile from 0 to 75% using the 33 Watts charger which came along with the mobile.🎯CAMERA:**************It comes with the 48-megapixel F/1.79 main camera with Sony Sensor and an 8mp ultrawide camera and the remaining two are the macro and the depth sensor.The main camera will let you shoot 4K 30fps video and 960fps 720 p video. When provided with good lighting conditions the main camera gives you a decent output and the Portrait mode also did a good job by blurring out the background gently.The low light images were average and it was decent enough for mobile phones with a budget of 15k.Coming to the selfie camera The Portrait mode worked excellently and the pictures were on a little warm tone than a natural skin tone. If you don't like the warm tone on your selfie pictures then you can fix it through editing apps from Play Store.🎯VERDICT:**************This mobile offers Rock-solid performance for everyday tasks along with very good battery life. This mobile phone comes with MIUI 12.5 so you don't have to worry about future updates for at least the next two years. With AMOLED display and the stereo speakers along with IP53 rating, this has to be the most competent mobile phone under 15000 and a good value for money.I have a YouTube channel: Gizmofeatures (You can also find the unboxing and impressions video there). When Comparing with Poco M3, Moto G10 Power, Samsung M12, you can pick Redmi note 10 any day. It is the best among these Four."
1,"This mobile i used only 3 days and mobile start sucking, and this mobile stuck 6 time in one day.. Most Worst mobile in my life 😣"
1,HERE I HAVE UPLOADED THE VIDEO ABOUT THE ISSUE WITH MY NEW MOBILE.FROM THE FIRST DAY TOUCH SCREEN NOT WORKING PROPERLY
4,It has good specifications.... Cut 1star bcoz of bad tactics by redmi.... They told base variant will start with 12k but didn't launched it.... Then I have to buy 14k variant.
4,Satisfied with this product. Best phone under 14000.Camera quality is also good. Battery performance is superb coz of 33w charger 🔋🔌. Finally it is a good phone as per my opinion.
3,I am not impressed with this phone. Samsung phones have better amoled display. Sound quality not good and not loud too. This phone hangs a lot. Camera quality very bad. I have owned previous phones of mi and they are much better than this. Pls go for note 9 pro in the same budget or realme.
5,Best phoneEver
4,Everything is good in the phone..I use redmi note 10 for 1 day...And review itI found i issue with this phone that is fingerprint sensor does not work properly it slwo or some time Tap fingerprint sensor for 2-3 time for useAbout a camera very good...Front camera is also good..I will edit review after 10 day of use...In shot very GOOD PHONE
1,Phone display has been breaken. It is mentioned as gorilla glass. It has fall down from just 6 feet. Y it is broken?. I will go to consumers courst. Please guide me
1,Redmi note 10 software is very bad xiaomi please fix software problem's Improve the camera & build quality is not good & battery drain very fast.  I AM BIG FAN OF XIAOMI MY FAVORITE COMPANY
5,I pay 100rs extra for one-day delivery it took less than 20 hours.. And after 7 days of using I would say this the best budget smartphone to this day.. There is another variant that comes in 12k you can wait for that or simply buy this at 14000 it comes with a back cover and a screen protector battery backup is awesome but a slight heating issue I'm am getting...
5,"Good picture quality. The 48 Mp camera works fine and so does the selfie camera in potrait mode. Sometimes the pictures are sharper than required. The charging is fast. Got full charge in 2.5 hours of fast charge. Overall build quality is good, not too heavy as compared to previous models. The plastic phone case provided prevents from ususal bumps and falls. The sound quality is decent and so is the video quality in full HD. Gaming performance is decent too, got to play need for speed in medium setting without crashing the app. Really happy with the purchase."
1,"Mobile is lagging. while I scrolling screen is not moving, I noticed it several times,it is very slow while playing games. product is not up to the mark in this price segment"
1,Battery is very bad ...battery is draining when even phone is on sleep mode .
1,check wether both the speakers are working or noi got the manufacturing defet in a piece wich they have senteven the headphone jack also not upto the mark wich give you sound only in one ear bud
5,"We loved it always, coz it's a no 1 brand.Exellent camera."
1,Toatl vest of money. The mobile having touch issue. Half Touch is not working. I suggest you all please do not buy Redmi Note 10 series. Please please please
1,"Very disappointed with the redmi product.Touch sensation problem. Sometimes some parts of the screen doesn't work on touch. I tried my best to get this latest product, but never expected such waste of money."
1,"The sd678 processor with 6GB of ram fails to keep up with everyday stuff like composing mails and browsing. Screen freezes at times, and touch response is far from adequate (and no, it is not because of the the protective film).Camera is average for this price range.The only good thing about this phone is its amoled display.It comes with the usual miui bloatware, but can uninstall/disable some.I understand these phones are not meant to last, nor do I expect flagship level performance for 14k; but this phone fails to perform even basic tasks where sub 10k phones ace.The finger print sensor is well placed amd fast, but often fails to work.There's no way to turn off fast charging, so expect your battery to give up soon."
4,Display is very good  10/10Camera is good for the price 8/10Battery is very good 10/10Lightweight and very slimPerformance is decent not the best 7/10MIUI is very laggyBack panel quality is not goodDual stereo speakers not the loudest but ok
1,Don't purchase this phone battery problem and phone is running is slow
1,After 5 days used . Nice design but performance is not up to mark and lagging . App crashes . Lot of adds which is irritating. Best buy Oppo or Realme.
2,i have used this smartphone for couple of days and what i came across cons and pros will share1. display : best in this price range no doubt about that crisp colors little saturated as its amoled panel for viewing is a pleasure of eyes2. Speakers : i didn't liked it yes u heard it right its not good the highs as high vocals are not clear its like its been suppress the quality is not like stereo speakers type its same like single speaker its like u can heard the music but not the vocals the base is killed3 Battery : Not seems to be 5000 mah coz of 11nm chip its drains like hell even surfing would suck the battery juice like hell and phone heats up a lot yes it charge as fast as advertised apart from that nothing is good might be an update would resolve this issue have to wait and watch4. Camera : its good in the price range 48 mp does it job ultra wide macro depth are satisfactory not good not bad does there job colours are not accurate but it does happen low light pictures are ok not as advertised. camera gives good result in good light or in moderate like in room bit not good in low light or at nightselfie camera is good takes good shots edges in portrait are quiet well managed same in low light not good enough5. Built quality nice all plastic very light and easy to hold and operate with one hand if u have big hands but very light coz of all plastic body gorilla glass 3 is used but will never be tested as we always use guard so nothing to talk about itin short its up to you you want it or pass on
1,"after 6 days use  :1. 2 sim+sd card, good2. width just 74mm, then its thin and comfortable in hand, good3. battery is good4. camera is ok (in this range price) but selfie isn't bad5. finger is side and fast6. face unlock is fast7. it's not bulky like m12 Samsung8. speaker is good9. Display is good, but i don't know why main some time is not good10. charging is fast11. it's not heavy weight, it's just 180 gr but m12 is more than 200grat the endi can't say it's good handset, why?Many times hanging, every day I have to restart it at least 5 timesToday I bought realme 8,its super handset, I can't compare both are, just go for realme 8"
5,Iam not big fan of #MI before this phone. Front camera was really nice having wide angle photography as well as from back camera. Battery was best overall this is nice phone for gaming also
2,"Not a good phone i donot know why it is hypedI should have purchased moto g30 ir waited for HuwaeiProblems:1.camera is not good2. Volume automatically decrease and increase3. App not opening have to clear cache each time4. no note pad while calling5.baterry is not good yesterday level of battery of 51 % today when i woke i found my phone switch off6.fingerprint scan is not good compared to Honor7.heating problem in general use8.screen timeout when you are watching anything or reading anythingLook wise it is good,  connectivity is good"

1,Wrost Phone Not waste of your moneyPlease Don't Buy This Product....... Very Bad Not Good this a Stupid Phone
1,Phone suddenly started working weird. Keyboard not working properly..Spacebar not working...Weird spellings..unable to get the call history...very very disappointed with the product quality.
1,"I am facing touch problems. To type this review I struggled lot. Games worst , some times very difficult to answer phone calls"
1,Aftwrv2 days of uses review is that Even though camera is good but when you make Video call either through Whatsapp or Duo your video image looks  that you are using some VGA camera. don't whybthwre is a difference in selfie video and video through whatsapp which uses same camera properties.Better to go with  Samsung
1,It will make you feel blind as this phone blurs fonts and apps while we scroll it... didn't like it..I made a replacement also but still the problem is same in that new one too
1,"There is some serious issue with this recently launched phone. Replaced product again shows the same touch screen problem, have to touch multiple times. How can the same issue is coming in the second phone too, unless their is some bug. Please do not buy this phone. A BIG NO NO NO TO THIS PRODUCT."
2,"1.Camera have lot of issue, front camera become completely blur during video call on low light.2. Primary camer sensor works poor on video recoding it takes time to focus on item3. Here and there we can see setting menus are lagging- example in app battery saver setting screen starts jerking when we scroll on menu.4. Some apps functionaliy are not responding  after installation. Example zomato place order option. Restarting app doesn't helped. After restarting mobile it worked.I got this by yesterday evening now 1 day completed in minimal usage i faced these many issues worst experience with redmi ,😞😞😞Iam not sure this occur in all redmi 10 mobile or only mine need to speak with customer care and replace. There no return option."

When automatic call recording is enabled the voice is breaking intermittantly. so i disabled that feature. may be i can test it again and update the comments whether its because of memory card capacity/free space or some other issue."

5,"Best phone ,"
5,"I purchased this phone for my grandmother. I feel it is too expensive in this price range.The sound quality is top notch. The torch is mind-blowingly bright.The UI is easy to understand but the font feels awful. Viewing angles are bad. (0/10 for that) can't expect that in ₹1.5k price.The camera is awful at 0.2 mp. All the pictures taken are grainy.The accessibility feature where the dialled numbers are spoken back is a good addition for the erderly or someone who is visually impaired.The features listed on the box works perfectly for now.Sadly, the processor inside the phone is of 'chinese' origin. It seems like micromax still hasn't learned from it's previous mistakes."
5,Amazing product at this cheap price...If you want to buy a new secondary phone..Go for it.
1,Please Do Not Buy This Chinese Product. China Made Mobiles Sell By Micromax. Mobile Quality is very Bad.Main issue with speaker. Sound Quality is very bad and waste.Please Add 200 or 300 rupee in your budget and buy samsung or Nokia Keypad Phones.
4,I like its large bright screen and compact size. Good for senior citizen. The only thing i did not like was its ring tone collecton which has only one in built ringtone which sounds like cheap chinese quality and requires sd card to add more ringtones which is inconvinient for senior citizens. Hope the company adds more inbuilt ringtones.
1,"I am very fed-up with this product it's hanging when touch the camera so many  times I tried but it's continuesly hanging, I bought for my parents but it's no use I want to return this product but it's not taking please reply what to do  now"

1,"My review after three months use:I am reducing it to one stars after three months use. Initially I gave five star. Reasons of giving one star is:1) the phone is over priced and it's actual price should be not more than 13-14K.2) occassionally it's back panel heats up.3) design is poor, especially at the back camera panel space above the flashlight is unutilized and don't look premium. Much cheaper mobile phones have better design.3) the whole body including screen, back panel and camera panel is very sensitive to scratches. You have to cover with phone case and screen guard immediately otherwise your phone will give a dirty look full if scrates after one week use.3) no IP rating. Forget water proofing, not a trace of water resistance. You have to prevent it from humidity and sweating.4) screen refresh rate is poor in comparison to other phones available below 10K range.Following was my review after almost one week use. __________________________________At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory. Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced."
1,"Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000. I have  doubt  its not 7000 man battery its like 2000 or 2500mah. Heating  issue also faced during  charging."
1,"Genuine Feedback to samsung and all buyersNot Upto the Mark..Battery is good, but mobile is very heavy.. not handy for one hand operation.. if you use it continuously then you feel pain in your  hand, designed is out dated, poor quality material.. camera is just okay..I am not happy overall performance of this phone at this price band...Mobile should be perfect for 15-16k price band..Lookwise not goodDisplay qaulity is just good not bestSound quality is goodCamera not much good that I am expecting.Big screen which perfect for movie watcher.. but after 30 minutes you feel pain in your hands.I bought Electric blue colour, it's look like samsung old samrt phone .My request to Amazon, is it possible to return this mobile. Then help me for return...I am not happy with overall performance of the phone..."
5,"Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage"
1,"There's something wrong with the new Samsung M51 mobile. Many other users are also facing the same issue. We are unable to connect through Wi-Fi on Samsung M51.Meanest Monster Ever ... HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi.Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says ""Incorrect Password"".I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1. Forget the connection and reconnect again.2. Update the phone s/w to latest version.3. Reset Settings4. Reset Network Settings5. Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened. Instead a replacement of this phone should be there, I have not even used it for more than an hour.Last year I ordered an MI phone from Flipkart, the battery was getting drained very fast. Within the next day, the phone was replaced without questions asked.Dissappointed by Amazon, the way they are handling this issue.Don't spend your hard-earned money on this phone. Unfortunately, if your phone turns-out to be faulty, then there is a never ending process to take care of issue."
1,"Usually I don't write the reviews, but this time I couldn't resist myself from doing so.First of all, I am a Samsung hater, but my wife didn't want a chinese brand phone, so I had no option than to go with Samsung. Therefore, this review may look like bias, but believe me, it's not.Doesn't look like a 27K phone. Screen looks so dull compared to my 3 years old one plus 5t phone. UI is boring. Stock android would have been appreciated. 3 finger screenshot feature is not available (though there are other ways, this one is easiest). Out of 8Gb 3.2Gb RAM was showing as used out of the box. Out of 128Gb , 32Gb was showing as used. Neither of the camera was impressive. There are some default apps (bloatware) which are absolutely useless. They didn't even provide the silicon transparent cover with the phone. The only good thing about this phone is - it is very bulky (this is not the sarcasm, I really like bulky phones)Anyway, I won't be using this phone, but feeling very bad that I spent this much of money for such a cheap phone 😥"
1,"Call quality is poor. When loud speaker is on, Cannot hear properly on the other side, call is muffled or breaking. Do someone else face this similar issue ? Is there any way to fix. I could not raise a ticket to contact either Amazon or samsung. Camera quality is also average.  Hated it.Updated review after 20 daysStarted facing charging issuesStopped charging suddenly, don't know what to doNo more replacement from AmazonNice lesson learnt:1. Don't fall into the trap of extensive hype of a product2. Don't believe youtubers reviews just before experiencing atleast 30 days of usage.3. Don't buy a product on its first day of launch4. Read the return and replacement policy thoroughly before buying."
2,"I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6. Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7. When Sealed Package open then phone display contain so much dust. Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8. Gorila Glass 3 protection under 25k i.e out dated glass protection after using 2 days with full care i got one scratch mark on display.9. NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10. Audio output in my boat rockers bluetooth headset with this phone is not as much as lound as compare to my previous phone Redmi Note 7 pro.11. Without using phone it take 2 hour to charge but when you use it frequently then it take 2.30-3 hour to charged it full from 0-100%.12. Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13. No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good. When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4. Till now Ram management is goodTo much hype created every where for this phone and due to this many user like me has purchased this phone but this phone under 25k is really not value for money. I am going to resale this phone. There are so many phone below 25k with best facilities as compare to this Samsung m51.Conclusion : Phone is overpriced and performance is average"
1,"1.On playing games, sound is too too less.2.Flash light too dull3. 7000Mah battery, all fake battery only last one day or one and a half day max4. There is no Broadband speed  indicator5.live wallpaper option not goodBetter avoid this phone, dont fall for advertisements"
5,"This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8. If you need all trending features to be covered in non Chinese mobile,THEN GO FOR IT... ALSO TRY TO UPDATE TO LATEST SOFTWARE ONCE AFTER SETTING UP YOUR MOBILE, OTHERWISE HEATING ISSUE WILL BE THERE."
5,"After using for more than 2 day's I must say, snapdragon 730g works wonderful .CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mega Pixcel and more feature in selfie camera.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also."
5,"My take after using the handset for 4 days:1. Display: Superb. Big, crystal clear, bright and everything you can expect from a samsung super amoled plus screen.2. Camera: Very good. Night mode could have been better.3. Sound: Speakers: Better than average, earphones: good4. Battery: Very good. But expected more backup from a 7000 mah battery. Had to charge it once a day for the last 4 days.5. UI: The one-ui provided here is different from the one provided in A series. The one that comes with A series phones like A50 etc is more user friendly and has more features like Secure folder, timer etc. Also, the Samsung notes app in A series is far better than the one provided here. In this price, an UI at par with the leading A series phones is expected.6. Processor: Good for normal use.7. Finger print unlock is fast and smooth.8. No case/ back cover and no earphone.9. A bit overpriced."
2,"It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos. When photo is clicked with lens covered completely,  it shows hundreds of white spots in image, same happens with pro mode too. (This is not regular image noise)"
1,"I have been using this from starting. Ordered on 18th sep and get this phone very next day 19th. Here is my overall review.1. Battery - tremendous and optimization is on next level2. Display - It's great display ever.3. Speed - faster then ever ( compared to my other phones )4. Gaming - Very powerful no laging ( played COD, Hitman Sniper, Asphalt 9)But wait, in the meantime I've faced some issues on the phone as well.1. Voice call - call is fine but when call is placed on speaker children voice could not be heard by other. On normal call it's perfect but on speaker it's not. Adult voice can be heard from a distance but children voice can't. even the phone is just near the face. This issue can lead you the problem while you're on whatsapp video call as well. First I thought it was just whatsapp issue but after certain test it's major issue on voice call. Tested with safe mode and also after factory reset (without any other third party applications)2. Fingerprint sensor - It's fine and fast. But wait. you need to setup both hands fingers so it's easy to use. Maybe if the finger print sensor placed on in-display then it's better than this but if you map with both hand fingers and thumb then it's easy. Other wise you've to wait for 30 seconds if the finger not matched for 5 times.3. Galaxy Apps - Disable it otherwise unnecessary apps and bloatware will be install automatically.4. Knox - It's displaying secured by Knox but secure folder is not there. Which should be.I have replaced the product but still the microphone issue is there so plz be carefull with this."
3,"1. NO secure folder option, This phone SUCKS.2.Processor is old same as A80 (launched in April 19)2. Display is Good3. Back Panel (it's plastic wanna be glass;) , watch it on the first and last time at unboxing cause it won't be same anymore)4. Not Camera monster it's a camera average, they show 64 MP its 64 MP, which takes 3-6 seconds for one snap. Till then moment is already gone.5. Battery works only for a day.For 27K it doesn't worth it.Don't buy it, seriously."
4,"Initial experiences:- Adaptive brightness/ Ambient Display: Frequent screen flickering and unstable; had to disable.- Fingerprint Scanner: Poor quality, frequently asks you to wipe..- No preapplied screen film or back-case supplied.+ Nice AMOLED panel and crisp viewing experience.+ Not bulky or uneasy to hold contrary to common perception.+ Biiig battery which lasts looong.+ Good reception and call quality.+ Not Chinese+ Better than Oneplus Nord (don't look at 5G, let our 4Gs work efficiently as of now!)+ Top notch performance."
5,"First impressions: the celestial black colour looks really good and elegant. Looks better than in pics or videos. The phone feels solid in hand. The screen is large and great quality punchy colors. The screen is also very bright.Performance too seems good except that the real performance will be known a while later as Samsung mobile tend to slow down with time. The back is a fingerprint magnet, so a case is a must.The battery is really a beast and charger is decent too. Battery easily lasts 2 days with average use, even with heavy use it lasts one and a half days.Camera Performance is great at this price. The pictures and videos come out great.I got the 6gb variant with hdfc offer and with HDFC smart buy, the price should come down to 22000. Its a great phone at this price. Most of the cons mentioned in online reviews are not for me. I am happy with this phone.Why I preferred M51 over Nord? M51 ticks all the right boxes for me. A great screen for watching videos, good casual gaming, a great battery lasting at least 2 days, a better camera, 128 gb storage with microsd card support  and at a price which is Rs. 3000  cheaper. I already have Samsung and Oneplus phones at home. So I can say with confidence that you won't go wrong with any of the brand.My overall first impression is that its a great phone with almost all things that one may need at this price. Will keep updating."
3,"Camera - GoodFast charge - GoodDisplay - AwesomePerformance - GreatBattery Backup - It's Not Like 7000mah, Average ( Like 4000mah ) Need Optimization2-3 times Play Store Getting Crashed....Otherwise Good to Buy.......Amazon very good Delivery.......NoEarphone And Softcase"
1,"I have ordered this mobile on the first day of the sale at 12 o clock sharp. Yes there are some good features, But let's talk only about the CONS. The reason for talking about the CONS as the PROS are talked by other friends.  1) Vibration of the mobile is more and can't hold the mobile for longer time.  2) Mobile is higher priced compared to other same configuration devices and no tempered glass or case has been provided.  3) Guys Please check the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR Value) before buy any mobile and in this its more which affects Head and Body and not good for health.  4) Weight of the mobile is MORE and finally I won't recommend this."
1,I received the phone on the very next day of the sale.Unfortunately I am facing issue with loudspeaker and mic. So the primary thing of a phone (calling) is not working properly.Even after replacement facing the same issue.
4,"Charging and display quality is good..No hangsHeating is not obsereved during charging or using mobile.Diasble galaxy store otherwise bloatware is installed continuously.I didn't find mobile is heavy , weight management is excellent. Otherwise it's as usual normal android.. phone.. camera I didn't like much both front and back useless. I purchased this phone esp for display and battery. For small hands mobile is bit tall not width wise..Macro photo lots of granules seeing.. I think in my phone macro lens is defective.. speaker output is not good. 3.2 gb ram used out of 8 gb by default .."
5,Great phone with good battery life the battery usually lasts for 2 days on light usage and charges super quick
5,"Pros:1. Value for money buy at 23k considering the offers.Try to get it at this price range by bank offers being offered.2. Camera is brilliant.Compared to OnePlus Nord and others in this price range.3. Snapdragon 730G optimized very well.Processor is snappy.Compared to other brands (realme 7 pro, one plus nord), it gives faster perfomance as it has been properly optimized.4. Battery is the top selling point for this phone.I have to take office calls for 5/6 hours a day, including webex meetings with wifi always on.It still last me 1.5 days.5. Display is excellent even though it is providing 60 hz refresh rate.Amoled display of samsung is brilliant as always.Cons:1. Back is plastic. Does feeling like a 25k phone.But as 7000mah battery had to be adjusted in a compact way, samsung had to compromise  with the design.2. 4k/1080p videos can't  record in 60fps.Doesn't  bother me much, it depends on your preference."
1,"Samsung delivered defective piece and had to gone through replacement cycle. Believe me, on Amazon getting replacement is not easy.  It was a manufacturing defect.Do see your phone thoroughly, as soon as you receive to check for defect.*** Amazon has no return policy on electronic items, even if product is damaged. They dont care. ***Finally after getting product :Camera, User Interface : GoodHeavy (because of mega battery). Its a big phone, so personally I am not finding it handy.Battery life : still need to find."
5,"This is the best phone in 25000 segment  730G processor with 7000 mah battery with 25w fast chargingThe display quality is amazing as it is S amoled panelThe 64 mp camera captures amazing details it also has night mode and slowmo, hyperlapse, one take, macro camera is not good tho . It tried fortnite it can run on medium graphics with 30fps limit and its pretty smooth thanks to 730G . The front facing camera quality is very good  i have attached pic of  ram usuage with no background app running one thing i didnt like was u cannot zoom in when u set to 64mp camera mode and it is filled with unnecessary apps like daily hunt and many others"
3,"Well, as compared to the same feature range phones. The price seems to be 2-3k high. But if you are bored of charging your phone every 6 hours, you have a relief here with 7000 mAh battery, which doesn't  disappoint you.  I choose primarily for the battery and it lived up to the point that it stated. With playing 1 hour of playing COD, using hotspot for a full day and browsing it lasted for more then 40 hours and there is a battery saver mode too, which will last for a week if you are travelling out and need to use phone for only call and minimum usage.But, if you are a non-stop gamer it will last a day depending on the usage.Pros:Display is good, performance is fine, battery is stand out. The camera is also good and bixby vision is cool. Many edited features come with the camera, that is added advantage. Sensors are good and fast too. The weight is well balanced, you won't feel the weight after a day's usage. Charging is quite quick. Rest of phone's features are fine.Cons:Plastic built body, no tempered glass or case is provided within the box. The speakers are located at the bottom which is uncomfortable if we hold the phone in two hands and watch videos or play games. In dark, the screen display may cause some burden to the eyes, which I did not face earlier. The background apps keeps running until you close them or optimize the battery which will automatically close all the background running appVerdict:Little high-priced, very good battery and a satisfactory performance."
3,"Awesome phone..all good reviews..1.definitely heavy, what else u can expect with huge 7000 battery, yet manageable.. u cant hold and watch movies or matches for long u need a stand..have to use Bluetooth or wired headset while talking as its heavy, u feel it slips off2. Stunning display amoled at its best..watched Enola holmes3. need back cover else scratches will be evident glaringly and lose its premium feelMost important worrying fact is SAR value at 1.3, the only fact I am disappointed with samsung..u can check dailling *#07#..ps samsung are valued for low sarAudio loud speaker I am not satisfied"
1,"Ibought it for 24,999 but now it's 19,499. Cheap phone but samsung looted me. Be aware of foreign countries. Either is Chinese or any other."
1,"I have been using Samsung Phones ever since they ventured into Smart Phones. I had privilege of using majority of Samsung Phones like Galaxy S2, Samsung Grand, Samsung S6, Samsung S9+, Samsung Note 3 and Samsung S10.When Samsung launched M51, like many I think I am also fooled by aggressive marketing campaign and youtube reviews by youtubers like Technical Guruji (I unsubscribed his channel due to fraud review)Why I purchased this phone because ofBrand SamsungExpected Good Camera SetupExpected Good Build QualityExpected Good PackagingAnd for this I have paid good price of INR 25KWhy I am disappointedBuild quality is quite inferior it's cheap plastic that use to come in phones like Karbon or Lava in 2012-2013.Camera setup is quite average, they say it's triple camera but picture quality is not so great, night shots are average, I think if you buy brands like Xiaomi you get better pictures by spending less amount. Probably that's why Samsung is marketing Single Take feature, which I think won't work if camera is average.Packaging, after paying INR 25K one expects box to include stuff like Phone Cover as these days majority of manufacturers, but here it comes with cheap quality of Box, that has nothing but a cheap charger with very poor quality of packaging, now a days many manufacturers are also putting the screen protectors at cheap cost, Samsung should take a note.Phone weighs quite heavy and is not easy to use with one hand, this is something nobody is telling, probably thats the only reason Samsung has degraded the build quality.What is good about this phoneBattery - Certainly that's the only feature for which I paid INR 25K. But are you willing to pay this much for a phone that's more of power bank.Headphone Jack - Samsung has retained it, and it's output is pretty good.Apart from that phone has same processor like Samsung A80, which comes with better camera setup and better build quality.Therefore I feel Samsung is over charging customers for this device and it should not cost more then INR 15K - 18K.So if you are only looking for battery and headphone jack then spend money on this one and If anyone wants to contact me I am ready to resell mine at 20%  discount.I wish they had option of giving zero stars.Amazon I am sorry this is my worst ever Amazon shopping experience which I regret everyday when I see what I got."
5,"EDIT : I have added 7 days battery usage video, please use that as new reference for battery usage.Original :Before you read the review, please know that I mainly use my phone for productivity and social media. I do not game heavily or photograph heavily.To me the best part about it is the display. I've never used an OLED display and moving from standard LCD to OLED is magical. The system wide dark mode support makes everything look sexy black!The battery is super powerful, although I've to use it for more days to give a better review. From what I experienced, you can easily get 12-15 hours of screentime at least, spanning over 2 days. The charging is as advertised, taking around 2 hours for a full charge.I'm not a camera enthusiast beyond some selfies and occasional landscape photography when I travel. The camera provided satisfied my expectations. Please look at same photographs attached, bearing in mind that light conditions were not optimal and I'm not an expert at the art. Also, it has Cam2 API support, so you can install a Google Camera mod and tweak the settings to your liking.This phone is worth it for the display and battery for me. It has everything I expected. Only disappointment is that it doesn't come with a cover or screenguard, while other manufacturers provide that even at this range."
3,"After 48 hours of usageVery much excited when I saw the specs. but!!!!Pros:1. Display2. Procesor  SD730G3. Camera4. Fast chargingCons:1. audio not loud getting crack sound in speaker mode2. Battery (it's 7000Mah) but discharging quickly(I didn't play games, I used it only calls, and YouTube). I felt like its a 4000Mah.3. Backside material looks very cheap. attracts lots of fingerprints4. Price is very high.5. Back case is not provided. (Phone is slippery need to handle with care or buy back case).After all, I feel this phone average for this price. (*** stars)if the price is 19999/- with this specs my price is (***** stars)"
1,Phone heats up while using camera for few minutes.Writing this just in one day of usageOther feedbacks in few daysHeating a lot.. worst ever experience  with Amazon
1,"I bought Samsung M51 on launch day itself! Within 2 days of usage, screen started flickering. Even Samsung customer care said that it's faulty screen"
1,"This mobile phone have many problems such as WiFi  issues  , Bluetooth issues,  saving pdf issues , sometimes light sensors not works , app is not working  ( showing many times) .This OS is CORE version  not as A series galaxy smartphones.I think in m51 is a experimental device by Samsung  .Samsung  inserted many apps from A series  maybe  this creates  problems  , because  its OS is core .Before purchasing M51 keep this things in mind  .I recognized after 17 days of using this .I mean to say , it creates problems after 17 days of using  .And now I am unable to return this mobile M51 .Service center told me this , its a OS problem  , after few days all m51 smartphone will get Software updates  .  Or to submit M51 to Service center  to get value of this smartphone  as a coupon,  which I will redeem coupon in exclusive Samsung showrooms  ."
5,GOOD OVERALL PHONEBATTERY IS HUGE USING PHONE FROM 7 AM ( 100% ) BATTERYPLAYED GAME FOR 50 MINUTEINSTAGRAM FOR 40 MINUTEMANY CALLS TOODID MAILING & TEXTING ALSO IN WHATSAPPWEBWHATSAPP IS ON FROM 9 AMWORKING FINE TILL NOWCAMERA IS WONDERFUL & WILL TRY ASPHALT 9 & THAN EDIT THIS REVIEWAT 5.20 PM ITS 76% BATTERYNow after use of many daysPhone works the same just one problem some time phone get disconnected automatically i don't  know if it is problem of phone or something else overallMust buy product for sure
5,Straight to the point :Purchased in first saleReceived : 20sep2020- Really heavy can start wrist pain if not used properly (but including 7000mah in this weight is surprisingly excellent. Kudos to samsung)- Headphone jack is a boon ...although I use TWS but a headphone jack is a must.- Battery can be stretched more than 1.5 days with normal usage. But initially need to disable every background app to get optimized battery life.- Glastic back panel is shiny but will not give premium feel.- Fingerprint is decent but getting used to side mount will take time.- Not for osmo mobile 3 (which I have tested and also try to upload video) uncomfortable to load and unload.- Excellent camera and video esp macro- Selfie cam is also good- Requires some adaptor to charge old phones. Mi cable is good converter & charging cable for usb mini- Speaker is average- Bloatware is there but can be disabled ...- 6gm ram and snapdragon processor does the job efficiently.- No hapticsA nice decent phone from Samsung.Pro Tip : Never buy a phone on the basis of whats new always buy on the basis of what you need. You can if you've extra bucks ;)Unboxing will be soon available on YouTube : IemMihir.Don't know but my initial review was deleted and I had to write this again.
1,"As mentioned by Samsung 7000 mh battery but battery drains very fast at the end of day when I am using internet,watching videos. Battery needs to carry for two days at 7000mh but it is not carry one day also. Please do not buy this product. Display is also very bad super amoliad  Display is fake some times video shows red faces. It is not zero edge after full Display video get cutted from the edges of phone display. Speaker sound is third class not upto the mark what we expect from Samsung. Handset provided doubly atmos but when I use headphones also can't find atmos experience. Very bad handset on this range better you can buy Samsung m31s for that.I provide 1 out of 10 ratings for this set. Its a garbage set."
5,"I purchased it on 18 September on 12:01 pm with no delay as I wanted to buy this amazing phone by Samsung. Surprisingly  it was delivered on the same day within 6 hrs. Now I have used it for almost a week and can give my overview about the phone. I will provide you the main pros and cons of Samsung M51PROS:#SuperAmoledPLUSdisplay believe me it is one of the best display I have ever seen on mobiles. You will love the premium quality while watching video and seeing photographs infact reading on this mobile feels great.#Camera: Amazing camera quality it gives natural colors, dynamic contrast ratio is better than the phones come between the price range of 30 to 40 thousand. Daylight images are just magical. 64mp camera is just awesome. 12mp macro lense gives you amazing details. Wide angle for selfish lovers where you will get most of the function get works automatically. One take picture is just amazing too. I can say you will not get such camera performance  in other phones even if you choose any phone having price beyond 40000.#Battery: Believe me if you are a normal user your battery will not get ended before the third day. If you are moderate users of phone it will give you atleast 2 days of battery backup. And if you are a hard-core mobile user you will not able to drain this battery in one single day.#UserfriendlyOneUI: what a lovely UI, very smooth , no confusing icons, better placement of folders in my files. Categorization of items by samsung is awesome anyone can use this with no difficulty. Your pics, videos, recordings, documents  everything will be kept in right place and believe me it will make you so happy as you don't have to find anything here and there.#Snapdragon730G: what a great thing to have both thing in your phone one the brand Samsung and another the processor snapdragon. Yes this processor  made M51 a great choice. Snapdragon helps to improve your gaming performance plus it also helps in smooth functioning  of different apps. No lag while viewing videos, playing games and making calls.CONSLook these are my point of views may be the cons don't have any value for most of the users.#Size: The size of phone is 6.7inch which can be a bit big for many users especially having small hands. Besides, bike riders who use to go offices daily may find this phone challenging while keeping inside the jeans pocket.#Body: the body of phone is glastik and it is so scratchable that means you have to buy the backcover as soon as possible. Using backcover and tempered  glass is advisable. This is not a big cons as now a days we all use back cover in all phones so don't take it as negative one.Hope you will like the review and it will help you give you idea of purchasing the phone."
1,Battery Backup not seems to be 7000mAh.Whatsapp video call getting disconnected mentioning some error in microphone.Phone started hanging on normal usages..
5,"Got the phone the next day within 24hrs of buying,best delivery by Amazon. Got discount on sbi credit card and extra 500 also- total price 7700Best phone with Snapdragon 450 on this price(Disclaimer-It doesn't has a finger print senser but i don't mind it as for day to day function it has face recognition and it's working fine )"
3,Battery is very good but the following problems arise in the very 1st day when the handset was delivered to me.Problems:1. When I got the phone I found light is coming out from the lower part of the display (this is known as bleeding screen problem).2. Due to this sometimes double tap and touch is not correctly responding.
5,Value for money..Nice look..Decent designGood in 10k range
4,Good budget phone.
4,"Not much to say other than it is a typical Samsung Galaxy model at this price range. For power users like myself, this is not the phone. But for casual purposes, it is ok. Touching seems a bit laggish, little more fluid response was expected from a phone running 3 GB RAM under the hood. Camera is average, some pictures look sharper, others look dull. Speakers are moderately sounding, not much crispier, but can go loud.Just one thing to say, if you like your phone clean, then don't buy (get a Android One) because this one comes with loads of bloatware (and I mean, loads). There are some apps you can remove, but most ones you can't remove, and they take up space real good. After buying and doing a 30 MB system update, my storage says 13gb already used out of 32 ! So, how can you save your HD videos and pictures? I have no idea. Display is good at this price. Lastly, phone is OK for casual browse, stream, music, done."
1,"Waste of money!! Very bad Quality of camera focus and image processing. It's not Max up Phone,  it's like ordinary Chinese 3rd grade product. People should stay away thinking it's a Samsung phone. The voice quality and reception is also poor very low volume of speakers as well. Its with LCD display poor quality of image, though brand claims  HD, infinity O display all are marketing gimmicks. Phone lags on even with 4GB ram, hangs on quite a lot of time. Overall,  not worth  for 10K range,  choose better phones."
1,Highly disappointed product from Samsung. No finger print security. Worst camera. Poor performance on touch screen. Only satisfaction is the 6.5 inch display.. Got cheated by trusting the brand name. I recommend not to buy this mobile instead go with other options in redmi or poco.
2,Phone is overall good for budget but you have to not accept anything from camera even basic phone have better camera than this phone. Also it's OK to old processor but screen is 720p TFT LCD SCREEN picture doesn't show sharp sometimes you have to wait sec to respond from screen. It's one UI is good but I am not fan of that. It has come with 7.5 wt slow charger it takes lots of time to full charge.I give him 🌟 🌟 star because its competitors have  better processor camera screen and camera.If you are fan of Samsung go for it otherwise don't.
1,"Very poor mobile,  camera  is of old school and need a steady had and steady image subject to get it capture clear. not at all good and phone have very low sound from speakers.  Also seceen is a bit dull compared to other brands similar products.If your aim is to call and message and need a samsung mobile then only buy this, otherwise waste of money😭"
2,"Very much average phone for this price, front camera is pathetic, you will only pixels on the screen in selfies as well as during video calls. Main camera is pretty average. I believe it may be the issue with the model that received so I have asked for replacement, technician visit is scheduled for tomorrow. Will update more after that.Update: As expected, technician mentioned its the branded phone (non chinese), at this price this the best you could get, though it may not be that good and below average)..So finally, If you are looking for better front facing camera, I think go with others models based on the reviews."
1,"Worst camera ever - For the back camera, it is said 13MP+2MP+2MP Triple rear camera setup, for this we would have expect atleast some normal level clarity. Look at the images the first images in the set is which I took on my Redmi 4 camera which I bought 4 years back and look at the clarity. And the second one is from this 13MP triple camera setup Samsung phone which is way beyond worst.Having shocked on the rear camera, I checked the front camera which is more horrible than this back camera. The photos are blurry and shaky as you can see in the images.NEVER imagined something like this cheap and poor quality from a brand like SAMSUNG. Immediately requested for Return.PLEASE dont buy this phone if you consider a good Camera on the phone."
1,"Anyone viewing this review. Plesse never think to buy this.Not worth for even 5000 rs.""Worst front and rear camera"" I have ever seen in a smartphone.Everything very cheap.Diplay quality worst.Charger worst.Wire length too short.Takes more than 5 hrs to full charge from 0 to 100.Camera is like old keypad phones VGA cameraSo many bloatware appsI don't know how Samsung can make such poor quality phones.Totally waste of many for a middle range smartphone buyer."
4,After using for two days here below is my feedback:Pros:1- Very good full HD display at this price2- No issue till now with the performance of the processor. Daily routine apps run perfectly.3) Huge battery nad super backup. You won't believe I have charged it once since I received.Cons:1- The phone is not compatible with 5Gz Wifi. This is surprising for me as it was expected to be included.2- 100% Charging will take more than 3.5 hours with the in the box charger which is 7W.3- The back cover had very chep built quality (Will have to hide it behind a cover for safety and scratches)
5,"I purchased 4gb ram and 64 gb model storage phone model at rupees 9499.00 during republic day sale. Phone is good in terms of ram, storage, display and battery. You will not get fingerprint sensor, amoled screen, decent camera and metal body but it is fine because phone's budget is also low and i would say it is better than other available model by different manufacturers. Overall great product."
4,Yes always M series is awesome.Good delivery by amazone thanks.But i bought this mobile on 1st day of sale and on 2nd day its price was decreased up to 500 rps Not fair from Amazon.But its ok overall good experience
1,"First - Ordered when at the begnining of sale and paid 500Rs more than current price.Second - I got defective piece as selfie camera was broken.Third - I was amazed to hear that they cannot refund money back, Amazon can only replace the product.It's worst experience with Amazon Prime."
1,"This is the worst phone samsung have ever produced. Camera quility is third class. You may get more valuable phone in this range from redmi. But it has really disappointed me. Please don't buy if you want a good camera.Cons:  1. Worst Camera  2. Screen stucks  3. Can't play smoothly free fire.Pro:  1. Big hd display  2. Sound is good  3. Battery is also good when you  compare with same range phones.Honest Advice: This phone cost 10,000/-. If you can add 2500/- more then Samsung M21 is the best budget smartphone that fits every need. And if your need for camera is very less then you can buy this phone."
3,"A good budget segment for the following users* attending online classes* Elders(above 55 age) who won't use phone very much and spend minimum time on Whatsapp, Facebook* Can play games like candy crush, subway surfers , clash of clans and other medium graphic games* Those who like to upgrade their old Oreo and pie OS phonesNot for the following users:School and college students who uses phone feasiblyPro gamers like Pubg and Call of dutyPros:* Large display and weightless* No heating problem on calls and long time usage* Call quality is good* Supports dual Volte* Plastic build and weightless* Decent battery capacity. Stands for one and half days for the above mentioned users* Decent cameraCons:* Average display.* 720p maximum support on YouTube videos.* Good speaker but not loud enough* No Corning Gorilla glass support, Tempered Glass and Back case are must to avoid scratches.* No finger print sensor. Only face unlock is available but it's responding slower than expected"
5,A very good and decent budget phone in this segment.Bought this on the republic day sale.Got this for a very good exchange deal.An upgrade after using my old phone for four years whose battery was dying and memory was getting full and was showing phone lags.A very good decent budget phone choice.Just go for it.Looks premium backed with excellant Samsung brand.
4,"Display is good, can get super bright clearity is good but the viewing angles could be better, not a deal breaker at this price (viewing angles 3.8/5). Rear Camera is good it can take good photos in bright light front camera struggles a little bit in good for video calls.Pro-good and Big display, processor is good for app usage. can play medium games, battery is super, usb type c , samsung service center and warrenty, light weight, screen to body ratio, notch is very good compared to othersCon- speaker should be louder but okay if you are hearing in quite place , rear camera is good for price gives great colour accuracy then my op6 frount camera should be better. Processing power is bit slow but no problem with app usages. Ram management need improvementConclusion it is a good phone you get what you pay."
1,"I would suggest no to buy it at all. The camera is pathetic, disgusting.Even a phn with normal camera would click nice pic than this.Video call image is blurry like vga camera. The touch screen  lags very much.Apps doesn't open instantly.Even 6k-7k phones of other companies  are better than this phn.Those who have used a 10k phone of other companies  earlier  will find it difficult  to get adjust with it.You can use this phone only for calls, for seeing time and used as alarm clock.I am sick of this phone.At this cost of 10k you would get very good phones of other companies."
4,"Good phone in cheapest price with all common features, camera quality also good, battery backup perfect ...."
3,"The product is not so good, though Samsung should have included the 5Ghz wifi option in this latest phone. Physical look is good, looks classy. Photos came out good. Though, I have not taken any night snaps. Battery is good, last charged about more than 24 hrs. while writing this review, still shows 62%, after moderate use. Not a gamer, so cannot tell about that part. I am 50 so for me this is good deal.After long usage, now for camera missing are slow mo, time lapse, night shots are just ok, to much of noise, recording is just ok. Its just an average phone, in this price range other manufacturers have included better camera options. Samsung should update camera software and include more options."
1,Camera - 2/10Battery -7/10Display 4/10No
1,Waste of money. Don't go with this phone better to go with some Chinese brands. For better performance
1,Zero stars - waste of 10k1.camera is bad2.display is not good.3.overall very very disappointed with the trusted brandname☹️4. Not even worth of 5k.5. Other brands are much better in this price.
2,"Not liked very much, product is below expectations.They saying it have triple camera only for show. Picture quality is very bad.Screen resolution is 720. I expected it should be 1020 as all smartphone giving this much minimum with this price.No fingerprint lock.Battery life is good.Screen size is also good.Face recognition mostly doesn't work.Why they show of lots of features when it mostly doesn't work."
5,Good in this price range.Looks is different. No camera bump is advantage.Hardware and camera is enough for basic needs
4,"Guys let’s keep in mind that it’s a budget phone and there shouldn’t be any over expectations from this, as I can see in some of the negative reviews. It’s a fantastic phone for the money that we pay! Speed, touch, camera, display and sound are all decent enough!  I would recommend this phone for the basic use for parents and students. If you are the one who  loads the  phone with multiple Apps, pics and videos...are a camera and speed freak...look for something else."
3,Prose:1. Nice look2. Big diaplay3. 4gb/64gb configuration at 9500₹4. Battery is satisfactoryCons:1. Display response is slow. While receiving call some times you have to touch screen 3-4 times.2. Fingerprint unlock option is not available. Which should have been included. Face unlock is given but with mask on face it won't work.3. Camera quality is below average. It doesn't bother me as I'm not fond of photos and selfie.4. Sound of speaker is low.
5,"Awesome Mobile at this price, Had no issues with my Mobile which i got delivered, First the camera looked Blurry while taking shots,I was schocked, but the processed image on video or picture in gallery was super good i dosnt look like a 13Mp camera, The mobile has no heating issues with day to day usage, Dont play Too Instesive games with this one,Display and aspect ratio is super cool and  it supports 15 W fast charging, not a lot of bloatware too, Face Unlock worked on low light conditions too, The seller delivered the mobile the next day itself was a surprise with normal delivery, Overall Perfect mobile if you are not planning to do heavy Gaming on this one... Redmi 9 has some good specs too But its build quailty comes nowhere near to this one and Redmi 9 Build quality cant keep up with the hardware it has prolly end in a Overheating mobile ,Satisfied with the purchase overall Hope this is helpful..."
1,"Editing review :After almost 4 months of use, the display has developed a flickering issue.Please note, the device did not fall nor the display has had any damage.Have tried factory resetting phone and also cleaning up system cache but to no Vail.The system stress test passes as well..Tried contacting samsung help centre but no response..Didn't expect such after sales service from samsung !"
1,He product is defective and has a display problem. Very disappointing.
1,Do not buy this phone... Samsung failed on my expectations.Replaced once due to phone camera quality issues. Phone failed on Amazon quality test software. 2nd replaced phone is also remotely inspected by Samsung customer care executive (remotely) and found faulty. Waiting for Amazon service executive visit for final report.
1,Main draw back of this phone is there is no finger lock option  & while calling its starts eco & you can hear ur own voice
5,"(This is my wife's account) I have been using the phone for last 3 weeks now. I am a moderate kind of user, love to use same phone for years and not much into heavy gaming. The phone is my 3rd Samsung phone over last 7 years. It functions very smooth and feels much more expensive in actual. I have compared the phone with my wife's M31s bought 3 months back and found reasonably good considering the price I have paid, 4GB variant @ Rs. 7600.00/- (Amazon discount + SBI card offer + 500 off from amazon coupon).+ve : Good performance for moderate users, absolutely no heating at any point of time, great battery life, overall excellent looks and built quality.-ve: Doesn't support HD - 1080p streaming, camera quality is fine for me but could have been better.Finally, if anyone wants a phone even in 10k price which would do justice to every aspect a smart phone is designed for and not a big camera lover, go for it."
1,"Read this before you buy1. No dual band Wi-Fi. It won't detect JioFiber 5GHz network. Only detects a 2.4GHz  Wi-Fi. All modern mobile and even a 8 years old iPad detects 5GHz network.2. No fingerprint sensor3. Though they claimed Headphone in description, it did not came in the box.4. Camera performs below average.5. Sound quality is not impressive."
4,"Overall performance of the phone is great. But camera quality is not upto the expectation redmi 9 prime has good camera quality at this price. Apart from camera , it's a good phone to buy at this price."
5,"As the product suggest. It has got a big screen and is worth watching binge in it.Battery backup is good as of now .The touch is smooth and doesn't  have any lag.Coming to the camera:Front camera is not that promising . It lags a bit.However,  I am happy with the back camera. The resolution l, wide camera and the clarity never let's you down.I haven't tried  playing a high resolution game yet.However basic game's,  like Candycrush, farmhouse, rail tycoon can be played in a jiffy.Coming to security, the phone only supports  pin,pattern and face recognition. It doesn't have finger print which is a small issueHowever  I loved the phones overall performance.  Strongly recommended"
3,Value for money. The rear camera is not that good. All apps auto updating always thereby new apps are not getting downloaded. Samsung recommended or China apps are getting automatically downloaded which is not needed. Battery life is ok and comes for 2 days at fully data on position. While in pant pocket the screen display rotates to landscape automatically even if auto rotate function is switched off. It will not come back to portrait if u held mobile vertical and u have to switch on auto rotate to make it normal. This is embarrassing
5,Excellent Product...Using it for my daughter's online class
3,"Not bad,.."
1,Very bad mobile. Touch screen not working properly.

2,Worst Smart Phone in this segment pathetic battery life and camera quality is worst than what we used to have in old smart phones 8 years backOPPO is frustating already planning to exchange it with some other phone
1,I am purchess this mobile last month but this mobile not work properly this device is very hang and heating problem this mobile is waste of money.. don't buy thi device.
4,This phone is value for money and packed with all that you need out of a smart phone in this range.Battery performance is satisfactory.Cons: At time’s the touch screen does not respond quickly as time lag is experienced between a finger gesture and response from the screen.AI of the camera delivers artificial pictures.Conclusion: This is a good buying option in this range must go for it.
1,Touch screen not working as i have received used phone . Very bad seller
1,Very bad camera
1,I got it delivered on 9th march .I started using it from 15 March .Return date was 17 March. It begin to hang .Despite of hsving 4GB ram.It will get stuck for couple of min in middle of operations and have to restart again .Dont buy online  rather go to shop and have it .Front Camera is decent .gives u plastic felling.Apart from hanging issue it is good at this price.

1,Mobile is not working properly  facing hang issue
5,I've been using Oppo and so I like it . It's a decent handset for an affordable price. I'm not a heavy user. So this phone does he job for me. It's comfortable in the hand and is sleek.
4,Mobile is very nice as much as expected.....but one thing is its little strucking.....don't know how it works on later days
3,Camera is not good and little bit skipping of apps while using any programme ...

Samsung mobiles are too delicate which are small drop also will loss the screen which cost you half of the mobile cost.. Currently I'm using OPPO F11 Pro, I liked a lot so I bought the oppo for my family.."

1,OPPO not giving a genuine service. They don't trust the buyers. In my opinion they selling mobiles to... come back to there service stores. After 1 month my a15 OPPO Mobile suddenly turned off. The service section said touch and screen not working. They asked rs.3200 to change. I never droped my mobile and there is no physical damage i asked for warranty they opened and showed me inside there is a liquid problem i said I never droped mobile into water then how it happens. After 30 min no warranty coverd if you want pay the money to change screen. Even without any mistake from coustomer they blaming and saying some technical issues. If there is a mobile internal problem what we can do. The same day before me almost 4 coustomers said same problem mobile suddenly off.Finally OPPO A15 MOBILE IS A FAILURE SET. AND OPPO NOT PROVIDING  GENUNE TRUSTED SERVICE.
1,Very disappointed! The phone worked good for 15days of time and then touch is not working t all ! My return period I have crossed. And touch sense is absolutely a disaster. Never had such experience from Amazon and the return policy was only for 8 days that is disgusting!!!!
5,"It was very nice, battery baskup is very good ,its fingerprint reader is good"

1,The product just overheating.. it is unbelievable from such great company production devices.  Here the cost does not matter but product quality is matters.1. builtin Alex is not working2. Average camera3. Overheating.I have been one plus 6t device since 2.5 so far single problem face.. I just upgraded to one plus 9 but it seems to be the worst decision. I did it as I am feeling now.
1,"Just got d phone today... frm day 1 too much overheating issue... Not possible to use...Also battery issue, 20% battery drained out in 15 minutes..."
4,One day delivery. Very fast. Kuddos on that.The phone is amazing. No complains so far. 3 days of heavy usage to check battery camera music everything.Would definitely say one of the best cameras. Sound could have been louder but not at all bad. Battery is excellent. Interface touch smoothness WOW.Didn't give 5 stars as always scope of improvement. But overall go for it. Remain a one plus fan
1,SENDING USED PRODUCT TO CUSTOMERSI BOUGHT IT WHEN I OPEN GALLERY 100 OF IMAGES ARE THERE ALSO MINOR SCRETCHES ARE
1,Oneplus is cheating us on 5gLook at the price 55000Don't go blindly friendsInstead Oneplus i am choosing Samsung
1,Network performance not good  and camera performance very Bad compared oneplus 9 and Samsung a71 both  are equally  and one plus 9 price to hight
1,"Strange change in features, automatic call recording feature has been withdrawn. Returning the phone"
1,"Dear Buyers,I bought this phone for my younger brother as his birthday gift. I was outside the city when I got this delivered to him. He was facing issues with this phone from the first day, but he didn't inform me since I gave him a gift and didn't feel like complaining about a gift. It's only after I met him I came to know that :1. This phone has serious heating issues. Gets so much hot while charging that a human hand can't hold it.2. Battery Draining issue. The battery doesn't last more than 5 hours after 100% charge with normal to low usage. If you keep the phone and stare at the battery percentage, you can actually see it going down in front of your eyes.3. Overrated camera. The amount paid for this phone doesn't justify the quality of the cameras, and the entire thing is overrated.4. I would clearly recommend buying an iPhone 11 instead. Way better battery life, camera, durability and software experience.I tried returning the phone immediately, but amazon did not accept the return and asked us to run some tests. On running the test they advised that the phone is perfect and we might be not using it right. Beautiful isn't it? And now we are stuck with this worthless heating brick."
5,"- SD888 - Superfast Processor- Real feel of 120 Hz Fluid Display- Charging - 0-100 in 35min !!!- Battery Usage: Screen on 120Hz (  Total 4 Hours ) : (2 Hours screentime, on wifi, video streaming,  including 30 Min Call Of Duty gameplay = Battery dropped from 100 to 70)- High-quality speakers ( Really Loud !! )- Decent Cameras - ( Don't expect too much Hasselblad hype )- Clean and Smooth UI - Oxygen OS."
1,This product is not worth the price. I have to return it. It heats a lot and camera quality is also not good.
1,i received mobile today on 21/04/2021 i chrged the device full and within 2 hour the battery percentage came 70 perctenage and i dont thin it will last all day
1,"Camera is not really great, battery draining too fast,i didn't expect this from one plus, loudspeaker for calls is not so high ,u can't listen if there is disturbance outside, but speaker for music is awesome effect, need to improve many things, battery is heating too much while using camera or for using in hot sun, u should improve this,if u lift ur phone from rest,all mobile shows fingerprint scanner to unlock,but one.plus is not showing that ,u should double tap or press the lock but it annoying for this, typing has also become difficult for me compared to my old mobile, sliding is also not good if u use this while texting, first it was to take about 50min to charge fully,now after 4 5 days it's taking 30 35min"
2,"Positive - phone is fast, no hang or lag, smooth operations and usageCons -Below average camera qualityVery bad battery performance. The bettery drains like anything, you feel the anxiety while using.I was not able to write the review of this phone for almost 4 days after the launch, clearly shows amazon and oneplus wanted to trick people buying this.Conclusion - not worth buying"
2,"Initial review after 2 days of use.Look and feel is great.Function smoothly without any lag.Faced heating issues even if slightly overloaded, big disappointment.Warp charge works very well, however battery is draining faster than usual.Camera is good on first impression, yet to explore more.Overall, doesn't looks like a good deal considering the price.---------------------------------------------Further reduced the rating to 2 star after extensive use of 2 months.1. Phone keeps heating even while not in use and background app restricted.2. Phone heats while charging and disable many features until temperature comes down.3. Hassalebald has only given name, seems like just another ordinary camera.4. Charging was good initially but after updates it takes more than an hour to fully charge.A basic 15k smartphone can be easily compared to this so called flagship killer. Strongly not recommended to buy."
1,"हर्षद मेहता की तरह चुना लगा दिया,हेसल ब्लेड का कैमरा बोल के । कभी मत खरीदना3 घंटे मैं 100 परसैंट बैटरी खत्म"
1,"This is the first time I am very disappointed with One Plus. We have three One Plus models and were very happy with the build, performance , camera etc. But this time One Plus 9 series disappointed. Firstly, heating issues and while switching on the mobile for first time the touch was not working at all."
5,"First things first the display is awesome with excellent brightness, Camera is top notch with 8k recording at 30fps and 4k recording at 30 & 60fps. 4500mah Battery is a beast and charges within 20mins atmost and it lasts easily for about 24hrs for a normal usage. I used the mobile for a whole day for gaming,video recording,with mobile data & WIFI on alternatively and still after 24hrs battery balance is 37% . Multi Threading is ultra smooth in this mobile as mine is 12/256 gb version and neva gets slow in any circumstances. These are so far my observations for the past 3days of my mobile usage. As of now there are no flaws with this, will update if any. Final verdict is flagship killer,if you can afford dont look back n  go for it..."
2,After usage for 2 days I am writing the review ...Heating issues are significant not even able to click pics while heating..Battery discharging Faster ..not lasting for even 8 hrs with moderate usage..Overall Not satisfied..Not expected such issues from one plus Premium phoneAmazon customer care are not replacing it.. Feeling cheated!! Waste of Money!!
4,"One plus is always good in terms of performance, display and charging. This model is marvellous in terms of charging speed. Battery backup is decent when you are using 120 Hz refresh rate. OS is very clean but you will not get many customised option as it is like a stock android. Call recording function is useless but it is privacy policy u can't blame OP for this.Camera is not as hyped by OP , hasselblad is ordinarily working. Still camera is good enough since last versions. May be future updates will do much better as hardware specifications are good enough. Front camera is ok type they must have given atleast IMX 586 in that. At this price, when u are getting SD 888 , very fast charging, Sony IMX 689 and 766 sensors, this price is good. But they should have given OIS, more 5G bands.People say that wireless charging should be given like in overseas versions. What is the use 15 watt or 30 watt wireless charging when you getting 65 watt charging. Wired charging is much quicker than wireless. So wireless charging under 30 watt will be worst.Vivo X60 or Pro may be better in terms of camera but still they are using SD 870 only. Just 33 watt charging. They are using Sony IMX 598 only.  Somewhere you are getting better but u can't beat this in terms of batter charging and performance.No heating issues I have faced when used this almost 3 hours. Design is ordinary dont look like a flagship, Color is good. Extremely light weight and handy to use.It is good to buy."
1,"The product just overheats and Battery drains in few minutes, Totally not worthy..."
1,"Guys my humble request...pls don't purchase this one plus 9.. Very worst.. Didn't expect from one plus...1. Within a 10 minutes of using getting OVER HEATING.2. CAMERA is worst.3. Network issues( • while connecting with Wifi, not getting a proper speed wic wifi having 150mbps. In this mobile we getting only 189kp. •Mobile network also worst.)4. Call is getting tooo lag..5. Look of the phone is very average.6. Screen clarity is gud.7. Builtin alexa is working gud.8. Sound clearity is gud.9. Overall worst phone at high price.10. Dont go for this one plus 9Thank you"
1,Over priced phone..very ordinary look..not amoled screen..OIS is a must in today's time which even every ordinary phone is providing. It is not expected out of a flagship phone.One plus !! You were always known for value for Money phones. I would expect you to provide OIS and good 5G bandwidth atleast as a update in future.
1,Sound is not coming through Bluetooth headset for this device
1,"One plus lost its credibility after one plus 9 release.One plus 9 is only hype and worth for the money you pay .One plus 9 is having plastic body like other substandard mobile in the market .One plus 9 does not have wireless charging for only products available in India .One plus is having only two cameras where as one plus R and one plus is having four cameraOne plus 9 is having 5G band - only two 5G bands. The customer care has been fooling us that it will upgrade to 4 5G band. Later on it has confirmed by one plus communication that the software upgrade will not enhance 5G II bandS to IV BANDSI am one of the admirer of one plus product quality  .However , it has diluted after the new release of one plus 9.What for we are paying ??????"
5,"Hey .Today I'm gonna review the Oneplus 9 5G .Ask me any questions you have directly , and I'll try to answer them all. 🙏Okay so let's start :The phone looks quite good , its thin but a bit less wide , I use an iPhone 12 Pro Max , and it's around 1-2 cm less wide . Not a big issue .Screen is fluid , no problems at all . I have used oneplus 7T so I've trust over this brand .Battery :The 65 watt charger does what it's meant to . The cable is a USB C To C . Not the old usb to C . Charges in around an hour .Camera :In my opinion , the biggest selling point is the camera here . Looks good , with a tinge of extra saturation . Way better than the older ones . Gives a lot of independence too .PUBG :ALot of people buy oneplus devices for games , and comparing to my iPhone , this device gives a good competition . 90 fps is an advantage over apple , but rarely devices give 90 fps , maybe in tdms but not in classics . No lag , but you will see some frame drops , but which device doesn't have frame drops ! Even the iPhone does .Competitors :I needed to purchase this for my mother , so Need to share why I went for this .There's IQOO , Asus and Oneplus in this range which are worth buying . I have been using one plus so I trust them more , they have a local service center too , something which I lack in my iPhone experience .I don't trust vivo much , IQOO is a developing brand , it's op for sure , but still couldn't gamble . The Oneplus gives better cameras than any other , which is the main reason I got this , as camera usage is a lot .People with similar budget with just gaming budget can go for rog , but if you need a family phone , this guy packs nearly everything .*You also get stickers and a red cable club card , which is something I like .CONS :Oneplus really needs to deal with the software issues . There's always some thing left to patch after the release , which sucks .The dialer has that annoying annoucement during recording , and that really can make you go deaf XDOverall , could go for rog if needed a gaming phone , but since a lot of my family members use this device , I went for one plus .Thanks for reading , I hope I helped you :)"
2,"The OnePlus 9 Software is a real Downer! If you're like me, then you would have gone by with the OnePlus 9 reviews and marketing press releases! Truth be told - Even after the update the phone has major flaws in software in the Alarm setting and interface! At the price charged the Camera is a real Downer! I feel cheated. This was to be a phone I could trust and hold on to for good,sadly now I need to possible buy another brand and chuck OnePlus for good! OnePlus is this ethical? You're marketing was just hype!"
5,"888 is way too fast.65 watt charging is awesome.120hz display is buttery smooth.Ram and Storage are also very fast.Rear cameras are awesome, best in this price segment.Front camera is very average (didn't liked it).Battery backup is also average, but the charging speed cover it all. If you're a moderate user you will get whole day backup.Oxygen OS is just amazing. It's the cleanest UI I've ever used and have lot of customization features too..No heating issue faced till now, it just became a little warm(very little) in booting. Other than that I played Asphalt 9 and COD mobile they were buttery smooth.Final rating from my side 9/10. ( One marks less coz take a lot of selfies but selfie camera turned out to be a disappointment for me).Go for it, awesome device, you will love using it."
5,I am using this phone from last 5-6 days. I listened very much about heating issue but after using this phone I am saying you truth I am also getting this problem but after updating the latest updates you will not goona face this problem again. But if you are working in direct sunlight for more than 1-2 hour you will get message of high temperature but in 2-3 minutes it will restore to normal.so here Is truth and phone is really amazing
4,"Using since past 3 days, good speed . No lags when multiple apps are opened. Amazing battery life, single charge is enough for more than a day. Wrap charge is superfast. 20 min for 45% to 100% charging. Camera's are good. I was using LG G7 ThinQ before. One plus 9 camera is not as good as LG. But still works well. Will post more update after a month usage."
2,"It doesn't match the quality that I have come to expect from OnePlus phones. I am graduating from OnePlus 6t. And definitely not expected based on the money you end up paying. There is nothing really special in the camera, atleast one doesn't notice a visible change except for the filters. The phone heats up like crazy even with simple operations like a video call (even after the latest Software update). Battery life is decent but not super sturdy as you would expect in a new phone, I can see this becoming a problem in the months to come.The good things are the performance, the gesture control, the ease offered by OnePlus switch."

1,I am using OnePlus since 2019. Just for the upgrade I bought OnePlus 9 5G but after all not a good option and not much happy with phone performance. Facing a lot of issues like-Heating issue is too much.battery life is not so good.Taking too much time while chargingCamera quality is average.
5,Excellent mobile . Charging is up next level. Super quality.
5,Product is good and provides similar performance as shared by one plus for 12 Gb Ram 256 Gb ROMAfter using one plus 7 pro and looking at 8 series I expected very little changes in 9 buy this cross my all expectations .Gaming.mode does not give any glitches or pixel issues .. performance is very good . Although battery gets drained but that depends on type of usage .Over all camera performance is best I have observed in this segment and Hasselblad camera breaks boundaries viewing clarity
4,"People should've waited for the updates. Phone has improved alot and still recieving updates.  Battery lasts for 1 day, its subjective. Depends on usage.  Fast charging🔥Camera puts out great quality if you turn on High Resolution from top.No heating issue now, everything is sorted. But camera needs alot of improvement it's slow in clicking.But to be honest there's nothing you'll hate about the device, You are paying this much for the camera and the OS. For camera prefer the Pro bcs of OIS. OP9 has stabilisation mode but not that effective. Great phone, if not camera go for the 8TBattery update- Initially you won't see good battery life, bcs new device takes time to understand your usage pattern and then it optimises the phone. 1st day 10% dropped in 15 mins. But now 10% drops in almost 45-60 mins. Decent battery+ Crazy charger= Satisfactory 1 day usage."
5,"I m oneplus phone user from a long time. I have used oneplus 3,6, 7T pro and now this. I m writing this review after using it for 2 days.Received phone 1 day before promised date. I bought this phone at 51999₹ with SBI credit card.Phone box contains phone with applied screen guard, back cover, charger and C to C cable for charger. You can't connect this phone to your laptop if you don't have C USB port in your laptop. You have to buy C to USB cable. Luckily I have one from my old phone.Phone is light is weight w.r.t. 7T pro which is a plus point for guy like me who carries the phone in front pocket. Also the screen size is appropriate, not too large and not too small.Phone is slim like one plus 6 and screen is flat and round at the edge like 7T pro. Front camera is not at centre, which I don't prefer.Battery looks good so far. Charging from 5% to 90% in 20min. I m using phone continually for last 2 days and I have to carge the phone twice. So I would say it's plus.I m not a game person but played game to check it's performance and found better than last phone.Cameras are really good. Both front and back camera are best. I m not a photographer but for amature like me it does job more then required.Cons for me:-1. No USB to C cable for laptop connection2. One plus phone app is not there, phone is using Google phone app, same goes with messaging app. Which is may be due to inbuilt Alexa.3. Heating of phone while charging and while using for long time, but that's what u expect when u have this much large battery.Overall really good phone within its price range with flagship brand."
2,"Average phone, esp given the hype given to it prior to the launch. Not at all a value for money. Prefer samsung or an iphone.Even lower priced phones from Samsung have far far better camera than this one.It is ridiculously over priced with the value it provides.Only positive is a wrap charger. Other than that it is an average phone.Speaker - 👎🏾Camera - 👎🏾👎🏾Pricing - 👎🏾Battery & charger - 👍🏾"
5,"AFTER ONE MONTH REVIEW1.Camera is great.I)OIS is not an issue as youtubers were saying.2.Neither overheating, temperature remains as it is on other devices it's just software glitch on apps like ampere3.gaming is so smooth that you will need few days to get used to (Cod Mobile,Pes2021,Kof, Pokemon go) even if you're pro.4.80percent battery can last 4-5 hours screen on time and 8-10 hours otherwise.5. Stereo speakers are good6.Screen quality is far better than previous OnePlus devices, Looks like samsung device from front because of samsung screen.7.Price is 6k -8k higher Just because of hasselblad logoOverall great phone go for it"
1,"I have been a OnePlus user since the original OnePlus. Never have been so much disappointed in a phone than this one.The first piece I bought - the battery heated up to 43 degrees and I couldn’t hold the phone. Got it replaced in the off chance that I had received a faulty piece.The second one - similar issues. Worse, the battery backup is pathetic. What use is a 30 min Warp charge if 80% of the battery drops down to 30% in half an hour of normal usage.Cons - Heating issues, pathetic battery life.Pros - None that just such a price point."

5,"Liked the quality of the product from OPPO and the design.. It's far better than the Samsung M and A series mobiles.. Samsung mobiles are too delicate which are small drop also will loss the screen which cost you half of the mobile cost.. Currently I'm using OPPO F11 Pro, I liked a lot so I bought the oppo for my family.."

5,A s Lim phone very good
5,Good product I m so happy good berry baicp
1,OPPO not giving a genuine service. They don't trust the buyers. In my opinion they selling mobiles to... come back to there service stores. After 1 month my a15 OPPO Mobile suddenly turned off. The service section said touch and screen not working. They asked rs.3200 to change. I never droped my mobile and there is no physical damage i asked for warranty they opened and showed me inside there is a liquid problem i said I never droped mobile into water then how it happens. After 30 min no warranty coverd if you want pay the money to change screen. Even without any mistake from coustomer they blaming and saying some technical issues. If there is a mobile internal problem what we can do. The same day before me almost 4 coustomers said same problem mobile suddenly off.Finally OPPO A15 MOBILE IS A FAILURE SET. AND OPPO NOT PROVIDING  GENUNE TRUSTED SERVICE.
1,Very disappointed! The phone worked good for 15days of time and then touch is not working t all ! My return period I have crossed. And touch sense is absolutely a disaster. Never had such experience from Amazon and the return policy was only for 8 days that is disgusting!!!!
5,"It was very nice, battery baskup is very good ,its fingerprint reader is good"

1,Don't dare to buy this phone... Pathetic camera.. camera clarity is like VGA... Oppo cheated this time to customers by fake features

5,"I am writing the review after use of about 1 day. I purchased it for my mother. She is very happy to have it. Aa she was earlier user of Samsung basic mobile and she used the mobile for about 6 years. So now she upgraded to smartphone of this brand because in her opinion Samsung mobiles are long lasting. In my opinion:-  Display- 4.5/5  Battery- 5/5  Camera- 5/5  Performance- 4/5  Look- 4/5  Value for money- 4.5/5Display is good and bright as usual Samsung display are always of better quality.  Sound is not best but okay. Look is good but need improvement in back design as it seems to be a cheap plastic material. Battery has no complaints. Camera specially front camera is surprisingly good. But performance should be improved as somtime touch is less responsive.so if you are multitasker and heavy user of mobile then itz not for you. but keeping the price in mind 7299 rs for 3gb ram and 32 gb storage its a fair deal as you are attached to Samsung brand which is better than cheap chinese mobiles like Mi, Oppo, etcPlz don't forget to like if fou find my review helpful 👍"
1,performance was very bad if I open the application that time hang my phone with in 3 seconds and when I rotate the video on landscape mode that time video has slowly moved
4,"Dont expect much from this phone, this is a average user phone, phone will be  lag if using more apps, but its decent for this price, value for money.  Best for Basic to Android upgraders."
1,"I ordered the phone as soon as it was launched. When I received the phone, the camera was not working properly. Everything was very blurry and phone was very slow.I placed a return request. I then received the replacement piece. Camera was working this time but after 1 day use, I noticed that nobody called me the whole day when I generally receive around 10 calls. When I tried calling from another number, it said that the number is out of coverage area when jio had good network reception and VoLTE was on. I have a placed a return request for second time now."
5,"Why did i purchased?1.For using wifi hotspot, instead of my primary phone2.To make or receive Emergency calls either from office or other personalsWhat did i liked most?1.Good Build quality2.Good Display, excellent quality3.Good signal reception, clear voice quality.4.economy price.5.Good Battery6.Latest operation system.7.Dolby atmos(good for music lovers)8.hotspotWhat makes you disappoint?Usb port should be ctype.Finally, what did you say?This is the excellent phone in this price range.Can be used as wifi hotspot and standby phone.This phone is only for basic usage like listening music, simple  voice calls, chatting, watching youtube, surfing net.Not recommended for gamers and heavy users.And display supports upto 720p only.Note:In initial setup, you may face lag and struck in youtube videos. But once after setup completed,restart  the phone.Everything  will get settled up."
3,"So I recieved the phone a few days back. And I will be using this phone as my primary phone. So I will keep this brief and almost to the point.Build quality- tacky looking, good, but can be improved for future budget phones. I got grey color, and it's not metallic, my mum says the rear looks like shahbadi floor tiles. Not an insult. Anyways I like it, but it's not metallic.Screen- personally, I am happy with it, touch feedback is nice too, but ofcourse not like 20k+ range phones.touch is very responsive in the calculator app.Battery- well 5000mah, good, it's quite more than necessary for me but good.Camera- macro camera- took a fair enough macro shot, 2mp. 3.2mp would have been a sweet spot in budget yet good quality. Front and main camera yet to test fully. Night time photos? Forget it. Honestly even most mid range phones don't fare well in night.Processor power- its not a powerful chip to begin with, but fine, I am going to manage with it. For others, the phone is a bit laggy/slow in some aspects..or most. Camera takes a good whole second or 2 to start, the viewfinder flow is not smooth and laggy/glitchy.but I like the wide and macro combination. SHOULD'VE BEEN 3.2MP :'(More apps= bit more lag while entering main menu. So the less no of apps, should suffice. I opened a bunch of apps, including 3 Google tabs in browser, and many apps, lag was not severe slowdown, but was a little slower than before or it's slow to begin with and didn't really have high expectations. Using the device care and/or restarting the phone did feel better and smoother, but took a good whole 7 to 10 seconds for the live wallpaper to load. Talking of wallpapers, even being samsing OneUI, there is no option for galaxy themes :(I am not gonna do any major gaming on this so I cannot say anything on it's regard, I prefer pc gaming. But don't expect much, however if you really want have a  experience where you'd feel better/happy with the purchase, I'd suggest playing classic games like Mario, crash bandicoot etc. Some game suggestions- Dadish, alto.I will update this review after a week/months use. And finally a half/full year update.If you have a budget of atleast 10k then I'd suggest buying some other samsung product or your preference. I've used the m31s and compared to this, that phone is way smooth, and many more models out there. But if you want a entry level phone, or coming from a feature phone, budget constraints, secondary phone. Then this is the phone to go with.  I personally like my m02 quite a bit."
1,"Phone is very slow& heats up quickly. I replace the first piece. Received the replacement the very next day, thanks to amazon. But the second handset was even worse as it got extremely heated even before it was set up completely. Returning it also."
1,"No wireless display as specified and camera not working evertime, quality is poor, even though 13mpixel, it's like VGA camera.. pictures are blur..please don't waste your money.."
3,Average Smartphone.....😵
4,"Mobile is good for simple use but pathetic camera , no fingerprint sensor and old processor which makes it slow for a phone in 2021 .  I purchased it as my secondry phone, display is really awesome and light weight with sleek design. For better deal opt for micromax IN 1B if you can compromise on display and will use as primary phone  .But the conclusion is samsung's quality and customer care cannot be compared with any other brand  in india .If you want a secondry phone then its a perfect choice at this price"
5,"At a first glance phone looks decent one. It has almost all the features except finger print but it's ok in this price range. Checked the sound quality, camera, internet speed. All seems to be fine. For a basic user it's a good choice. Will review further after using few more days."
5,The product is best value for money and only watch it as a budget smartphone
1,Performance and display is not as per standard. Pale display....it looka like a duplicate screen. Performance is so slow that even opening a calculator take 5sec of lag to open. It seems this phn is either refurbished version of some older phone. Samsung has not delivered such low standard phn till now.
1,"Reason to buy :1. Very stylish looks . u found a premium quality.2. Big display.3. Battery is good.Reason not to buy1. It's like a Scorpio with auto""s engine.App load time is long2. Camara just a scrap.3. Speaker is very very bad. Burst speaker.Over all don't buy this . if you don't want anything more than call nd need only a good looking ph then only buy or either go for poco c3,redmi 9a"
1,I have used 3 or 4 samsung phones with this price tag. But this phone model is disappointing me.I found below issues in the phone that i received from this seller. Not sure about other users.1. Call volume is low.2. Performance issue.3. Phone hangs in the middle without loading the website completely.4. Very heavy but ( i did not notice it when i ordered. This is my mistake).5. Call disconnection but not very frequently.There is no option for refund. But it has only exchange with the same model.I returned this mobile . Am waiting for replacement phone. Let us see how the new phone of same model works.
2,Good in screen size. Average phone in the price range. 👍Camera 📷 worst-: On the name of samsung it's very bad. 👎Battery🔋backup-: It's is good can run full day.👍Speed~RAM-: Don't even think of playing any game. It's lag vere very much even while playing Temple Run in 3gb variant.👎Memory management-: it's come with 32gb internal memory in with 10gb is allready consume by system software.👎Overall ~ If you are purchasing this phone for only calling purpose then go for it. 👍Don't think of playing a single 50-100Mb game u won't be able to play on this device 🙏
3,"Writing this review after couple of days of using. First I ordered this and received a slow item, then I replaced the item and thanks to Amazon I have received the replacement within 1 day. But, the replacement item is still slow. Hence, I have decided to return the item.PROS:1. Big Screen2. Huge Battery Life3. 3GB of RAM4. 32GB of Internal Storage6. Latest Android OSCONS:1. MediaTek Processor (after having 3GB of RAM, the phone takes 2 seconds to open Chrome and 1.5 seconds to open contact list)2. Hangs After Playing GamesVERDICT:You can go for this phone if you are looking for a secondary phone or you are gifting this to your parents. This phone is not for them who will watch movies, play games and hinging on social media apps."
5,* Display is very good* Battery Backup Excellent* Stylish Mobile* YouTube Videos playing without buffering
1,"Guys if you are looking for a smartphone Please do not buy this product. Reasons are given below1. Battery life is not upto the Mark even in power saving mode. Drained very fast in just 15 hrs. If you watch movie then ot will drain in 4 hrs only.2. Camera. Both front and rear camera are just like vga camera. No quality of Megapixels.3. Hangs a lot. Takes too much to unlock and don't have a fingerprint scanner as well. No facelock option.4. Many times it dont show the caller number on screen for 5 to 10 seconds.When you are working on it and someone calls you then only ringtone will play first and small icon will appear on the top after 5-10 seconds. Unknown no. by truecaller will show when you disconnect call.5. I have not installed any game as it hangs in normal operation.6. Screen width is not upto mark,as keys of keyboard come closer. You will feel uncomfortable while typing.7. Sound quality is low, as no proper music beats.8. When you are on call the screen automatically flash and touch enables.Samsung should recall this model. Worst ever phone. You can add 2000 more and can get better phone than this."
2,"Phone is little bit slow hanging in first start , below average camera quality both front and rear , plastic back but at this price point cant expect more. But we can expect good Qualcomm Snapdragon processor or exynos ...long charger wirePros - good battery not yet checked , bright and clear screen, latest update today via OTA,Cons- very small charger wire and it is unacceptable, below average camera, very slow phone , plastic cheap quality,I suggest spend bit more on good specification phone don't just go with Samsung..."
5,"Best smartphone in this prize,nice display, battery life best,but I want to more features like, screen shot and screen recorder too."
1,"First I was happy that Samsung rolled out a budget phone under 7000 Rs. but later got disappointed that we have to bear slow processor. The processor is quite slow and the phone started hanging as soon as I booted for the very first time. Along with this drawback, the display is very cheap when it comes to expecting a nice one from a brand like Samsung. I would suggest not to go with the brand value but see the specifications before you buy and don't make the mistake which I made."
4,"3/32gb variant @ 7299/- is good deal with samsung brand. Quad-core MediaTek MT6739 Processor is outdated & slow but adequate for basic usage. No lagging for whatsApp, fb, YouTube.  Display & Screen resolution is great as well as battery backup. 10W charger took more than 3.5hr for full charging. Cameras are average considering price point."
4,"This is my first personal Samsung phone, and what better model to start with! Using it for a week  now and everything is functioning as it should. Very good display, sound and maneuverability overall.  Only one thing :  The mobile's data cable could really have been a bit longer. Other than that the phone is working fine. The best thing is the 5000mAH battery,  which I am enjoying. :-) Truly  a value for money.Will update if I find any other significant matter in the coming days."
4,Product is just ok if you have another phone. I use iPhone n I took it as some apps have xtra features in android.Phone has a good battery. Processor is not good enough so it’s a little slagging. Design is good. Display is too bright if u hold it straight with ur eyes as it’s a tft lcd.  I hope in future updates mobile will become a little smoother.  It is very rare that you will get every update time to time in this price. But I am sure u r not going to get a better choice in this price. If you have money shortcomings you can consider it!!Have a nice day ahead!!
2,I ONLY USE FOR MAKING CALLS.WHATSAPP VIDEOS ONE OR TWO I SEE AT THE MAXIMUM.MOBILE LOOKS GOOD.NO ONE CAN TALK ILL ABOUT SAMSUNG DISPLAY OR CAMERA.AS USUAL BATTERY FAILS.IN THIS CASE ATTERY DRAINS EVERYDAY I NEED TO CHARGE EVENTHOUGH I DIDNOT PLAY ANY GAME OR SEE MEDIA.IF WE PUT FULL CHARGE ATLEAST IT SHOULD LAST FOR ONE FULL DAY.MORNING IF IT IS 100 PERCENT EVENING IT COMES AROUND 35 PERCENT.CURSE FOR SAMSUNG.
5,Best samsung mobile in this price category.Thank you Amazon.
2,"I would not recommend this product to any age group.This mobile has most slowest processor, even on first day you feel like you are operating crashed system.Go for bit higher prise product you Will not regret."
5,"If we compare the product quality with the price, definitely it is a value for money device for your daily usage.Battery life is very good, charging is a bit slow but ok.Look wise the phone gives a decent look from back side which can be increased by using back cover.Front side look is awsm.Screen size is good for gaming and movies, performance is great even in sunlight.Camera quality is absolutely fine.Definitely you can go for this having a branded logo on back."
5,A wonderful value for money! I had asked it as a extra side phone. It provides excellent prolonged battery life and beautiful design that doesn't get you off. The performance is obviously not as fast as premium phones in terms of speed if you want to use as a multi purpose phone. But basic apps just do all fine.
1,Defective Item was received.IMEI number is not displaying when dialing the required number.Requested for a refund but exchange partner has refused to collect it despite raising a request within 24 hours.Please check the seller on Amazon before purchasing your products.
3,The phone gets very hot with minimal use.Editing the review after the phone was replaced. This time got the right product and it works pretty well.Guess it was a faulty product to begin with. Happy with Amazon. Samsung needs to do their quality checks better.
5,Just amazing..Battery back up to video quality as well as net working and perform too fast..
5,"Very good budget phone with big screen. Support is only for 2.4ghz WiFi and not support 5ghz WiFi which user is missing compared to other manufacturers smartphone around same price range. Charger point is not so smooth to insert the charging pin and seems it might cause priblem after an year use, but need to see how it copes with."
5,One  of Best mobile phone in this range💪 truely💪awesome
3,After using this device for 5 days I can share some pros and consPros-1- Budget smartphone from Samsung at this price range.2- Screen is better in performance.3- 5000 mAh battery life stands upto 24 hours after watching videos for 5 hours and calling. (Couldn't play game)4- Picture quality is average.Cons-1- The device lags and sometimes hang on performing easy steps like shifting app to app.2- Multitask becomes difficult as it is slow in performance.3- Camera is not upto the mark.4- Doesn't feel premium while holding the phone.5- due to bigger battery the mobile feels heavy. (206 gms)6- Found bugs like-(1) Pressing power button takes time to wake and sleep the screen.(2) Home screen zooms upto 300% without activating.(3) Opening camera stucks for upto 5-10 sec sometimes.(Will update more if found)Thanks!
5,Good quality product.. working perfectly. No defects found on mobile. Good quality rear cameras and good quality front cameras. Good sound quality.  Good display quality . Light weight . Good touch sensitive. Designs and colours are good . In this price mobile  is good. Phone back Is made of plastic. Good performance ram no lag coming . Android 10 installed . After we connect internet  to phone we get updations of all. Totally good mobile. Total 10 gb is used in rom 22 gb Is balance.
1,Believe me guys don't make mistake you will regret. This phone hangs a lot even at normal task like opening notification panel or settings or receiving calls. Better go for other brands if you are tight with your budget they buy new Gionee phones Gionee F103 pro was my first phone there are some software update problem but except that everything runs much smoother than this M02 and note it this Gionee phone was 5 years old and still you can play COD in it. Even i have played pubg recently before it was ban. Now i ordered new mobile because i was getting battery issue in my Gionee handset and trusted Samsung but i got something more bad than previous phone.Don't buy it!
1,Pathetic performance of the phone. My father in law was using old redmi 3i for past many years. Since it's battery was almost gone i bought this useless mobile with weakest processor. Opening a dialer itself takes 3-4 seconds. I didn't imagine this like sluggishness of the mobile from Samsung. Better i would've gone with xiomi or realme. Wasted Rs.7500.. lets see how long will it work
4,"So I ordered this phone 20 days ago I guessAs i got a good exchange offer for my repaired handset i only paid 900.About the product-The screen quality is awesome at this price point, the battery is also promising, build quality is above average however it doesn’t offer fingerprint which is pretty basic even at this price.The main concern with this handset is the ram management on this one creates problem. The multitasking can’t be done fluently and yes it lags a bitTo me I purchased this handset for my 2.5 years old niece as she loves watching videos throughout the day. So for us it was a health purchase but for those who want to use this as a primary phone. Please increase your budget otherwise you will be irritated."

5,"My mother has mobility issues and is not very tech friendly.When I saw this phone on Amazon, I felt it was just what she needed. So, I ordered one and am very happy with the purchase.She likes the familiar shape and features of the phone, which looks like a Landline instrument. The sound and the ringtone are loud and clear and she can carry it wherever she goes. It has enough charge to see her through a whole day and more. She is very happy with her Gigasmart Fixed Wireless Phone!"
5,Very handy and efficient. Nice features as well..
1,It is of no use as it is not accepting my sim card .please insert sim and check.

4,"I've been using this phone for 4days now.I will share my review with pros and cons:cons:1.It feel like a cheap phone idk why,there are some phones in this price segment ""looks"" premium.2.No LED notification,a major missing.3.Rear Camera is not that good in default,but when we changed to 48MP it looks ""kinda"" good.It seems like good in this price segment.4.Its little bit getting Hot while charging and I feel some Hottnes while taking photos(maybe coz of outside temperature)5.It takes quite a bit to get fully charged,yah the battery is 6000 but its fast charging with 18W.6.so much pre installed apps(we can uninstall it) and also like previously,we have to go through each app to disable ""Recommendations""Pros:1.Very light weight and it doesn't feel a massive 6000 is inside2.Front camera is Superb! good detailed pics in portrait.3.Battery is so good.I use the phone to take a lot of pictures and use it for 1 hr swiping through Instagram,the battery doesn't notice that at all lol(its pretty good)4.Stereo speaker does that job GOOD5.For games,ya with a medium settings it is good for 1hr continuous gaming after that it gets little hot but there is no overheating like that issue till now.This is all I can remember,I will try to update if I notice it afterwards."
3,"Redmi 9 Power Electric Green (4+128)(FIRST 24-HOURS REVIEW)• A phone with Superb Design and unique colours• I have purchased electric green colour and believe it is really superB in looks• Heavy in weight but its okey as it looks fine in hands• Dual stereo speakers with ultimate sound quality!! BUT BUT BUT !!• Redmi claimed 6000mAh Battery, means we think that it will go through atlest ""1 & Half day to 2 days"" of battery backup in one charge, But there is nothing like that.• The Battery will Last go to 1 day of maximum backup only if limited use.(I charged the phone full in last evening by 7pm and its 1 pm today righ now and it is 55% left with no use as i am using it as a secondary phone, means the Remaining 55% battery will last longer to 11pm. The total battery backup without use of phone will go to 28 Hours, as i am using it as a secondary phone with no whatsapp, youtube or any kind of internet surfing with this phone)• It means if u want to use it as a primary phone with whatsapp, youtube, and other internet features then i dont think so that it can give 1 day backup• Redmi claimed 22W Fast Charger with it, apart from it while using its own 22W fast charger it takes more then enough time to charge(It takes time to Charge full)• Camera quality is like hell, specially the front camera, Don't buy if u wants a Camera Quality in Mid Range phoneSummary:-Purchase it if u want as a secondary phonePurchase it if u want super outer looks with ultimate colour optionsPurchase it if u dont want good selfie camera quality (According to price range)Purchase it if u want a Good Looking Attractive Phone"
1,"Very Disappointed by the product. Camera quality is too bad. The only one thing is in phone is it has 6000mah Battery. Overall this product is very worst. Don't buy if you are looking it as a primary phone which has best camera, Storage & massive battery."
1,"Honest review after a week of usage -Do not make the mistake of buying this mobile. While the price point is competitive, it would make lot of sense to pay an extra 1000 and go for the Redmi Note 9 instead of Redmi 9 Power.This mobile has pathetic camera quality. It says 48 MP camera, but the quality is as good as 8 or 13 MP camera. Redmi note 9 having the same camera gives far better quality images. I am truly disappointed with the camera quality.So do not go on the Megapixels. This mobile honestly has very bad camera quality.The performance is OK. A snapdragon octacore processor does not do any justice as I have experienced good amount of lags while opening basic apps.The battery back up is good, but apart from that, there is nothing special about this phone.I regret buying this in the flash sale."
4,Ok Product
1,"Camera is very worst, In indoor lighting pictures are getting blurred, Front camera is something like 4 years back quality because it has only 8MP.When coming to back camera even with 48MP, photos are not clear.My suggestion is not to purchase this mobile, if you can bare 1000/- more, best choice is Redmi note9 or you can purchase realme phones with in this budget.I tried to return the product due to camera quality not expected, but return will not take return back due to quality issue for mobile phone.I purchased many Mobiles, but this is my first worst experience.So please don't by this mobile 🙏🙏🙏🙏"
1,"I bought Redmi 9 power blue (128 GB) in the first sale on 22nd Dec 2020.Amazon delivered it very speedy on 23rd Dec 2020.Reviews:1) Camera: Average for both front and back cameras.2) Sound: Good3) Battery: Drained very fastly, even charging is a bit slower, not looks like 6000 mah.4) Processor: slow processing and sometimes hang also. And touch is also responding slow.5) Games: I didn't try much yet.6) Weight: BulkyI bought it because of the camera but a little bit disappointed with it."
1,Front camera is very poor for video calling. Sometime screen goes totally white on video calling like hanging problems.Its looking dark face.Also battery is not according to expectation as 6000mAH. Battery showing 20% and suddenly goes 80%without charging.

1,Waste mobile
4,Good phone
1,Phone having bad quality and hanging issue and performance is very poor and bad camera quality and brightness over exposed in sun light
1,Non of the features they have mentioned match the phone.-Both Cameras are horrible.-The phone is laggy-Battrey back is horrible-Charge time is horribly slow for a 22W charger
1,Got a damaged phone .. plus Amazon customer service not helping on this .. bad product .. poor service by amazon ... please Don't buy ...
4,Purchased on 22nd Dec 2020.4 GB RAM 128 GB Storage Capacity.Mighty Black (Colour).Rs. 11998Included: Charger. Clear Case. Sim Tray Ejector. Documentation.About 17+ GB of Storage Capacity is utilised by OS and Pre-installed Apps.
3,"I bought this mobile on the first sale 22 Dec 128 gb version, coming to the phone the miui is the same we find in other mi devices which is the reason I bought the phone but one this which I miss the most in MIUI 12 is the absence of second space(why Mi ❓)Pros: Good battery, 48MP back camera and MIUi 12cons: front camera(my redmi note 5 does a better job), no second space, a bit bulky when you hold the phone"
1,"Battery do`t work as specified 6000 mah. worst camera result ever. even new theme or fonts don't work. battery drain to fast. very chip on weight,look,speaker,display many more, friends first time a request you to please do not buy this phone. company try to achieve their position high that's why they start to deliver this type of chip product to customer.  In my home 7 mobile is redmi but i never seen this type of chip mobile ever. i am so sad after purchase this mobile. I need to my money Back."
1,"Firstly got too late delivery from amazon, no response from customer care representative. The product is now totaly different like stock Android and cheap like oppo, Vivo Xiaomi lossing his market. Quality also not upto the mark. It gives low performance even many times the miui stop the apps. Very very bad feeling to order this mobile.On second day of delivery it stuck on bootAnd keep restarting again & again.lastly i had to format it and i lost my data of year &year.Shamfull xiaomi. DONT BUY xiaomi phone with MIUI 12 it is worst than worst"
5,Redmi mobile is having features what we essential requitred.I m very happy with the new model.So far it's very nice and value for my.Wil review after couple of days usage.
4,Its value for money but if you are a selfie person than no pictures are ok but not too good I love everything about it
3,"Average performanceEdit (after 1 year usage): no issues in daily tasks,While playing pubg and some calls it freezes and swithes off."
5,Awesome product. Like it❤️ 12k under best phone.Dual stereo speakers.Good camBattery backup ❤️💯Build quality 💯Design 💯Best choice 👍
1,Front facing camera is too bad....
1,Front camera on video call is showung dark face. Screen goes white like hanging problem.Battery goes 20%to 80% automatically.Its camera performance is very low.You can choose other option in same price like vivo.
2,"Front camera is third class. Rear camera's quality  is average.  Battary like  4000 mah. Wi fi, Hotspot,  Bluetooth touch key does not work properly.  There are no auto call record option and notification receive indicating  led. Only sound quality is very good. No return policy only replacement, so I am hopeless."
4,"Primary usage Suitable for battery, videos watching, storage 128GB like songs backup listening music offline with speaker HiRes 2 speakers one in top and one at bottom, splash resistant.If ur requirement is secondary like Camera 48mp camera with Snapdragon 662.Not for heavy games.Then its suits me well. 5 star.No phone for these specs at this price point."
2,"After a month use....Phone is just ordinary.  No effects of the memory options are noticed.  In fact it takes roughly 2 minutes to get to the main screen after power on.  Preloaded with 13-15 gb of system files and bloatware.  So you get to use only 49 GB effective storage place.The phone is like paying for our dish TV, you will be forced to watch a lot of advertising apps.A lot of personal information may be used, your mi id will be linked to phone, email, ip address, location etc.Earlier I used Lenovo p2 nothing of this, and was a great phone.Having said all bad things, the phone is good for sound, visual, and battery.  Camera is the worst part.If you are buying for a camera then this one is a bad choice.  Battery 🔋 and the sound is great.Too many bloatware, I suppose Redmi should pay attention.  Or we all should avoid the phone and the brand.Repair would be easy as Redmi has many service centers around the country.  Except battery and music I don't see any difference or advantage over other phones for routine activities.Overall very average phone 📱 which is priced on higher side."
1,The product is not upto the mark.It gives low performance even many times the miui  stop the apps and camera quality is also poor.
3,The product is very disappointed in the camera segment. Front and back both camera is worst. It is not as 48 mp camera .Battery backup is well as 6000 mah.only vedio can play up to 13 hours after that phone is dead.if you bye for a big battery only then you can bye this product.all so processor is not as helio g85.
4,"I have ordered blazing blue colur but i have recived black colour instead of blue,But still it is a wonderful phone at reasonable cost.Battery backup is awesome and camera is amazing.I highly recommend to buy this phone from these seller"
5,Chief and best
5,Nice phone
4,"The pros of this smartphone are1. fhd+ display2. good battery life ( 2.5 days+ if only used for calling and light use,  1.5 days for overall usage like YouTube, watsapp, google meet, music, calling and gaming)3. 18w fast charge and 22.5w charger in box ( 19 - 96% in 2 hours)4. less bloatware5. ufs storage6. Stereo speakersAnd cons are1) average processor.2) average camera. (Steady photos are very good but low light needs improvement)3) MIUI 12 is little laggy.4) little heavy.5) Speakers are not that loud but works very well.So only buy if you want good viewing experience, battery life , fast charging and 22.5 w charger."
1,Front camera 3rd class.
3,Just got the phone in hand and the phone started lagging the next day.1- Performance average.2- Camera Average.3- Bit heavy and bulky too u can feel that.4- Design poor or should i say worse.5- MIUI is worst.
5,"Value For money, Sound quality is Superb, display clarity nice, overall worth for it."
1,Friends don't buy redmi 9 power smart phone.Don't waste your hard earned money to buy such disgusting phone.Performance very badBattery life very badFast charging not at allCamera quality v v poor.User friendly not at all.This is my genuine review after using it.My had wasted my money you all plz don't waste your money buying this phone.
1,"After using for 10 days My genuine review.1.Mobile always hanging.If you open camera it will hanging automatically.If you open 2 tabs,it will hanging.2. Cameras response time is too late.3. Front camera waste. It's shows you black only.4. Battery performance gud.My old Redmi note 4 is best to compare this Redmi 9 power.""My biggest mistake buying this redmi 9 power""We need a solution from mi and Amazon."
2,It's a MARKETING TRAP...IT CLAIMS to have all the best feature but they performance is below average... it's has all the features but no quality....Only Pros1.Good quality FHD screen2.Battery backup is okay.3. Speaker quality.Cons1. Below Avg camera.2. It HANGS3. NOT A SMOOTH TOUCH.4. TOUCH LAGS need to tap button multiple times one gets irritate.5 . One feels cheated because we have better option in the same price range.Worst use experience. I feel my older 3 GB ram redmi 8a is more smooth than this.My recommendation always give priority to a better Processor.
1,"Please don't buy this go for redmi note 9 pro.Camera is very bad .I seriously suggest not to manufacture redmi products in India ,all the made in India of redmi is worst ..."
5,"Got the phone the next day within 24hrs of buying,best delivery by Amazon. Got discount on sbi credit card and extra 500 also- total price 7700Best phone with Snapdragon 450 on this price(Disclaimer-It doesn't has a finger print senser but i don't mind it as for day to day function it has face recognition and it's working fine )"
3,Battery is very good but the following problems arise in the very 1st day when the handset was delivered to me.Problems:1. When I got the phone I found light is coming out from the lower part of the display (this is known as bleeding screen problem).2. Due to this sometimes double tap and touch is not correctly responding.
5,Value for money..Nice look..Decent designGood in 10k range
4,Good budget phone.
4,"Not much to say other than it is a typical Samsung Galaxy model at this price range. For power users like myself, this is not the phone. But for casual purposes, it is ok. Touching seems a bit laggish, little more fluid response was expected from a phone running 3 GB RAM under the hood. Camera is average, some pictures look sharper, others look dull. Speakers are moderately sounding, not much crispier, but can go loud.Just one thing to say, if you like your phone clean, then don't buy (get a Android One) because this one comes with loads of bloatware (and I mean, loads). There are some apps you can remove, but most ones you can't remove, and they take up space real good. After buying and doing a 30 MB system update, my storage says 13gb already used out of 32 ! So, how can you save your HD videos and pictures? I have no idea. Display is good at this price. Lastly, phone is OK for casual browse, stream, music, done."
1,"Waste of money!! Very bad Quality of camera focus and image processing. It's not Max up Phone,  it's like ordinary Chinese 3rd grade product. People should stay away thinking it's a Samsung phone. The voice quality and reception is also poor very low volume of speakers as well. Its with LCD display poor quality of image, though brand claims  HD, infinity O display all are marketing gimmicks. Phone lags on even with 4GB ram, hangs on quite a lot of time. Overall,  not worth  for 10K range,  choose better phones."
1,Highly disappointed product from Samsung. No finger print security. Worst camera. Poor performance on touch screen. Only satisfaction is the 6.5 inch display.. Got cheated by trusting the brand name. I recommend not to buy this mobile instead go with other options in redmi or poco.
2,Phone is overall good for budget but you have to not accept anything from camera even basic phone have better camera than this phone. Also it's OK to old processor but screen is 720p TFT LCD SCREEN picture doesn't show sharp sometimes you have to wait sec to respond from screen. It's one UI is good but I am not fan of that. It has come with 7.5 wt slow charger it takes lots of time to full charge.I give him 🌟 🌟 star because its competitors have  better processor camera screen and camera.If you are fan of Samsung go for it otherwise don't.
1,"Very poor mobile,  camera  is of old school and need a steady had and steady image subject to get it capture clear. not at all good and phone have very low sound from speakers.  Also seceen is a bit dull compared to other brands similar products.If your aim is to call and message and need a samsung mobile then only buy this, otherwise waste of money😭"
2,"Very much average phone for this price, front camera is pathetic, you will only pixels on the screen in selfies as well as during video calls. Main camera is pretty average. I believe it may be the issue with the model that received so I have asked for replacement, technician visit is scheduled for tomorrow. Will update more after that.Update: As expected, technician mentioned its the branded phone (non chinese), at this price this the best you could get, though it may not be that good and below average)..So finally, If you are looking for better front facing camera, I think go with others models based on the reviews."
1,"Worst camera ever - For the back camera, it is said 13MP+2MP+2MP Triple rear camera setup, for this we would have expect atleast some normal level clarity. Look at the images the first images in the set is which I took on my Redmi 4 camera which I bought 4 years back and look at the clarity. And the second one is from this 13MP triple camera setup Samsung phone which is way beyond worst.Having shocked on the rear camera, I checked the front camera which is more horrible than this back camera. The photos are blurry and shaky as you can see in the images.NEVER imagined something like this cheap and poor quality from a brand like SAMSUNG. Immediately requested for Return.PLEASE dont buy this phone if you consider a good Camera on the phone."
1,"Anyone viewing this review. Plesse never think to buy this.Not worth for even 5000 rs.""Worst front and rear camera"" I have ever seen in a smartphone.Everything very cheap.Diplay quality worst.Charger worst.Wire length too short.Takes more than 5 hrs to full charge from 0 to 100.Camera is like old keypad phones VGA cameraSo many bloatware appsI don't know how Samsung can make such poor quality phones.Totally waste of many for a middle range smartphone buyer."
4,After using for two days here below is my feedback:Pros:1- Very good full HD display at this price2- No issue till now with the performance of the processor. Daily routine apps run perfectly.3) Huge battery nad super backup. You won't believe I have charged it once since I received.Cons:1- The phone is not compatible with 5Gz Wifi. This is surprising for me as it was expected to be included.2- 100% Charging will take more than 3.5 hours with the in the box charger which is 7W.3- The back cover had very chep built quality (Will have to hide it behind a cover for safety and scratches)
5,"I purchased 4gb ram and 64 gb model storage phone model at rupees 9499.00 during republic day sale. Phone is good in terms of ram, storage, display and battery. You will not get fingerprint sensor, amoled screen, decent camera and metal body but it is fine because phone's budget is also low and i would say it is better than other available model by different manufacturers. Overall great product."
4,Yes always M series is awesome.Good delivery by amazone thanks.But i bought this mobile on 1st day of sale and on 2nd day its price was decreased up to 500 rps Not fair from Amazon.But its ok overall good experience
1,"First - Ordered when at the begnining of sale and paid 500Rs more than current price.Second - I got defective piece as selfie camera was broken.Third - I was amazed to hear that they cannot refund money back, Amazon can only replace the product.It's worst experience with Amazon Prime."
1,"This is the worst phone samsung have ever produced. Camera quility is third class. You may get more valuable phone in this range from redmi. But it has really disappointed me. Please don't buy if you want a good camera.Cons:  1. Worst Camera  2. Screen stucks  3. Can't play smoothly free fire.Pro:  1. Big hd display  2. Sound is good  3. Battery is also good when you  compare with same range phones.Honest Advice: This phone cost 10,000/-. If you can add 2500/- more then Samsung M21 is the best budget smartphone that fits every need. And if your need for camera is very less then you can buy this phone."
3,"A good budget segment for the following users* attending online classes* Elders(above 55 age) who won't use phone very much and spend minimum time on Whatsapp, Facebook* Can play games like candy crush, subway surfers , clash of clans and other medium graphic games* Those who like to upgrade their old Oreo and pie OS phonesNot for the following users:School and college students who uses phone feasiblyPro gamers like Pubg and Call of dutyPros:* Large display and weightless* No heating problem on calls and long time usage* Call quality is good* Supports dual Volte* Plastic build and weightless* Decent battery capacity. Stands for one and half days for the above mentioned users* Decent cameraCons:* Average display.* 720p maximum support on YouTube videos.* Good speaker but not loud enough* No Corning Gorilla glass support, Tempered Glass and Back case are must to avoid scratches.* No finger print sensor. Only face unlock is available but it's responding slower than expected"
5,A very good and decent budget phone in this segment.Bought this on the republic day sale.Got this for a very good exchange deal.An upgrade after using my old phone for four years whose battery was dying and memory was getting full and was showing phone lags.A very good decent budget phone choice.Just go for it.Looks premium backed with excellant Samsung brand.
4,"Display is good, can get super bright clearity is good but the viewing angles could be better, not a deal breaker at this price (viewing angles 3.8/5). Rear Camera is good it can take good photos in bright light front camera struggles a little bit in good for video calls.Pro-good and Big display, processor is good for app usage. can play medium games, battery is super, usb type c , samsung service center and warrenty, light weight, screen to body ratio, notch is very good compared to othersCon- speaker should be louder but okay if you are hearing in quite place , rear camera is good for price gives great colour accuracy then my op6 frount camera should be better. Processing power is bit slow but no problem with app usages. Ram management need improvementConclusion it is a good phone you get what you pay."
1,"I would suggest no to buy it at all. The camera is pathetic, disgusting.Even a phn with normal camera would click nice pic than this.Video call image is blurry like vga camera. The touch screen  lags very much.Apps doesn't open instantly.Even 6k-7k phones of other companies  are better than this phn.Those who have used a 10k phone of other companies  earlier  will find it difficult  to get adjust with it.You can use this phone only for calls, for seeing time and used as alarm clock.I am sick of this phone.At this cost of 10k you would get very good phones of other companies."
4,"Good phone in cheapest price with all common features, camera quality also good, battery backup perfect ...."
3,"The product is not so good, though Samsung should have included the 5Ghz wifi option in this latest phone. Physical look is good, looks classy. Photos came out good. Though, I have not taken any night snaps. Battery is good, last charged about more than 24 hrs. while writing this review, still shows 62%, after moderate use. Not a gamer, so cannot tell about that part. I am 50 so for me this is good deal.After long usage, now for camera missing are slow mo, time lapse, night shots are just ok, to much of noise, recording is just ok. Its just an average phone, in this price range other manufacturers have included better camera options. Samsung should update camera software and include more options."
1,Camera - 2/10Battery -7/10Display 4/10No
1,Waste of money. Don't go with this phone better to go with some Chinese brands. For better performance
1,Zero stars - waste of 10k1.camera is bad2.display is not good.3.overall very very disappointed with the trusted brandname☹️4. Not even worth of 5k.5. Other brands are much better in this price.
2,"Not liked very much, product is below expectations.They saying it have triple camera only for show. Picture quality is very bad.Screen resolution is 720. I expected it should be 1020 as all smartphone giving this much minimum with this price.No fingerprint lock.Battery life is good.Screen size is also good.Face recognition mostly doesn't work.Why they show of lots of features when it mostly doesn't work."
5,Good in this price range.Looks is different. No camera bump is advantage.Hardware and camera is enough for basic needs
4,"Guys let’s keep in mind that it’s a budget phone and there shouldn’t be any over expectations from this, as I can see in some of the negative reviews. It’s a fantastic phone for the money that we pay! Speed, touch, camera, display and sound are all decent enough!  I would recommend this phone for the basic use for parents and students. If you are the one who  loads the  phone with multiple Apps, pics and videos...are a camera and speed freak...look for something else."
3,Prose:1. Nice look2. Big diaplay3. 4gb/64gb configuration at 9500₹4. Battery is satisfactoryCons:1. Display response is slow. While receiving call some times you have to touch screen 3-4 times.2. Fingerprint unlock option is not available. Which should have been included. Face unlock is given but with mask on face it won't work.3. Camera quality is below average. It doesn't bother me as I'm not fond of photos and selfie.4. Sound of speaker is low.
5,"Awesome Mobile at this price, Had no issues with my Mobile which i got delivered, First the camera looked Blurry while taking shots,I was schocked, but the processed image on video or picture in gallery was super good i dosnt look like a 13Mp camera, The mobile has no heating issues with day to day usage, Dont play Too Instesive games with this one,Display and aspect ratio is super cool and  it supports 15 W fast charging, not a lot of bloatware too, Face Unlock worked on low light conditions too, The seller delivered the mobile the next day itself was a surprise with normal delivery, Overall Perfect mobile if you are not planning to do heavy Gaming on this one... Redmi 9 has some good specs too But its build quailty comes nowhere near to this one and Redmi 9 Build quality cant keep up with the hardware it has prolly end in a Overheating mobile ,Satisfied with the purchase overall Hope this is helpful..."
1,"Editing review :After almost 4 months of use, the display has developed a flickering issue.Please note, the device did not fall nor the display has had any damage.Have tried factory resetting phone and also cleaning up system cache but to no Vail.The system stress test passes as well..Tried contacting samsung help centre but no response..Didn't expect such after sales service from samsung !"
1,He product is defective and has a display problem. Very disappointing.
1,Do not buy this phone... Samsung failed on my expectations.Replaced once due to phone camera quality issues. Phone failed on Amazon quality test software. 2nd replaced phone is also remotely inspected by Samsung customer care executive (remotely) and found faulty. Waiting for Amazon service executive visit for final report.
1,Main draw back of this phone is there is no finger lock option  & while calling its starts eco & you can hear ur own voice
5,"(This is my wife's account) I have been using the phone for last 3 weeks now. I am a moderate kind of user, love to use same phone for years and not much into heavy gaming. The phone is my 3rd Samsung phone over last 7 years. It functions very smooth and feels much more expensive in actual. I have compared the phone with my wife's M31s bought 3 months back and found reasonably good considering the price I have paid, 4GB variant @ Rs. 7600.00/- (Amazon discount + SBI card offer + 500 off from amazon coupon).+ve : Good performance for moderate users, absolutely no heating at any point of time, great battery life, overall excellent looks and built quality.-ve: Doesn't support HD - 1080p streaming, camera quality is fine for me but could have been better.Finally, if anyone wants a phone even in 10k price which would do justice to every aspect a smart phone is designed for and not a big camera lover, go for it."
1,"Read this before you buy1. No dual band Wi-Fi. It won't detect JioFiber 5GHz network. Only detects a 2.4GHz  Wi-Fi. All modern mobile and even a 8 years old iPad detects 5GHz network.2. No fingerprint sensor3. Though they claimed Headphone in description, it did not came in the box.4. Camera performs below average.5. Sound quality is not impressive."
4,"Overall performance of the phone is great. But camera quality is not upto the expectation redmi 9 prime has good camera quality at this price. Apart from camera , it's a good phone to buy at this price."
5,"As the product suggest. It has got a big screen and is worth watching binge in it.Battery backup is good as of now .The touch is smooth and doesn't  have any lag.Coming to the camera:Front camera is not that promising . It lags a bit.However,  I am happy with the back camera. The resolution l, wide camera and the clarity never let's you down.I haven't tried  playing a high resolution game yet.However basic game's,  like Candycrush, farmhouse, rail tycoon can be played in a jiffy.Coming to security, the phone only supports  pin,pattern and face recognition. It doesn't have finger print which is a small issueHowever  I loved the phones overall performance.  Strongly recommended"
3,Value for money. The rear camera is not that good. All apps auto updating always thereby new apps are not getting downloaded. Samsung recommended or China apps are getting automatically downloaded which is not needed. Battery life is ok and comes for 2 days at fully data on position. While in pant pocket the screen display rotates to landscape automatically even if auto rotate function is switched off. It will not come back to portrait if u held mobile vertical and u have to switch on auto rotate to make it normal. This is embarrassing
1,"I am not happy buy the mobile in amazon.Whats in the box:- Handset, Earphone, USB Cable, Sim Tray Ejecter, Pre-applied Screen Protector and Protective Case, Booklet with Warranty Card and Quick Guide"

1,There is no headphone in the box... unsatisfied 😟 disappointed ☹️
2,"It's an average phone. Quite on the pretty side. ONLY those who are looking for a budget phone can think of purchasing this one. The camera is very average, but the functions & controls of the phone are smooth. It's very lightweight - that's a plus!"
5,Its a really very amazing and a nicely working phone..the camera quality and battery is also very good🤩😊.liked the product very much
4,Nice phone value for money but in inbox there is no earphone and screen protector receive being a regular customer of Amazon i am  unhappy there was  clearly written that these items are included in inbox.
1,"when i ordered this phone , headphone is free with phone but received order without headphone"
3,i have recently bought this phone..on 18 may 2020.. delivery is good but there was no headphones in a box.features r awesome nd phone is working gud.but camera quality is bit bad.
1,Worst mobile . I never expect from oppo such a low grade mobile. Touch is not working. Phone hanging. No return and replacement option.  From Amazon I got bad experience. Don't buy this mobile. Waste of money.
5,"Nice mobile prices 12,450"
1,"Body sensor not working. Was late by 2 days to find out this defect and so could not use ""return"" option.Due to body sensor problem, phone display never gets off while talking and so when brought close to ear, buttons like mute, hold gets activated while speaking.The basic function, which is to talk to others on phone becomes troublesome. Everytime have to very careful of holding position to make sure phone is not touched on body. Hate this and feel cheated/dejected.Cannot return as well."
1,It is roadside product with dusty display. When called Amazon customer care she deny to replace item. Don't buy anything from Amazon. Amazon only sells defective items. I returned many items and this was very useless response. She also disconnected call.USELESS AMAZON
1,This mobile was used by someone else.I have got someone else's mobile.I am not happy for this mobile.I will not do return this mobile.Because the reason of I give gift for other person.
4,"Better to value for money , quality is as per shown ..And fast delivered by amazon."
1,Earphones not received in a phone box
5,"Oppo always exports premium quality mobiles. Let there be no such features like other mobile but i phone also doesn't export such features at high price, then?I have attached some pictures also you can check them incase you wanna see the picture quality.Hence you can buy this without any tension.Amazing mobile's camera and body quality and display is also good.Go for it I suggest. 😃"
5,Fantastic
5,The phone is excellent but if the front and rear camara should be high and should be their dark mode compalsary but it should be added fastly and should give ear phonesonly main default is not nice camara should be high because the less cost mobiles will take more tean agers so they do moor selfies so it should increase and oppo is the selfie expert but this phone no selfie expert camara for next phone it should increase .Imay think I will increase
1,This product received wrost.. In this item some useful applications not run..Order canceled but no cancelation status and pick up status updating by Amazon..No any contact provided by Amazon..Realy disappoint..
2,This product details said there is a earphone and screen protector.  But i didnt get that
1,Don't buy it from Amazon the return service of Amazon is very bad..disgusting they never think customer problem no one in call centre never call you return policy and service is very poor only benefit looking cite ... don't buy anything from amazon.. in future I never buy electronics items from Amazon... flipcart is most trusted than amazon
3,"I like the product. But as compared to my other phone Realme X2. I found the lag in processing in some of minor things also. It is having 6GB RAM then also the having some processing issue. I don;t like the product. Even after this specs, the things are getting lag."
4,Nice mobile in this Price 👌👌👌👌..
5,Very nice phone for Rs.12500/-
4,Nice product...but there is no C pin charger  thts only one prob in this product...
1,"i have received the waste and damaged products and i chasing the customer support from last 10 days no solution upto now waste of money on  amazon ,waste of time on amazon ,and i customer of amzaon from last 5 years and i am a prime member this is the services i am getting"
3,Headsets are missing in the phone box...where are the original headsets...its normally included in phonebox??
1,The phone lags a lot right from the box. You have to swipe 3-4 times. Apps get hung. Never seen such a pathetic phone.
4,"Good product  but as compared to Mi note 8 its not Good . If you want to rought use for bussiness purchase.. Provessor is slow , not for gaming. But want you tube and surffing it's usefull. Another all thing is good .I don't have time for upload pics , but this review is enought.Product is same as photos."
5,For the money an excellent phone. My usage is mostly for mail and messaging. Bit of browsing and reading. The battery lasts for two days in my use. I bought one and then I was very happy with it and I bought another of the same.
1,"Screen quality is very poor , camera is also nearly poor, all over the phone is worst. I ordered this phone by choosing the no cost emi option of Bajaj , but they are also taking the processing charges of Rs.174 on every instalment.So please don’t use Bajaj’s emi option for ordering this phone. Thanks"
3,Updating after 4month :-screen recorder not available..which is default function of every android now a days..-Charging draining faster but charging gaining very slower.-its not a 21st century phone .. so many basic features missing Day 1: experience:-Most important : it will not redirect the link into the present app in mobile .... It will open link every times in default browser..Eg: if I got any Facebook /insta /Twitter link and I already have installed these app then it will not asking me to get open with app instead it will redirect to browser and again I need to login... So so poor technology1.processor looks slow while setup and configuration my account data restoration as compare to redmi note 7 (same price older version phone than this)2. Camera quality is very low both back and front ...capture blurred images..not focusing the face even after setup manually.3.  Not value for money.. I think I made mistake to choose oppo brand .. I compare all the feature with redmi.. redmi looks far better than this..4. No front flash light available to click in night5. Looks slow to handle multiple apps compare to redmi6. Please don't buy this phone..this is so poor technology phone..
5,I have been an user of nokia 6.1 as it started to face issues I have opted for this one. After using premium phones like Xperia and Nokia I feel the fabrication is not upto to the standards. Helios processing a little slow.Banking apps a little stretched due to the size of the screen. Rest all a good buy.
1,"I couldn't like it bcoz of its poor water resistence quality.I bought it on Dec.2020 but the working system of this disturbed on March 2021,within a period of 2-3 months.It is great loss .It mars  the Credibility of the Company also.I wanted to purchase one more but the damage has spoiled my mood n faith.I want compansation for the loss.It would be of great support n credibility of the company if it exchangeg the mobile OppoA31,Mystery or mend it properly without my loss.If the company do this favour,it would be a gentl step towatds customer care n service as well as the establishment of strong credibility n capabilitu of the Company."
1,"1. Phone don't have type C charging2. Dual app not possible for all app like redmi phones3. Charger is normal 5v 2 Amp so no fast charging.4. Not for multi tasking people.5. Camera and sound average6. Processor and touch very slow7. Only 6GB RAM AND 128 GB ROM is good  in this phone.8. Also it's not showing dual 4G9. Battery is only 1 day at normal uses.10. Display dpi is also very low.11. Can be treated as entry level phone.12. WhatsApp Camera function is abnormal, don't waste money on OPPO A31"
5,Photo not clear 🙃🙃.. I'm not satisfy to camera... everything is ok...but camera very worst. .
1,"Distorted , voice quality bad . Cannot even retrun now."
1,Touch quility not goodCamera quility not good
2,Look wise phone is great. But it touch response is very slow. Pls don't buy this phone.
1,Very bad vCamera not expected
2,Worst Smart Phone in this segment pathetic battery life and camera quality is worst than what we used to have in old smart phones 8 years backOPPO is frustating already planning to exchange it with some other phone
1,I am purchess this mobile last month but this mobile not work properly this device is very hang and heating problem this mobile is waste of money.. don't buy thi device.
4,This phone is value for money and packed with all that you need out of a smart phone in this range.Battery performance is satisfactory.Cons: At time’s the touch screen does not respond quickly as time lag is experienced between a finger gesture and response from the screen.AI of the camera delivers artificial pictures.Conclusion: This is a good buying option in this range must go for it.
1,Touch screen not working as i have received used phone . Very bad seller
1,Very bad camera
1,I got it delivered on 9th march .I started using it from 15 March .Return date was 17 March.

1,Mobile is not working properly  facing hang issue
5,I've been using Oppo and so I like it . It's a decent handset for an affordable price. I'm not a heavy user. So this phone does he job for me. It's comfortable in the hand and is sleek.
4,Mobile is very nice as much as expected.....but one thing is its little strucking.....don't know how it works on later days

1,Phone hanged many times .I return it for replacement but not get back yet.Amazon shipping and replacement service is too bad. I uploaded a video....
5,"Loving the phone....Purchased with bank discount,6gb 128gb blue variant...i must say,it looks super awesome....having gorilla glass protection in front and back,it makes it even better....Camera is really cool,getting some decent clicks,just install google camera and the quality is much much betterBattery backup is quite good as well,just turn off dual 4g,dont use volte if not necessary,turn of auto start for apps which u feel are not required,keep miui battery saver turned on for better backup,keep gps off when not needed,just do small adjustments and battery will surely last longerPerformance is also great considering the chipset you are getting,infact u also get 4g+ which is not even there on redmi note 7 pro and would never come also....so internet speed,call quality,signal strength...everything is impressiveI must say,in this price range,this phone totally deserves praises from all....i hope i tried to cover all points and helped people to look for this phone as a good option for them...All the best..."
5,best mobile under 10000
5,Pros- batteryCameraPriceLookCons- delicate. So has to be handled carefully.It took 10 days for the product to reach.
5,"Excellent phone under 10,000. Specialy 18 watt fast chargers🔋🔌.....if your budget is 10k u must buy it without any doubt...👍"
5,Redmi note 8 is the best Smartphone under 10k of the year 2019
2,"Redmi has been a prominent smartphone brand which has given a quality product at a pocket-friendly price range. I have a lot of expectation from Xiaomi. I have used almost 4 of their smartphone in last 2 Years but truely disappointed with Note 8.I Won't use the complex word & would like to make the review very simple & to the point.The Negative things of Redmi Note 8 are:-(1) 😔 Battery drains very fast if you're using Wifi, low signal area & of course while gaming like PUBG & COD. Needs to recharge after 6-8 hours. But 18W Fast charging will help you to charge quickly but that doesn't solve the entire problem. (2) 😡 Can't disable pre-installed apps. Lots of annoying ads & Can't give these phone to someone new to android or smartphone (eg. Parents because of unnecessary ads & you need to be very careful to handle them). (4) 💥 Flashlight very poor ( Note 5 Pro, A3 & Note 8 Pro has better flash). (5) 👀 Unnecessarily forces to use location in all apps (which is most annoying). Why is Mi so much interested in our location? (6) 📷 The Quad camera works fine but zoom doesn't make much difference. Good for normal use & Justify the price segment. (7) 🤮 Everyone tries to make UI & Design as simple to operate but Xiaomi MiUi is so disgusting & difficult to operate. (8) 🤕 Apps crash here and there. I hope they will consider this in upcoming updates.(9) 🔥 Heating issue while charging the phone & while using it for even 30 minutes.⚫ Overall: It is a nice phone for average use but if you're amazed by its so-called features & you think that it can survive your high-end requirement then be aware it is not for you."
5,Excellent phone in this price point 👌👌👌
1,"If u are a WiFi user ....then pls don't buy this phone....I have received replacement with same problem.So finally I returned the phone ( as both phone have same WiFi issues)May everyone didn't notice the WiFi connectivity time .....I stay full time in WiFi ,so pls check how longer it stay connected to WiFi ..In my case after 2 to 3 hr ...WiFi shows unavailable until I restart phone."
5,Nice product ...India's No One. Brand
3,"King of budget phones, but 3 star because of very annoying add's. What the hell xiaomi thinking. They didn't given it for free i have paid for the device!Amazon delivery 5/5 (on time)Camera 4/5 wide angle is very goodDisplay 5/5Network 4/5Charging. 3.5/5 its taking aprox 2.02 min to  3 min if mobile data is ONGorilla glass5  3/5 (already got a scratch even after taking careFinger print  4/5 (not fast as other phone's)Face unlock 3/5  ( realme u1 is double faster)IR blaster works great"
5,This product is very good and very good quality thank you Amazon thank you so muchI am use this device 6 day very smuthly and very fast and fast charge charging time 1 hour 45
5,"I purchased it from redmi store. Its performance is awesome.Super clarity display, good battery backup, super loud speaker with thunder voice.... Etc.... U can buy this without thinking more"
5,"I got this device on 1st November 1 week before our famous Jagadhatri Puja in Chandannagar and this was my best purchase till date.Design:- First of all this thing just glows. The very first moment I saw this phone I was literally drooling. The back and froth Gorilla Glass back gives this an unmatched premium feeling in the hand.So classy so elegant yet so eye catching and charming. At least 5-6 strangers have asked me about this device. This phone is sure a looker.Camera :- The camera can give competition to phones that are 2-3x more expensive than this.This phone with GCam 7 just blows the competition out of water, nothing even comes close.The GCam 7 works on this device so flawless without any lags or stutters whatsoever it's pure magic just see the samples, straight out of the camera.The selfies of this device are even better than iPhone 7 , I compared them side by side and the selfies frrom this one have better dynamic range, better contrast and better depth effect. Night Sight too works like a charmGCam7+ Redmi Note 8=♥️🔥The addition of wideangle and macro are just cherry on the top. Wide Angle takes decent shots is good lighting conditions and you can take videos with the macro cam as well. Both does the job pretty well. I will give the GCam 7 link at the end🤗Display:- The FullHD+ screen, yes a FullHD+ screen in a sub 10K phone, the screen is bright, vibrant produces great colour and contarsts and watching YouTube videos and movies makes the experience so much better.Performance:- 665 is a very well rounded SoC it's running very well, without any lags or hiccups experienced till date and PUBG runs pretty smooth without any lags and stutters whatsoever and this doesn't heats up at all.Battery and Charging :- I have experienced about 1 and 1/2 days of battery backup with moderate usage and thanks to the 18W fast Charge it charges up 0-80 in around 75mins.Speaker:- The downfiring speaker is very loud and crisp you can literally feel air pumping out of the speaker in a bass heavy song and the speaker has a self cleaning feature too. The earpiece is loud crisp  and clear too.This phone media consuming to much better.Extra Features:-IR blaster ✔️Gorilla Glass 5 back and front great hand feel, premium built and scratch resistant✔️Self cleaning speaker✔️Wireless FM✔️P2i coating✔️USB C✔️Fast 18W charger in the box✔️Cons:- There are ads in the UI but a mere 5mins of tweaking and voila you will never see a ad in your deviceVery very difficult to get hold off one in these flash sales.Overall this phone is redefining what a budget phone can do, from a Great built quality with Gorilla Glass 5 on both front and back, with downright best camera in this segment, to the presence of great speakers, to the presence of P2i water resistant coating which gives a great peace of mind to the presence of IR blaster, Wireless FM to the presence of USB C this phone is a perfect from every department no phone even comes close.If your budget is within Rs 12000 this is the best buy you can buy just go for it✌️Fair warning:- After using the GCam 7 on this device you will have a difficult time switching to any other phone even 2-3x more expensive cause the picture quality produced by this phone is just lit.Get this phone asap and Install GCam 7 and let this perfect combo amaze you♥️🔥Thanks for reading this review if you find this helpful like this and have a great day."
5,"It took around 9 days to get the product delivered. It's a great phone. Battery backup is awesome. Fast charger is provided in the box. Front Camera isn't that great, but still, it's very good. Rear camera takes good pictures. Fingerprint is also very fast, but little bit slow as compared to my Realme 3 pro. Still fingerprint is fast enough. Also, the glass back is awesome. Overall a good phone. Got it for 8,999/-Also got Rs 100 Amazon cashback. It's a killer deal even in 9,999/-. Just go for it."
1,I have purchased redmi note 8 at 25th October and within 8 days Dust particle accumulated in camera lensDon't buy!!!!!!!!!!
5,Purple is too good.
1,"Very Bad experience with this 😞 phone quality for Camera , Internet speed, and Battery. Camera quality is worst, it's not even 12mp camera. Charger is not charging fast, it is taking 2 hrs to get full charge.Never buy a phone before read a review by certified buyers. You tube people making false video for marketing of phone brand so never trust on you tube videos."
5,"You may miss such like a worthy mobile in just 13k, if you don't buy. Awesome product. Be hurry to purchase."
5,Best smartphone under 10k
4,Nice budgeted Phone:Some points as per my opinion: (out of 5)1-  Battery Backup 5/5.2-  Camera 4.5/5  (Micro Lense is use)3-  Display - 5/54-  Sound Quality - 5/55-  Fingerprint Unlock 3/5 (Small size fingerprint unlock)6-  Face Unlock - 4/5 (Little Slow)7-  Performance - 5/58-  Looks - 5/5 (Premium Look)9-  Weight - 4/5 (Feel heavy)10-  Gaming Performance - 4.5 / 5
5,"Pros- (1)- Super premium design  (2)- Glass 5 back and front, that's  why phone looking dashing.  (3)-403 PPI density make display good.  (4)-Fast Finger unlock as well as face unlock.  (5)-Battery back also awesome 2 days for normal using  (6)-fast processor makes phone great while  navigating.  (7)-No words for camera , can take profession picture powered by Macro lens.  (8)- Purchased this phone without any confusion and headache.  Cons-- No cons no negative comment for this phone in this price range, This comment provide after using  Galaxy note 8, samsung M30s , nokia 6.1 Plus,"
4,Good not much better as expected the heating problem is facing and fingerprint is also not work properly sometimes and ...battery also draine fast but it has fast charge so it can be charge fast ..if u buy go for realme mobiles

1,"Network connectivity is too low and battery backup is not good ,camera quality is not that what they show in add, very dull with least details camera picture"
5,Best Smartphone In This Price.
5,Very good product and camera quality is extremely good
4,"If you are planning to buy Redmi Note 8, check my experience as followsPro's :1. Camera: 48 MP Quad camera gives well exposed output. Note 8's camera is one of the Best in under 10k price segment.- It also have ultra-wide, macro depth sensor.- Front camera is also great.- Capable to shoot 4k 30 fps, slow motion 120 fps.2. Snapdragon 665: which is handles daily to day multitasking pretty well.3. 4000 mAH Battery: easily lasts for a day,18 watt charger included inside box which helps to charge mobile fully in 2 hours.4. Notification LED.5. IR Blaster.6. Dedicated SD card slot.7. Headphone jack.8. Gorrila glass 5 on front and back.Con's:- When playing PUBG with high settings, sometime it lags with frame drops.Verdict:If you are looking for phone for daily use with amazing camera quality, then Note 8 is right choice for you.But if looking for gaming then don't buy this one."
1,Camera not good. Bad performance . Battery  charging very slow . I don't like this product.
1,"The phone has major touch glitches. After trying at least 3-4 times, got this phone recently. All the excitement of receiving a new phone vanished when the touch started acting up. The phone shudders and starts operating on its own without even touching it. The camera features are quite good but the phone should be made stable first. Disappointed. Don't buy in flash sale. Their testing process is still going on."
5,"i purchased redmi note 8 in first sale on 21st october i am very happy with the performance and build quality is really great  redmi gave 18w fast charger in box i am very happy the price. (key specs) processor snapdragon 665,4000 mah baterry with18w fast charging,quad cameras (8+48+2+2),13mp selfie cmaera,6.39 inch fhd display,fingerprint sensor face unlock i am giving some picture sample taken by redmi note8 if u want a good phone at price of 10k then take redmi note 8.  please like my review"
3,Every thing looks good except camera.#After zooming photo black spots found on face. You can see it on sample pic.#Tuch is little bit slow.
1,Ok Google feature is not supporteing.Showing language ia not supported in access with voice match setting for all languages....So u can't use ok google.
1,"Only reason I bought it, it's supports dual app asAs of now Realme clone supports phonepe and many more so.....Before I buying it I guessed it could have battery have issue. Now I am facing the same. As Redmi 4000mah is not enough to run a fhd mobilesmoothly a day. This is same with Redmi note 7s.Now about the camera, sound, display , charging speed, all are good.My old Realme 1 has good battery life than this.I hope you got a little idea about Redmi note 8You can buy it . If you love Redmi .In one word I also love this mobile as it comes with a full loaded features and prices."
1,Lot of issues with the phone software. Loads of unwanted stuff on the phone. Screen is very bright in the night and even the lowest setting does not work well. Google Assistant does not work. Voice activation for Assistant does not work. Xiaomi does not have answer for it. No point getting a phone and struggling with it. Better phones available.

4,"Good one under 9k, Detailed review after using a week"
4,"A reasonably decent mobile. Overall an extremely good mobile. Gifted to my mother. Not sure if someone is camera Creek, then how they would take it, as that was not my criteria. I liked the mobile being already seen and handled One plus 7T and Samsung M31. This is a good one in 8990 bucks.Update: Working fine even after 2 odd months. Good battery, stays up to more than 1 day upon routine use. Light weight. Dont compare it with high end mobiles though."
3,"Product is only valubale for calling and browing ,apart from that it is not able to handle high backup apps.even it got hanged when iam using facebook app.So kindly look before you buy ,regaring the data you are going to handle on this mobile ."
1,"Super slow...Open camera and the entire sunset is over...Apps close on its own...Paytm app closes before otp arrives...multiple attempts...Totally useless phone...Can not exchange this phone...you won't get option of OPPO A11K when you choosing a new phone...Further, the IEMI number does not exist...Amazing right???That's what I got..."
1,"I purchased this phone online from Amazon... since the day I purchased it, it never worked properly... i updated the operating system, i updated all the software and with all this the performance even degraded and started hanging. I did Factory Reset but the phone keep hanging on and goes Black-out in between any application.The phone is a very cheap quality and horrible product. the ratings on the website are fake and misleading. Now after 8 days even the vendor has disagreed to replace it."
3,It is a budget and decent smartphone. But it has little slow performance as compared to other budget smartphone in this price segment. Overall performance is good. Camera could more better as compared with other smartphone.

1,OPPO not giving a genuine service. They don't trust the buyers. In my opinion they selling mobiles to... come back to there service stores. After 1 month my a15 OPPO Mobile suddenly turned off. The service section said touch and screen not working. They asked rs.3200 to change. I never droped my mobile and there is no physical damage i asked for warranty they opened and showed me inside there is a liquid problem i said I never droped mobile into water then how it happens. After 30 min no warranty coverd if you want pay the money to change screen. Even without any mistake from coustomer they blaming and saying some technical issues. If there is a mobile internal problem what we can do. The same day before me almost 4 coustomers said same problem mobile suddenly off.Finally OPPO A15 MOBILE IS A FAILURE SET. AND OPPO NOT PROVIDING  GENUNE TRUSTED SERVICE.
1,Very disappointed! The phone worked good for 15days of time and then touch is not working t all ! My return period I have crossed. And touch sense is absolutely a disaster. Never had such experience from Amazon and the return policy was only for 8 days that is disgusting!!!!

1,The product just overheating.. it is unbelievable from such great company production devices.  Here the cost does not matter but product quality is matters.1. builtin Alex is not working2. Average camera3. Overheating.I have been one plus 6t device since 2.5 so far single problem face.. I just upgraded to one plus 9 but it seems to be the worst decision. I did it as I am feeling now.
1,"Just got d phone today... frm day 1 too much overheating issue... Not possible to use...Also battery issue, 20% battery drained out in 15 minutes..."
4,One day delivery. Very fast. Kuddos on that.The phone is amazing. No complains so far. 3 days of heavy usage to check battery camera music everything.Would definitely say one of the best cameras. Sound could have been louder but not at all bad. Battery is excellent. Interface touch smoothness WOW.Didn't give 5 stars as always scope of improvement. But overall go for it. Remain a one plus fan
1,SENDING USED PRODUCT TO CUSTOMERSI BOUGHT IT WHEN I OPEN GALLERY 100 OF IMAGES ARE THERE ALSO MINOR SCRETCHES ARE
1,Oneplus is cheating us on 5gLook at the price 55000Don't go blindly friendsInstead Oneplus i am choosing Samsung
1,Network performance not good  and camera performance very Bad compared oneplus 9 and Samsung a71 both  are equally  and one plus 9 price to hight
1,"Strange change in features, automatic call recording feature has been withdrawn. Returning the phone"
1,"Dear Buyers,I bought this phone for my younger brother as his birthday gift. I was outside the city when I got this delivered to him. He was facing issues with this phone from the first day, but he didn't inform me since I gave him a gift and didn't feel like complaining about a gift. It's only after I met him I came to know that :1. This phone has serious heating issues. Gets so much hot while charging that a human hand can't hold it.2. Battery Draining issue. The battery doesn't last more than 5 hours after 100% charge with normal to low usage. If you keep the phone and stare at the battery percentage, you can actually see it going down in front of your eyes.3. Overrated camera. The amount paid for this phone doesn't justify the quality of the cameras, and the entire thing is overrated.4. I would clearly recommend buying an iPhone 11 instead. Way better battery life, camera, durability and software experience.I tried returning the phone immediately, but amazon did not accept the return and asked us to run some tests. On running the test they advised that the phone is perfect and we might be not using it right. Beautiful isn't it? And now we are stuck with this worthless heating brick."
5,"- SD888 - Superfast Processor- Real feel of 120 Hz Fluid Display- Charging - 0-100 in 35min !!!- Battery Usage: Screen on 120Hz (  Total 4 Hours ) : (2 Hours screentime, on wifi, video streaming,  including 30 Min Call Of Duty gameplay = Battery dropped from 100 to 70)- High-quality speakers ( Really Loud !! )- Decent Cameras - ( Don't expect too much Hasselblad hype )- Clean and Smooth UI - Oxygen OS."
1,This product is not worth the price. I have to return it. It heats a lot and camera quality is also not good.
1,i received mobile today on 21/04/2021 i chrged the device full and within 2 hour the battery percentage came 70 perctenage and i dont thin it will last all day
1,"Camera is not really great, battery draining too fast,i didn't expect this from one plus, loudspeaker for calls is not so high ,u can't listen if there is disturbance outside, but speaker for music is awesome effect, need to improve many things, battery is heating too much while using camera or for using in hot sun, u should improve this,if u lift ur phone from rest,all mobile shows fingerprint scanner to unlock,but one.plus is not showing that ,u should double tap or press the lock but it annoying for this, typing has also become difficult for me compared to my old mobile, sliding is also not good if u use this while texting, first it was to take about 50min to charge fully,now after 4 5 days it's taking 30 35min"
2,"Positive - phone is fast, no hang or lag, smooth operations and usageCons -Below average camera qualityVery bad battery performance. The bettery drains like anything, you feel the anxiety while using.I was not able to write the review of this phone for almost 4 days after the launch, clearly shows amazon and oneplus wanted to trick people buying this.Conclusion - not worth buying"
2,"Initial review after 2 days of use.Look and feel is great.Function smoothly without any lag.Faced heating issues even if slightly overloaded, big disappointment.Warp charge works very well, however battery is draining faster than usual.Camera is good on first impression, yet to explore more.Overall, doesn't looks like a good deal considering the price.---------------------------------------------Further reduced the rating to 2 star after extensive use of 2 months.1. Phone keeps heating even while not in use and background app restricted.2. Phone heats while charging and disable many features until temperature comes down.3. Hassalebald has only given name, seems like just another ordinary camera.4. Charging was good initially but after updates it takes more than an hour to fully charge.A basic 15k smartphone can be easily compared to this so called flagship killer. Strongly not recommended to buy."
1,"हर्षद मेहता की तरह चुना लगा दिया,हेसल ब्लेड का कैमरा बोल के । कभी मत खरीदना3 घंटे मैं 100 परसैंट बैटरी खत्म"
1,"This is the first time I am very disappointed with One Plus. We have three One Plus models and were very happy with the build, performance , camera etc. But this time One Plus 9 series disappointed. Firstly, heating issues and while switching on the mobile for first time the touch was not working at all."
5,"First things first the display is awesome with excellent brightness, Camera is top notch with 8k recording at 30fps and 4k recording at 30 & 60fps. 4500mah Battery is a beast and charges within 20mins atmost and it lasts easily for about 24hrs for a normal usage. I used the mobile for a whole day for gaming,video recording,with mobile data & WIFI on alternatively and still after 24hrs battery balance is 37% . Multi Threading is ultra smooth in this mobile as mine is 12/256 gb version and neva gets slow in any circumstances. These are so far my observations for the past 3days of my mobile usage. As of now there are no flaws with this, will update if any. Final verdict is flagship killer,if you can afford dont look back n  go for it..."
2,After usage for 2 days I am writing the review ...Heating issues are significant not even able to click pics while heating..Battery discharging Faster ..not lasting for even 8 hrs with moderate usage..Overall Not satisfied..Not expected such issues from one plus Premium phoneAmazon customer care are not replacing it.. Feeling cheated!! Waste of Money!!
4,"One plus is always good in terms of performance, display and charging. This model is marvellous in terms of charging speed. Battery backup is decent when you are using 120 Hz refresh rate. OS is very clean but you will not get many customised option as it is like a stock android. Call recording function is useless but it is privacy policy u can't blame OP for this.Camera is not as hyped by OP , hasselblad is ordinarily working. Still camera is good enough since last versions. May be future updates will do much better as hardware specifications are good enough. Front camera is ok type they must have given atleast IMX 586 in that. At this price, when u are getting SD 888 , very fast charging, Sony IMX 689 and 766 sensors, this price is good. But they should have given OIS, more 5G bands.People say that wireless charging should be given like in overseas versions. What is the use 15 watt or 30 watt wireless charging when you getting 65 watt charging. Wired charging is much quicker than wireless. So wireless charging under 30 watt will be worst.Vivo X60 or Pro may be better in terms of camera but still they are using SD 870 only. Just 33 watt charging. They are using Sony IMX 598 only.  Somewhere you are getting better but u can't beat this in terms of batter charging and performance.No heating issues I have faced when used this almost 3 hours. Design is ordinary dont look like a flagship, Color is good. Extremely light weight and handy to use.It is good to buy."
1,"The product just overheats and Battery drains in few minutes, Totally not worthy..."
1,"Guys my humble request...pls don't purchase this one plus 9.. Very worst.. Didn't expect from one plus...1. Within a 10 minutes of using getting OVER HEATING.2. CAMERA is worst.3. Network issues( • while connecting with Wifi, not getting a proper speed wic wifi having 150mbps. In this mobile we getting only 189kp. •Mobile network also worst.)4. Call is getting tooo lag..5. Look of the phone is very average.6. Screen clarity is gud.7. Builtin alexa is working gud.8. Sound clearity is gud.9. Overall worst phone at high price.10. Dont go for this one plus 9Thank you"
1,Over priced phone..very ordinary look..not amoled screen..OIS is a must in today's time which even every ordinary phone is providing. It is not expected out of a flagship phone.One plus !! You were always known for value for Money phones. I would expect you to provide OIS and good 5G bandwidth atleast as a update in future.
1,Sound is not coming through Bluetooth headset for this device
1,"One plus lost its credibility after one plus 9 release.One plus 9 is only hype and worth for the money you pay .One plus 9 is having plastic body like other substandard mobile in the market .One plus 9 does not have wireless charging for only products available in India .One plus is having only two cameras where as one plus R and one plus is having four cameraOne plus 9 is having 5G band - only two 5G bands. The customer care has been fooling us that it will upgrade to 4 5G band. Later on it has confirmed by one plus communication that the software upgrade will not enhance 5G II bandS to IV BANDSI am one of the admirer of one plus product quality  .However , it has diluted after the new release of one plus 9.What for we are paying ??????"
5,"Hey .Today I'm gonna review the Oneplus 9 5G .Ask me any questions you have directly , and I'll try to answer them all. 🙏Okay so let's start :The phone looks quite good , its thin but a bit less wide , I use an iPhone 12 Pro Max , and it's around 1-2 cm less wide . Not a big issue .Screen is fluid , no problems at all . I have used oneplus 7T so I've trust over this brand .Battery :The 65 watt charger does what it's meant to . The cable is a USB C To C . Not the old usb to C . Charges in around an hour .Camera :In my opinion , the biggest selling point is the camera here . Looks good , with a tinge of extra saturation . Way better than the older ones . Gives a lot of independence too .PUBG :ALot of people buy oneplus devices for games , and comparing to my iPhone , this device gives a good competition . 90 fps is an advantage over apple , but rarely devices give 90 fps , maybe in tdms but not in classics . No lag , but you will see some frame drops , but which device doesn't have frame drops ! Even the iPhone does .Competitors :I needed to purchase this for my mother , so Need to share why I went for this .There's IQOO , Asus and Oneplus in this range which are worth buying . I have been using one plus so I trust them more , they have a local service center too , something which I lack in my iPhone experience .I don't trust vivo much , IQOO is a developing brand , it's op for sure , but still couldn't gamble . The Oneplus gives better cameras than any other , which is the main reason I got this , as camera usage is a lot .People with similar budget with just gaming budget can go for rog , but if you need a family phone , this guy packs nearly everything .*You also get stickers and a red cable club card , which is something I like .CONS :Oneplus really needs to deal with the software issues . There's always some thing left to patch after the release , which sucks .The dialer has that annoying annoucement during recording , and that really can make you go deaf XDOverall , could go for rog if needed a gaming phone , but since a lot of my family members use this device , I went for one plus .Thanks for reading , I hope I helped you :)"
2,"The OnePlus 9 Software is a real Downer! If you're like me, then you would have gone by with the OnePlus 9 reviews and marketing press releases! Truth be told - Even after the update the phone has major flaws in software in the Alarm setting and interface! At the price charged the Camera is a real Downer! I feel cheated. This was to be a phone I could trust and hold on to for good,sadly now I need to possible buy another brand and chuck OnePlus for good! OnePlus is this ethical? You're marketing was just hype!"
5,"888 is way too fast.65 watt charging is awesome.120hz display is buttery smooth.Ram and Storage are also very fast.Rear cameras are awesome, best in this price segment.Front camera is very average (didn't liked it).Battery backup is also average, but the charging speed cover it all. If you're a moderate user you will get whole day backup.Oxygen OS is just amazing. It's the cleanest UI I've ever used and have lot of customization features too..No heating issue faced till now, it just became a little warm(very little) in booting. Other than that I played Asphalt 9 and COD mobile they were buttery smooth.Final rating from my side 9/10. ( One marks less coz take a lot of selfies but selfie camera turned out to be a disappointment for me).Go for it, awesome device, you will love using it."
5,I am using this phone from last 5-6 days. I listened very much about heating issue but after using this phone I am saying you truth I am also getting this problem but after updating the latest updates you will not goona face this problem again. But if you are working in direct sunlight for more than 1-2 hour you will get message of high temperature but in 2-3 minutes it will restore to normal.so here Is truth and phone is really amazing
4,"Using since past 3 days, good speed . No lags when multiple apps are opened. Amazing battery life, single charge is enough for more than a day. Wrap charge is superfast. 20 min for 45% to 100% charging. Camera's are good. I was using LG G7 ThinQ before. One plus 9 camera is not as good as LG. But still works well. Will post more update after a month usage."
2,"It doesn't match the quality that I have come to expect from OnePlus phones. I am graduating from OnePlus 6t. And definitely not expected based on the money you end up paying. There is nothing really special in the camera, atleast one doesn't notice a visible change except for the filters. The phone heats up like crazy even with simple operations like a video call (even after the latest Software update). Battery life is decent but not super sturdy as you would expect in a new phone, I can see this becoming a problem in the months to come.The good things are the performance, the gesture control, the ease offered by OnePlus switch."

1,I am using OnePlus since 2019. Just for the upgrade I bought OnePlus 9 5G but after all not a good option and not much happy with phone performance. Facing a lot of issues like-Heating issue is too much.battery life is not so good.Taking too much time while chargingCamera quality is average.
5,Excellent mobile . Charging is up next level. Super quality.
5,Product is good and provides similar performance as shared by one plus for 12 Gb Ram 256 Gb ROMAfter using one plus 7 pro and looking at 8 series I expected very little changes in 9 buy this cross my all expectations .Gaming.mode does not give any glitches or pixel issues .. performance is very good . Although battery gets drained but that depends on type of usage .Over all camera performance is best I have observed in this segment and Hasselblad camera breaks boundaries viewing clarity
4,"People should've waited for the updates. Phone has improved alot and still recieving updates.  Battery lasts for 1 day, its subjective. Depends on usage.  Fast charging🔥Camera puts out great quality if you turn on High Resolution from top.No heating issue now, everything is sorted. But camera needs alot of improvement it's slow in clicking.But to be honest there's nothing you'll hate about the device, You are paying this much for the camera and the OS. For camera prefer the Pro bcs of OIS. OP9 has stabilisation mode but not that effective. Great phone, if not camera go for the 8TBattery update- Initially you won't see good battery life, bcs new device takes time to understand your usage pattern and then it optimises the phone. 1st day 10% dropped in 15 mins. But now 10% drops in almost 45-60 mins. Decent battery+ Crazy charger= Satisfactory 1 day usage."
5,"I m oneplus phone user from a long time. I have used oneplus 3,6, 7T pro and now this. I m writing this review after using it for 2 days.Received phone 1 day before promised date. I bought this phone at 51999₹ with SBI credit card.Phone box contains phone with applied screen guard, back cover, charger and C to C cable for charger. You can't connect this phone to your laptop if you don't have C USB port in your laptop. You have to buy C to USB cable. Luckily I have one from my old phone.Phone is light is weight w.r.t. 7T pro which is a plus point for guy like me who carries the phone in front pocket. Also the screen size is appropriate, not too large and not too small.Phone is slim like one plus 6 and screen is flat and round at the edge like 7T pro. Front camera is not at centre, which I don't prefer.Battery looks good so far. Charging from 5% to 90% in 20min. I m using phone continually for last 2 days and I have to carge the phone twice. So I would say it's plus.I m not a game person but played game to check it's performance and found better than last phone.Cameras are really good. Both front and back camera are best. I m not a photographer but for amature like me it does job more then required.Cons for me:-1. No USB to C cable for laptop connection2. One plus phone app is not there, phone is using Google phone app, same goes with messaging app. Which is may be due to inbuilt Alexa.3. Heating of phone while charging and while using for long time, but that's what u expect when u have this much large battery.Overall really good phone within its price range with flagship brand."
2,"Average phone, esp given the hype given to it prior to the launch. Not at all a value for money. Prefer samsung or an iphone.Even lower priced phones from Samsung have far far better camera than this one.It is ridiculously over priced with the value it provides.Only positive is a wrap charger. Other than that it is an average phone.Speaker - 👎🏾Camera - 👎🏾👎🏾Pricing - 👎🏾Battery & charger - 👍🏾"
5,"AFTER ONE MONTH REVIEW1.Camera is great.I)OIS is not an issue as youtubers were saying.2.Neither overheating, temperature remains as it is on other devices it's just software glitch on apps like ampere3.gaming is so smooth that you will need few days to get used to (Cod Mobile,Pes2021,Kof, Pokemon go) even if you're pro.4.80percent battery can last 4-5 hours screen on time and 8-10 hours otherwise.5. Stereo speakers are good6.Screen quality is far better than previous OnePlus devices, Looks like samsung device from front because of samsung screen.7.Price is 6k -8k higher Just because of hasselblad logoOverall great phone go for it"
1,"I have been a OnePlus user since the original OnePlus. Never have been so much disappointed in a phone than this one.The first piece I bought - the battery heated up to 43 degrees and I couldn’t hold the phone. Got it replaced in the off chance that I had received a faulty piece.The second one - similar issues. Worse, the battery backup is pathetic. What use is a 30 min Warp charge if 80% of the battery drops down to 30% in half an hour of normal usage.Cons - Heating issues, pathetic battery life.Pros - None that just such a price point."

5,"This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt."
5,"Best camera, very good battery life, eat body material, average weight, best performance,  best display."
1,3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera. In very disappointed  with this kind of front camera. Need refund.
1,"Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom."
1,"The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller."
1,"I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.Face unlock very slow.Heat issue which charging and heavy usageFull charge takes more than 3 hrsWould not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phonego with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality"
1,"Software is no working. No sounds in media, cant attend calls, every 5 mints phone gone to switched off and even though no retraining option."
2,"Phone camera is not good , samsung says it's 64 mega pixel but its photos like 8 megapixels .photo detailing are not good  . Also processor is not Upton the mark it's some time slow and hang in multi function use . While using keyboard , keyboard hide automatically for 1 second . My mobile variant is 6 GB 128 GB. Don't waste your time and money ."
1,"Camera front is worst, not up to the mark. Waste of money. ,"
3,Not a Samsung performance. It seems it was launched without proper test n trials. I already had M30 so decided to buy M31 (6GB). But got shocked to see the poor performance n battery life. The 64MP images can't be sent easily to someone on WhatsApp. Camera give errors now n then. Battery life worst then M30 which has 5000mh. Mobile heats on charging.
5,Mind blowing  camera real monster battery look awesome and fist first launch first hand
1,I purchased this phone by seeing 64 MP for camera usage but M31 was the worst phone with camera quality.. Front camera is 8 and back camera was 16 MP not more that that.. there is no return option only replacement(Good game was playing by samsung &Amazon) please dont buy this mobile and dont waste your money... Heating problem while charging.. etc  i am really  very frustrated with this phone quality.. i lost my money by buying this phone..😔😔😪
5,"1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍"
4,"HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks."
1,"Not satisfied with the qualityDisplay quality is no adequateBody is made of plastic like materialI was using MI like 6 plus pro then 7 plus proFor a change I have purchased this product, the quality is not up to the mark when comparing to my old redmi note seriesThe sound quality is very worst.While making call with full volume it is not clear from the day of purchase.I am planning to go back to MI againWorst phone pls don't buyNot value for money"
1,Phone is very slow my opinion is west ur money
1,Average
1,"I purchased this as soon as it was launched and its one of the worst decision that i made. Selfie camera is blurry and clicks yellow pictures, phone lags in playback video, all of a sudden, video will disappear and only sound continues to play, back camera isn't that great as hyped, its very low in quality, body of the phone is more like a plastic and very low quality material, overall very dis-satisfied with the product. Amazon has agreed post diagnosis saying its a faulty piece  but does not give refund"
1,One of worst mobile and one of the worst brand. Better to purchase any other brand except Samsung.1. Heating issue2. Second sim works on 3g.3. Even its 6Gb ram works like 2gb ram phone.When I called amazon customer care they said I have to go to service center for this and they are telling to check through app.Its a f***ing phone please please please don't waste your money.And this is my last ever purchase from amazon.
2,"Cons:Button position (power& volume) too highFingerprint reader too highHeats up a lot.Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours & 28 minutesSpeaker volume low.The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls.Pros:Feels lightweightNice display.The camera is decent.Update 1:Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer.Update 2:Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement.Update 3:Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality. I have to put the call on 100% volume to be able to hear at least a bit."

1,"I bought this mobile in last Friday , it is not working from 6th day.  Unable to receive calls and if unexpectedly I received a call not getting  sound and I can't here the opposite person voice or my voice to them. When I try to call someone automatically network is getting disconnected and it's reconnecting automatically in few minutes. I expect this might be  software issue , I have gone through lot of reviews ,maximum number of people who buyed this mobile facing this issue.Unable to replace the mobile also as it is not showing any option to me."
1,"Worst mobile was I got , Samsung m31 taking more time for charging 100% , it's almost 4 hours for charging , and after that 20 hours battery I'll train 0% its waste of time compare to other fast charging mobile , and camera worst"
2,"I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed!I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung!I so miss my POCOFirst the pros1. The brand name - if you think it is one!2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos4. Build - seems decentCons:1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates meAnyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me nowWhat a waste of Money this has been"
5,Received it on time within 24 hours thumps up to amazon. Now Product. Done all the settings. I am using samsung after a long gap of 8-10 years. After Samsung Grand I had stopped using. So setting done now data transfer Samsung's smart switch option is fantastic. Everything I wanted to transfer got it. No problem at all .Now SIM transferred. Done OK it is dual 4G VOLTE and above all it is having separate slot for micro sd card. Effortless working.Now Camera. It has got lot of options. All I have not yet tried but for sure I have checked the quality of the photograph and the night mode is superb. What else you want to know rest of the things are written in detail and is true. Working very fine. Proud to won it. Nice Product. Samsung should keep competing iPhone
1,"What is this samsung,i didn't expect from you.plastic body is ok we can use cover.Corning gorella glass 3 is ok we can use tempered protection.Even 3 hr charging time is ok we can charge during night.But Overheating how can we deal with them !this price range other companies providing super fast , cool processor like snapdragon 730G.& What you do fooling customers."
5,Nice phone in this price range
2,"Cons:1. RAM. Claims to be 6GB, whereas my 2year old phone with 4GB RAM has much smoother display2. Battery Charging. Claims 15W fast charging. Takes more than 2 hours to charge the phone.Pros:1. Good cameras2. Perfect screen sizeI bought it as a great deal from Samsung, but it is a BIG dissappointment. And they say it cannot be returned. Total waste of money for me. Redmi Note pro 8 is much better than this at same price."
2,"1) claims 21 hour of internet usage timing, i started using it after 100charged  but it barely last for 24 hour with 5 hour of heavy usage and even turned mobile in bettery saving mode.  so what is the point of carry that much heavy 191gm device all around.2) phone heats a lot while its charging ,like you can't even touch it at some point.3)internet bandwith speed in mobile as well as in wifi is not good. i had a samsung galaxy note3 where i get fast internet with same network. wanted to return this device but they had a very strict policy so you cannot return, you can only replace it.  even i am trying it for replacement it wont let me as i have to download balencco app and this app never say your phone is not working fine. i could have spend my money in buying other phone.bought on very first minute of release but al excitment turned down after seeing actual performance."
1,"i am a Big fan of Samsung products, but today i got a dead phone, first i thought it don't have charging so try to charge the phone but no response,i am really really disappointed today. but thanks to amazon the responded quickly and ordered a replacement. but now i am worried about phone performance now. how i am going to handle if future same problem arises. before buy think again."
1,"Worst experience ever, camera quality not better 5out of 2, battery down very fast, max 3 hours taken charging 100% ,sometime WhatsApp hangups.108 gp free storage but mobile heating high, fingerprints only 3 finger available,  not better fingerprints,  I am the first buyer before launching. Over all don't buy this m 31. No extra protection, no additional option,  very simple mobile,not worthiness of money,"
1,"First time met very bad experience from Samsung phone, camera quality is very poor. Front facing camera not good at all. Not comfortable with 6000mahbattery life.Amazon.india  just destroyed their Goodwill by selling this product.I purchased this phone for my friend. And now he is angry on me....Dear customer please avoid to buy this product."
1,Very poor performance.. camera is ok not bad . But very slow net speed .. opening app time is relatively fast but after internet is very slow .... my old mobile Samsung on max is much faster performance for loading web page than Samsung m31 .. this phone taking much more time to open any web site ... remaining everything is ok ..Fast changing is not far like they said .. 30 mins charging it charging 20% but my old Samsung is 30% charged at same time . I have found this two major drawback.
4,I ordered in first sale after comparing all the phones at this range and i am satisfied with this phone but want to discuss some pros and consPros:1. Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also.2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️)3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex
5,"Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device. You can always drop them on the comment)"
1,"Dear Amazon Team,I have been delivered faulty product from UP. It is just 15 days from buying the product and it was showing hang issue. and now this phone is dead and restart itself. No customer care is replying. Very poor service. Need replacement of the phone immediately."
5,"Delivery was fast, packing was good, phone started quite unusual that applications were not even downloading on wifi, later after a couple of restarts it's good now. So thumps up , happy so far ."
3,It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display & mammoth battery.Pros :1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself )2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.3. SAR rating - lowest one4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )Cons :1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet )2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great3. Not so great processorWho can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery & Samsung branding.
3,"I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.Pros:1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.Cons:1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better."
5,"The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screenIf you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colorsI am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos. I am hoping battery performance wl improve in few daysCamera pictures are goodLots of bloatware come with Samsung so had to uninstall/ disable them manually"
5,Awesome camera Awesome battery Awesome display  ....Super clear ZoomSuper Macro sensorSuper ultrawide angleAtlast Thanks Samsung for 730G
1,"My review after three months use:I am reducing it to one stars after three months use. Initially I gave five star. Reasons of giving one star is:1) the phone is over priced and it's actual price should be not more than 13-14K.2) occassionally it's back panel heats up.3) design is poor, especially at the back camera panel space above the flashlight is unutilized and don't look premium. Much cheaper mobile phones have better design.3) the whole body including screen, back panel and camera panel is very sensitive to scratches. You have to cover with phone case and screen guard immediately otherwise your phone will give a dirty look full if scrates after one week use.3) no IP rating. Forget water proofing, not a trace of water resistance. You have to prevent it from humidity and sweating.4) screen refresh rate is poor in comparison to other phones available below 10K range.Following was my review after almost one week use. __________________________________At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory. Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced."
1,"Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000. I have  doubt  its not 7000 man battery its like 2000 or 2500mah. Heating  issue also faced during  charging."
1,"Genuine Feedback to samsung and all buyersNot Upto the Mark..Battery is good, but mobile is very heavy.. not handy for one hand operation.. if you use it continuously then you feel pain in your  hand, designed is out dated, poor quality material.. camera is just okay..I am not happy overall performance of this phone at this price band...Mobile should be perfect for 15-16k price band..Lookwise not goodDisplay qaulity is just good not bestSound quality is goodCamera not much good that I am expecting.Big screen which perfect for movie watcher.. but after 30 minutes you feel pain in your hands.I bought Electric blue colour, it's look like samsung old samrt phone .My request to Amazon, is it possible to return this mobile. Then help me for return...I am not happy with overall performance of the phone..."
5,"Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage"
1,"There's something wrong with the new Samsung M51 mobile. Many other users are also facing the same issue. We are unable to connect through Wi-Fi on Samsung M51.Meanest Monster Ever ... HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi.Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says ""Incorrect Password"".I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1. Forget the connection and reconnect again.2. Update the phone s/w to latest version.3. Reset Settings4. Reset Network Settings5. Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened. Instead a replacement of this phone should be there, I have not even used it for more than an hour.Last year I ordered an MI phone from Flipkart, the battery was getting drained very fast. Within the next day, the phone was replaced without questions asked.Dissappointed by Amazon, the way they are handling this issue.Don't spend your hard-earned money on this phone. Unfortunately, if your phone turns-out to be faulty, then there is a never ending process to take care of issue."
1,"Usually I don't write the reviews, but this time I couldn't resist myself from doing so.First of all, I am a Samsung hater, but my wife didn't want a chinese brand phone, so I had no option than to go with Samsung. Therefore, this review may look like bias, but believe me, it's not.Doesn't look like a 27K phone. Screen looks so dull compared to my 3 years old one plus 5t phone. UI is boring. Stock android would have been appreciated. 3 finger screenshot feature is not available (though there are other ways, this one is easiest). Out of 8Gb 3.2Gb RAM was showing as used out of the box. Out of 128Gb , 32Gb was showing as used. Neither of the camera was impressive. There are some default apps (bloatware) which are absolutely useless. They didn't even provide the silicon transparent cover with the phone. The only good thing about this phone is - it is very bulky (this is not the sarcasm, I really like bulky phones)Anyway, I won't be using this phone, but feeling very bad that I spent this much of money for such a cheap phone 😥"
1,"Call quality is poor. When loud speaker is on, Cannot hear properly on the other side, call is muffled or breaking. Do someone else face this similar issue ? Is there any way to fix. I could not raise a ticket to contact either Amazon or samsung. Camera quality is also average.  Hated it.Updated review after 20 daysStarted facing charging issuesStopped charging suddenly, don't know what to doNo more replacement from AmazonNice lesson learnt:1. Don't fall into the trap of extensive hype of a product2. Don't believe youtubers reviews just before experiencing atleast 30 days of usage.3. Don't buy a product on its first day of launch4. Read the return and replacement policy thoroughly before buying."
2,"I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6. Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7. When Sealed Package open then phone display contain so much dust. Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8. Gorila Glass 3 protection under 25k i.e out dated glass protection after using 2 days with full care i got one scratch mark on display.9. NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10. Audio output in my boat rockers bluetooth headset with this phone is not as much as lound as compare to my previous phone Redmi Note 7 pro.11. Without using phone it take 2 hour to charge but when you use it frequently then it take 2.30-3 hour to charged it full from 0-100%.12. Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13. No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good. When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4. Till now Ram management is goodTo much hype created every where for this phone and due to this many user like me has purchased this phone but this phone under 25k is really not value for money. I am going to resale this phone. There are so many phone below 25k with best facilities as compare to this Samsung m51.Conclusion : Phone is overpriced and performance is average"
1,"1.On playing games, sound is too too less.2.Flash light too dull3. 7000Mah battery, all fake battery only last one day or one and a half day max4. There is no Broadband speed  indicator5.live wallpaper option not goodBetter avoid this phone, dont fall for advertisements"
5,"This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8. If you need all trending features to be covered in non Chinese mobile,THEN GO FOR IT... ALSO TRY TO UPDATE TO LATEST SOFTWARE ONCE AFTER SETTING UP YOUR MOBILE, OTHERWISE HEATING ISSUE WILL BE THERE."
5,"After using for more than 2 day's I must say, snapdragon 730g works wonderful .CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mega Pixcel and more feature in selfie camera.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also."
5,"My take after using the handset for 4 days:1. Display: Superb. Big, crystal clear, bright and everything you can expect from a samsung super amoled plus screen.2. Camera: Very good. Night mode could have been better.3. Sound: Speakers: Better than average, earphones: good4. Battery: Very good. But expected more backup from a 7000 mah battery. Had to charge it once a day for the last 4 days.5. UI: The one-ui provided here is different from the one provided in A series. The one that comes with A series phones like A50 etc is more user friendly and has more features like Secure folder, timer etc. Also, the Samsung notes app in A series is far better than the one provided here. In this price, an UI at par with the leading A series phones is expected.6. Processor: Good for normal use.7. Finger print unlock is fast and smooth.8. No case/ back cover and no earphone.9. A bit overpriced."
2,"It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos. When photo is clicked with lens covered completely,  it shows hundreds of white spots in image, same happens with pro mode too. (This is not regular image noise)"
1,"I have been using this from starting. Ordered on 18th sep and get this phone very next day 19th. Here is my overall review.1. Battery - tremendous and optimization is on next level2. Display - It's great display ever.3. Speed - faster then ever ( compared to my other phones )4. Gaming - Very powerful no laging ( played COD, Hitman Sniper, Asphalt 9)But wait, in the meantime I've faced some issues on the phone as well.1. Voice call - call is fine but when call is placed on speaker children voice could not be heard by other. On normal call it's perfect but on speaker it's not. Adult voice can be heard from a distance but children voice can't. even the phone is just near the face. This issue can lead you the problem while you're on whatsapp video call as well. First I thought it was just whatsapp issue but after certain test it's major issue on voice call. Tested with safe mode and also after factory reset (without any other third party applications)2. Fingerprint sensor - It's fine and fast. But wait. you need to setup both hands fingers so it's easy to use. Maybe if the finger print sensor placed on in-display then it's better than this but if you map with both hand fingers and thumb then it's easy. Other wise you've to wait for 30 seconds if the finger not matched for 5 times.3. Galaxy Apps - Disable it otherwise unnecessary apps and bloatware will be install automatically.4. Knox - It's displaying secured by Knox but secure folder is not there. Which should be.I have replaced the product but still the microphone issue is there so plz be carefull with this."
3,"1. NO secure folder option, This phone SUCKS.2.Processor is old same as A80 (launched in April 19)2. Display is Good3. Back Panel (it's plastic wanna be glass;) , watch it on the first and last time at unboxing cause it won't be same anymore)4. Not Camera monster it's a camera average, they show 64 MP its 64 MP, which takes 3-6 seconds for one snap. Till then moment is already gone.5. Battery works only for a day.For 27K it doesn't worth it.Don't buy it, seriously."
4,"Initial experiences:- Adaptive brightness/ Ambient Display: Frequent screen flickering and unstable; had to disable.- Fingerprint Scanner: Poor quality, frequently asks you to wipe..- No preapplied screen film or back-case supplied.+ Nice AMOLED panel and crisp viewing experience.+ Not bulky or uneasy to hold contrary to common perception.+ Biiig battery which lasts looong.+ Good reception and call quality.+ Not Chinese+ Better than Oneplus Nord (don't look at 5G, let our 4Gs work efficiently as of now!)+ Top notch performance."
5,"First impressions: the celestial black colour looks really good and elegant. Looks better than in pics or videos. The phone feels solid in hand. The screen is large and great quality punchy colors. The screen is also very bright.Performance too seems good except that the real performance will be known a while later as Samsung mobile tend to slow down with time. The back is a fingerprint magnet, so a case is a must.The battery is really a beast and charger is decent too. Battery easily lasts 2 days with average use, even with heavy use it lasts one and a half days.Camera Performance is great at this price. The pictures and videos come out great.I got the 6gb variant with hdfc offer and with HDFC smart buy, the price should come down to 22000. Its a great phone at this price. Most of the cons mentioned in online reviews are not for me. I am happy with this phone.Why I preferred M51 over Nord? M51 ticks all the right boxes for me. A great screen for watching videos, good casual gaming, a great battery lasting at least 2 days, a better camera, 128 gb storage with microsd card support  and at a price which is Rs. 3000  cheaper. I already have Samsung and Oneplus phones at home. So I can say with confidence that you won't go wrong with any of the brand.My overall first impression is that its a great phone with almost all things that one may need at this price. Will keep updating."
3,"Camera - GoodFast charge - GoodDisplay - AwesomePerformance - GreatBattery Backup - It's Not Like 7000mah, Average ( Like 4000mah ) Need Optimization2-3 times Play Store Getting Crashed....Otherwise Good to Buy.......Amazon very good Delivery.......NoEarphone And Softcase"
1,"I have ordered this mobile on the first day of the sale at 12 o clock sharp. Yes there are some good features, But let's talk only about the CONS. The reason for talking about the CONS as the PROS are talked by other friends.  1) Vibration of the mobile is more and can't hold the mobile for longer time.  2) Mobile is higher priced compared to other same configuration devices and no tempered glass or case has been provided.  3) Guys Please check the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR Value) before buy any mobile and in this its more which affects Head and Body and not good for health.  4) Weight of the mobile is MORE and finally I won't recommend this."
1,I received the phone on the very next day of the sale.Unfortunately I am facing issue with loudspeaker and mic. So the primary thing of a phone (calling) is not working properly.Even after replacement facing the same issue.
4,"Charging and display quality is good..No hangsHeating is not obsereved during charging or using mobile.Diasble galaxy store otherwise bloatware is installed continuously.I didn't find mobile is heavy , weight management is excellent. Otherwise it's as usual normal android.. phone.. camera I didn't like much both front and back useless. I purchased this phone esp for display and battery. For small hands mobile is bit tall not width wise..Macro photo lots of granules seeing.. I think in my phone macro lens is defective.. speaker output is not good. 3.2 gb ram used out of 8 gb by default .."
5,Great phone with good battery life the battery usually lasts for 2 days on light usage and charges super quick
5,"Pros:1. Value for money buy at 23k considering the offers.Try to get it at this price range by bank offers being offered.2. Camera is brilliant.Compared to OnePlus Nord and others in this price range.3. Snapdragon 730G optimized very well.Processor is snappy.Compared to other brands (realme 7 pro, one plus nord), it gives faster perfomance as it has been properly optimized.4. Battery is the top selling point for this phone.I have to take office calls for 5/6 hours a day, including webex meetings with wifi always on.It still last me 1.5 days.5. Display is excellent even though it is providing 60 hz refresh rate.Amoled display of samsung is brilliant as always.Cons:1. Back is plastic. Does feeling like a 25k phone.But as 7000mah battery had to be adjusted in a compact way, samsung had to compromise  with the design.2. 4k/1080p videos can't  record in 60fps.Doesn't  bother me much, it depends on your preference."
1,"Samsung delivered defective piece and had to gone through replacement cycle. Believe me, on Amazon getting replacement is not easy.  It was a manufacturing defect.Do see your phone thoroughly, as soon as you receive to check for defect.*** Amazon has no return policy on electronic items, even if product is damaged. They dont care. ***Finally after getting product :Camera, User Interface : GoodHeavy (because of mega battery). Its a big phone, so personally I am not finding it handy.Battery life : still need to find."
5,"This is the best phone in 25000 segment  730G processor with 7000 mah battery with 25w fast chargingThe display quality is amazing as it is S amoled panelThe 64 mp camera captures amazing details it also has night mode and slowmo, hyperlapse, one take, macro camera is not good tho . It tried fortnite it can run on medium graphics with 30fps limit and its pretty smooth thanks to 730G . The front facing camera quality is very good  i have attached pic of  ram usuage with no background app running one thing i didnt like was u cannot zoom in when u set to 64mp camera mode and it is filled with unnecessary apps like daily hunt and many others"
3,"Well, as compared to the same feature range phones. The price seems to be 2-3k high. But if you are bored of charging your phone every 6 hours, you have a relief here with 7000 mAh battery, which doesn't  disappoint you.  I choose primarily for the battery and it lived up to the point that it stated. With playing 1 hour of playing COD, using hotspot for a full day and browsing it lasted for more then 40 hours and there is a battery saver mode too, which will last for a week if you are travelling out and need to use phone for only call and minimum usage.But, if you are a non-stop gamer it will last a day depending on the usage.Pros:Display is good, performance is fine, battery is stand out. The camera is also good and bixby vision is cool. Many edited features come with the camera, that is added advantage. Sensors are good and fast too. The weight is well balanced, you won't feel the weight after a day's usage. Charging is quite quick. Rest of phone's features are fine.Cons:Plastic built body, no tempered glass or case is provided within the box. The speakers are located at the bottom which is uncomfortable if we hold the phone in two hands and watch videos or play games. In dark, the screen display may cause some burden to the eyes, which I did not face earlier. The background apps keeps running until you close them or optimize the battery which will automatically close all the background running appVerdict:Little high-priced, very good battery and a satisfactory performance."
3,"Awesome phone..all good reviews..1.definitely heavy, what else u can expect with huge 7000 battery, yet manageable.. u cant hold and watch movies or matches for long u need a stand..have to use Bluetooth or wired headset while talking as its heavy, u feel it slips off2. Stunning display amoled at its best..watched Enola holmes3. need back cover else scratches will be evident glaringly and lose its premium feelMost important worrying fact is SAR value at 1.3, the only fact I am disappointed with samsung..u can check dailling *#07#..ps samsung are valued for low sarAudio loud speaker I am not satisfied"
1,"Ibought it for 24,999 but now it's 19,499. Cheap phone but samsung looted me. Be aware of foreign countries. Either is Chinese or any other."
1,"I have been using Samsung Phones ever since they ventured into Smart Phones. I had privilege of using majority of Samsung Phones like Galaxy S2, Samsung Grand, Samsung S6, Samsung S9+, Samsung Note 3 and Samsung S10.When Samsung launched M51, like many I think I am also fooled by aggressive marketing campaign and youtube reviews by youtubers like Technical Guruji (I unsubscribed his channel due to fraud review)Why I purchased this phone because ofBrand SamsungExpected Good Camera SetupExpected Good Build QualityExpected Good PackagingAnd for this I have paid good price of INR 25KWhy I am disappointedBuild quality is quite inferior it's cheap plastic that use to come in phones like Karbon or Lava in 2012-2013.Camera setup is quite average, they say it's triple camera but picture quality is not so great, night shots are average, I think if you buy brands like Xiaomi you get better pictures by spending less amount. Probably that's why Samsung is marketing Single Take feature, which I think won't work if camera is average.Packaging, after paying INR 25K one expects box to include stuff like Phone Cover as these days majority of manufacturers, but here it comes with cheap quality of Box, that has nothing but a cheap charger with very poor quality of packaging, now a days many manufacturers are also putting the screen protectors at cheap cost, Samsung should take a note.Phone weighs quite heavy and is not easy to use with one hand, this is something nobody is telling, probably thats the only reason Samsung has degraded the build quality.What is good about this phoneBattery - Certainly that's the only feature for which I paid INR 25K. But are you willing to pay this much for a phone that's more of power bank.Headphone Jack - Samsung has retained it, and it's output is pretty good.Apart from that phone has same processor like Samsung A80, which comes with better camera setup and better build quality.Therefore I feel Samsung is over charging customers for this device and it should not cost more then INR 15K - 18K.So if you are only looking for battery and headphone jack then spend money on this one and If anyone wants to contact me I am ready to resell mine at 20%  discount.I wish they had option of giving zero stars.Amazon I am sorry this is my worst ever Amazon shopping experience which I regret everyday when I see what I got."
5,"EDIT : I have added 7 days battery usage video, please use that as new reference for battery usage.Original :Before you read the review, please know that I mainly use my phone for productivity and social media. I do not game heavily or photograph heavily.To me the best part about it is the display. I've never used an OLED display and moving from standard LCD to OLED is magical. The system wide dark mode support makes everything look sexy black!The battery is super powerful, although I've to use it for more days to give a better review. From what I experienced, you can easily get 12-15 hours of screentime at least, spanning over 2 days. The charging is as advertised, taking around 2 hours for a full charge.I'm not a camera enthusiast beyond some selfies and occasional landscape photography when I travel. The camera provided satisfied my expectations. Please look at same photographs attached, bearing in mind that light conditions were not optimal and I'm not an expert at the art. Also, it has Cam2 API support, so you can install a Google Camera mod and tweak the settings to your liking.This phone is worth it for the display and battery for me. It has everything I expected. Only disappointment is that it doesn't come with a cover or screenguard, while other manufacturers provide that even at this range."
3,"After 48 hours of usageVery much excited when I saw the specs. but!!!!Pros:1. Display2. Procesor  SD730G3. Camera4. Fast chargingCons:1. audio not loud getting crack sound in speaker mode2. Battery (it's 7000Mah) but discharging quickly(I didn't play games, I used it only calls, and YouTube). I felt like its a 4000Mah.3. Backside material looks very cheap. attracts lots of fingerprints4. Price is very high.5. Back case is not provided. (Phone is slippery need to handle with care or buy back case).After all, I feel this phone average for this price. (*** stars)if the price is 19999/- with this specs my price is (***** stars)"
1,Phone heats up while using camera for few minutes.Writing this just in one day of usageOther feedbacks in few daysHeating a lot.. worst ever experience  with Amazon
1,"I bought Samsung M51 on launch day itself! Within 2 days of usage, screen started flickering. Even Samsung customer care said that it's faulty screen"
1,"This mobile phone have many problems such as WiFi  issues  , Bluetooth issues,  saving pdf issues , sometimes light sensors not works , app is not working  ( showing many times) .This OS is CORE version  not as A series galaxy smartphones.I think in m51 is a experimental device by Samsung  .Samsung  inserted many apps from A series  maybe  this creates  problems  , because  its OS is core .Before purchasing M51 keep this things in mind  .I recognized after 17 days of using this .I mean to say , it creates problems after 17 days of using  .And now I am unable to return this mobile M51 .Service center told me this , its a OS problem  , after few days all m51 smartphone will get Software updates  .  Or to submit M51 to Service center  to get value of this smartphone  as a coupon,  which I will redeem coupon in exclusive Samsung showrooms  ."
5,GOOD OVERALL PHONEBATTERY IS HUGE USING PHONE FROM 7 AM ( 100% ) BATTERYPLAYED GAME FOR 50 MINUTEINSTAGRAM FOR 40 MINUTEMANY CALLS TOODID MAILING & TEXTING ALSO IN WHATSAPPWEBWHATSAPP IS ON FROM 9 AMWORKING FINE TILL NOWCAMERA IS WONDERFUL & WILL TRY ASPHALT 9 & THAN EDIT THIS REVIEWAT 5.20 PM ITS 76% BATTERYNow after use of many daysPhone works the same just one problem some time phone get disconnected automatically i don't  know if it is problem of phone or something else overallMust buy product for sure
5,Straight to the point :Purchased in first saleReceived : 20sep2020- Really heavy can start wrist pain if not used properly (but including 7000mah in this weight is surprisingly excellent. Kudos to samsung)- Headphone jack is a boon ...although I use TWS but a headphone jack is a must.- Battery can be stretched more than 1.5 days with normal usage. But initially need to disable every background app to get optimized battery life.- Glastic back panel is shiny but will not give premium feel.- Fingerprint is decent but getting used to side mount will take time.- Not for osmo mobile 3 (which I have tested and also try to upload video) uncomfortable to load and unload.- Excellent camera and video esp macro- Selfie cam is also good- Requires some adaptor to charge old phones. Mi cable is good converter & charging cable for usb mini- Speaker is average- Bloatware is there but can be disabled ...- 6gm ram and snapdragon processor does the job efficiently.- No hapticsA nice decent phone from Samsung.Pro Tip : Never buy a phone on the basis of whats new always buy on the basis of what you need. You can if you've extra bucks ;)Unboxing will be soon available on YouTube : IemMihir.Don't know but my initial review was deleted and I had to write this again.
1,"As mentioned by Samsung 7000 mh battery but battery drains very fast at the end of day when I am using internet,watching videos. Battery needs to carry for two days at 7000mh but it is not carry one day also. Please do not buy this product. Display is also very bad super amoliad  Display is fake some times video shows red faces. It is not zero edge after full Display video get cutted from the edges of phone display. Speaker sound is third class not upto the mark what we expect from Samsung. Handset provided doubly atmos but when I use headphones also can't find atmos experience. Very bad handset on this range better you can buy Samsung m31s for that.I provide 1 out of 10 ratings for this set. Its a garbage set."
5,"I purchased it on 18 September on 12:01 pm with no delay as I wanted to buy this amazing phone by Samsung. Surprisingly  it was delivered on the same day within 6 hrs. Now I have used it for almost a week and can give my overview about the phone. I will provide you the main pros and cons of Samsung M51PROS:#SuperAmoledPLUSdisplay believe me it is one of the best display I have ever seen on mobiles. You will love the premium quality while watching video and seeing photographs infact reading on this mobile feels great.#Camera: Amazing camera quality it gives natural colors, dynamic contrast ratio is better than the phones come between the price range of 30 to 40 thousand. Daylight images are just magical. 64mp camera is just awesome. 12mp macro lense gives you amazing details. Wide angle for selfish lovers where you will get most of the function get works automatically. One take picture is just amazing too. I can say you will not get such camera performance  in other phones even if you choose any phone having price beyond 40000.#Battery: Believe me if you are a normal user your battery will not get ended before the third day. If you are moderate users of phone it will give you atleast 2 days of battery backup. And if you are a hard-core mobile user you will not able to drain this battery in one single day.#UserfriendlyOneUI: what a lovely UI, very smooth , no confusing icons, better placement of folders in my files. Categorization of items by samsung is awesome anyone can use this with no difficulty. Your pics, videos, recordings, documents  everything will be kept in right place and believe me it will make you so happy as you don't have to find anything here and there.#Snapdragon730G: what a great thing to have both thing in your phone one the brand Samsung and another the processor snapdragon. Yes this processor  made M51 a great choice. Snapdragon helps to improve your gaming performance plus it also helps in smooth functioning  of different apps. No lag while viewing videos, playing games and making calls.CONSLook these are my point of views may be the cons don't have any value for most of the users.#Size: The size of phone is 6.7inch which can be a bit big for many users especially having small hands. Besides, bike riders who use to go offices daily may find this phone challenging while keeping inside the jeans pocket.#Body: the body of phone is glastik and it is so scratchable that means you have to buy the backcover as soon as possible. Using backcover and tempered  glass is advisable. This is not a big cons as now a days we all use back cover in all phones so don't take it as negative one.Hope you will like the review and it will help you give you idea of purchasing the phone."

The cooling technology is very good if we play game we can not feel heat upto 3 hrs. After that it gets lite heat.if u keep phone side for 15 min u can play more 3 hrs. The front camera is simply awesome. The back camera is some watt dull. No heat at all in normal use. This review after 30 days, Thank you."

1,Never buy chip quality battery drain issues don't buy
4,"Previous owner of Redmi 7 2gb 32gbRedmi Note 10 4gb 64gb was blazing fastIf you aren't able to buy this wait till Xiaomi release the same in poco with 6gb ram for the same price, like they did with Redmi power with a downgrade in camera, They won't remove the 48mp camera, They may decrease or remove the remaining cameras in poco version of resmi note 10About Amazon sale I logged in to amazon.in in my pc and clicked on join wait list around 12:02, then opened the app and booked the phone I was in queue for almost 20 to 25 minutes, the next step was payment which was a pain in the head, no COD, Note: only upi ids with number@ are accepted, I added a card Note: Check if ecommerce payments is enabled for your cardIn the allocated 15 minutes the order was booked but payment failed, thankfully I was allowed to pay againAlso while I was waiting in queue I got an option to buy the phone 2 ways, lightning deal - 11998, Regular price - 11999 (in Amazon App), I think lightning deal is for those who want to claim offersFirst of all, i bought this phone for basic use online payments, govt apps like Twallet, Tration, Tappfolio, MyGHMC, Digilocker, Aadhaar, Hpgas, Bharatgas, Hmwssb and much more all of them mostly dual appsI am a pc user so I don't use my mobile for gaming or streamingPros:Display : The display is crisp and clear better than my Redmi 7 (not comparing LCD with Amoled)Touch: The touch response is good it's fast, I can type fast in this phone no lag thereMobile data: 4g Data connectivity is superb I can feel the difference between my redmi 7 and this, mostly the download speedFeel: In hand feel is also good, the weight is lessCamera: Best in the segment (obviously if you don't use the stock app)Price: considering how this is priced more than Redmi Note 9 (10999), I am not angry this too will cost the same after 6 months probably will be on exchange and discount by August independence day sale.Cons:Battery: Being amoled this shouldn't consume so much battery, hope Xiaomi fixes this with an updatePlastic back: glossy back (should have come with matte or rough panel for better grip) and little bit of vibration while playing the speakers especially on top near cameraStereo speakers: yep more like dual speakers than stereo (then again Xiaomi never claimed that they support Dolby (Oppo has them and they sound awesome)Verdict: I was waiting for this from almost a year, from the launch of Redmi note 8 and my analysis went way deep, I was looking at Samsung for amoled, Redmi power for stereo speakers and good battery, Poco varient of Redmi note 9 for the processor and decent in the box fast chargerThis covered almost all of them (not fully though)Finally this just serves my purpose, I still aim to buy a good PC, Nothing can beat a desktop ( I wish remix os and phoenix os were as competitive as Windows, remix went out of play long back."
5,"Finally, Xiaomi has decided to design for its Note series of mobiles. This mobile phone is definitely going to be and head Turner when you pull the mobile out of the pocket. It has an almost 1mm protruding camera module on the rear of the mobile. I have bought aqua-green color which has these light gradient shade. The colors are up to your personal preferences.The phone has a matte finish at the back so it is definitely not a fingerprint magnet. It also doesn't feel very heavy and is very easy to hold firmly.🎯DESIGN and DISPLAY:******************************This 6.43-inch display with the Full HD Plus resolution is really good along with a punch-hole selfie camera that offers a seamless user experience.The brightness can go up 1100 nits peak so it is definitely not a difficult thing to use it under sunlight. Xiaomi provided this model with the Widevine L1 DRM certification support for this mobile. So, playing HD videos on an ott platform won't be an issue.Z-axis haptic motor used in this mobile throws more realistic vibrations while playing games. I tried it extensively with a couple of games, the experience was really satisfying. Kudos to Xiaomi for throwing in all the sensors on this mobile especially for not giving up on the remote control sensor.This mobile comes with a lot of preloaded apps like Facebook, LinkedIn, MI remote, MI credit, MI Store, MI pay, share m, etc. Out of these, you can uninstall a couple of apps and you have to live with the remaining apps for the rest of the life.🎯PERFORMANCE:**********************The fingerprint sensor is very sensitive and highly responsive that even if you touch the sensor unintentionally you will end up unlocking the phone. It is that fast. Games like Asphalt 9 and Call of Duty worked excellently without any lag or freezing. This mobile would definitely outscore any mobile under this budget easily.It took 25 to 35 minutes to charge the mobile from 0 to 75% using the 33 Watts charger which came along with the mobile.🎯CAMERA:**************It comes with the 48-megapixel F/1.79 main camera with Sony Sensor and an 8mp ultrawide camera and the remaining two are the macro and the depth sensor.The main camera will let you shoot 4K 30fps video and 960fps 720 p video. When provided with good lighting conditions the main camera gives you a decent output and the Portrait mode also did a good job by blurring out the background gently.The low light images were average and it was decent enough for mobile phones with a budget of 15k.Coming to the selfie camera The Portrait mode worked excellently and the pictures were on a little warm tone than a natural skin tone. If you don't like the warm tone on your selfie pictures then you can fix it through editing apps from Play Store.🎯VERDICT:**************This mobile offers Rock-solid performance for everyday tasks along with very good battery life. This mobile phone comes with MIUI 12.5 so you don't have to worry about future updates for at least the next two years. With AMOLED display and the stereo speakers along with IP53 rating, this has to be the most competent mobile phone under 15000 and a good value for money.I have a YouTube channel: Gizmofeatures (You can also find the unboxing and impressions video there). When Comparing with Poco M3, Moto G10 Power, Samsung M12, you can pick Redmi note 10 any day. It is the best among these Four."
1,"This mobile i used only 3 days and mobile start sucking, and this mobile stuck 6 time in one day.. Most Worst mobile in my life 😣"
1,HERE I HAVE UPLOADED THE VIDEO ABOUT THE ISSUE WITH MY NEW MOBILE.FROM THE FIRST DAY TOUCH SCREEN NOT WORKING PROPERLY
4,It has good specifications.... Cut 1star bcoz of bad tactics by redmi.... They told base variant will start with 12k but didn't launched it.... Then I have to buy 14k variant.
4,Satisfied with this product. Best phone under 14000.Camera quality is also good. Battery performance is superb coz of 33w charger 🔋🔌. Finally it is a good phone as per my opinion.
3,I am not impressed with this phone. Samsung phones have better amoled display. Sound quality not good and not loud too. This phone hangs a lot. Camera quality very bad. I have owned previous phones of mi and they are much better than this. Pls go for note 9 pro in the same budget or realme.
5,Best phoneEver
4,Everything is good in the phone..I use redmi note 10 for 1 day...And review itI found i issue with this phone that is fingerprint sensor does not work properly it slwo or some time Tap fingerprint sensor for 2-3 time for useAbout a camera very good...Front camera is also good..I will edit review after 10 day of use...In shot very GOOD PHONE
1,Phone display has been breaken. It is mentioned as gorilla glass. It has fall down from just 6 feet. Y it is broken?. I will go to consumers courst. Please guide me
1,Redmi note 10 software is very bad xiaomi please fix software problem's Improve the camera & build quality is not good & battery drain very fast.  I AM BIG FAN OF XIAOMI MY FAVORITE COMPANY
5,I pay 100rs extra for one-day delivery it took less than 20 hours.. And after 7 days of using I would say this the best budget smartphone to this day.. There is another variant that comes in 12k you can wait for that or simply buy this at 14000 it comes with a back cover and a screen protector battery backup is awesome but a slight heating issue I'm am getting...
5,"Good picture quality. The 48 Mp camera works fine and so does the selfie camera in potrait mode. Sometimes the pictures are sharper than required. The charging is fast. Got full charge in 2.5 hours of fast charge. Overall build quality is good, not too heavy as compared to previous models. The plastic phone case provided prevents from ususal bumps and falls. The sound quality is decent and so is the video quality in full HD. Gaming performance is decent too, got to play need for speed in medium setting without crashing the app. Really happy with the purchase."
1,"Mobile is lagging. while I scrolling screen is not moving, I noticed it several times,it is very slow while playing games. product is not up to the mark in this price segment"
1,Battery is very bad ...battery is draining when even phone is on sleep mode .
1,check wether both the speakers are working or noi got the manufacturing defet in a piece wich they have senteven the headphone jack also not upto the mark wich give you sound only in one ear bud
5,"We loved it always, coz it's a no 1 brand.Exellent camera."
1,Toatl vest of money. The mobile having touch issue. Half Touch is not working. I suggest you all please do not buy Redmi Note 10 series. Please please please
1,"Very disappointed with the redmi product.Touch sensation problem. Sometimes some parts of the screen doesn't work on touch. I tried my best to get this latest product, but never expected such waste of money."
1,"The sd678 processor with 6GB of ram fails to keep up with everyday stuff like composing mails and browsing. Screen freezes at times, and touch response is far from adequate (and no, it is not because of the the protective film).Camera is average for this price range.The only good thing about this phone is its amoled display.It comes with the usual miui bloatware, but can uninstall/disable some.I understand these phones are not meant to last, nor do I expect flagship level performance for 14k; but this phone fails to perform even basic tasks where sub 10k phones ace.The finger print sensor is well placed amd fast, but often fails to work.There's no way to turn off fast charging, so expect your battery to give up soon."
4,Display is very good  10/10Camera is good for the price 8/10Battery is very good 10/10Lightweight and very slimPerformance is decent not the best 7/10MIUI is very laggyBack panel quality is not goodDual stereo speakers not the loudest but ok
1,Don't purchase this phone battery problem and phone is running is slow
1,After 5 days used . Nice design but performance is not up to mark and lagging . App crashes . Lot of adds which is irritating. Best buy Oppo or Realme.
2,i have used this smartphone for couple of days and what i came across cons and pros will share1. display : best in this price range no doubt about that crisp colors little saturated as its amoled panel for viewing is a pleasure of eyes2. Speakers : i didn't liked it yes u heard it right its not good the highs as high vocals are not clear its like its been suppress the quality is not like stereo speakers type its same like single speaker its like u can heard the music but not the vocals the base is killed3 Battery : Not seems to be 5000 mah coz of 11nm chip its drains like hell even surfing would suck the battery juice like hell and phone heats up a lot yes it charge as fast as advertised apart from that nothing is good might be an update would resolve this issue have to wait and watch4. Camera : its good in the price range 48 mp does it job ultra wide macro depth are satisfactory not good not bad does there job colours are not accurate but it does happen low light pictures are ok not as advertised. camera gives good result in good light or in moderate like in room bit not good in low light or at nightselfie camera is good takes good shots edges in portrait are quiet well managed same in low light not good enough5. Built quality nice all plastic very light and easy to hold and operate with one hand if u have big hands but very light coz of all plastic body gorilla glass 3 is used but will never be tested as we always use guard so nothing to talk about itin short its up to you you want it or pass on
1,"after 6 days use  :1. 2 sim+sd card, good2. width just 74mm, then its thin and comfortable in hand, good3. battery is good4. camera is ok (in this range price) but selfie isn't bad5. finger is side and fast6. face unlock is fast7. it's not bulky like m12 Samsung8. speaker is good9. Display is good, but i don't know why main some time is not good10. charging is fast11. it's not heavy weight, it's just 180 gr but m12 is more than 200grat the endi can't say it's good handset, why?Many times hanging, every day I have to restart it at least 5 timesToday I bought realme 8,its super handset, I can't compare both are, just go for realme 8"
5,Iam not big fan of #MI before this phone. Front camera was really nice having wide angle photography as well as from back camera. Battery was best overall this is nice phone for gaming also
2,"Not a good phone i donot know why it is hypedI should have purchased moto g30 ir waited for HuwaeiProblems:1.camera is not good2. Volume automatically decrease and increase3. App not opening have to clear cache each time4. no note pad while calling5.baterry is not good yesterday level of battery of 51 % today when i woke i found my phone switch off6.fingerprint scan is not good compared to Honor7.heating problem in general use8.screen timeout when you are watching anything or reading anythingLook wise it is good,  connectivity is good"

1,"I am facing touch problems. To type this review I struggled lot. Games worst , some times very difficult to answer phone calls"
1,Aftwrv2 days of uses review is that Even though camera is good but when you make Video call either through Whatsapp or Duo your video image looks  that you are using some VGA camera. don't whybthwre is a difference in selfie video and video through whatsapp which uses same camera properties.Better to go with  Samsung
1,It will make you feel blind as this phone blurs fonts and apps while we scroll it... didn't like it..I made a replacement also but still the problem is same in that new one too
1,"There is some serious issue with this recently launched phone. Replaced product again shows the same touch screen problem, have to touch multiple times. How can the same issue is coming in the second phone too, unless their is some bug. Please do not buy this phone. A BIG NO NO NO TO THIS PRODUCT."
2,"1.Camera have lot of issue, front camera become completely blur during video call on low light.2. Primary camer sensor works poor on video recoding it takes time to focus on item3. Here and there we can see setting menus are lagging- example in app battery saver setting screen starts jerking when we scroll on menu.4. Some apps functionaliy are not responding  after installation. Example zomato place order option. Restarting app doesn't helped. After restarting mobile it worked.I got this by yesterday evening now 1 day completed in minimal usage i faced these many issues worst experience with redmi ,😞😞😞Iam not sure this occur in all redmi 10 mobile or only mine need to speak with customer care and replace. There no return option."

Mobile sound quality is poor, touch pad is very bad, for charging mobile it's taking too much time. I personally not recommend this mobile."

1,"I brought this from Amazon on September 2nd 2020 after receiving the item I tried all my software knowledge to update the amigo launcher (default) , location to keep a track on weather and all other software which were already installed in the phone by using a high speed WiFi network.but nothing worked on it same day when I applied for return amazon arranged a technician to reconfirm the reason I am giving for return . Even the technician came on 10/09/2020(scheduled by Amazon) said there is some problem which can't be fixed by his and gave the same report to amazon .even after that they ask me to wait for 48hours to return it .WTF...every time I buy a electronic machine in from this site I get either damaged or else destroyed.They do take return but not when the customer want they schedule the service whenever so-called executive or service provider wants.Meanwhile they will keep your money on hold too so that you can't buy it from any other site or shop.This is what I am experiencing since last year even after being a prime member."

Got discount on sbi credit card and extra 500 also- total price 7700Best phone with Snapdragon 450 on this price(Disclaimer-It doesn't has a finger print senser but i don't mind it as for day to day function it has face recognition and it's working fine )"
3,Battery is very good but the following problems arise in the very 1st day when the handset was delivered to me.Problems:1. When I got the phone I found light is coming out from the lower part of the display (this is known as bleeding screen problem).2. Due to this sometimes double tap and touch is not correctly responding.
5,Value for money..Nice look..Decent designGood in 10k range
4,Good budget phone.
4,"Not much to say other than it is a typical Samsung Galaxy model at this price range. For power users like myself, this is not the phone. But for casual purposes, it is ok. Touching seems a bit laggish, little more fluid response was expected from a phone running 3 GB RAM under the hood. Camera is average, some pictures look sharper, others look dull. Speakers are moderately sounding, not much crispier, but can go loud.Just one thing to say, if you like your phone clean, then don't buy (get a Android One) because this one comes with loads of bloatware (and I mean, loads). There are some apps you can remove, but most ones you can't remove, and they take up space real good. After buying and doing a 30 MB system update, my storage says 13gb already used out of 32 ! So, how can you save your HD videos and pictures? I have no idea. Display is good at this price. Lastly, phone is OK for casual browse, stream, music, done."
1,"Waste of money!! Very bad Quality of camera focus and image processing. It's not Max up Phone,  it's like ordinary Chinese 3rd grade product. People should stay away thinking it's a Samsung phone. The voice quality and reception is also poor very low volume of speakers as well. Its with LCD display poor quality of image, though brand claims  HD, infinity O display all are marketing gimmicks. Phone lags on even with 4GB ram, hangs on quite a lot of time. Overall,  not worth  for 10K range,  choose better phones."
1,Highly disappointed product from Samsung. No finger print security. Worst camera. Poor performance on touch screen. Only satisfaction is the 6.5 inch display.. Got cheated by trusting the brand name. I recommend not to buy this mobile instead go with other options in redmi or poco.
2,Phone is overall good for budget but you have to not accept anything from camera even basic phone have better camera than this phone. Also it's OK to old processor but screen is 720p TFT LCD SCREEN picture doesn't show sharp sometimes you have to wait sec to respond from screen. It's one UI is good but I am not fan of that. It has come with 7.5 wt slow charger it takes lots of time to full charge.I give him 🌟 🌟 star because its competitors have  better processor camera screen and camera.If you are fan of Samsung go for it otherwise don't.
1,"Very poor mobile,  camera  is of old school and need a steady had and steady image subject to get it capture clear. not at all good and phone have very low sound from speakers.  Also seceen is a bit dull compared to other brands similar products.If your aim is to call and message and need a samsung mobile then only buy this, otherwise waste of money😭"
2,"Very much average phone for this price, front camera is pathetic, you will only pixels on the screen in selfies as well as during video calls. Main camera is pretty average. I believe it may be the issue with the model that received so I have asked for replacement, technician visit is scheduled for tomorrow. Will update more after that.Update: As expected, technician mentioned its the branded phone (non chinese), at this price this the best you could get, though it may not be that good and below average)..So finally, If you are looking for better front facing camera, I think go with others models based on the reviews."
1,"Worst camera ever - For the back camera, it is said 13MP+2MP+2MP Triple rear camera setup, for this we would have expect atleast some normal level clarity. Look at the images the first images in the set is which I took on my Redmi 4 camera which I bought 4 years back and look at the clarity. And the second one is from this 13MP triple camera setup Samsung phone which is way beyond worst.Having shocked on the rear camera, I checked the front camera which is more horrible than this back camera. The photos are blurry and shaky as you can see in the images.NEVER imagined something like this cheap and poor quality from a brand like SAMSUNG. Immediately requested for Return.PLEASE dont buy this phone if you consider a good Camera on the phone."
1,"Anyone viewing this review. Plesse never think to buy this.Not worth for even 5000 rs.""Worst front and rear camera"" I have ever seen in a smartphone.Everything very cheap.Diplay quality worst.Charger worst.Wire length too short.Takes more than 5 hrs to full charge from 0 to 100.Camera is like old keypad phones VGA cameraSo many bloatware appsI don't know how Samsung can make such poor quality phones.Totally waste of many for a middle range smartphone buyer."
4,After using for two days here below is my feedback:Pros:1- Very good full HD display at this price2- No issue till now with the performance of the processor. Daily routine apps run perfectly.3) Huge battery nad super backup. You won't believe I have charged it once since I received.Cons:1- The phone is not compatible with 5Gz Wifi. This is surprising for me as it was expected to be included.2- 100% Charging will take more than 3.5 hours with the in the box charger which is 7W.3- The back cover had very chep built quality (Will have to hide it behind a cover for safety and scratches)
5,"I purchased 4gb ram and 64 gb model storage phone model at rupees 9499.00 during republic day sale. Phone is good in terms of ram, storage, display and battery. You will not get fingerprint sensor, amoled screen, decent camera and metal body but it is fine because phone's budget is also low and i would say it is better than other available model by different manufacturers. Overall great product."
4,Yes always M series is awesome.Good delivery by amazone thanks.But i bought this mobile on 1st day of sale and on 2nd day its price was decreased up to 500 rps Not fair from Amazon.But its ok overall good experience
1,"First - Ordered when at the begnining of sale and paid 500Rs more than current price.Second - I got defective piece as selfie camera was broken.Third - I was amazed to hear that they cannot refund money back, Amazon can only replace the product.It's worst experience with Amazon Prime."
1,"This is the worst phone samsung have ever produced. Camera quility is third class. You may get more valuable phone in this range from redmi. But it has really disappointed me. Please don't buy if you want a good camera.Cons:  1. Worst Camera  2. Screen stucks  3. Can't play smoothly free fire.Pro:  1. Big hd display  2. Sound is good  3. Battery is also good when you  compare with same range phones.Honest Advice: This phone cost 10,000/-. If you can add 2500/- more then Samsung M21 is the best budget smartphone that fits every need. And if your need for camera is very less then you can buy this phone."
3,"A good budget segment for the following users* attending online classes* Elders(above 55 age) who won't use phone very much and spend minimum time on Whatsapp, Facebook* Can play games like candy crush, subway surfers , clash of clans and other medium graphic games* Those who like to upgrade their old Oreo and pie OS phonesNot for the following users:School and college students who uses phone feasiblyPro gamers like Pubg and Call of dutyPros:* Large display and weightless* No heating problem on calls and long time usage* Call quality is good* Supports dual Volte* Plastic build and weightless* Decent battery capacity. Stands for one and half days for the above mentioned users* Decent cameraCons:* Average display.* 720p maximum support on YouTube videos.* Good speaker but not loud enough* No Corning Gorilla glass support, Tempered Glass and Back case are must to avoid scratches.* No finger print sensor. Only face unlock is available but it's responding slower than expected"
5,A very good and decent budget phone in this segment.Bought this on the republic day sale.Got this for a very good exchange deal.An upgrade after using my old phone for four years whose battery was dying and memory was getting full and was showing phone lags.A very good decent budget phone choice.Just go for it.Looks premium backed with excellant Samsung brand.
4,"Display is good, can get super bright clearity is good but the viewing angles could be better, not a deal breaker at this price (viewing angles 3.8/5). Rear Camera is good it can take good photos in bright light front camera struggles a little bit in good for video calls.Pro-good and Big display, processor is good for app usage. can play medium games, battery is super, usb type c , samsung service center and warrenty, light weight, screen to body ratio, notch is very good compared to othersCon- speaker should be louder but okay if you are hearing in quite place , rear camera is good for price gives great colour accuracy then my op6 frount camera should be better. Processing power is bit slow but no problem with app usages. Ram management need improvementConclusion it is a good phone you get what you pay."
1,"I would suggest no to buy it at all. The camera is pathetic, disgusting.Even a phn with normal camera would click nice pic than this.Video call image is blurry like vga camera. The touch screen  lags very much.Apps doesn't open instantly.Even 6k-7k phones of other companies  are better than this phn.Those who have used a 10k phone of other companies  earlier  will find it difficult  to get adjust with it.You can use this phone only for calls, for seeing time and used as alarm clock.I am sick of this phone.At this cost of 10k you would get very good phones of other companies."
4,"Good phone in cheapest price with all common features, camera quality also good, battery backup perfect ...."
3,"The product is not so good, though Samsung should have included the 5Ghz wifi option in this latest phone. Physical look is good, looks classy. Photos came out good. Though, I have not taken any night snaps. Battery is good, last charged about more than 24 hrs. while writing this review, still shows 62%, after moderate use. Not a gamer, so cannot tell about that part. I am 50 so for me this is good deal.After long usage, now for camera missing are slow mo, time lapse, night shots are just ok, to much of noise, recording is just ok. Its just an average phone, in this price range other manufacturers have included better camera options. Samsung should update camera software and include more options."
1,Camera - 2/10Battery -7/10Display 4/10No
1,Waste of money. Don't go with this phone better to go with some Chinese brands. For better performance
1,Zero stars - waste of 10k1.camera is bad2.display is not good.3.overall very very disappointed with the trusted brandname☹️4. Not even worth of 5k.5. Other brands are much better in this price.
2,"Not liked very much, product is below expectations.They saying it have triple camera only for show. Picture quality is very bad.Screen resolution is 720. I expected it should be 1020 as all smartphone giving this much minimum with this price.No fingerprint lock.Battery life is good.Screen size is also good.Face recognition mostly doesn't work.Why they show of lots of features when it mostly doesn't work."
5,Good in this price range.Looks is different. No camera bump is advantage.Hardware and camera is enough for basic needs
4,"Guys let’s keep in mind that it’s a budget phone and there shouldn’t be any over expectations from this, as I can see in some of the negative reviews. It’s a fantastic phone for the money that we pay! Speed, touch, camera, display and sound are all decent enough!  I would recommend this phone for the basic use for parents and students. If you are the one who  loads the  phone with multiple Apps, pics and videos...are a camera and speed freak...look for something else."
3,Prose:1. Nice look2. Big diaplay3. 4gb/64gb configuration at 9500₹4. Battery is satisfactoryCons:1. Display response is slow. While receiving call some times you have to touch screen 3-4 times.2. Fingerprint unlock option is not available. Which should have been included. Face unlock is given but with mask on face it won't work.3. Camera quality is below average. It doesn't bother me as I'm not fond of photos and selfie.4. Sound of speaker is low.
5,"Awesome Mobile at this price, Had no issues with my Mobile which i got delivered, First the camera looked Blurry while taking shots,I was schocked, but the processed image on video or picture in gallery was super good i dosnt look like a 13Mp camera, The mobile has no heating issues with day to day usage, Dont play Too Instesive games with this one,Display and aspect ratio is super cool and  it supports 15 W fast charging, not a lot of bloatware too, Face Unlock worked on low light conditions too, The seller delivered the mobile the next day itself was a surprise with normal delivery, Overall Perfect mobile if you are not planning to do heavy Gaming on this one... Redmi 9 has some good specs too But its build quailty comes nowhere near to this one and Redmi 9 Build quality cant keep up with the hardware it has prolly end in a Overheating mobile ,Satisfied with the purchase overall Hope this is helpful..."
1,"Editing review :After almost 4 months of use, the display has developed a flickering issue.Please note, the device did not fall nor the display has had any damage.Have tried factory resetting phone and also cleaning up system cache but to no Vail.The system stress test passes as well..Tried contacting samsung help centre but no response..Didn't expect such after sales service from samsung !"
1,He product is defective and has a display problem. Very disappointing.
1,Do not buy this phone... Samsung failed on my expectations.Replaced once due to phone camera quality issues. Phone failed on Amazon quality test software. 2nd replaced phone is also remotely inspected by Samsung customer care executive (remotely) and found faulty. Waiting for Amazon service executive visit for final report.
1,Main draw back of this phone is there is no finger lock option  & while calling its starts eco & you can hear ur own voice
5,"(This is my wife's account) I have been using the phone for last 3 weeks now. I am a moderate kind of user, love to use same phone for years and not much into heavy gaming. The phone is my 3rd Samsung phone over last 7 years. It functions very smooth and feels much more expensive in actual. I have compared the phone with my wife's M31s bought 3 months back and found reasonably good considering the price I have paid, 4GB variant @ Rs. 7600.00/- (Amazon discount + SBI card offer + 500 off from amazon coupon).+ve : Good performance for moderate users, absolutely no heating at any point of time, great battery life, overall excellent looks and built quality.-ve: Doesn't support HD - 1080p streaming, camera quality is fine for me but could have been better.Finally, if anyone wants a phone even in 10k price which would do justice to every aspect a smart phone is designed for and not a big camera lover, go for it."
1,"Read this before you buy1. No dual band Wi-Fi. It won't detect JioFiber 5GHz network. Only detects a 2.4GHz  Wi-Fi. All modern mobile and even a 8 years old iPad detects 5GHz network.2. No fingerprint sensor3. Though they claimed Headphone in description, it did not came in the box.4. Camera performs below average.5. Sound quality is not impressive."
4,"Overall performance of the phone is great. But camera quality is not upto the expectation redmi 9 prime has good camera quality at this price. Apart from camera , it's a good phone to buy at this price."
5,"As the product suggest. It has got a big screen and is worth watching binge in it.Battery backup is good as of now .The touch is smooth and doesn't  have any lag.Coming to the camera:Front camera is not that promising . It lags a bit.However,  I am happy with the back camera. The resolution l, wide camera and the clarity never let's you down.I haven't tried  playing a high resolution game yet.However basic game's,  like Candycrush, farmhouse, rail tycoon can be played in a jiffy.Coming to security, the phone only supports  pin,pattern and face recognition. It doesn't have finger print which is a small issueHowever  I loved the phones overall performance.  Strongly recommended"
3,Value for money. The rear camera is not that good. All apps auto updating always thereby new apps are not getting downloaded. Samsung recommended or China apps are getting automatically downloaded which is not needed. Battery life is ok and comes for 2 days at fully data on position. While in pant pocket the screen display rotates to landscape automatically even if auto rotate function is switched off. It will not come back to portrait if u held mobile vertical and u have to switch on auto rotate to make it normal. This is embarrassing
5,"I am writing the review after use of about 1 day. I purchased it for my mother. She is very happy to have it. Aa she was earlier user of Samsung basic mobile and she used the mobile for about 6 years. So now she upgraded to smartphone of this brand because in her opinion Samsung mobiles are long lasting. In my opinion:-  Display- 4.5/5  Battery- 5/5  Camera- 5/5  Performance- 4/5  Look- 4/5  Value for money- 4.5/5Display is good and bright as usual Samsung display are always of better quality.  Sound is not best but okay. Look is good but need improvement in back design as it seems to be a cheap plastic material. Battery has no complaints. Camera specially front camera is surprisingly good. But performance should be improved as somtime touch is less responsive.so if you are multitasker and heavy user of mobile then itz not for you. but keeping the price in mind 7299 rs for 3gb ram and 32 gb storage its a fair deal as you are attached to Samsung brand which is better than cheap chinese mobiles like Mi, Oppo, etcPlz don't forget to like if fou find my review helpful 👍"
1,performance was very bad if I open the application that time hang my phone with in 3 seconds and when I rotate the video on landscape mode that time video has slowly moved
4,"Dont expect much from this phone, this is a average user phone, phone will be  lag if using more apps, but its decent for this price, value for money.  Best for Basic to Android upgraders."
1,"I ordered the phone as soon as it was launched. When I received the phone, the camera was not working properly. Everything was very blurry and phone was very slow.I placed a return request. I then received the replacement piece. Camera was working this time but after 1 day use, I noticed that nobody called me the whole day when I generally receive around 10 calls. When I tried calling from another number, it said that the number is out of coverage area when jio had good network reception and VoLTE was on. I have a placed a return request for second time now."
5,"Why did i purchased?1.For using wifi hotspot, instead of my primary phone2.To make or receive Emergency calls either from office or other personalsWhat did i liked most?1.Good Build quality2.Good Display, excellent quality3.Good signal reception, clear voice quality.4.economy price.5.Good Battery6.Latest operation system.7.Dolby atmos(good for music lovers)8.hotspotWhat makes you disappoint?Usb port should be ctype.Finally, what did you say?This is the excellent phone in this price range.Can be used as wifi hotspot and standby phone.This phone is only for basic usage like listening music, simple  voice calls, chatting, watching youtube, surfing net.Not recommended for gamers and heavy users.And display supports upto 720p only.Note:In initial setup, you may face lag and struck in youtube videos. But once after setup completed,restart  the phone.Everything  will get settled up."
3,"So I recieved the phone a few days back. And I will be using this phone as my primary phone. So I will keep this brief and almost to the point.Build quality- tacky looking, good, but can be improved for future budget phones. I got grey color, and it's not metallic, my mum says the rear looks like shahbadi floor tiles. Not an insult. Anyways I like it, but it's not metallic.Screen- personally, I am happy with it, touch feedback is nice too, but ofcourse not like 20k+ range phones.touch is very responsive in the calculator app.Battery- well 5000mah, good, it's quite more than necessary for me but good.Camera- macro camera- took a fair enough macro shot, 2mp. 3.2mp would have been a sweet spot in budget yet good quality. Front and main camera yet to test fully. Night time photos? Forget it. Honestly even most mid range phones don't fare well in night.Processor power- its not a powerful chip to begin with, but fine, I am going to manage with it. For others, the phone is a bit laggy/slow in some aspects..or most. Camera takes a good whole second or 2 to start, the viewfinder flow is not smooth and laggy/glitchy.but I like the wide and macro combination. SHOULD'VE BEEN 3.2MP :'(More apps= bit more lag while entering main menu. So the less no of apps, should suffice. I opened a bunch of apps, including 3 Google tabs in browser, and many apps, lag was not severe slowdown, but was a little slower than before or it's slow to begin with and didn't really have high expectations. Using the device care and/or restarting the phone did feel better and smoother, but took a good whole 7 to 10 seconds for the live wallpaper to load. Talking of wallpapers, even being samsing OneUI, there is no option for galaxy themes :(I am not gonna do any major gaming on this so I cannot say anything on it's regard, I prefer pc gaming. But don't expect much, however if you really want have a  experience where you'd feel better/happy with the purchase, I'd suggest playing classic games like Mario, crash bandicoot etc. Some game suggestions- Dadish, alto.I will update this review after a week/months use. And finally a half/full year update.If you have a budget of atleast 10k then I'd suggest buying some other samsung product or your preference. I've used the m31s and compared to this, that phone is way smooth, and many more models out there. But if you want a entry level phone, or coming from a feature phone, budget constraints, secondary phone. Then this is the phone to go with.  I personally like my m02 quite a bit."
1,"Phone is very slow& heats up quickly. I replace the first piece. Received the replacement the very next day, thanks to amazon. But the second handset was even worse as it got extremely heated even before it was set up completely. Returning it also."
1,"No wireless display as specified and camera not working evertime, quality is poor, even though 13mpixel, it's like VGA camera.. pictures are blur..please don't waste your money.."
3,Average Smartphone.....😵
4,"Mobile is good for simple use but pathetic camera , no fingerprint sensor and old processor which makes it slow for a phone in 2021 .  I purchased it as my secondry phone, display is really awesome and light weight with sleek design. For better deal opt for micromax IN 1B if you can compromise on display and will use as primary phone  .But the conclusion is samsung's quality and customer care cannot be compared with any other brand  in india .If you want a secondry phone then its a perfect choice at this price"
5,"At a first glance phone looks decent one. It has almost all the features except finger print but it's ok in this price range. Checked the sound quality, camera, internet speed. All seems to be fine. For a basic user it's a good choice. Will review further after using few more days."
5,The product is best value for money and only watch it as a budget smartphone
1,Performance and display is not as per standard. Pale display....it looka like a duplicate screen. Performance is so slow that even opening a calculator take 5sec of lag to open. It seems this phn is either refurbished version of some older phone. Samsung has not delivered such low standard phn till now.
1,"Reason to buy :1. Very stylish looks . u found a premium quality.2. Big display.3. Battery is good.Reason not to buy1. It's like a Scorpio with auto""s engine.App load time is long2. Camara just a scrap.3. Speaker is very very bad. Burst speaker.Over all don't buy this . if you don't want anything more than call nd need only a good looking ph then only buy or either go for poco c3,redmi 9a"
1,I have used 3 or 4 samsung phones with this price tag. But this phone model is disappointing me.I found below issues in the phone that i received from this seller. Not sure about other users.1. Call volume is low.2. Performance issue.3. Phone hangs in the middle without loading the website completely.4. Very heavy but ( i did not notice it when i ordered. This is my mistake).5. Call disconnection but not very frequently.There is no option for refund. But it has only exchange with the same model.I returned this mobile . Am waiting for replacement phone. Let us see how the new phone of same model works.
2,Good in screen size. Average phone in the price range. 👍Camera 📷 worst-: On the name of samsung it's very bad. 👎Battery🔋backup-: It's is good can run full day.👍Speed~RAM-: Don't even think of playing any game. It's lag vere very much even while playing Temple Run in 3gb variant.👎Memory management-: it's come with 32gb internal memory in with 10gb is allready consume by system software.👎Overall ~ If you are purchasing this phone for only calling purpose then go for it. 👍Don't think of playing a single 50-100Mb game u won't be able to play on this device 🙏
3,"Writing this review after couple of days of using. First I ordered this and received a slow item, then I replaced the item and thanks to Amazon I have received the replacement within 1 day. But, the replacement item is still slow. Hence, I have decided to return the item.PROS:1. Big Screen2. Huge Battery Life3. 3GB of RAM4. 32GB of Internal Storage6. Latest Android OSCONS:1. MediaTek Processor (after having 3GB of RAM, the phone takes 2 seconds to open Chrome and 1.5 seconds to open contact list)2. Hangs After Playing GamesVERDICT:You can go for this phone if you are looking for a secondary phone or you are gifting this to your parents. This phone is not for them who will watch movies, play games and hinging on social media apps."
5,* Display is very good* Battery Backup Excellent* Stylish Mobile* YouTube Videos playing without buffering
1,"Guys if you are looking for a smartphone Please do not buy this product. Reasons are given below1. Battery life is not upto the Mark even in power saving mode. Drained very fast in just 15 hrs. If you watch movie then ot will drain in 4 hrs only.2. Camera. Both front and rear camera are just like vga camera. No quality of Megapixels.3. Hangs a lot. Takes too much to unlock and don't have a fingerprint scanner as well. No facelock option.4. Many times it dont show the caller number on screen for 5 to 10 seconds.When you are working on it and someone calls you then only ringtone will play first and small icon will appear on the top after 5-10 seconds. Unknown no. by truecaller will show when you disconnect call.5. I have not installed any game as it hangs in normal operation.6. Screen width is not upto mark,as keys of keyboard come closer. You will feel uncomfortable while typing.7. Sound quality is low, as no proper music beats.8. When you are on call the screen automatically flash and touch enables.Samsung should recall this model. Worst ever phone. You can add 2000 more and can get better phone than this."
2,"Phone is little bit slow hanging in first start , below average camera quality both front and rear , plastic back but at this price point cant expect more. But we can expect good Qualcomm Snapdragon processor or exynos ...long charger wirePros - good battery not yet checked , bright and clear screen, latest update today via OTA,Cons- very small charger wire and it is unacceptable, below average camera, very slow phone , plastic cheap quality,I suggest spend bit more on good specification phone don't just go with Samsung..."
5,"Best smartphone in this prize,nice display, battery life best,but I want to more features like, screen shot and screen recorder too."
1,"First I was happy that Samsung rolled out a budget phone under 7000 Rs. but later got disappointed that we have to bear slow processor. The processor is quite slow and the phone started hanging as soon as I booted for the very first time. Along with this drawback, the display is very cheap when it comes to expecting a nice one from a brand like Samsung. I would suggest not to go with the brand value but see the specifications before you buy and don't make the mistake which I made."
4,"3/32gb variant @ 7299/- is good deal with samsung brand. Quad-core MediaTek MT6739 Processor is outdated & slow but adequate for basic usage. No lagging for whatsApp, fb, YouTube.  Display & Screen resolution is great as well as battery backup. 10W charger took more than 3.5hr for full charging. Cameras are average considering price point."
4,"This is my first personal Samsung phone, and what better model to start with! Using it for a week  now and everything is functioning as it should. Very good display, sound and maneuverability overall.  Only one thing :  The mobile's data cable could really have been a bit longer. Other than that the phone is working fine. The best thing is the 5000mAH battery,  which I am enjoying. :-) Truly  a value for money.Will update if I find any other significant matter in the coming days."
4,Product is just ok if you have another phone. I use iPhone n I took it as some apps have xtra features in android.Phone has a good battery. Processor is not good enough so it’s a little slagging. Design is good. Display is too bright if u hold it straight with ur eyes as it’s a tft lcd.  I hope in future updates mobile will become a little smoother.  It is very rare that you will get every update time to time in this price. But I am sure u r not going to get a better choice in this price. If you have money shortcomings you can consider it!!Have a nice day ahead!!
2,I ONLY USE FOR MAKING CALLS.WHATSAPP VIDEOS ONE OR TWO I SEE AT THE MAXIMUM.MOBILE LOOKS GOOD.NO ONE CAN TALK ILL ABOUT SAMSUNG DISPLAY OR CAMERA.AS USUAL BATTERY FAILS.IN THIS CASE ATTERY DRAINS EVERYDAY I NEED TO CHARGE EVENTHOUGH I DIDNOT PLAY ANY GAME OR SEE MEDIA.IF WE PUT FULL CHARGE ATLEAST IT SHOULD LAST FOR ONE FULL DAY.MORNING IF IT IS 100 PERCENT EVENING IT COMES AROUND 35 PERCENT.CURSE FOR SAMSUNG.
5,Best samsung mobile in this price category.Thank you Amazon.
2,"I would not recommend this product to any age group.This mobile has most slowest processor, even on first day you feel like you are operating crashed system.Go for bit higher prise product you Will not regret."
5,"If we compare the product quality with the price, definitely it is a value for money device for your daily usage.Battery life is very good, charging is a bit slow but ok.Look wise the phone gives a decent look from back side which can be increased by using back cover.Front side look is awsm.Screen size is good for gaming and movies, performance is great even in sunlight.Camera quality is absolutely fine.Definitely you can go for this having a branded logo on back."
5,A wonderful value for money! I had asked it as a extra side phone. It provides excellent prolonged battery life and beautiful design that doesn't get you off. The performance is obviously not as fast as premium phones in terms of speed if you want to use as a multi purpose phone. But basic apps just do all fine.
1,Defective Item was received.IMEI number is not displaying when dialing the required number.Requested for a refund but exchange partner has refused to collect it despite raising a request within 24 hours.Please check the seller on Amazon before purchasing your products.
3,The phone gets very hot with minimal use.Editing the review after the phone was replaced. This time got the right product and it works pretty well.Guess it was a faulty product to begin with. Happy with Amazon. Samsung needs to do their quality checks better.
5,Just amazing..Battery back up to video quality as well as net working and perform too fast..
5,"Very good budget phone with big screen. Support is only for 2.4ghz WiFi and not support 5ghz WiFi which user is missing compared to other manufacturers smartphone around same price range. Charger point is not so smooth to insert the charging pin and seems it might cause priblem after an year use, but need to see how it copes with."
5,One  of Best mobile phone in this range💪 truely💪awesome
3,After using this device for 5 days I can share some pros and consPros-1- Budget smartphone from Samsung at this price range.2- Screen is better in performance.3- 5000 mAh battery life stands upto 24 hours after watching videos for 5 hours and calling. (Couldn't play game)4- Picture quality is average.Cons-1- The device lags and sometimes hang on performing easy steps like shifting app to app.2- Multitask becomes difficult as it is slow in performance.3- Camera is not upto the mark.4- Doesn't feel premium while holding the phone.5- due to bigger battery the mobile feels heavy. (206 gms)6- Found bugs like-(1) Pressing power button takes time to wake and sleep the screen.(2) Home screen zooms upto 300% without activating.(3) Opening camera stucks for upto 5-10 sec sometimes.(Will update more if found)Thanks!
5,Good quality product.. working perfectly. No defects found on mobile. Good quality rear cameras and good quality front cameras. Good sound quality.  Good display quality . Light weight . Good touch sensitive. Designs and colours are good . In this price mobile  is good. Phone back Is made of plastic. Good performance ram no lag coming . Android 10 installed . After we connect internet  to phone we get updations of all. Totally good mobile. Total 10 gb is used in rom 22 gb Is balance.
1,Believe me guys don't make mistake you will regret. This phone hangs a lot even at normal task like opening notification panel or settings or receiving calls. Better go for other brands if you are tight with your budget they buy new Gionee phones Gionee F103 pro was my first phone there are some software update problem but except that everything runs much smoother than this M02 and note it this Gionee phone was 5 years old and still you can play COD in it. Even i have played pubg recently before it was ban. Now i ordered new mobile because i was getting battery issue in my Gionee handset and trusted Samsung but i got something more bad than previous phone.Don't buy it!
1,Pathetic performance of the phone. My father in law was using old redmi 3i for past many years. Since it's battery was almost gone i bought this useless mobile with weakest processor. Opening a dialer itself takes 3-4 seconds. I didn't imagine this like sluggishness of the mobile from Samsung. Better i would've gone with xiomi or realme. Wasted Rs.7500.. lets see how long will it work
4,"So I ordered this phone 20 days ago I guessAs i got a good exchange offer for my repaired handset i only paid 900.About the product-The screen quality is awesome at this price point, the battery is also promising, build quality is above average however it doesn’t offer fingerprint which is pretty basic even at this price.The main concern with this handset is the ram management on this one creates problem. The multitasking can’t be done fluently and yes it lags a bitTo me I purchased this handset for my 2.5 years old niece as she loves watching videos throughout the day. So for us it was a health purchase but for those who want to use this as a primary phone. Please increase your budget otherwise you will be irritated."
5,"Thankyou Amazon. It's worth the price plus got it on discount... Yippee... The phone is light weight which is good. At this price, the phone is superb... 😃😃😃"

4,Mobile phone awesome. But unboxing my parcel my charger is some of dusty & charger not working
5,"I bought this phone for my dad as he is not much techno savvy. This is a perfect phone for basic use in your budget. Dual Sim, good battery, nice torch light, basic camera expandable memory and the best feature is speaker radio which my dad enjoys a lot! All these features under 1.3k which you'll not find in any other brand in this price."
5,Good item . Working perfectly.  Good quality.  Good keypad . Good display.  Good performance.  Good sound. Good colours and design. Good at this price..
4,I ordered dis mb for my father-in-law. Der was a sound problem with his lastly used mb.but dis mb D sound quality is good.
1,Totally disappointed with the phone and it's Contact number search options. It displays total all names that which has the single letter even in the middle and last of the name. We have search all the the names for the single contact name.It also display the dial pad numbers very small
1,The product that I received clearly seems to be a used one. The battery was already inserted. There was no initial screen guard (sticker) to protect the screen. There are scratches on the screen. The handsfree is missing that I supposed to receive as mentioned in the product description. Overall pathetic experience with the seller and the product.Can't comment on the product as I could not use it.
5,Very good product.Very good Ring sounds.Thank you
4,Worth the money paid. But for elderly it could have been more user friendly. Basic features like sound and button aren't the best.
4,Good design and valuable devices
1,"Default password ""0000"" or ""1234"" for anti theft function not work. Customer care ask me to go service center Which is 120km away from my place.Product is good but after sale service is very bad. Specially if you live away from big cities."
3,"its a good 👍 👌 product but saved number very small pictures quality not good mobile phones good  big battery valuable mobile, good keypad, led tourch not any gaming available for free"
1,After 28 days battery damage and because of battery mobile cover also damage bad experience from micromax and Amazon. And battery back also poor don't buy this phone.
1,The phone is dead after 2 month of purchase no service center found in my area
1,Writing this review after one month of use.. I hv never had lik this experience.. battery life of the mobile is very low.. y these people are making such a good review about this waste phone... I don't know what to do now.. never ever buy it again
4,"It is avery good feacher phone at this prize ,thear are some need to improove bettry,sound quality,sound is so much loud but not clear , display is bright,body very good quality, charger very good quality, earphones is average, overall value for money."
5,"I bought this mobile for my mother in law , she just loved it, easy to use and it has very big torch light which gives bright light."
5,Battery life v.good but takes lot of time for charging. Sound quality clear and I can say the phone is value for money. The phone is good for old aged people.
3,"There is no sound in the speaker, unable to hear properly."
5,Every  thing  is perfect......Better than Samsung and nokia.....in this segment  ....
5,"So good product,must buy for any citizen who cannot afford smartphones,the camera is good for that phone,the microphone is super and the speaker works greatly,the torch is very nice and the auto call recording function is so superb"
4,"I gift this phone to my mom.. Really phone was amazing...Light weight, display ,But sound quality very poor"
5,Good one for budget and don’t have any issue after 1month
5,Big size battery and sound not a good but ok quality very better
4,I need a basic phone in order to have more battery for talk where we can't expect in smart phone
5,"Greatest deal for Snapdragon 750 that too with Samsung. Buy blindly.There are many comments on display quality.But it doesn't matter that much , what we have to see in buying 5G phone is future proof.Buying 90hz display with cheap processor won't last you for year.This phone has one of the best 5G processor SD 750 which can last longer than others.There are few 5G mobiles Under 20 k which offers better display than this 1. Oppo A74: but in this the processor you get SD 480 , which is the basic version of 5G processor and below par than SD 750.2. Oppo a53s: which uses mediatek dimension 700 . Please don't compare media Tek Vs Snapdragon.Final verdict: You have to decide what you want. If you really looking for best 5G features under 20 k then blindly go for M42. Since no other company offers SD 750 processor for less than 20 k."
5,"Edit after a month of usage -1. Best in class battery - Full charge lasts over 2 days without fail2. Fast processor - I have more than 50 apps installed, but phone works without a glitch3. Camera - No one can beat Samsung in camera build and quality!Buy without a thought :)Got the phone delivered on same day of the sale/ launch. Super happy with whatever less I have used it till now. 😊"
1,Not.much excited compare to other all
2,"Please don't waste your money on this phone, I got attracted to the exchange offer as they are offering a higher discount. But looks like it's just a marketing trick.. they rejected the exchange offer at the time of delivery.. my phone had no scratches, no dents, no cracks, by citing some minor issues.. and I had to pay the balance amount to take the delivery.At this price point, there are many other phones/variants in the market with better features. The Display is not good at all with only HD+ whereas there are many phones in the market which are half the price with FHD+ feature. You can very well compare all the icons and graphics are pixilated.Moreover, only SIM1 is 5G, SIM2 is limited to 4G, no dedicated MicroSD slot.. its a hybrid sim slot."
5,"Got this for my mom. She loves it. The battery is amazing considering the fact that she uses the light mode while I use the dark mode. It comes with some junk but those can be uninstalled the phone is not heavy and the screen is amazing. I was skeptical about the hd display thing but the point is very few people can't differentiate between 1080 and 720 p. I definitely can't tell the difference.. The display is amazing. A freind told me that the charger is slow compared to other companies. The thing is my father's Samsung is still working fine and it's j5 prime , that's 5 years .. My stock Android had a 10 watt charger n 3000 mah n it works well, yes I play cod and all. Point it I feel that slower chargers preserve the battery decay better. Maybe it's just a feeling anyhow. I'm quite happy with the phone. The missing features on the camera will be fixed with a few updates as Samsung always does and in case it doesn't that's fine too . Phone is smooth and might heat on the first few charges but it will go away . It's quite light and slim and the best part is Samsung promises 3 year Android upgrades and four year security upgraded . The hd display with 750 gives great battery and smoothness . Amazon did an amazing job at delivery during this pandemic."
3,"I bought the phone after getting attracted to the banners only and here's what i found out after that:Pros - 5,000 mah Battery is Very good can go upto 2 days without charge, true 48 mp quad camera is upto the mark as expected from samsung, 750 g processor is excellent, 5G bands are supportive with more frequencies and lastly, Knox security plays a big role in making it better.Cons - Display is really bad only HD+ instead Samsung should have gone with FHD+ with this price and it has only 266 PPI which makes it even worse only thing good in display is that it is Super Amoled, In-box Charger is only 15W which is also dissapointing and aslo there wasn't any soft case inside the box or pre-applied screen protector."
1,No Pre-installed screen guard. No basic back cover. Short charging cable. Cheap packaging. Too much cost cutting. Disappointed.
1,Please don't buy this. Display graphics quality is very very bad and charger is also cheap quality
2,Positive..1. Design2. Built Quality Premium3. Snapdragon 7504. 5G5. Samsung PayNegative1. Always on Display not available (which is very common)2. Camera Quality not much impressive3. Very Common UI interfaceVerdict.Only buy for 5G other than not very much impressive.. it cost should bhi only 15k then justified.
5,Decent performance by Snapdragon 750GSuper Amoled 👌Camera 👌Battery life 👌Plastic back 👎Overall look 👌Fast charge 👎HD + display 👎 (but it not look like hd+)Overall rating 8/10
1,poor quality disply .resolution very low . totaly bad phone . never buy
5,Awesome PhoneAwesome CameraLong Lasting Battery Life5G SupportGood displayGo for it blindliy..HeadPhone Jack also providedAlso a good nonchinese phone for budget gamers😎⚡
1,"I used to zoom the screen share in MS Teams in Asus Max Pro M1  - which was quite crystal clear view . But i exchanged that phone with Samsung M42 and i regret now. If i zoom the MSTeams Screen share , everything is blur and not clear . Please regret from buying this product . Its waste of Money.Updated:I uploaded two videos of flickering issue in YouTube. Please watch and decide"
1,Pixelated display clearly visible.Poor resolution.Totally disappointed with the display quality. Not expected this from Samsung.Wost buy !
5,"I got this phone for my mother and she usually  uses her phone for long term ie 3-4 yrs. In that sense this phone is future proof been a 5g ready. Also it has very good processer(great performance), good camera n decent battery. Overall happy with the product which I bought at rs 18500!!!"
5,"About exchange: someone gave a review here on amazon that the exchange offer is a scam, no it's not, I got this device on the exchange offer only and things went smoothly.Look I know there are some cons that shouldn't have been and many reviewers have already listed it here and on various other platforms, but this is a mobile and it's working and it's good. The feel and look are amazing and it's not at all heavy, it's compatible with good gaming performance. Since it is a plastic body so while charging it might heat initially but as it reaches 100% it gradually cools down, and once charged it lasts a whole day even with video calls or gaming/ When you visit the settings section there are various amazing features, themes are super cool. Overall a good buy and many have written such negative reviews according to their perspective, due to which others will think the mobile is a total piece of crap when it's not, and trust me it's a good one and you can ask me questions if you have any doubts."
1,"Pros.1) Samsung Pay ( Which they are accepting only few bank card's).Cons.1) Worst Display Quality ( Even App Icons text also Blurred)2) Taking 2 hour's 30 minutes for full charge.3) If you use mobile for normal browsing and basic use of WhatsApp battery was coming to 52% percent in 1 hour.4) Very Short Charging cable was Given.5) I have 100 mbps internet connection but this mobile hardly Taking 20 MBPS, I tested with myself old mobile it is Taking 50 MBPS.6) THOSE WHOSE PLAY PUBG THIS MOBILE IS HELL FOR THEM WORST GAMING EXPERIENCE, HANGS A LOT. (THIS ones has 6gb ram but it actually performs likes 3 ram mobile).7) finger print sensor was very slow,  FACE RECOGNITION IS DUMB.8) ABOUT CAMERA ( After facing all this I didn't check that as if I check it will definitely fail to impress).9) When I saw the mobile design after opening the box , It remembers you the Chinese mobiles design which was in 2015 with back door open to change the battery."
2,"Phone is a decent one, it has average camera and its display is relatively good for 720P since it's a s.amoled. I have noticed whenever I try to open the folder on the extreme end by any thumb, the touch doesn't get sensed, instead I have to press directly on the folder icon by the other thumb, I don't know what's the reason behind this. Apart from this software is good, but I hate the way bloatwares are been added and there is no option to uninstall Netflix or some apps. Even to torcher the user, there is automatic download of mojo app and some useless apps, hence u have to stop the auto install and other app features on galaxy store. The most concerned thing is we don't have always display on feature and the carrier aggregation. Unfortunately even the Samsung helpdesk doesn't know that this feature is not available in this phone. There are many minor issues which samsung has to fix with updates if they decide to do it.  To the given price I personally had expected better from samsung, but it's just ok. If they update the software patch it would be a good phone."
1,Camera not good
5,Using m42 5g for 2 days now and here is my review i like the battery backup it's very awesome and while buying this phone i was bit worried about it's 720p display but it's not even noticable in day to day life use so u can buy this I bought m42 5g for my father and he is so satisfied and i have use so many smartphone till the date and i got the best battery backup on this one fingerprint is like ok ok not so fast not so slow it's average and for any questions u can ask from me 😊
2,"Display quality is very vary poor for this segment of phone, otherwise I would have given it five star."
5,"Pretty Decent for daily usage. Remember the Brand Name Samsung - Don't go with the review. Snapdragon works well. Features like Samsung Pay, Knox Security and big display looks awesome 👌.  Just go ahead 😀👍👌👏"
3,Looks and colour is stylish talking about camera and battery is not at good quality
1,Am upset of weak resolution display of this mobile... it's not up to the mark ... images is also average
4,"I made right choice eventhough initially was skeptical.Though it is not a superman but an reliable  all rounder.  Before this moto g5 s plus was my all rounder.  I am not a gamer a normal user.What I liked most:1. Battery. Refer my battery observations below.2. Lag free response.3. Decent camera, though colors are over done.4. Wifi Calling is working great with Airtel sim.5. No call drop or interruptions as I faced with moto  since at my home the mobile signal strength is low.What I didn't  like1. Too big for my convenience, cannot keep in jeans pocket and in shirt pocket will be protruding.2. Samsung Apps and other default apps which cannot be Uninstalled.3. Some missing features : Poor Keypad heptics, Alarm  cannot be repeated for certain dates, etc 4.  Ring tone and alarm volume is low. if there is any other noise difficult to hear.Battery:Charging time nearly 2 hrs  when phone is switched off.1st recharge 100%:At end of 48 hrs 5% remaing.Light usage only -  20 minutes of mobile call. 1 hr You tube video, 1 hr Watsapp video, installing 10 apps, some small and wats app message sending and reading. Throught 2 sims , Bluetooth, location and wifi all where active.2nd recharge 100%:At end of 56hrs 5% remain. Usage is almost 75% compared to 1st recharge."
4,"Have been using the phone for 3 days and the only drawback is the display of the phone. If you don't mind the display, then it is a very good phone that is also future ready. The cameras are also decent. The looks of the phone are amazing. You can go for it if you don't watch YouTube or stream videos on your phone."
1,"I have purchased this model 1 day back, but I was facing performance issue on network connectivity. And my sim2 is not working in this device. With 4GB Ram what ever apps are running the same apps are not able to work with 8GB Ram. It is the defective piece.And the support is also worst where they are not able to give the refund of the amount. They are suggesting to use the same model again with the defects. They don't require any customer satisfaction."
3,"The phone was bought for using in online classes. The voice quality was poor. My students were unable to hear me with a distance of 2 feet from the device. Replaced it once, but the replacement aslo had the same issue."
5,"One day delivery by Amazon as committed..About phone- posting review after 2days of use- not very heavy, good features, battery life is good more than 1day, fast processing, superb camera"
5,Battery  for normal use  almost 2daysBoth Camera is very goodDisplay could have  FHD+ but OKNo heating issueAndroid 11  don't see big change from  Android 9Ear speaker voice vibrates in phone body5G not in service as of now...Overall Good as on 5 days review...
5,"M42 5G 8gb/128gb is a wonderful phone  and true to its specifications. In the few days I have used it I have found it very convenient to use. No heating issue, no lag in flipping through the pages, opening of Apps etc. Response to commands is fast. On screen finger sensor works good as it responds fast enough. Hopefully the 5G functions would also work to our satisfaction. It is a very good buy at its price and it is made in India."
1,This particular model has a faulty microphone that you can notice while video calling and if you ask your 5 year old child to speak on the microphone the other side will hardly be able to hear anything. I exchanged my first phone and still had the issue you with the second phone so it is very very clear that this is the issue with the model itself ...to anyone who has purchased this particular phone I challenge them please bring your kid on a whatsapp call and ask the other other person on other side to listen and identify what the child is saying ..I bet they will not be able to to hear anything at all so good luck to all the people who have purchased this defective model. . This is not expected from a brand leader like Samsung
5,Good mobile handset with nice look
5,"Today Dt.06May2021, I have received it with awesome packaging by Amazon.Battery : For full charge (0% to 100%) it takes 2 hours 15 minutes as expected (15w charger not Bad).Display : Awesome display even it's Super AMOLED, HD+ resolution with 720 x 1600 pixels resolution.Camera : Very good.Software : One UI 3.1, Android 11Mobile Appearance : Excellent especially backside it looks amazing glossy finish.After usage couple of weeks,  its really great in terms of performance,  battery of this mobile. Very much appreciated below 20K price. One can buy without second thought."
5,Got this 8GB 5G phone at an unbelievable price. Here are my observationsPro's:-1. Big Larger Display2. On screen finger print sensor3. Expecting better battery performanceCons:-1. Though ordered a black phone received a white charger2. Either 2 SIM or 1 SIM + 1 SDSlot3. Could have provided a rubber silicon case
1,"I am facing problem while calling someone, the call gets connect but their is no audio from my side means the other person doesn't hear my voice .please  provide me the solution or replace it"
5,Battery back up is good last atleast 3 days with normal usuage.Camera is decent. Overall happy with the buy.
3,"Perfect things about the phone are weight is manageable, phone is slim, attractive look, camera is fine,The only and most important thing is the disappointing display quality (hd+). Expect much much better amoled HDR display at ₹21000.You can literally see the pixels with naked eyes.Second worst thing is you cannot return the product."
5,"Great productPros:1)excellent processor. ( can feel the change. My previous phone was samsung A5 2016.)2) Excellent battery backup. (Till date. Run 1day with all sensors)3) can't realize the 720 pixel display4) camera as usual maintains its quality.5) obviously 5G (don't know, waiting only)6)My favorite Secret folderCons1) To charge the phone it takes 2h normally. (major issue)2) absence of punch hole front camera3) expecting 64 or 108 MP primary camera4) After knowing 720 p display it may disturb you.5) I personally love side fingerprint reader.6)Samsung Please provide Headphone (no headphone, No cover)"
5,Excellent smartphone with 5g connection.... Especially samsung provides this.... It is really proper smartphone as it has SD750g processors.... It has one of the interesting features which is knox security special private protection.1. Build quality - super2. Display - hd+ sAMOLED3. Connection - 5g network especially4. Security - knox5. Camera- 48+8+5+5/20mp selfi6. Finally in display fingerprint....I love all the above features. I have become fan of Samsung m42.... Love it...

There are many minor issues which samsung has to fix with updates if they decide to do it.  To the given price I personally had expected better from samsung, but it's just ok. If they update the software patch it would be a good phone."
1,Camera not good
5,Using m42 5g for 2 days now and here is my review i like the battery backup it's very awesome and while buying this phone i was bit worried about it's 720p display but it's not even noticable in day to day life use so u can buy this I bought m42 5g for my father and he is so satisfied and i have use so many smartphone till the date and i got the best battery backup on this one fingerprint is like ok ok not so fast not so slow it's average and for any questions u can ask from me 😊
2,"Display quality is very vary poor for this segment of phone, otherwise I would have given it five star."
5,"Pretty Decent for daily usage. Remember the Brand Name Samsung - Don't go with the review. Snapdragon works well. Features like Samsung Pay, Knox Security and big display looks awesome 👌.  Just go ahead 😀👍👌👏"
3,Looks and colour is stylish talking about camera and battery is not at good quality
1,Am upset of weak resolution display of this mobile... it's not up to the mark ... images is also average
4,"I made right choice eventhough initially was skeptical.Though it is not a superman but an reliable  all rounder.  Before this moto g5 s plus was my all rounder.  I am not a gamer a normal user.What I liked most:1. Battery. Refer my battery observations below.2. Lag free response.3. Decent camera, though colors are over done.4. Wifi Calling is working great with Airtel sim.5. No call drop or interruptions as I faced with moto  since at my home the mobile signal strength is low.What I didn't  like1. Too big for my convenience, cannot keep in jeans pocket and in shirt pocket will be protruding.2. Samsung Apps and other default apps which cannot be Uninstalled.3. Some missing features : Poor Keypad heptics, Alarm  cannot be repeated for certain dates, etc 4.  Ring tone and alarm volume is low. if there is any other noise difficult to hear.Battery:Charging time nearly 2 hrs  when phone is switched off.1st recharge 100%:At end of 48 hrs 5% remaing.Light usage only -  20 minutes of mobile call. 1 hr You tube video, 1 hr Watsapp video, installing 10 apps, some small and wats app message sending and reading. Throught 2 sims , Bluetooth, location and wifi all where active.2nd recharge 100%:At end of 56hrs 5% remain. Usage is almost 75% compared to 1st recharge."
4,"Have been using the phone for 3 days and the only drawback is the display of the phone. If you don't mind the display, then it is a very good phone that is also future ready. The cameras are also decent. The looks of the phone are amazing. You can go for it if you don't watch YouTube or stream videos on your phone."
1,"I have purchased this model 1 day back, but I was facing performance issue on network connectivity. And my sim2 is not working in this device. With 4GB Ram what ever apps are running the same apps are not able to work with 8GB Ram. It is the defective piece.And the support is also worst where they are not able to give the refund of the amount. They are suggesting to use the same model again with the defects. They don't require any customer satisfaction."
3,"The phone was bought for using in online classes. The voice quality was poor. My students were unable to hear me with a distance of 2 feet from the device. Replaced it once, but the replacement aslo had the same issue."
5,"One day delivery by Amazon as committed..About phone- posting review after 2days of use- not very heavy, good features, battery life is good more than 1day, fast processing, superb camera"
5,Battery  for normal use  almost 2daysBoth Camera is very goodDisplay could have  FHD+ but OKNo heating issueAndroid 11  don't see big change from  Android 9Ear speaker voice vibrates in phone body5G not in service as of now...Overall Good as on 5 days review...
5,"M42 5G 8gb/128gb is a wonderful phone  and true to its specifications. In the few days I have used it I have found it very convenient to use. No heating issue, no lag in flipping through the pages, opening of Apps etc. Response to commands is fast. On screen finger sensor works good as it responds fast enough. Hopefully the 5G functions would also work to our satisfaction. It is a very good buy at its price and it is made in India."
1,This particular model has a faulty microphone that you can notice while video calling and if you ask your 5 year old child to speak on the microphone the other side will hardly be able to hear anything. I exchanged my first phone and still had the issue you with the second phone so it is very very clear that this is the issue with the model itself ...to anyone who has purchased this particular phone I challenge them please bring your kid on a whatsapp call and ask the other other person on other side to listen and identify what the child is saying ..I bet they will not be able to to hear anything at all so good luck to all the people who have purchased this defective model. . This is not expected from a brand leader like Samsung
5,Good mobile handset with nice look
5,"Today Dt.06May2021, I have received it with awesome packaging by Amazon.Battery : For full charge (0% to 100%) it takes 2 hours 15 minutes as expected (15w charger not Bad).Display : Awesome display even it's Super AMOLED, HD+ resolution with 720 x 1600 pixels resolution.Camera : Very good.Software : One UI 3.1, Android 11Mobile Appearance : Excellent especially backside it looks amazing glossy finish.After usage couple of weeks,  its really great in terms of performance,  battery of this mobile. Very much appreciated below 20K price. One can buy without second thought."
5,Got this 8GB 5G phone at an unbelievable price. Here are my observationsPro's:-1. Big Larger Display2. On screen finger print sensor3. Expecting better battery performanceCons:-1. Though ordered a black phone received a white charger2. Either 2 SIM or 1 SIM + 1 SDSlot3. Could have provided a rubber silicon case
1,"I am facing problem while calling someone, the call gets connect but their is no audio from my side means the other person doesn't hear my voice .please  provide me the solution or replace it"
5,Battery back up is good last atleast 3 days with normal usuage.Camera is decent. Overall happy with the buy.
3,"Perfect things about the phone are weight is manageable, phone is slim, attractive look, camera is fine,The only and most important thing is the disappointing display quality (hd+). Expect much much better amoled HDR display at ₹21000.You can literally see the pixels with naked eyes.Second worst thing is you cannot return the product."
5,"Great productPros:1)excellent processor. ( can feel the change. My previous phone was samsung A5 2016.)2) Excellent battery backup. (Till date. Run 1day with all sensors)3) can't realize the 720 pixel display4) camera as usual maintains its quality.5) obviously 5G (don't know, waiting only)6)My favorite Secret folderCons1) To charge the phone it takes 2h normally. (major issue)2) absence of punch hole front camera3) expecting 64 or 108 MP primary camera4) After knowing 720 p display it may disturb you.5) I personally love side fingerprint reader.6)Samsung Please provide Headphone (no headphone, No cover)"
5,Excellent smartphone with 5g connection.... Especially samsung provides this.... It is really proper smartphone as it has SD750g processors.... It has one of the interesting features which is knox security special private protection.1. Build quality - super2. Display - hd+ sAMOLED3. Connection - 5g network especially4. Security - knox5. Camera- 48+8+5+5/20mp selfi6. Finally in display fingerprint....I love all the above features. I have become fan of Samsung m42.... Love it...
5,"Great product by redmi, but I request to redmi please don't make fake sale"
1,Never buy chip quality battery drain issues don't buy
4,"Previous owner of Redmi 7 2gb 32gbRedmi Note 10 4gb 64gb was blazing fastIf you aren't able to buy this wait till Xiaomi release the same in poco with 6gb ram for the same price, like they did with Redmi power with a downgrade in camera, They won't remove the 48mp camera, They may decrease or remove the remaining cameras in poco version of resmi note 10About Amazon sale I logged in to amazon.in in my pc and clicked on join wait list around 12:02, then opened the app and booked the phone I was in queue for almost 20 to 25 minutes, the next step was payment which was a pain in the head, no COD, Note: only upi ids with number@ are accepted, I added a card Note: Check if ecommerce payments is enabled for your cardIn the allocated 15 minutes the order was booked but payment failed, thankfully I was allowed to pay againAlso while I was waiting in queue I got an option to buy the phone 2 ways, lightning deal - 11998, Regular price - 11999 (in Amazon App), I think lightning deal is for those who want to claim offersFirst of all, i bought this phone for basic use online payments, govt apps like Twallet, Tration, Tappfolio, MyGHMC, Digilocker, Aadhaar, Hpgas, Bharatgas, Hmwssb and much more all of them mostly dual appsI am a pc user so I don't use my mobile for gaming or streamingPros:Display : The display is crisp and clear better than my Redmi 7 (not comparing LCD with Amoled)Touch: The touch response is good it's fast, I can type fast in this phone no lag thereMobile data: 4g Data connectivity is superb I can feel the difference between my redmi 7 and this, mostly the download speedFeel: In hand feel is also good, the weight is lessCamera: Best in the segment (obviously if you don't use the stock app)Price: considering how this is priced more than Redmi Note 9 (10999), I am not angry this too will cost the same after 6 months probably will be on exchange and discount by August independence day sale.Cons:Battery: Being amoled this shouldn't consume so much battery, hope Xiaomi fixes this with an updatePlastic back: glossy back (should have come with matte or rough panel for better grip) and little bit of vibration while playing the speakers especially on top near cameraStereo speakers: yep more like dual speakers than stereo (then again Xiaomi never claimed that they support Dolby (Oppo has them and they sound awesome)Verdict: I was waiting for this from almost a year, from the launch of Redmi note 8 and my analysis went way deep, I was looking at Samsung for amoled, Redmi power for stereo speakers and good battery, Poco varient of Redmi note 9 for the processor and decent in the box fast chargerThis covered almost all of them (not fully though)Finally this just serves my purpose, I still aim to buy a good PC, Nothing can beat a desktop ( I wish remix os and phoenix os were as competitive as Windows, remix went out of play long back."
5,"Finally, Xiaomi has decided to design for its Note series of mobiles. This mobile phone is definitely going to be and head Turner when you pull the mobile out of the pocket. It has an almost 1mm protruding camera module on the rear of the mobile. I have bought aqua-green color which has these light gradient shade. The colors are up to your personal preferences.The phone has a matte finish at the back so it is definitely not a fingerprint magnet. It also doesn't feel very heavy and is very easy to hold firmly.🎯DESIGN and DISPLAY:******************************This 6.43-inch display with the Full HD Plus resolution is really good along with a punch-hole selfie camera that offers a seamless user experience.The brightness can go up 1100 nits peak so it is definitely not a difficult thing to use it under sunlight. Xiaomi provided this model with the Widevine L1 DRM certification support for this mobile. So, playing HD videos on an ott platform won't be an issue.Z-axis haptic motor used in this mobile throws more realistic vibrations while playing games. I tried it extensively with a couple of games, the experience was really satisfying. Kudos to Xiaomi for throwing in all the sensors on this mobile especially for not giving up on the remote control sensor.This mobile comes with a lot of preloaded apps like Facebook, LinkedIn, MI remote, MI credit, MI Store, MI pay, share m, etc. Out of these, you can uninstall a couple of apps and you have to live with the remaining apps for the rest of the life.🎯PERFORMANCE:**********************The fingerprint sensor is very sensitive and highly responsive that even if you touch the sensor unintentionally you will end up unlocking the phone. It is that fast. Games like Asphalt 9 and Call of Duty worked excellently without any lag or freezing. This mobile would definitely outscore any mobile under this budget easily.It took 25 to 35 minutes to charge the mobile from 0 to 75% using the 33 Watts charger which came along with the mobile.🎯CAMERA:**************It comes with the 48-megapixel F/1.79 main camera with Sony Sensor and an 8mp ultrawide camera and the remaining two are the macro and the depth sensor.The main camera will let you shoot 4K 30fps video and 960fps 720 p video. When provided with good lighting conditions the main camera gives you a decent output and the Portrait mode also did a good job by blurring out the background gently.The low light images were average and it was decent enough for mobile phones with a budget of 15k.Coming to the selfie camera The Portrait mode worked excellently and the pictures were on a little warm tone than a natural skin tone. If you don't like the warm tone on your selfie pictures then you can fix it through editing apps from Play Store.🎯VERDICT:**************This mobile offers Rock-solid performance for everyday tasks along with very good battery life. This mobile phone comes with MIUI 12.5 so you don't have to worry about future updates for at least the next two years. With AMOLED display and the stereo speakers along with IP53 rating, this has to be the most competent mobile phone under 15000 and a good value for money.I have a YouTube channel: Gizmofeatures (You can also find the unboxing and impressions video there). When Comparing with Poco M3, Moto G10 Power, Samsung M12, you can pick Redmi note 10 any day. It is the best among these Four."
1,"This mobile i used only 3 days and mobile start sucking, and this mobile stuck 6 time in one day.. Most Worst mobile in my life 😣"
1,HERE I HAVE UPLOADED THE VIDEO ABOUT THE ISSUE WITH MY NEW MOBILE.FROM THE FIRST DAY TOUCH SCREEN NOT WORKING PROPERLY
4,It has good specifications.... Cut 1star bcoz of bad tactics by redmi.... They told base variant will start with 12k but didn't launched it.... Then I have to buy 14k variant.
4,Satisfied with this product. Best phone under 14000.Camera quality is also good. Battery performance is superb coz of 33w charger 🔋🔌. Finally it is a good phone as per my opinion.
3,I am not impressed with this phone. Samsung phones have better amoled display. Sound quality not good and not loud too. This phone hangs a lot. Camera quality very bad. I have owned previous phones of mi and they are much better than this. Pls go for note 9 pro in the same budget or realme.
5,Best phoneEver
4,Everything is good in the phone..I use redmi note 10 for 1 day...And review itI found i issue with this phone that is fingerprint sensor does not work properly it slwo or some time Tap fingerprint sensor for 2-3 time for useAbout a camera very good...Front camera is also good..I will edit review after 10 day of use...In shot very GOOD PHONE
1,Phone display has been breaken. It is mentioned as gorilla glass. It has fall down from just 6 feet. Y it is broken?. I will go to consumers courst. Please guide me
1,Redmi note 10 software is very bad xiaomi please fix software problem's Improve the camera & build quality is not good & battery drain very fast.  I AM BIG FAN OF XIAOMI MY FAVORITE COMPANY
5,I pay 100rs extra for one-day delivery it took less than 20 hours.. And after 7 days of using I would say this the best budget smartphone to this day.. There is another variant that comes in 12k you can wait for that or simply buy this at 14000 it comes with a back cover and a screen protector battery backup is awesome but a slight heating issue I'm am getting...
5,"Good picture quality. The 48 Mp camera works fine and so does the selfie camera in potrait mode. Sometimes the pictures are sharper than required. The charging is fast. Got full charge in 2.5 hours of fast charge. Overall build quality is good, not too heavy as compared to previous models. The plastic phone case provided prevents from ususal bumps and falls. The sound quality is decent and so is the video quality in full HD. Gaming performance is decent too, got to play need for speed in medium setting without crashing the app. Really happy with the purchase."
1,"Mobile is lagging. while I scrolling screen is not moving, I noticed it several times,it is very slow while playing games. product is not up to the mark in this price segment"
1,Battery is very bad ...battery is draining when even phone is on sleep mode .
1,check wether both the speakers are working or noi got the manufacturing defet in a piece wich they have senteven the headphone jack also not upto the mark wich give you sound only in one ear bud
5,"We loved it always, coz it's a no 1 brand.Exellent camera."
1,Toatl vest of money. The mobile having touch issue. Half Touch is not working. I suggest you all please do not buy Redmi Note 10 series. Please please please
1,"Very disappointed with the redmi product.Touch sensation problem. Sometimes some parts of the screen doesn't work on touch. I tried my best to get this latest product, but never expected such waste of money."
1,"The sd678 processor with 6GB of ram fails to keep up with everyday stuff like composing mails and browsing. Screen freezes at times, and touch response is far from adequate (and no, it is not because of the the protective film).Camera is average for this price range.The only good thing about this phone is its amoled display.It comes with the usual miui bloatware, but can uninstall/disable some.I understand these phones are not meant to last, nor do I expect flagship level performance for 14k; but this phone fails to perform even basic tasks where sub 10k phones ace.The finger print sensor is well placed amd fast, but often fails to work.There's no way to turn off fast charging, so expect your battery to give up soon."
4,Display is very good  10/10Camera is good for the price 8/10Battery is very good 10/10Lightweight and very slimPerformance is decent not the best 7/10MIUI is very laggyBack panel quality is not goodDual stereo speakers not the loudest but ok
1,Don't purchase this phone battery problem and phone is running is slow
1,After 5 days used . Nice design but performance is not up to mark and lagging . App crashes . Lot of adds which is irritating. Best buy Oppo or Realme.
2,i have used this smartphone for couple of days and what i came across cons and pros will share1. display : best in this price range no doubt about that crisp colors little saturated as its amoled panel for viewing is a pleasure of eyes2. Speakers : i didn't liked it yes u heard it right its not good the highs as high vocals are not clear its like its been suppress the quality is not like stereo speakers type its same like single speaker its like u can heard the music but not the vocals the base is killed3 Battery : Not seems to be 5000 mah coz of 11nm chip its drains like hell even surfing would suck the battery juice like hell and phone heats up a lot yes it charge as fast as advertised apart from that nothing is good might be an update would resolve this issue have to wait and watch4. Camera : its good in the price range 48 mp does it job ultra wide macro depth are satisfactory not good not bad does there job colours are not accurate but it does happen low light pictures are ok not as advertised. camera gives good result in good light or in moderate like in room bit not good in low light or at nightselfie camera is good takes good shots edges in portrait are quiet well managed same in low light not good enough5. Built quality nice all plastic very light and easy to hold and operate with one hand if u have big hands but very light coz of all plastic body gorilla glass 3 is used but will never be tested as we always use guard so nothing to talk about itin short its up to you you want it or pass on
1,"after 6 days use  :1. 2 sim+sd card, good2. width just 74mm, then its thin and comfortable in hand, good3. battery is good4. camera is ok (in this range price) but selfie isn't bad5. finger is side and fast6. face unlock is fast7. it's not bulky like m12 Samsung8. speaker is good9. Display is good, but i don't know why main some time is not good10. charging is fast11. it's not heavy weight, it's just 180 gr but m12 is more than 200grat the endi can't say it's good handset, why?Many times hanging, every day I have to restart it at least 5 timesToday I bought realme 8,its super handset, I can't compare both are, just go for realme 8"
5,Iam not big fan of #MI before this phone. Front camera was really nice having wide angle photography as well as from back camera. Battery was best overall this is nice phone for gaming also
2,"Not a good phone i donot know why it is hypedI should have purchased moto g30 ir waited for HuwaeiProblems:1.camera is not good2. Volume automatically decrease and increase3.

5,Awesome phone ever i have #MI this phone value for money awesome camera  #NOTE10
4,Nice mobile
1,Wrost Phone Not waste of your moneyPlease Don't Buy This Product....... Very Bad Not Good this a Stupid Phone
1,Phone suddenly started working weird. Keyboard not working properly..Spacebar not working...Weird spellings..unable to get the call history...very very disappointed with the product quality.
1,"I am facing touch problems. To type this review I struggled lot. Games worst , some times very difficult to answer phone calls"
1,Aftwrv2 days of uses review is that Even though camera is good but when you make Video call either through Whatsapp or Duo your video image looks  that you are using some VGA camera. don't whybthwre is a difference in selfie video and video through whatsapp which uses same camera properties.Better to go with  Samsung
1,It will make you feel blind as this phone blurs fonts and apps while we scroll it... didn't like it..I made a replacement also but still the problem is same in that new one too
1,"There is some serious issue with this recently launched phone. Replaced product again shows the same touch screen problem, have to touch multiple times. How can the same issue is coming in the second phone too, unless their is some bug. Please do not buy this phone. A BIG NO NO NO TO THIS PRODUCT."
2,"1.Camera have lot of issue, front camera become completely blur during video call on low light.2. Primary camer sensor works poor on video recoding it takes time to focus on item3. Here and there we can see setting menus are lagging- example in app battery saver setting screen starts jerking when we scroll on menu.4. Some apps functionaliy are not responding  after installation. Example zomato place order option. Restarting app doesn't helped. After restarting mobile it worked.I got this by yesterday evening now 1 day completed in minimal usage i faced these many issues worst experience with redmi ,😞😞😞Iam not sure this occur in all redmi 10 mobile or only mine need to speak with customer care and replace. There no return option."

1,Heating problem in phone and phone start stucking. And screen become blurred
5,"I am writing the review after use of about 1 day. I purchased it for my mother. She is very happy to have it. Aa she was earlier user of Samsung basic mobile and she used the mobile for about 6 years. So now she upgraded to smartphone of this brand because in her opinion Samsung mobiles are long lasting. In my opinion:-  Display- 4.5/5  Battery- 5/5  Camera- 5/5  Performance- 4/5  Look- 4/5  Value for money- 4.5/5Display is good and bright as usual Samsung display are always of better quality.  Sound is not best but okay. Look is good but need improvement in back design as it seems to be a cheap plastic material. Battery has no complaints. Camera specially front camera is surprisingly good. But performance should be improved as somtime touch is less responsive.so if you are multitasker and heavy user of mobile then itz not for you. but keeping the price in mind 7299 rs for 3gb ram and 32 gb storage its a fair deal as you are attached to Samsung brand which is better than cheap chinese mobiles like Mi, Oppo, etcPlz don't forget to like if fou find my review helpful 👍"
1,performance was very bad if I open the application that time hang my phone with in 3 seconds and when I rotate the video on landscape mode that time video has slowly moved
4,"Dont expect much from this phone, this is a average user phone, phone will be  lag if using more apps, but its decent for this price, value for money.  Best for Basic to Android upgraders."
1,"I ordered the phone as soon as it was launched. When I received the phone, the camera was not working properly. Everything was very blurry and phone was very slow.I placed a return request. I then received the replacement piece. Camera was working this time but after 1 day use, I noticed that nobody called me the whole day when I generally receive around 10 calls. When I tried calling from another number, it said that the number is out of coverage area when jio had good network reception and VoLTE was on. I have a placed a return request for second time now."
5,"Why did i purchased?1.For using wifi hotspot, instead of my primary phone2.To make or receive Emergency calls either from office or other personalsWhat did i liked most?1.Good Build quality2.Good Display, excellent quality3.Good signal reception, clear voice quality.4.economy price.5.Good Battery6.Latest operation system.7.Dolby atmos(good for music lovers)8.hotspotWhat makes you disappoint?Usb port should be ctype.Finally, what did you say?This is the excellent phone in this price range.Can be used as wifi hotspot and standby phone.This phone is only for basic usage like listening music, simple  voice calls, chatting, watching youtube, surfing net.Not recommended for gamers and heavy users.And display supports upto 720p only.Note:In initial setup, you may face lag and struck in youtube videos. But once after setup completed,restart  the phone.Everything  will get settled up."
3,"So I recieved the phone a few days back. And I will be using this phone as my primary phone. So I will keep this brief and almost to the point.Build quality- tacky looking, good, but can be improved for future budget phones. I got grey color, and it's not metallic, my mum says the rear looks like shahbadi floor tiles. Not an insult. Anyways I like it, but it's not metallic.Screen- personally, I am happy with it, touch feedback is nice too, but ofcourse not like 20k+ range phones.touch is very responsive in the calculator app.Battery- well 5000mah, good, it's quite more than necessary for me but good.Camera- macro camera- took a fair enough macro shot, 2mp. 3.2mp would have been a sweet spot in budget yet good quality. Front and main camera yet to test fully. Night time photos? Forget it. Honestly even most mid range phones don't fare well in night.Processor power- its not a powerful chip to begin with, but fine, I am going to manage with it. For others, the phone is a bit laggy/slow in some aspects..or most. Camera takes a good whole second or 2 to start, the viewfinder flow is not smooth and laggy/glitchy.but I like the wide and macro combination. SHOULD'VE BEEN 3.2MP :'(More apps= bit more lag while entering main menu. So the less no of apps, should suffice. I opened a bunch of apps, including 3 Google tabs in browser, and many apps, lag was not severe slowdown, but was a little slower than before or it's slow to begin with and didn't really have high expectations. Using the device care and/or restarting the phone did feel better and smoother, but took a good whole 7 to 10 seconds for the live wallpaper to load. Talking of wallpapers, even being samsing OneUI, there is no option for galaxy themes :(I am not gonna do any major gaming on this so I cannot say anything on it's regard, I prefer pc gaming. But don't expect much, however if you really want have a  experience where you'd feel better/happy with the purchase, I'd suggest playing classic games like Mario, crash bandicoot etc. Some game suggestions- Dadish, alto.I will update this review after a week/months use. And finally a half/full year update.If you have a budget of atleast 10k then I'd suggest buying some other samsung product or your preference. I've used the m31s and compared to this, that phone is way smooth, and many more models out there. But if you want a entry level phone, or coming from a feature phone, budget constraints, secondary phone. Then this is the phone to go with.  I personally like my m02 quite a bit."
1,"Phone is very slow& heats up quickly. I replace the first piece. Received the replacement the very next day, thanks to amazon. But the second handset was even worse as it got extremely heated even before it was set up completely. Returning it also."
1,"No wireless display as specified and camera not working evertime, quality is poor, even though 13mpixel, it's like VGA camera.. pictures are blur..please don't waste your money.."
3,Average Smartphone.....😵
4,"Mobile is good for simple use but pathetic camera , no fingerprint sensor and old processor which makes it slow for a phone in 2021 .  I purchased it as my secondry phone, display is really awesome and light weight with sleek design. For better deal opt for micromax IN 1B if you can compromise on display and will use as primary phone  .But the conclusion is samsung's quality and customer care cannot be compared with any other brand  in india .If you want a secondry phone then its a perfect choice at this price"
5,"At a first glance phone looks decent one. It has almost all the features except finger print but it's ok in this price range. Checked the sound quality, camera, internet speed. All seems to be fine. For a basic user it's a good choice. Will review further after using few more days."
5,The product is best value for money and only watch it as a budget smartphone
1,Performance and display is not as per standard. Pale display....it looka like a duplicate screen. Performance is so slow that even opening a calculator take 5sec of lag to open. It seems this phn is either refurbished version of some older phone. Samsung has not delivered such low standard phn till now.
1,"Reason to buy :1. Very stylish looks . u found a premium quality.2. Big display.3. Battery is good.Reason not to buy1. It's like a Scorpio with auto""s engine.App load time is long2. Camara just a scrap.3. Speaker is very very bad. Burst speaker.Over all don't buy this . if you don't want anything more than call nd need only a good looking ph then only buy or either go for poco c3,redmi 9a"
1,I have used 3 or 4 samsung phones with this price tag. But this phone model is disappointing me.I found below issues in the phone that i received from this seller. Not sure about other users.1. Call volume is low.2. Performance issue.3. Phone hangs in the middle without loading the website completely.4. Very heavy but ( i did not notice it when i ordered. This is my mistake).5. Call disconnection but not very frequently.There is no option for refund. But it has only exchange with the same model.I returned this mobile . Am waiting for replacement phone. Let us see how the new phone of same model works.
2,Good in screen size. Average phone in the price range. 👍Camera 📷 worst-: On the name of samsung it's very bad. 👎Battery🔋backup-: It's is good can run full day.👍Speed~RAM-: Don't even think of playing any game. It's lag vere very much even while playing Temple Run in 3gb variant.👎Memory management-: it's come with 32gb internal memory in with 10gb is allready consume by system software.👎Overall ~ If you are purchasing this phone for only calling purpose then go for it. 👍Don't think of playing a single 50-100Mb game u won't be able to play on this device 🙏
3,"Writing this review after couple of days of using. First I ordered this and received a slow item, then I replaced the item and thanks to Amazon I have received the replacement within 1 day. But, the replacement item is still slow. Hence, I have decided to return the item.PROS:1. Big Screen2. Huge Battery Life3. 3GB of RAM4. 32GB of Internal Storage6. Latest Android OSCONS:1. MediaTek Processor (after having 3GB of RAM, the phone takes 2 seconds to open Chrome and 1.5 seconds to open contact list)2. Hangs After Playing GamesVERDICT:You can go for this phone if you are looking for a secondary phone or you are gifting this to your parents. This phone is not for them who will watch movies, play games and hinging on social media apps."
5,* Display is very good* Battery Backup Excellent* Stylish Mobile* YouTube Videos playing without buffering
1,"Guys if you are looking for a smartphone Please do not buy this product. Reasons are given below1. Battery life is not upto the Mark even in power saving mode. Drained very fast in just 15 hrs. If you watch movie then ot will drain in 4 hrs only.2. Camera. Both front and rear camera are just like vga camera. No quality of Megapixels.3. Hangs a lot. Takes too much to unlock and don't have a fingerprint scanner as well. No facelock option.4. Many times it dont show the caller number on screen for 5 to 10 seconds.When you are working on it and someone calls you then only ringtone will play first and small icon will appear on the top after 5-10 seconds. Unknown no. by truecaller will show when you disconnect call.5. I have not installed any game as it hangs in normal operation.6. Screen width is not upto mark,as keys of keyboard come closer. You will feel uncomfortable while typing.7. Sound quality is low, as no proper music beats.8. When you are on call the screen automatically flash and touch enables.Samsung should recall this model. Worst ever phone. You can add 2000 more and can get better phone than this."
2,"Phone is little bit slow hanging in first start , below average camera quality both front and rear , plastic back but at this price point cant expect more. But we can expect good Qualcomm Snapdragon processor or exynos ...long charger wirePros - good battery not yet checked , bright and clear screen, latest update today via OTA,Cons- very small charger wire and it is unacceptable, below average camera, very slow phone , plastic cheap quality,I suggest spend bit more on good specification phone don't just go with Samsung..."
5,"Best smartphone in this prize,nice display, battery life best,but I want to more features like, screen shot and screen recorder too."
1,"First I was happy that Samsung rolled out a budget phone under 7000 Rs. but later got disappointed that we have to bear slow processor. The processor is quite slow and the phone started hanging as soon as I booted for the very first time. Along with this drawback, the display is very cheap when it comes to expecting a nice one from a brand like Samsung. I would suggest not to go with the brand value but see the specifications before you buy and don't make the mistake which I made."
4,"3/32gb variant @ 7299/- is good deal with samsung brand. Quad-core MediaTek MT6739 Processor is outdated & slow but adequate for basic usage. No lagging for whatsApp, fb, YouTube.  Display & Screen resolution is great as well as battery backup. 10W charger took more than 3.5hr for full charging. Cameras are average considering price point."
4,"This is my first personal Samsung phone, and what better model to start with! Using it for a week  now and everything is functioning as it should. Very good display, sound and maneuverability overall.  Only one thing :  The mobile's data cable could really have been a bit longer. Other than that the phone is working fine. The best thing is the 5000mAH battery,  which I am enjoying. :-) Truly  a value for money.Will update if I find any other significant matter in the coming days."
4,Product is just ok if you have another phone. I use iPhone n I took it as some apps have xtra features in android.Phone has a good battery. Processor is not good enough so it’s a little slagging. Design is good. Display is too bright if u hold it straight with ur eyes as it’s a tft lcd.  I hope in future updates mobile will become a little smoother.  It is very rare that you will get every update time to time in this price. But I am sure u r not going to get a better choice in this price. If you have money shortcomings you can consider it!!Have a nice day ahead!!
2,I ONLY USE FOR MAKING CALLS.WHATSAPP VIDEOS ONE OR TWO I SEE AT THE MAXIMUM.MOBILE LOOKS GOOD.NO ONE CAN TALK ILL ABOUT SAMSUNG DISPLAY OR CAMERA.AS USUAL BATTERY FAILS.IN THIS CASE ATTERY DRAINS EVERYDAY I NEED TO CHARGE EVENTHOUGH I DIDNOT PLAY ANY GAME OR SEE MEDIA.IF WE PUT FULL CHARGE ATLEAST IT SHOULD LAST FOR ONE FULL DAY.MORNING IF IT IS 100 PERCENT EVENING IT COMES AROUND 35 PERCENT.CURSE FOR SAMSUNG.
5,Best samsung mobile in this price category.Thank you Amazon.
2,"I would not recommend this product to any age group.This mobile has most slowest processor, even on first day you feel like you are operating crashed system.Go for bit higher prise product you Will not regret."
5,"If we compare the product quality with the price, definitely it is a value for money device for your daily usage.Battery life is very good, charging is a bit slow but ok.Look wise the phone gives a decent look from back side which can be increased by using back cover.Front side look is awsm.Screen size is good for gaming and movies, performance is great even in sunlight.Camera quality is absolutely fine.Definitely you can go for this having a branded logo on back."
5,A wonderful value for money! I had asked it as a extra side phone. It provides excellent prolonged battery life and beautiful design that doesn't get you off. The performance is obviously not as fast as premium phones in terms of speed if you want to use as a multi purpose phone. But basic apps just do all fine.
1,Defective Item was received.IMEI number is not displaying when dialing the required number.Requested for a refund but exchange partner has refused to collect it despite raising a request within 24 hours.Please check the seller on Amazon before purchasing your products.
3,The phone gets very hot with minimal use.Editing the review after the phone was replaced. This time got the right product and it works pretty well.Guess it was a faulty product to begin with. Happy with Amazon. Samsung needs to do their quality checks better.
5,Just amazing..Battery back up to video quality as well as net working and perform too fast..
5,"Very good budget phone with big screen. Support is only for 2.4ghz WiFi and not support 5ghz WiFi which user is missing compared to other manufacturers smartphone around same price range. Charger point is not so smooth to insert the charging pin and seems it might cause priblem after an year use, but need to see how it copes with."
5,One  of Best mobile phone in this range💪 truely💪awesome
3,After using this device for 5 days I can share some pros and consPros-1- Budget smartphone from Samsung at this price range.2- Screen is better in performance.3- 5000 mAh battery life stands upto 24 hours after watching videos for 5 hours and calling. (Couldn't play game)4- Picture quality is average.Cons-1- The device lags and sometimes hang on performing easy steps like shifting app to app.2- Multitask becomes difficult as it is slow in performance.3- Camera is not upto the mark.4- Doesn't feel premium while holding the phone.5- due to bigger battery the mobile feels heavy. (206 gms)6- Found bugs like-(1) Pressing power button takes time to wake and sleep the screen.(2) Home screen zooms upto 300% without activating.(3) Opening camera stucks for upto 5-10 sec sometimes.(Will update more if found)Thanks!
5,Good quality product.. working perfectly. No defects found on mobile. Good quality rear cameras and good quality front cameras. Good sound quality.  Good display quality . Light weight . Good touch sensitive. Designs and colours are good . In this price mobile  is good. Phone back Is made of plastic. Good performance ram no lag coming . Android 10 installed . After we connect internet  to phone we get updations of all. Totally good mobile. Total 10 gb is used in rom 22 gb Is balance.
1,Believe me guys don't make mistake you will regret. This phone hangs a lot even at normal task like opening notification panel or settings or receiving calls. Better go for other brands if you are tight with your budget they buy new Gionee phones Gionee F103 pro was my first phone there are some software update problem but except that everything runs much smoother than this M02 and note it this Gionee phone was 5 years old and still you can play COD in it. Even i have played pubg recently before it was ban. Now i ordered new mobile because i was getting battery issue in my Gionee handset and trusted Samsung but i got something more bad than previous phone.Don't buy it!
1,Pathetic performance of the phone. My father in law was using old redmi 3i for past many years. Since it's battery was almost gone i bought this useless mobile with weakest processor. Opening a dialer itself takes 3-4 seconds. I didn't imagine this like sluggishness of the mobile from Samsung. Better i would've gone with xiomi or realme. Wasted Rs.7500.. lets see how long will it work
4,"So I ordered this phone 20 days ago I guessAs i got a good exchange offer for my repaired handset i only paid 900.About the product-The screen quality is awesome at this price point, the battery is also promising, build quality is above average however it doesn’t offer fingerprint which is pretty basic even at this price.The main concern with this handset is the ram management on this one creates problem. The multitasking can’t be done fluently and yes it lags a bitTo me I purchased this handset for my 2.5 years old niece as she loves watching videos throughout the day. So for us it was a health purchase but for those who want to use this as a primary phone. Please increase your budget otherwise you will be irritated."
5,"I am writing the review after use of about 1 day. I purchased it for my mother. She is very happy to have it. Aa she was earlier user of Samsung basic mobile and she used the mobile for about 6 years. So now she upgraded to smartphone of this brand because in her opinion Samsung mobiles are long lasting. In my opinion:-  Display- 4.5/5  Battery- 5/5  Camera- 5/5  Performance- 4/5  Look- 4/5  Value for money- 4.5/5Display is good and bright as usual Samsung display are always of better quality.  Sound is not best but okay. Look is good but need improvement in back design as it seems to be a cheap plastic material. Battery has no complaints. Camera specially front camera is surprisingly good. But performance should be improved as somtime touch is less responsive.so if you are multitasker and heavy user of mobile then itz not for you. but keeping the price in mind 7299 rs for 3gb ram and 32 gb storage its a fair deal as you are attached to Samsung brand which is better than cheap chinese mobiles like Mi, Oppo, etcPlz don't forget to like if fou find my review helpful 👍"
1,performance was very bad if I open the application that time hang my phone with in 3 seconds and when I rotate the video on landscape mode that time video has slowly moved
4,"Dont expect much from this phone, this is a average user phone, phone will be  lag if using more apps, but its decent for this price, value for money.  Best for Basic to Android upgraders."
1,"I ordered the phone as soon as it was launched. When I received the phone, the camera was not working properly. Everything was very blurry and phone was very slow.I placed a return request. I then received the replacement piece. Camera was working this time but after 1 day use, I noticed that nobody called me the whole day when I generally receive around 10 calls. When I tried calling from another number, it said that the number is out of coverage area when jio had good network reception and VoLTE was on. I have a placed a return request for second time now."
5,"Why did i purchased?1.For using wifi hotspot, instead of my primary phone2.To make or receive Emergency calls either from office or other personalsWhat did i liked most?1.Good Build quality2.Good Display, excellent quality3.Good signal reception, clear voice quality.4.economy price.5.Good Battery6.Latest operation system.7.Dolby atmos(good for music lovers)8.hotspotWhat makes you disappoint?Usb port should be ctype.Finally, what did you say?This is the excellent phone in this price range.Can be used as wifi hotspot and standby phone.This phone is only for basic usage like listening music, simple  voice calls, chatting, watching youtube, surfing net.Not recommended for gamers and heavy users.And display supports upto 720p only.Note:In initial setup, you may face lag and struck in youtube videos. But once after setup completed,restart  the phone.Everything  will get settled up."
3,"So I recieved the phone a few days back. And I will be using this phone as my primary phone. So I will keep this brief and almost to the point.Build quality- tacky looking, good, but can be improved for future budget phones. I got grey color, and it's not metallic, my mum says the rear looks like shahbadi floor tiles. Not an insult. Anyways I like it, but it's not metallic.Screen- personally, I am happy with it, touch feedback is nice too, but ofcourse not like 20k+ range phones.touch is very responsive in the calculator app.Battery- well 5000mah, good, it's quite more than necessary for me but good.Camera- macro camera- took a fair enough macro shot, 2mp. 3.2mp would have been a sweet spot in budget yet good quality. Front and main camera yet to test fully. Night time photos? Forget it. Honestly even most mid range phones don't fare well in night.Processor power- its not a powerful chip to begin with, but fine, I am going to manage with it. For others, the phone is a bit laggy/slow in some aspects..or most. Camera takes a good whole second or 2 to start, the viewfinder flow is not smooth and laggy/glitchy.but I like the wide and macro combination. SHOULD'VE BEEN 3.2MP :'(More apps= bit more lag while entering main menu. So the less no of apps, should suffice. I opened a bunch of apps, including 3 Google tabs in browser, and many apps, lag was not severe slowdown, but was a little slower than before or it's slow to begin with and didn't really have high expectations. Using the device care and/or restarting the phone did feel better and smoother, but took a good whole 7 to 10 seconds for the live wallpaper to load. Talking of wallpapers, even being samsing OneUI, there is no option for galaxy themes :(I am not gonna do any major gaming on this so I cannot say anything on it's regard, I prefer pc gaming. But don't expect much, however if you really want have a  experience where you'd feel better/happy with the purchase, I'd suggest playing classic games like Mario, crash bandicoot etc. Some game suggestions- Dadish, alto.I will update this review after a week/months use. And finally a half/full year update.If you have a budget of atleast 10k then I'd suggest buying some other samsung product or your preference. I've used the m31s and compared to this, that phone is way smooth, and many more models out there. But if you want a entry level phone, or coming from a feature phone, budget constraints, secondary phone. Then this is the phone to go with.  I personally like my m02 quite a bit."
1,"Phone is very slow& heats up quickly. I replace the first piece. Received the replacement the very next day, thanks to amazon. But the second handset was even worse as it got extremely heated even before it was set up completely. Returning it also."
1,"No wireless display as specified and camera not working evertime, quality is poor, even though 13mpixel, it's like VGA camera.. pictures are blur..please don't waste your money.."
3,Average Smartphone.....😵
4,"Mobile is good for simple use but pathetic camera , no fingerprint sensor and old processor which makes it slow for a phone in 2021 .  I purchased it as my secondry phone, display is really awesome and light weight with sleek design. For better deal opt for micromax IN 1B if you can compromise on display and will use as primary phone  .But the conclusion is samsung's quality and customer care cannot be compared with any other brand  in india .If you want a secondry phone then its a perfect choice at this price"
5,"At a first glance phone looks decent one. It has almost all the features except finger print but it's ok in this price range. Checked the sound quality, camera, internet speed. All seems to be fine. For a basic user it's a good choice. Will review further after using few more days."
5,The product is best value for money and only watch it as a budget smartphone
1,Performance and display is not as per standard. Pale display....it looka like a duplicate screen. Performance is so slow that even opening a calculator take 5sec of lag to open. It seems this phn is either refurbished version of some older phone. Samsung has not delivered such low standard phn till now.
1,"Reason to buy :1. Very stylish looks . u found a premium quality.2. Big display.3. Battery is good.Reason not to buy1. It's like a Scorpio with auto""s engine.App load time is long2. Camara just a scrap.3. Speaker is very very bad.

5,Good phoneDecent look and looks stylishCamera and battery quality are super goodGood phone in this range 👍But delivery service is not good
1,Dont buy.. after 10 to.15 mins gaming phone lagging too much
2,Not good phone stopped working after some time so i didn't suggest you this...
2,"Worst product, not as expected its not even a month and ut hangs so much! Its front camera is just worst, only it's first look is good nothing else. Don't go for it!! Redmi note 8 and even note 5 is much better than it!😤 Completely disappointed 😤😤😤"
2,Here my product review after usage of 3 months.Cons:If you bought this mobile you can't exchange. I have tried but not able to exchange my device.Please check by clicking the exchange option and you can take the decision.Now you can understand why you should not by this mobile.Gaming - Mobile heating and lagging when you playing high graphics gameBattery - 5020mAh battery. Moderate performFor charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100.Macro camera - useless featureFront and Rear camera - Not good compare with realme 6000rs mobile camera.UI is fine but consuming more ramMany pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app).I suggest please buy some other brand don't waste your money like me.
5,Totally impressed by the built and looks. For 13k I thought of getting realme 6i but the stocks barely last..!So I decided to get this phone. The phone is great and smooth. Gaming experience is also good but not as good as g90t.G85 is a decent processor with great daily life performance!If 12k is your budget go for it..Or 13k..realme 6i and 14k... Go for poco m2. Scarlet red looks stunning!!
5,Awesome product 💎Value for money 💵Best in segment📱For normal usage this one is the best 🙌Long battery life 🤳 when compared to other smartphones.Camera is ok for this price📸Charging is comparitively slow it takes 2 - 2 and half hrs or more to get full charged.🕕 Overall its best for the price  👍
5,"Hi I am writing this review post usage of 7 days,1. The Dsiplay is perfect better than Samsung M21 in the similar price range. The display is Full HD+ whereas its counter parts are not offering that.2. The camera scores over its counter parts whereas not much variations available in Selfie but fantastic at this price.3. The specifications are more or less similar to Mi Note 8 except the processor, it's Helios G85 in this one whereas its Qualcomm in Note 8 i.e 625.4. Note 8 had 4K video capture option but not with the latest  Note 9.5. The battery stays long as promised as I am not a gamer the battery lasts for over a day and half.6. This had P2i protection towards splash but not with Note 8.7. To conclude I shall recommend this phone as no brands available at such good price.Thanks for reading god bless . Enjoy"
3,"My Mobile phone has some screen issue. On completely black wall paper or black background there's a permanent white dot (like screen is defective) on the screen but i requested for the replacement soon device will be replaced. Although device is preety average, ram management is not that good.go for the snapdragon rather than mediatek.Pubg lags sometimes on medium settings and there's a ton of preloaded apps from which some apps you cannot uninstall.there are several options in the market other than xiaomi. So,choose your device wisely."
4,Very nice Phone.. smooth performance.. charge service decent.. screen quality superb.. sound ok.. but body vibration issue is here.. in speaker mode or at time of calling body vibration present.. no notification light.. overall decent performance at this price.. phone support only 18 watt fast charge.

1,"Really Disappointed.""Made In China"" product!No ""Made in India by Redmi"" ? (the reason, I selected Redmi. but disappointed)Giving '1star' because,no '0star' option is there!!!![1. Giving 1star to 'made in china'. 2. Not reviewing for 'Quality & all']"

5,Good Performance and nice display
4,Good Mobile......But little bit disappointed with Processor and High Cost
1,This product is not good at all.I request you to not buy this product.I have problem with this device & I did not get any resolution.
4,Nice phone
1,I brought this phone. Flash is not working properly. No intensification in flash. It working like touch is on. I complained to customer care. They sent AC repairman. I said he is AC repairman they said he is all in one. He just reset the phone and said now it works well but there is no change in previous result and the one after reset.
1,"Misguiding information!!!!!!In the banner it says ""Made in India"". But in reality it is ""Made in China"". It is a blatant attack on trust. This can't be tolerated!!Beware of misguiding information...."
1,Price is too high compared to specsShould have gone for m21
5,Awesome mobile
5,Ultimate 📷..... 🔋 backup is very good.....👌
5,Awesome product..go for it guys..delevery and packing is also good..i got it only in two days
2,Looks premium and mi claims that it has quite a lot of features. Has a better IR blaster for remote accessibility. Only the camera is the best in the price range and other aspects it’s a Piece of shit.Kindly don’t buy Becoz it’s worth only for 8-9k Move to Samsung or any other phone. Fedup with the performance of the phone in the very first day. The 2stars are only for the camera Quality and IR blaster. Phone lags much and Gaming performance is too poor and way of handling this phone requires a lot of patience as it loads for longer time for some of the app details. Battery last better and Camera quality is good that’s all. Not worthy for 13.5k.Pls don’t buy it if you expect performance from this phone or if you think you can have better features phone.
4,Good for this price range..
5,"I brought this phone for my youtube channel review,I thinks that it's a great part product for me because it's Four cameras on the back, punch-hole on the front , camera is perfect, It's me changed my status and one of the best phone i ever had review in last few days  phone capacity 128GB killer memory, Good battery it last 1 to 2 days with normal used. However, Mobile legend has a lot of frame drop when you set it into High Graphic but still manageable when you set to medium graphic. So sad, I thought this is much better compared to lasted redmi phones,The quad-camera setup is almost the same as on the Note 9S but with one small difference - the 5MP f/2.4 camera has been swapped for a 2MP f/2.4 one with autofocus, which is a very welcome feature because it makes macro photography that much easier.The main camera has been borrowed - 48MP with f/1.8 aperture as well as the ultra-wide unit - 8MP with f/2.2 aperture. The ultra-wide's sensor is quite small measuring at 1/4.0"" with 1.12µm. And, of course, the 2MP depth sensor, which serves more of an aesthetic purpose than functional one.Ｖｉｄｅｏ ｒｅｃｏｒｄｉｎｇUnfortunately, the phone supports video recording only up to 1080p at 30 fps. There aren't many modes in which you can shoot in either. A cinematic aspect ratio is available to add some dramatic effect to the video, but that's pretty much it.The Full HD video itself is a bit on the soft side and the dynamic range seems a bit too narrow. You can't see anything in the shadows and clouds in the sky are just a tad brighter than they should."
1,"Selfie Camera Not As Expected-Picture Quality Very Bad, Appearing Small Dots On Entire Face During And After Selfie Clicks.Rear Camera :Rear Camera Picture Quality Nice But Detailing Not good."
5,Nice camera quality
1,"PROS- 5000 batteryAVARAGE- processor( the mediatek processor hit a lot)CONS-CAMERA( it is fake, works like normal 16 MP camera, it is just for advertisement).CHARGER( though company says it is of 22.5 W, it takes a lot of time to charge) .ADVERTISE( you all know how the adds disturb you every time)."

3,"Product is not super value for money. Back panel plastic quality not so good.Camera perform great in daylight condition and ok in low light.I have also note 9 Pro I think that is super value for money under 14000 if you budget permit then go for it. By paying extra 2000 rupees for redmi note 9 Pro you got great build quality with back side glass, UFS 2.1 rom for storage and to great camera."
5,Good productEasy to useCamera quality bestLooking goodLight weightBest for gaming#Mi
2,Phone Performance overroll good but charging speed is too slow it's take more time to charge my phone 35 to 100 percent charge on a 3 hours i am not satisfied. I am student and going to college in morning but phone take to more time to charge its 1 hours take to 30 percentage on charge. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡

4,"Got the mobile on the launch date,Battery must be appreciatedCamera is just averageMobile performance is above average90hz refresh rate? If u r buying the mobile for this feature then I'm afraid u may get disappointed, it's just normal.The USB cable is too small in lengthIt's a good mobile in this budget, there are no returns for this,  only replacement is available, hence choose wisely before buying"
3,Camera quality is low
5,"In this budget, it has exceeded all expectations .. I have primarily taken this phone for the battery and so far not disappointed"
1,"1. It doesn't work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.2. Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one.3. Amazon didn't allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.4. No return policy, you will have to live with the phone you didn't like. Now you decide."
1,"Not worth buying....faulty software, poor display quality, single band wifi doesn't support  5ghz WIFI band. Gyro sensor missing and many more. DONT GO BY PAID REVIEWS IN YOU TUBE"
1,I will never purchase Samsung phones. Phone is lagging too much and slow. Waste of hard earning money.
1,This is worst samsung mobile I have seen from samsung. It's sceen quality and colors are trash. Even a old 5000 rs phone can beat it's quality. Please never ever buy this product.
1,मोबाइल का कैमरा बिल्कुल भी सही नही है 48 PM बताया और क्लियरिटी 5 मेगा पिक्सल का भी नही है ।मोबाइल भी पुराना सा दिखता है ।इसको नही खरीदे
1,The phone hangs a lot and is very slow. I received a replacement which continues to hang
5,Just unboxed the phone.Seems to be a better one in this price segment as of now.Just checked with the camera & voice it seems good but one thing it's very heavy in weight may be due to battery.Hope samsung lives upto expectation.
1,"Worst camera quality. It is like 2 megapixel camera. Photos are very worst. If you slightly zoom the photo,  you can see blurry...Previously I used 13 megapixel amera phone. Those photos are very good."
1,Don't received  handset ejection  pin  and manual.
1,"No 5Ghz wifi band on this mobile, miserable in 2021 , even my previous mobile of Samsung which I bought in 2017 have 5Ghz wifi , it's a big comedy"
1,Very poor quality camera .Found box seal damage still Amazon not taking it back.waste of money.Phone very slow.Don’t buy from Amazon.Now Amazon started cheating customers to make profits.
1,Hitting issue
1,very poor build qualityvery poor camera piclow quality phoneno return policyvery worst mobilejust making fool to customer by samsung m12 and Amazon
1,"Good battery. Heating while charging and using mobile data, camera below average with 48 mp true, looks like 13 mp. Heavy in weight and thickness (okay that 6000 mah) display is not good as other phones in this rage in terms of technology and display ratio. Overall below average in this price."
1,Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it's having high end config. It doesn't look that way.Camera utterly disappointed. Never seen this kind of mobile in the recent past and more over if you buy this product you have to bare with it because no return/refund option according to return policy only replacement that disappoints even more. Advising don't waste money on this product.
5,"This is perfect phone, good speed, decent specs and outstanding battery life. The look of the device is also attractive. Above all, the trust of company."
1,"PHONE IS TOTAL RUBBISH.  Slowest to respond, Camera not at all good, abruptly closes down youtube and other applications on itself....AND THIS PHONE IS UTTER WASTE. CAMERA QUALITY IS BAD.Not at all happy with the product.I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
2,"Product specifications are not at par..Display is below average.Camera quality is just okay..It doesnt support 5ghz wifi, which is not mentioned anywhere so please make sure before buying.."
1,Dislike
1,Self camera is just like 2 mega pixels.
1,"Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost. Newer days below 10000 value mobiles also supporting dual band.I have purchased samsung mobile in 2018 will support 5ghz band, 2021 manufactured mobile will not support dual band  very shameful.This is cheating of amazon not mentioned same in details about the product. I am suggesting don't buy those who are using Jiofiber WIFI."
1,"The user experience is pathetic on these cheap phones. Its filled to the brim with bloatware that you can't remove.You're better off getting the Mi phones as they have a far better UIAlso, I can't return this garbage of a phone as Samsung don't list this as a software issue.I'll have to look into installing lineage os and de-google this phone before using it but that's easier said than done."
5,"A very satisfying  experience with the device so  far.Pros:1. Long battery life-  I am a moderate  user who does everything  except gaming. That said , the battery lasts up to 2 full days.2. Decent cameras for the price. Pictures are satisfactory but could be better.3. Very responsive finger print sensor.4. Good sound quality, although dolby's impact  is not much pronounced5. UI is great and snappy. Lots of customization options.6. The display is good and smooth with 90hz refresh rate. It does make the difference.7. Fast charging works fine.Cons:1. The weight of the phone is on the heavier side @ 220 gms2. The display could have been a full HD+ @ 1080p3. No led notification light. All though there are apps that can do the job on an AMOLED screen.Overall, a good package."
1,Horrible product
1,Just for name sake Cam & Battery are 48mp & 6000mah. But coming to reality it is poor. The weight of the phone also almost 250gm so it is not a smart phone it is a hard phone. And the top menu bar beside front cam is not responding sometimes.
1,"Not a good mobile.Quite heavy in weight, you will obviously feel it. Weight is 220 gms which is far exceeding acceptable range. Can definitely be used as paperweight.Nothing special in screen, processor or camera also.Just a marketing gimmick by samsung.Stay away.. At 13.5k we deserve far better than this."
4,I am giving this review after usage of 2 daysI bought this phone only for two req 1. Battery and Camera.1. BatteryBang on it lasted for 1 and half days there are unnecessary apps pre installed please remove those one of them is Takatak and Snapchat those are  absolutely non sense.I played Call Of Duty for straight 3 hours non stop battery drained from 98% to 80 %2. Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in India!!If anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this
1,Camera is very poor.. though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp
3,"This phone has 90hz display, but I see a lag while browing or navigating in apps, doesn't feel like 90hz at all48MP true cam when option selected gives noisy images , otherwise in normal mode works above averageBattery is excellent works for 2 daysHeating issues occur on heavy usage, in normal mode you won't notice itFront cam 8 mp just averageOverall I took 6gb 128 gb version for 13k and doesn't seem as good.Above average phone for the price...."
2,"The phone is good looking, but it doesn't support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .No handsfree in the box"
5,"It's a real monster. Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING. Fingerprint works very fast. Battery life is also really huge. Those who are not in favour of camera quality they're wrong camera quality is just awesome, size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera. Must buy product. Really happy from it 😌. Once again no complains regarding anything."
4,"Changing my review on this device after 2 month usage .  I finally have to say that this is the bang for the buck .Awesome battery life , and that's what I want . I am just using it for basic social media and calls .. rest of my heavy work is done on my primary device .CAMERA is average , My ipad's 5 MP camera shoots better than the so called ""true"" 48MP.My advice-- go for 6gb variant as 2.5 gb is acquired by the system .Overall - 4☆"
5,Very good phone. Camera display speed very good. Weight is little heavy.  But worth compare to the price
3,Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn’t give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you’re choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you’ll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review
1,"This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information."
5,Good- got it for 9999- decent phone for this cost with all the necessary gizmos and bling- finger print sensor is good. fast and sensitive. Haven't tried the face unlock.- display is top notch on any good Samsung phone for this price- quality pics/ decent ( note - I'm a normal user of camera )- battery is very good. its really a monsterBad ( depends on perspective )- slightly big for small hands- it has all the dumb samsung apps inbuilt ( you can uninstall a few )- slightly heavier when you have a good solid case ( read as spigen branded )Overall very happy to have a good ( more than decent ) phone for the initial offer price.

1,The product just overheating.. it is unbelievable from such great company production devices.  Here the cost does not matter but product quality is matters.1. builtin Alex is not working2. Average camera3. Overheating.I have been one plus 6t device since 2.5 so far single problem face.. I just upgraded to one plus 9 but it seems to be the worst decision. I did it as I am feeling now.
1,"Just got d phone today... frm day 1 too much overheating issue... Not possible to use...Also battery issue, 20% battery drained out in 15 minutes..."
4,One day delivery. Very fast. Kuddos on that.The phone is amazing. No complains so far. 3 days of heavy usage to check battery camera music everything.Would definitely say one of the best cameras. Sound could have been louder but not at all bad. Battery is excellent. Interface touch smoothness WOW.Didn't give 5 stars as always scope of improvement. But overall go for it. Remain a one plus fan
1,SENDING USED PRODUCT TO CUSTOMERSI BOUGHT IT WHEN I OPEN GALLERY 100 OF IMAGES ARE THERE ALSO MINOR SCRETCHES ARE
1,Oneplus is cheating us on 5gLook at the price 55000Don't go blindly friendsInstead Oneplus i am choosing Samsung
1,Network performance not good  and camera performance very Bad compared oneplus 9 and Samsung a71 both  are equally  and one plus 9 price to hight
1,"Strange change in features, automatic call recording feature has been withdrawn. Returning the phone"
1,"Dear Buyers,I bought this phone for my younger brother as his birthday gift. I was outside the city when I got this delivered to him. He was facing issues with this phone from the first day, but he didn't inform me since I gave him a gift and didn't feel like complaining about a gift. It's only after I met him I came to know that :1. This phone has serious heating issues. Gets so much hot while charging that a human hand can't hold it.2. Battery Draining issue. The battery doesn't last more than 5 hours after 100% charge with normal to low usage. If you keep the phone and stare at the battery percentage, you can actually see it going down in front of your eyes.3. Overrated camera. The amount paid for this phone doesn't justify the quality of the cameras, and the entire thing is overrated.4. I would clearly recommend buying an iPhone 11 instead. Way better battery life, camera, durability and software experience.I tried returning the phone immediately, but amazon did not accept the return and asked us to run some tests. On running the test they advised that the phone is perfect and we might be not using it right. Beautiful isn't it? And now we are stuck with this worthless heating brick."
5,"- SD888 - Superfast Processor- Real feel of 120 Hz Fluid Display- Charging - 0-100 in 35min !!!- Battery Usage: Screen on 120Hz (  Total 4 Hours ) : (2 Hours screentime, on wifi, video streaming,  including 30 Min Call Of Duty gameplay = Battery dropped from 100 to 70)- High-quality speakers ( Really Loud !! )- Decent Cameras - ( Don't expect too much Hasselblad hype )- Clean and Smooth UI - Oxygen OS."
1,This product is not worth the price. I have to return it. It heats a lot and camera quality is also not good.
1,i received mobile today on 21/04/2021 i chrged the device full and within 2 hour the battery percentage came 70 perctenage and i dont thin it will last all day
1,"Camera is not really great, battery draining too fast,i didn't expect this from one plus, loudspeaker for calls is not so high ,u can't listen if there is disturbance outside, but speaker for music is awesome effect, need to improve many things, battery is heating too much while using camera or for using in hot sun, u should improve this,if u lift ur phone from rest,all mobile shows fingerprint scanner to unlock,but one.plus is not showing that ,u should double tap or press the lock but it annoying for this, typing has also become difficult for me compared to my old mobile, sliding is also not good if u use this while texting, first it was to take about 50min to charge fully,now after 4 5 days it's taking 30 35min"
2,"Positive - phone is fast, no hang or lag, smooth operations and usageCons -Below average camera qualityVery bad battery performance. The bettery drains like anything, you feel the anxiety while using.I was not able to write the review of this phone for almost 4 days after the launch, clearly shows amazon and oneplus wanted to trick people buying this.Conclusion - not worth buying"
2,"Initial review after 2 days of use.Look and feel is great.Function smoothly without any lag.Faced heating issues even if slightly overloaded, big disappointment.Warp charge works very well, however battery is draining faster than usual.Camera is good on first impression, yet to explore more.Overall, doesn't looks like a good deal considering the price.---------------------------------------------Further reduced the rating to 2 star after extensive use of 2 months.1. Phone keeps heating even while not in use and background app restricted.2. Phone heats while charging and disable many features until temperature comes down.3. Hassalebald has only given name, seems like just another ordinary camera.4. Charging was good initially but after updates it takes more than an hour to fully charge.A basic 15k smartphone can be easily compared to this so called flagship killer. Strongly not recommended to buy."
1,"हर्षद मेहता की तरह चुना लगा दिया,हेसल ब्लेड का कैमरा बोल के । कभी मत खरीदना3 घंटे मैं 100 परसैंट बैटरी खत्म"
1,"This is the first time I am very disappointed with One Plus. We have three One Plus models and were very happy with the build, performance , camera etc. But this time One Plus 9 series disappointed. Firstly, heating issues and while switching on the mobile for first time the touch was not working at all."
5,"First things first the display is awesome with excellent brightness, Camera is top notch with 8k recording at 30fps and 4k recording at 30 & 60fps. 4500mah Battery is a beast and charges within 20mins atmost and it lasts easily for about 24hrs for a normal usage. I used the mobile for a whole day for gaming,video recording,with mobile data & WIFI on alternatively and still after 24hrs battery balance is 37% . Multi Threading is ultra smooth in this mobile as mine is 12/256 gb version and neva gets slow in any circumstances. These are so far my observations for the past 3days of my mobile usage. As of now there are no flaws with this, will update if any. Final verdict is flagship killer,if you can afford dont look back n  go for it..."
2,After usage for 2 days I am writing the review ...Heating issues are significant not even able to click pics while heating..Battery discharging Faster ..not lasting for even 8 hrs with moderate usage..Overall Not satisfied..Not expected such issues from one plus Premium phoneAmazon customer care are not replacing it.. Feeling cheated!! Waste of Money!!
4,"One plus is always good in terms of performance, display and charging. This model is marvellous in terms of charging speed. Battery backup is decent when you are using 120 Hz refresh rate. OS is very clean but you will not get many customised option as it is like a stock android. Call recording function is useless but it is privacy policy u can't blame OP for this.Camera is not as hyped by OP , hasselblad is ordinarily working. Still camera is good enough since last versions. May be future updates will do much better as hardware specifications are good enough. Front camera is ok type they must have given atleast IMX 586 in that. At this price, when u are getting SD 888 , very fast charging, Sony IMX 689 and 766 sensors, this price is good. But they should have given OIS, more 5G bands.People say that wireless charging should be given like in overseas versions. What is the use 15 watt or 30 watt wireless charging when you getting 65 watt charging. Wired charging is much quicker than wireless. So wireless charging under 30 watt will be worst.Vivo X60 or Pro may be better in terms of camera but still they are using SD 870 only. Just 33 watt charging. They are using Sony IMX 598 only.  Somewhere you are getting better but u can't beat this in terms of batter charging and performance.No heating issues I have faced when used this almost 3 hours. Design is ordinary dont look like a flagship, Color is good. Extremely light weight and handy to use.It is good to buy."
1,"The product just overheats and Battery drains in few minutes, Totally not worthy..."
1,"Guys my humble request...pls don't purchase this one plus 9.. Very worst.. Didn't expect from one plus...1. Within a 10 minutes of using getting OVER HEATING.2. CAMERA is worst.3. Network issues( • while connecting with Wifi, not getting a proper speed wic wifi having 150mbps. In this mobile we getting only 189kp. •Mobile network also worst.)4. Call is getting tooo lag..5. Look of the phone is very average.6. Screen clarity is gud.7. Builtin alexa is working gud.8. Sound clearity is gud.9. Overall worst phone at high price.10. Dont go for this one plus 9Thank you"
1,Over priced phone..very ordinary look..not amoled screen..OIS is a must in today's time which even every ordinary phone is providing. It is not expected out of a flagship phone.One plus !! You were always known for value for Money phones. I would expect you to provide OIS and good 5G bandwidth atleast as a update in future.
1,Sound is not coming through Bluetooth headset for this device
1,"One plus lost its credibility after one plus 9 release.One plus 9 is only hype and worth for the money you pay .One plus 9 is having plastic body like other substandard mobile in the market .One plus 9 does not have wireless charging for only products available in India .One plus is having only two cameras where as one plus R and one plus is having four cameraOne plus 9 is having 5G band - only two 5G bands. The customer care has been fooling us that it will upgrade to 4 5G band. Later on it has confirmed by one plus communication that the software upgrade will not enhance 5G II bandS to IV BANDSI am one of the admirer of one plus product quality  .However , it has diluted after the new release of one plus 9.What for we are paying ??????"
5,"Hey .Today I'm gonna review the Oneplus 9 5G .Ask me any questions you have directly , and I'll try to answer them all. 🙏Okay so let's start :The phone looks quite good , its thin but a bit less wide , I use an iPhone 12 Pro Max , and it's around 1-2 cm less wide . Not a big issue .Screen is fluid , no problems at all . I have used oneplus 7T so I've trust over this brand .Battery :The 65 watt charger does what it's meant to . The cable is a USB C To C . Not the old usb to C . Charges in around an hour .Camera :In my opinion , the biggest selling point is the camera here . Looks good , with a tinge of extra saturation . Way better than the older ones . Gives a lot of independence too .PUBG :ALot of people buy oneplus devices for games , and comparing to my iPhone , this device gives a good competition . 90 fps is an advantage over apple , but rarely devices give 90 fps , maybe in tdms but not in classics . No lag , but you will see some frame drops , but which device doesn't have frame drops ! Even the iPhone does .Competitors :I needed to purchase this for my mother , so Need to share why I went for this .There's IQOO , Asus and Oneplus in this range which are worth buying . I have been using one plus so I trust them more , they have a local service center too , something which I lack in my iPhone experience .I don't trust vivo much , IQOO is a developing brand , it's op for sure , but still couldn't gamble . The Oneplus gives better cameras than any other , which is the main reason I got this , as camera usage is a lot .People with similar budget with just gaming budget can go for rog , but if you need a family phone , this guy packs nearly everything .*You also get stickers and a red cable club card , which is something I like .CONS :Oneplus really needs to deal with the software issues . There's always some thing left to patch after the release , which sucks .The dialer has that annoying annoucement during recording , and that really can make you go deaf XDOverall , could go for rog if needed a gaming phone , but since a lot of my family members use this device , I went for one plus .Thanks for reading , I hope I helped you :)"
2,"The OnePlus 9 Software is a real Downer! If you're like me, then you would have gone by with the OnePlus 9 reviews and marketing press releases! Truth be told - Even after the update the phone has major flaws in software in the Alarm setting and interface! At the price charged the Camera is a real Downer! I feel cheated. This was to be a phone I could trust and hold on to for good,sadly now I need to possible buy another brand and chuck OnePlus for good! OnePlus is this ethical? You're marketing was just hype!"
5,"888 is way too fast.65 watt charging is awesome.120hz display is buttery smooth.Ram and Storage are also very fast.Rear cameras are awesome, best in this price segment.Front camera is very average (didn't liked it).Battery backup is also average, but the charging speed cover it all. If you're a moderate user you will get whole day backup.Oxygen OS is just amazing. It's the cleanest UI I've ever used and have lot of customization features too..No heating issue faced till now, it just became a little warm(very little) in booting. Other than that I played Asphalt 9 and COD mobile they were buttery smooth.Final rating from my side 9/10. ( One marks less coz take a lot of selfies but selfie camera turned out to be a disappointment for me).Go for it, awesome device, you will love using it."
5,I am using this phone from last 5-6 days. I listened very much about heating issue but after using this phone I am saying you truth I am also getting this problem but after updating the latest updates you will not goona face this problem again. But if you are working in direct sunlight for more than 1-2 hour you will get message of high temperature but in 2-3 minutes it will restore to normal.so here Is truth and phone is really amazing
4,"Using since past 3 days, good speed . No lags when multiple apps are opened. Amazing battery life, single charge is enough for more than a day. Wrap charge is superfast. 20 min for 45% to 100% charging. Camera's are good. I was using LG G7 ThinQ before. One plus 9 camera is not as good as LG. But still works well. Will post more update after a month usage."
2,"It doesn't match the quality that I have come to expect from OnePlus phones. I am graduating from OnePlus 6t. And definitely not expected based on the money you end up paying. There is nothing really special in the camera, atleast one doesn't notice a visible change except for the filters. The phone heats up like crazy even with simple operations like a video call (even after the latest Software update). Battery life is decent but not super sturdy as you would expect in a new phone, I can see this becoming a problem in the months to come.The good things are the performance, the gesture control, the ease offered by OnePlus switch."

1,I am using OnePlus since 2019. Just for the upgrade I bought OnePlus 9 5G but after all not a good option and not much happy with phone performance. Facing a lot of issues like-Heating issue is too much.battery life is not so good.Taking too much time while chargingCamera quality is average.
5,Excellent mobile . Charging is up next level. Super quality.
5,Product is good and provides similar performance as shared by one plus for 12 Gb Ram 256 Gb ROMAfter using one plus 7 pro and looking at 8 series I expected very little changes in 9 buy this cross my all expectations .Gaming.mode does not give any glitches or pixel issues .. performance is very good . Although battery gets drained but that depends on type of usage .Over all camera performance is best I have observed in this segment and Hasselblad camera breaks boundaries viewing clarity
4,"People should've waited for the updates. Phone has improved alot and still recieving updates.  Battery lasts for 1 day, its subjective. Depends on usage.  Fast charging🔥Camera puts out great quality if you turn on High Resolution from top.No heating issue now, everything is sorted. But camera needs alot of improvement it's slow in clicking.But to be honest there's nothing you'll hate about the device, You are paying this much for the camera and the OS. For camera prefer the Pro bcs of OIS. OP9 has stabilisation mode but not that effective. Great phone, if not camera go for the 8TBattery update- Initially you won't see good battery life, bcs new device takes time to understand your usage pattern and then it optimises the phone. 1st day 10% dropped in 15 mins. But now 10% drops in almost 45-60 mins. Decent battery+ Crazy charger= Satisfactory 1 day usage."
5,"I m oneplus phone user from a long time. I have used oneplus 3,6, 7T pro and now this. I m writing this review after using it for 2 days.Received phone 1 day before promised date. I bought this phone at 51999₹ with SBI credit card.Phone box contains phone with applied screen guard, back cover, charger and C to C cable for charger. You can't connect this phone to your laptop if you don't have C USB port in your laptop. You have to buy C to USB cable. Luckily I have one from my old phone.Phone is light is weight w.r.t. 7T pro which is a plus point for guy like me who carries the phone in front pocket. Also the screen size is appropriate, not too large and not too small.Phone is slim like one plus 6 and screen is flat and round at the edge like 7T pro. Front camera is not at centre, which I don't prefer.Battery looks good so far. Charging from 5% to 90% in 20min. I m using phone continually for last 2 days and I have to carge the phone twice. So I would say it's plus.I m not a game person but played game to check it's performance and found better than last phone.Cameras are really good. Both front and back camera are best. I m not a photographer but for amature like me it does job more then required.Cons for me:-1. No USB to C cable for laptop connection2. One plus phone app is not there, phone is using Google phone app, same goes with messaging app. Which is may be due to inbuilt Alexa.3. Heating of phone while charging and while using for long time, but that's what u expect when u have this much large battery.Overall really good phone within its price range with flagship brand."
2,"Average phone, esp given the hype given to it prior to the launch. Not at all a value for money. Prefer samsung or an iphone.Even lower priced phones from Samsung have far far better camera than this one.It is ridiculously over priced with the value it provides.Only positive is a wrap charger. Other than that it is an average phone.Speaker - 👎🏾Camera - 👎🏾👎🏾Pricing - 👎🏾Battery & charger - 👍🏾"
5,"AFTER ONE MONTH REVIEW1.Camera is great.I)OIS is not an issue as youtubers were saying.2.Neither overheating, temperature remains as it is on other devices it's just software glitch on apps like ampere3.gaming is so smooth that you will need few days to get used to (Cod Mobile,Pes2021,Kof, Pokemon go) even if you're pro.4.80percent battery can last 4-5 hours screen on time and 8-10 hours otherwise.5. Stereo speakers are good6.Screen quality is far better than previous OnePlus devices, Looks like samsung device from front because of samsung screen.7.Price is 6k -8k higher Just because of hasselblad logoOverall great phone go for it"
1,"I have been a OnePlus user since the original OnePlus. Never have been so much disappointed in a phone than this one.The first piece I bought - the battery heated up to 43 degrees and I couldn’t hold the phone. Got it replaced in the off chance that I had received a faulty piece.The second one - similar issues. Worse, the battery backup is pathetic. What use is a 30 min Warp charge if 80% of the battery drops down to 30% in half an hour of normal usage.Cons - Heating issues, pathetic battery life.Pros - None that just such a price point."

5,"I am writing the review after use of about 1 day. I purchased it for my mother. She is very happy to have it. Aa she was earlier user of Samsung basic mobile and she used the mobile for about 6 years. So now she upgraded to smartphone of this brand because in her opinion Samsung mobiles are long lasting. In my opinion:-  Display- 4.5/5  Battery- 5/5  Camera- 5/5  Performance- 4/5  Look- 4/5  Value for money- 4.5/5Display is good and bright as usual Samsung display are always of better quality.  Sound is not best but okay. Look is good but need improvement in back design as it seems to be a cheap plastic material. Battery has no complaints. Camera specially front camera is surprisingly good. But performance should be improved as somtime touch is less responsive.so if you are multitasker and heavy user of mobile then itz not for you. but keeping the price in mind 7299 rs for 3gb ram and 32 gb storage its a fair deal as you are attached to Samsung brand which is better than cheap chinese mobiles like Mi, Oppo, etcPlz don't forget to like if fou find my review helpful 👍"
1,performance was very bad if I open the application that time hang my phone with in 3 seconds and when I rotate the video on landscape mode that time video has slowly moved
4,"Dont expect much from this phone, this is a average user phone, phone will be  lag if using more apps, but its decent for this price, value for money.  Best for Basic to Android upgraders."
1,"I ordered the phone as soon as it was launched. When I received the phone, the camera was not working properly. Everything was very blurry and phone was very slow.I placed a return request. I then received the replacement piece. Camera was working this time but after 1 day use, I noticed that nobody called me the whole day when I generally receive around 10 calls. When I tried calling from another number, it said that the number is out of coverage area when jio had good network reception and VoLTE was on. I have a placed a return request for second time now."
5,"Why did i purchased?1.For using wifi hotspot, instead of my primary phone2.To make or receive Emergency calls either from office or other personalsWhat did i liked most?1.Good Build quality2.Good Display, excellent quality3.Good signal reception, clear voice quality.4.economy price.5.Good Battery6.Latest operation system.7.Dolby atmos(good for music lovers)8.hotspotWhat makes you disappoint?Usb port should be ctype.Finally, what did you say?This is the excellent phone in this price range.Can be used as wifi hotspot and standby phone.This phone is only for basic usage like listening music, simple  voice calls, chatting, watching youtube, surfing net.Not recommended for gamers and heavy users.And display supports upto 720p only.Note:In initial setup, you may face lag and struck in youtube videos. But once after setup completed,restart  the phone.Everything  will get settled up."
3,"So I recieved the phone a few days back. And I will be using this phone as my primary phone. So I will keep this brief and almost to the point.Build quality- tacky looking, good, but can be improved for future budget phones. I got grey color, and it's not metallic, my mum says the rear looks like shahbadi floor tiles. Not an insult. Anyways I like it, but it's not metallic.Screen- personally, I am happy with it, touch feedback is nice too, but ofcourse not like 20k+ range phones.touch is very responsive in the calculator app.Battery- well 5000mah, good, it's quite more than necessary for me but good.Camera- macro camera- took a fair enough macro shot, 2mp. 3.2mp would have been a sweet spot in budget yet good quality. Front and main camera yet to test fully. Night time photos? Forget it. Honestly even most mid range phones don't fare well in night.Processor power- its not a powerful chip to begin with, but fine, I am going to manage with it. For others, the phone is a bit laggy/slow in some aspects..or most. Camera takes a good whole second or 2 to start, the viewfinder flow is not smooth and laggy/glitchy.but I like the wide and macro combination. SHOULD'VE BEEN 3.2MP :'(More apps= bit more lag while entering main menu. So the less no of apps, should suffice. I opened a bunch of apps, including 3 Google tabs in browser, and many apps, lag was not severe slowdown, but was a little slower than before or it's slow to begin with and didn't really have high expectations. Using the device care and/or restarting the phone did feel better and smoother, but took a good whole 7 to 10 seconds for the live wallpaper to load. Talking of wallpapers, even being samsing OneUI, there is no option for galaxy themes :(I am not gonna do any major gaming on this so I cannot say anything on it's regard, I prefer pc gaming. But don't expect much, however if you really want have a  experience where you'd feel better/happy with the purchase, I'd suggest playing classic games like Mario, crash bandicoot etc. Some game suggestions- Dadish, alto.I will update this review after a week/months use. And finally a half/full year update.If you have a budget of atleast 10k then I'd suggest buying some other samsung product or your preference. I've used the m31s and compared to this, that phone is way smooth, and many more models out there. But if you want a entry level phone, or coming from a feature phone, budget constraints, secondary phone. Then this is the phone to go with.  I personally like my m02 quite a bit."
1,"Phone is very slow& heats up quickly. I replace the first piece. Received the replacement the very next day, thanks to amazon. But the second handset was even worse as it got extremely heated even before it was set up completely. Returning it also."
1,"No wireless display as specified and camera not working evertime, quality is poor, even though 13mpixel, it's like VGA camera.. pictures are blur..please don't waste your money.."
3,Average Smartphone.....😵
4,"Mobile is good for simple use but pathetic camera , no fingerprint sensor and old processor which makes it slow for a phone in 2021 .  I purchased it as my secondry phone, display is really awesome and light weight with sleek design. For better deal opt for micromax IN 1B if you can compromise on display and will use as primary phone  .But the conclusion is samsung's quality and customer care cannot be compared with any other brand  in india .If you want a secondry phone then its a perfect choice at this price"
5,"At a first glance phone looks decent one. It has almost all the features except finger print but it's ok in this price range. Checked the sound quality, camera, internet speed. All seems to be fine. For a basic user it's a good choice. Will review further after using few more days."
5,The product is best value for money and only watch it as a budget smartphone
1,Performance and display is not as per standard. Pale display....it looka like a duplicate screen. Performance is so slow that even opening a calculator take 5sec of lag to open. It seems this phn is either refurbished version of some older phone. Samsung has not delivered such low standard phn till now.
1,"Reason to buy :1. Very stylish looks . u found a premium quality.2. Big display.3. Battery is good.Reason not to buy1. It's like a Scorpio with auto""s engine.App load time is long2. Camara just a scrap.3. Speaker is very very bad. Burst speaker.Over all don't buy this . if you don't want anything more than call nd need only a good looking ph then only buy or either go for poco c3,redmi 9a"
1,I have used 3 or 4 samsung phones with this price tag. But this phone model is disappointing me.I found below issues in the phone that i received from this seller. Not sure about other users.1. Call volume is low.2. Performance issue.3. Phone hangs in the middle without loading the website completely.4. Very heavy but ( i did not notice it when i ordered. This is my mistake).5. Call disconnection but not very frequently.There is no option for refund. But it has only exchange with the same model.I returned this mobile . Am waiting for replacement phone. Let us see how the new phone of same model works.
2,Good in screen size. Average phone in the price range. 👍Camera 📷 worst-: On the name of samsung it's very bad. 👎Battery🔋backup-: It's is good can run full day.👍Speed~RAM-: Don't even think of playing any game. It's lag vere very much even while playing Temple Run in 3gb variant.👎Memory management-: it's come with 32gb internal memory in with 10gb is allready consume by system software.👎Overall ~ If you are purchasing this phone for only calling purpose then go for it. 👍Don't think of playing a single 50-100Mb game u won't be able to play on this device 🙏
3,"Writing this review after couple of days of using. First I ordered this and received a slow item, then I replaced the item and thanks to Amazon I have received the replacement within 1 day. But, the replacement item is still slow. Hence, I have decided to return the item.PROS:1. Big Screen2. Huge Battery Life3. 3GB of RAM4. 32GB of Internal Storage6. Latest Android OSCONS:1. MediaTek Processor (after having 3GB of RAM, the phone takes 2 seconds to open Chrome and 1.5 seconds to open contact list)2. Hangs After Playing GamesVERDICT:You can go for this phone if you are looking for a secondary phone or you are gifting this to your parents. This phone is not for them who will watch movies, play games and hinging on social media apps."
5,* Display is very good* Battery Backup Excellent* Stylish Mobile* YouTube Videos playing without buffering
1,"Guys if you are looking for a smartphone Please do not buy this product. Reasons are given below1. Battery life is not upto the Mark even in power saving mode. Drained very fast in just 15 hrs. If you watch movie then ot will drain in 4 hrs only.2. Camera. Both front and rear camera are just like vga camera. No quality of Megapixels.3. Hangs a lot. Takes too much to unlock and don't have a fingerprint scanner as well. No facelock option.4. Many times it dont show the caller number on screen for 5 to 10 seconds.When you are working on it and someone calls you then only ringtone will play first and small icon will appear on the top after 5-10 seconds. Unknown no. by truecaller will show when you disconnect call.5. I have not installed any game as it hangs in normal operation.6. Screen width is not upto mark,as keys of keyboard come closer. You will feel uncomfortable while typing.7. Sound quality is low, as no proper music beats.8. When you are on call the screen automatically flash and touch enables.Samsung should recall this model. Worst ever phone. You can add 2000 more and can get better phone than this."
2,"Phone is little bit slow hanging in first start , below average camera quality both front and rear , plastic back but at this price point cant expect more. But we can expect good Qualcomm Snapdragon processor or exynos ...long charger wirePros - good battery not yet checked , bright and clear screen, latest update today via OTA,Cons- very small charger wire and it is unacceptable, below average camera, very slow phone , plastic cheap quality,I suggest spend bit more on good specification phone don't just go with Samsung..."
5,"Best smartphone in this prize,nice display, battery life best,but I want to more features like, screen shot and screen recorder too."
1,"First I was happy that Samsung rolled out a budget phone under 7000 Rs. but later got disappointed that we have to bear slow processor. The processor is quite slow and the phone started hanging as soon as I booted for the very first time. Along with this drawback, the display is very cheap when it comes to expecting a nice one from a brand like Samsung. I would suggest not to go with the brand value but see the specifications before you buy and don't make the mistake which I made."
4,"3/32gb variant @ 7299/- is good deal with samsung brand. Quad-core MediaTek MT6739 Processor is outdated & slow but adequate for basic usage. No lagging for whatsApp, fb, YouTube.  Display & Screen resolution is great as well as battery backup. 10W charger took more than 3.5hr for full charging. Cameras are average considering price point."
4,"This is my first personal Samsung phone, and what better model to start with! Using it for a week  now and everything is functioning as it should. Very good display, sound and maneuverability overall.  Only one thing :  The mobile's data cable could really have been a bit longer. Other than that the phone is working fine. The best thing is the 5000mAH battery,  which I am enjoying. :-) Truly  a value for money.Will update if I find any other significant matter in the coming days."
4,Product is just ok if you have another phone. I use iPhone n I took it as some apps have xtra features in android.Phone has a good battery. Processor is not good enough so it’s a little slagging. Design is good. Display is too bright if u hold it straight with ur eyes as it’s a tft lcd.  I hope in future updates mobile will become a little smoother.  It is very rare that you will get every update time to time in this price. But I am sure u r not going to get a better choice in this price. If you have money shortcomings you can consider it!!Have a nice day ahead!!
2,I ONLY USE FOR MAKING CALLS.WHATSAPP VIDEOS ONE OR TWO I SEE AT THE MAXIMUM.MOBILE LOOKS GOOD.NO ONE CAN TALK ILL ABOUT SAMSUNG DISPLAY OR CAMERA.AS USUAL BATTERY FAILS.IN THIS CASE ATTERY DRAINS EVERYDAY I NEED TO CHARGE EVENTHOUGH I DIDNOT PLAY ANY GAME OR SEE MEDIA.IF WE PUT FULL CHARGE ATLEAST IT SHOULD LAST FOR ONE FULL DAY.MORNING IF IT IS 100 PERCENT EVENING IT COMES AROUND 35 PERCENT.CURSE FOR SAMSUNG.
5,Best samsung mobile in this price category.Thank you Amazon.
2,"I would not recommend this product to any age group.This mobile has most slowest processor, even on first day you feel like you are operating crashed system.Go for bit higher prise product you Will not regret."
5,"If we compare the product quality with the price, definitely it is a value for money device for your daily usage.Battery life is very good, charging is a bit slow but ok.Look wise the phone gives a decent look from back side which can be increased by using back cover.Front side look is awsm.Screen size is good for gaming and movies, performance is great even in sunlight.Camera quality is absolutely fine.Definitely you can go for this having a branded logo on back."
5,A wonderful value for money! I had asked it as a extra side phone. It provides excellent prolonged battery life and beautiful design that doesn't get you off. The performance is obviously not as fast as premium phones in terms of speed if you want to use as a multi purpose phone. But basic apps just do all fine.
1,Defective Item was received.IMEI number is not displaying when dialing the required number.Requested for a refund but exchange partner has refused to collect it despite raising a request within 24 hours.Please check the seller on Amazon before purchasing your products.
3,The phone gets very hot with minimal use.Editing the review after the phone was replaced. This time got the right product and it works pretty well.Guess it was a faulty product to begin with. Happy with Amazon. Samsung needs to do their quality checks better.
5,Just amazing..Battery back up to video quality as well as net working and perform too fast..
5,"Very good budget phone with big screen. Support is only for 2.4ghz WiFi and not support 5ghz WiFi which user is missing compared to other manufacturers smartphone around same price range. Charger point is not so smooth to insert the charging pin and seems it might cause priblem after an year use, but need to see how it copes with."
5,One  of Best mobile phone in this range💪 truely💪awesome
3,After using this device for 5 days I can share some pros and consPros-1- Budget smartphone from Samsung at this price range.2- Screen is better in performance.3- 5000 mAh battery life stands upto 24 hours after watching videos for 5 hours and calling. (Couldn't play game)4- Picture quality is average.Cons-1- The device lags and sometimes hang on performing easy steps like shifting app to app.2- Multitask becomes difficult as it is slow in performance.3- Camera is not upto the mark.4- Doesn't feel premium while holding the phone.5- due to bigger battery the mobile feels heavy. (206 gms)6- Found bugs like-(1) Pressing power button takes time to wake and sleep the screen.(2) Home screen zooms upto 300% without activating.(3) Opening camera stucks for upto 5-10 sec sometimes.(Will update more if found)Thanks!
5,Good quality product.. working perfectly. No defects found on mobile. Good quality rear cameras and good quality front cameras. Good sound quality.  Good display quality . Light weight . Good touch sensitive. Designs and colours are good . In this price mobile  is good. Phone back Is made of plastic. Good performance ram no lag coming . Android 10 installed . After we connect internet  to phone we get updations of all. Totally good mobile. Total 10 gb is used in rom 22 gb Is balance.
1,Believe me guys don't make mistake you will regret. This phone hangs a lot even at normal task like opening notification panel or settings or receiving calls. Better go for other brands if you are tight with your budget they buy new Gionee phones Gionee F103 pro was my first phone there are some software update problem but except that everything runs much smoother than this M02 and note it this Gionee phone was 5 years old and still you can play COD in it. Even i have played pubg recently before it was ban. Now i ordered new mobile because i was getting battery issue in my Gionee handset and trusted Samsung but i got something more bad than previous phone.Don't buy it!
1,Pathetic performance of the phone. My father in law was using old redmi 3i for past many years. Since it's battery was almost gone i bought this useless mobile with weakest processor. Opening a dialer itself takes 3-4 seconds. I didn't imagine this like sluggishness of the mobile from Samsung. Better i would've gone with xiomi or realme. Wasted Rs.7500.. lets see how long will it work
4,"So I ordered this phone 20 days ago I guessAs i got a good exchange offer for my repaired handset i only paid 900.About the product-The screen quality is awesome at this price point, the battery is also promising, build quality is above average however it doesn’t offer fingerprint which is pretty basic even at this price.The main concern with this handset is the ram management on this one creates problem. The multitasking can’t be done fluently and yes it lags a bitTo me I purchased this handset for my 2.5 years old niece as she loves watching videos throughout the day. So for us it was a health purchase but for those who want to use this as a primary phone. Please increase your budget otherwise you will be irritated."
1,Very bad products
3,carge is low
1,Waste of money!!
2,"how could you think , it can compete other brands by low photography where other brands comes with 48MP quad rear camera"
3,Good phone
1,Heating problem is thereVery bad Experience
3,This phone have no call recording function.
1,Phone is hanging mid app opening.Haven't even installed Pubg on it.Glitchy AF.Touch Screen has problem too.Expected better from OppoBought it for my aunt 2 days ago and today only it got delivered.Not even 10 hrs and it is lagging and glitching.
4,"Review after using the mobile for 5 days:Battery backup is great and charging is also faster. Camara quality is good. Side mounted Finger print sensor is the best in segment which works like a charm. I did not find any lag in it. I have bought 6gb 128gb variant.  Though the battery is 5000mah the phone is light weight. Pubg and free fire works smooth, there is no lag while playing it in high graphics settings as well. Only problem is there is no call recording option by default. You need to download third party app from play store for call recording.Overall the phone is very good and value for money. The phone is not bulky it's very slim."
5,"As a media consumption phone it's the best phone under Rs. 20,000 given that it's the only one with stereo speakers which are well-balanced. Stereo sound does make a difference even in a small device. Couple that with a sharp FHD+ screen (its TFT LCD screen is perfectly fine; AMOLED is unnecessarily hyped) and a good battery, and you have a winner. Well done Oppo. Not interested in camera or gaming so can't comment on that. 665 processor works fine for streaming and surfing. Best deal for 6GB RAM version would be with exchange or some offer to bring it under Rs. 15,000. The 4GB one can be nudged closer to even Rs.10,000 which would be a steal."
1,Please don't refer to anyone this is 6 GB ram but when we are in normal work like movies watching and texting lagging too much.... And also Nothing to gaming 😒 total lagging... I failed to choose this phone
3,Duplicate headsets and Data cable was sent with no OPPO stamps or Printed in the Headsets. There is a white line on the right side of the handset which might leads towards damaging the Entire screen.
4,For OPPO A52 mobile it doesn't have fast charging and it doesn't have call recording facility from oppo company. Usually from past two years I am using Oppo F11 mobile phone . It has call recording facility which was given by oppo company from the manufacture . One more thing is in COLOR OS 7.1 I cannot see the system apps also. The product was absolutely good product . I would like to give 4.0 out of 5 rating. If I above features which I mentioned above then I will give 4.75 out of 5 rating.
5,Thank u oppo....very good phone... amazing battery..good camera...
3,Pros:Looks goodBuild quality is goodDisplay quality is goodsound quality is goodBattery back up is goodCons:Cameras are disappointing. Especially the front camera. It's useless. Primary camera also does not take sharp pictures. Not at all good for the price. Future software update may improve things.Overall performance is average. There are occasional stutters while browsing internet.
3,1) THERE IS NO AUTO CALL RECORDER AVAILABLE IN THIS PHONE2) FRONT CAMERA IS OK BUT BACK CAMERA IS VERY POORI ADVICE TO OPPO PLEASE UPDATE AUTO CALL RECORDER IN THIS PHONE AND IMPROVE CAMERA QUALITY
2,"The camera quality is very poor. I have been using amazon platform since long and have never felt so much disappointed. The photo quality of the phone is so bad that I am repenting why did I purchase this phone. Let me mention one important thing also, You can not return this product. I wanted to replace this model with any other OPPO phone, but my request was turned downed by amazon. However, after diagnosing my phone via blancoo app Amazon agreed with my point that the camera was not functioning properly and I am being provided with the same model new piece, I never experienced bad about amazon services, but this issue has changed my opinion a bit. A suggestion : Never buy a phone without doing proper research."
3,"I dont have anything better to do right now , so here I go (to the quest of writing my first detailed review about anything):-Oppo A52 is a relatively old phone , according to chinese standard (release date June 2020).Battery -3.5My previous phone Zenfone Max pro m1 gave more battery during its early days and equal amount after using it for one year. ~ with moderate use , you need to recharge after 1 day.Screen/Display - 5 .Awesome . Comes very close to OP7t (@ 60Hz) . No complaints .Performance - 3/5O.K .Camera - 2/5Just pass , like I did in my Cs-1 paper.Build - 3.5Better than O.KOverall = 0.6+0.75+0.75+1+0.4 = 3.5 ............."
5,Nice mobile all price of only looks this handset awesome actractiv
5,"Except camera, overall phone is very good interms of performance, battery, interface, I really like oppo a52 phone and good budget phone."
2,"First - Phone lags a lot. More than blink of an eye after you have clicked on an App's icon.Worst front camera. I have used OPPO phone before. Infcat my last phone was oppo as well. And this one is just bad.My recommendation, do not buy. Please"
2,"Hi,If you want only Music phone, purchase it. Otherwise Camera Quality very bad, touch sensor has issue, auto call recording facility not there, dialer search with unsaved number not available, Maximum time your call will not connect and vice versa.  Heavy weight, side finger sensor is irretating.  In this exchange option this phone is not available in list.Intact , this is not a user friendly phone and  will not recommend to anyone."
4,"Battery dropping is an issue. One more thing that I am facing, though it's not a fault but I don't know others are facing or not - while typing in social apps sometimes the app closedown and goes in multitasking, because of the home page button is just below the space-bar. Sometimes I face problem in typing fast."
5,"Got it in GIF sale for 8.5k after exchanging old mobile. For this price this is the best mobile you can get if camera is not a concern. Snapdragon 665 is a very good processor and with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage this is a very good configuration.Screen is good and crisp with good colour reproduction.Battery backup is excellent, getting almost two days. Before first time use it is recommended to fully charge even before switching on the device for first time.Camera clarity is good for 12MP setup. Photos are good under proper lighting conditions."
1,The battery drained too fast. Didn’t look like the 5000 Mah battery.The contacts took a long time to shown or load the contacts.
1,"This mobile was waste product , When I was talking with any one with this phone it was making resound and static noise which cause me headache.And also when I was selected for mobile service from Amazon he came and saw and he told we can't do any thing with this speaker problem and went back . So, waste product and also Amazon was not taking exchange ,,,I highly recommend u not to buy this product and suffer....."
5,The best thing about this phone is its camera 📸 . If you are a mobile photographer surely go for it and if you are a gamer you can go for it too its an magical phone. There's only one problem the quality of the slow motion is quite low.
5,Great phone for its price.  Box contains the protective back cover which is a added benefit and a good earphone.  Charging takes time if completely drained which is a slight irritant.  Else good recommend.
4,Battery comes only a day full when I use net it is not working (long lasting) for complete day. The battery quality may not be that much qualitative. Phone quality and camera 📸 quality is also not satisfactory.
1,It's really bad choice. Don't go for oppo products. It's my first oppo product. It starts showing overheat warning all the time from start up.Its hanging when playing games and relly not for multitasking.
3,"After using 1 month, I am updating my review:Mobile design & weight: 7/10Back camera quality: 5/10Front camera quality: 8/10Mobile sound quality: 10/10Mobile screen quality : 10/10Mobile performance: 4/10Touch response: 7/10Battery life & charging speed: 8/10Face recognition & Fingerprint sensitivity: 10/10"
3,Guys I am sure it is better then redmi note 9 and redmi phones because when you feel the luxury touch of phone you forget those phone. Other side no lags according to you tubers it is not but personally it is good phone because I am not pubg game player I play normal games and everyone compare phone with pubg lol. It is best phone for normal people performance is awesome up to the mark. Sound quality better then Dolby because both speaker works very good and loud with clear hearing. No heat up issue fast charging also works good and lots of things oppo providing you. I am first time using oppo phone and I am happy with my purchase. I also compare with many phones but I chose this one because it on bajaj no cost EMI and with good features. I am sure you will not regret after buy this product very nice smooth and good quality it's bit heavy but it is11:34 Battery optimization also work very nice. No phone is perfect in this world but it is better then other companies. I know it is Chinese company phone but we are using everything which is import from China so stay away from politics and choose according to your pocket and according to your wish. It is one of the best phone I ever purchased perfect phone for me. I recommend for those who looking for different and change. Processor yeah Woh doesn't matter Yaar sound and looks always matter. Yo it's a best phone good in my hands.
3,"There is something missing in software side, auto call recording, if u search contacts unwanted contacts will come first.Camera quality average."
4,"I have received a defective product. There is a vertical led error in display. Some how I didn't notice firstly and my returned period was over so I could not return it. However rest functions are working properly, but as a mobile lover I am not satisfied. So far the delivery time span is concerned I was also a bit disappointed. However overall experience was not good."
1,"Very disappointed after buying it. In first glance I was so happy to buy it. But now, I regret . You must know what things made me give this product very less rating :-1. Poorest camera quality2. No call recording3. Hanging issue4. No smooth experience, sometimes touch pad literally sleeps and doesn't work5. App clone feature is limited to some certain apps only6. Battery backup is below satisfactory level.7. Hardly 1 update I've got so far.It seems like I've bought a garbage in exchange offer. I'm missing my old phone. I will never buy oppo phones.The company needs to use some common sense before manufacturing smartphones. The most useful feature like call recording has not been provided. Despite 6 GB RAM, it doesn't give smooth experience and stops working sometimes. Then what's the use of buying 6GB variant.In short, ""Don't buy"", ""Beware of Oppo Smartphones""."
5,"Superb!!!!!This is my first phone of oppo, initially I was little hagette to buy this due to rating of camera ,but my assumption was wrong.it is amazing.camarra is up to the mark,display is sharp and fine.sound quality is good."
1,"I got a new phone after I mentioned the OPPO phone is faulty for incoming call. I got a new phone. However I have the same problem with the new phone. For the incoming calls, I accept the call, I can't hear anything or neither the person on the other side. Now with the new phone, I have to wait 10-20 seconds before I can hear the person. Atleast now I can hear them after 20 seconds. But OPPO is faulty. I am not sure why not everyone is complaining about it. I had a dual SIM in my phone. Could this be a reason? Or the OPPO is itself is faulty"
2,Oppo a52 mobile is good in any thing but the I can booked this mobile in Amazon this charger is not oppo company brand. Amazon giving duplicate charger this is for gve the oppo company charger to everyone . don't give the local charger
5,"Best affordable product from  oppo.Posting review after 15 days of intense use.Screen 5/5Battery Backup 4.5/5Speed 5/5In every aspect, phone is awesome."
5,"Superb...Nothing expected in this price segment got this for 11k in deal. 6gb 128. Variant.Quad resolution, quad camera and full view display.Technology keeps changing so dont waste money on big brands or 50k for phones..Hence i intend to buy a phone not more than 12k budget and got this beautifulphone with all requirements.Stylish no fingerprint back but on side.Display is awesome.Camera is good.Little heavy and needs good back cover protection."
1,Worst phone from Oppo. Highly unreliable. Hangs too much. Call could not be received sometimes. Updated software but it's UI sucks  F11 Pro UI was awesome. A52 is worst. Never recommend anyone to buy at Rs.100 also. Calling is also troublesome. It is linked with web. Overall I rate it 0 on scale of 10.
4,Oppo is my favo for long time and this is for the 3rd time Oppo keep me happy as expected. The deal from Amazon was really a killer (almost 50% off!) and the seller Appario also did a mind-blowing quicker delivery of 2 days in advance - therefore I presented this mobile as an Diwali gift to my spouse!!
1,Waste of money!!

Variant.Quad resolution, quad camera and full view display.Technology keeps changing so dont waste money on big brands or 50k for phones..Hence i intend to buy a phone not more than 12k budget and got this beautifulphone with all requirements.Stylish no fingerprint back but on side.Display is awesome.Camera is good.Little heavy and needs good back cover protection."
1,Worst phone from Oppo. Highly unreliable. Hangs too much. Call could not be received sometimes. Updated software but it's UI sucks  F11 Pro UI was awesome. A52 is worst. Never recommend anyone to buy at Rs.100 also. Calling is also troublesome. It is linked with web. Overall I rate it 0 on scale of 10.
4,Oppo is my favo for long time and this is for the 3rd time Oppo keep me happy as expected. The deal from Amazon was really a killer (almost 50% off!) and the seller Appario also did a mind-blowing quicker delivery of 2 days in advance - therefore I presented this mobile as an Diwali gift to my spouse!!
4,Best phoneGood lookingEasy to handle even on one handLoaded with full features except web.The smaller look and dual sim support is the best feature that i like most .Speaker: music sound low but ear speaker sound is great.Battery : 2 days on average usage800mah battery charge within minutes.Cons: earphone and adaptor is not coming with the boxRecommend: anyone sould get it without any hesitationWhen i took this in my hand it feels great.
5,Received today .worth for money.very good

3,All above good mobile phone but bettery performance is very weak so I am so sad this bettery issued.
4,Good product...worth of price.
2,Belive me don't go for other review the reality is you can get such features in only 15 k phone.Camera quality is below 15000 phone even redmi note 7 pro hav better camera than thisI have used mi max 2 redmi not 7 pro pcoc F1 vivo v 20 pro all having good features and camera.Coming to battery samsung is makiy fool of written 7000 mah performance like 4000 mahComing to processor i can't even think to play pubg in it . 30 fps. So much laggy.It is not a gaming phone but this not also a camera phone i can say this is a display phone with fooled 7000 mah battery..I dont wanaa heart any one but this is the reality of samsung.. i feel my first and last mistake.... Very big disappointment.
5,I bought this phone last month. Good battery life ( 2 days). Processing speed is not so high. But it is okay for me.  Camera quality is good. Screen picture quality is excellent.side finger print sensor is not useful for me. Looks good. But little bulky feel.
3,When your phone battery comes to 15 or  14 percent the free fire glitches so many times and more than 30 percent is better for gaming without glitches
5,Best phone everBattery: BestDisplay: BestBack Camera:BestFront Camera: BestSamsung did a great job with this phone

4,"I've been using this phone for 4days now.I will share my review with pros and cons:cons:1.It feel like a cheap phone idk why,there are some phones in this price segment ""looks"" premium.2.No LED notification,a major missing.3.Rear Camera is not that good in default,but when we changed to 48MP it looks ""kinda"" good.It seems like good in this price segment.4.Its little bit getting Hot while charging and I feel some Hottnes while taking photos(maybe coz of outside temperature)5.It takes quite a bit to get fully charged,yah the battery is 6000 but its fast charging with 18W.6.so much pre installed apps(we can uninstall it) and also like previously,we have to go through each app to disable ""Recommendations""Pros:1.Very light weight and it doesn't feel a massive 6000 is inside2.Front camera is Superb! good detailed pics in portrait.3.Battery is so good.I use the phone to take a lot of pictures and use it for 1 hr swiping through Instagram,the battery doesn't notice that at all lol(its pretty good)4.Stereo speaker does that job GOOD5.For games,ya with a medium settings it is good for 1hr continuous gaming after that it gets little hot but there is no overheating like that issue till now.This is all I can remember,I will try to update if I notice it afterwards."
3,"Redmi 9 Power Electric Green (4+128)(FIRST 24-HOURS REVIEW)• A phone with Superb Design and unique colours• I have purchased electric green colour and believe it is really superB in looks• Heavy in weight but its okey as it looks fine in hands• Dual stereo speakers with ultimate sound quality!! BUT BUT BUT !!• Redmi claimed 6000mAh Battery, means we think that it will go through atlest ""1 & Half day to 2 days"" of battery backup in one charge, But there is nothing like that.• The Battery will Last go to 1 day of maximum backup only if limited use.(I charged the phone full in last evening by 7pm and its 1 pm today righ now and it is 55% left with no use as i am using it as a secondary phone, means the Remaining 55% battery will last longer to 11pm. The total battery backup without use of phone will go to 28 Hours, as i am using it as a secondary phone with no whatsapp, youtube or any kind of internet surfing with this phone)• It means if u want to use it as a primary phone with whatsapp, youtube, and other internet features then i dont think so that it can give 1 day backup• Redmi claimed 22W Fast Charger with it, apart from it while using its own 22W fast charger it takes more then enough time to charge(It takes time to Charge full)• Camera quality is like hell, specially the front camera, Don't buy if u wants a Camera Quality in Mid Range phoneSummary:-Purchase it if u want as a secondary phonePurchase it if u want super outer looks with ultimate colour optionsPurchase it if u dont want good selfie camera quality (According to price range)Purchase it if u want a Good Looking Attractive Phone"
1,"Very Disappointed by the product. Camera quality is too bad. The only one thing is in phone is it has 6000mah Battery. Overall this product is very worst. Don't buy if you are looking it as a primary phone which has best camera, Storage & massive battery."
1,"Honest review after a week of usage -Do not make the mistake of buying this mobile. While the price point is competitive, it would make lot of sense to pay an extra 1000 and go for the Redmi Note 9 instead of Redmi 9 Power.This mobile has pathetic camera quality. It says 48 MP camera, but the quality is as good as 8 or 13 MP camera. Redmi note 9 having the same camera gives far better quality images. I am truly disappointed with the camera quality.So do not go on the Megapixels. This mobile honestly has very bad camera quality.The performance is OK. A snapdragon octacore processor does not do any justice as I have experienced good amount of lags while opening basic apps.The battery back up is good, but apart from that, there is nothing special about this phone.I regret buying this in the flash sale."
4,Ok Product
1,"Camera is very worst, In indoor lighting pictures are getting blurred, Front camera is something like 4 years back quality because it has only 8MP.When coming to back camera even with 48MP, photos are not clear.My suggestion is not to purchase this mobile, if you can bare 1000/- more, best choice is Redmi note9 or you can purchase realme phones with in this budget.I tried to return the product due to camera quality not expected, but return will not take return back due to quality issue for mobile phone.I purchased many Mobiles, but this is my first worst experience.So please don't by this mobile 🙏🙏🙏🙏"
1,"I bought Redmi 9 power blue (128 GB) in the first sale on 22nd Dec 2020.Amazon delivered it very speedy on 23rd Dec 2020.Reviews:1) Camera: Average for both front and back cameras.2) Sound: Good3) Battery: Drained very fastly, even charging is a bit slower, not looks like 6000 mah.4) Processor: slow processing and sometimes hang also. And touch is also responding slow.5) Games: I didn't try much yet.6) Weight: BulkyI bought it because of the camera but a little bit disappointed with it."
1,Front camera is very poor for video calling. Sometime screen goes totally white on video calling like hanging problems.Its looking dark face.Also battery is not according to expectation as 6000mAH. Battery showing 20% and suddenly goes 80%without charging.

4,Good phone
1,Phone having bad quality and hanging issue and performance is very poor and bad camera quality and brightness over exposed in sun light
1,Non of the features they have mentioned match the phone.-Both Cameras are horrible.-The phone is laggy-Battrey back is horrible-Charge time is horribly slow for a 22W charger
1,Got a damaged phone .. plus Amazon customer service not helping on this .. bad product .. poor service by amazon ... please Don't buy ...
4,Purchased on 22nd Dec 2020.4 GB RAM 128 GB Storage Capacity.Mighty Black (Colour).Rs. 11998Included: Charger. Clear Case. Sim Tray Ejector. Documentation.About 17+ GB of Storage Capacity is utilised by OS and Pre-installed Apps.
3,"I bought this mobile on the first sale 22 Dec 128 gb version, coming to the phone the miui is the same we find in other mi devices which is the reason I bought the phone but one this which I miss the most in MIUI 12 is the absence of second space(why Mi ❓)Pros: Good battery, 48MP back camera and MIUi 12cons: front camera(my redmi note 5 does a better job), no second space, a bit bulky when you hold the phone"
1,"Battery do`t work as specified 6000 mah. worst camera result ever. even new theme or fonts don't work. battery drain to fast. very chip on weight,look,speaker,display many more, friends first time a request you to please do not buy this phone. company try to achieve their position high that's why they start to deliver this type of chip product to customer.  In my home 7 mobile is redmi but i never seen this type of chip mobile ever. i am so sad after purchase this mobile. I need to my money Back."
1,"Firstly got too late delivery from amazon, no response from customer care representative. The product is now totaly different like stock Android and cheap like oppo, Vivo Xiaomi lossing his market. Quality also not upto the mark. It gives low performance even many times the miui stop the apps. Very very bad feeling to order this mobile.On second day of delivery it stuck on bootAnd keep restarting again & again.lastly i had to format it and i lost my data of year &year.Shamfull xiaomi. DONT BUY xiaomi phone with MIUI 12 it is worst than worst"
5,Redmi mobile is having features what we essential requitred.I m very happy with the new model.So far it's very nice and value for my.Wil review after couple of days usage.
4,Its value for money but if you are a selfie person than no pictures are ok but not too good I love everything about it
3,"Average performanceEdit (after 1 year usage): no issues in daily tasks,While playing pubg and some calls it freezes and swithes off."
5,Awesome product. Like it❤️ 12k under best phone.Dual stereo speakers.Good camBattery backup ❤️💯Build quality 💯Design 💯Best choice 👍
1,Front facing camera is too bad....
1,Front camera on video call is showung dark face. Screen goes white like hanging problem.Battery goes 20%to 80% automatically.Its camera performance is very low.You can choose other option in same price like vivo.
2,"Front camera is third class. Rear camera's quality  is average.  Battary like  4000 mah. Wi fi, Hotspot,  Bluetooth touch key does not work properly.  There are no auto call record option and notification receive indicating  led. Only sound quality is very good. No return policy only replacement, so I am hopeless."
4,"Primary usage Suitable for battery, videos watching, storage 128GB like songs backup listening music offline with speaker HiRes 2 speakers one in top and one at bottom, splash resistant.If ur requirement is secondary like Camera 48mp camera with Snapdragon 662.Not for heavy games.Then its suits me well. 5 star.No phone for these specs at this price point."
2,"After a month use....Phone is just ordinary.  No effects of the memory options are noticed.  In fact it takes roughly 2 minutes to get to the main screen after power on.  Preloaded with 13-15 gb of system files and bloatware.  So you get to use only 49 GB effective storage place.The phone is like paying for our dish TV, you will be forced to watch a lot of advertising apps.A lot of personal information may be used, your mi id will be linked to phone, email, ip address, location etc.Earlier I used Lenovo p2 nothing of this, and was a great phone.Having said all bad things, the phone is good for sound, visual, and battery.  Camera is the worst part.If you are buying for a camera then this one is a bad choice.  Battery 🔋 and the sound is great.Too many bloatware, I suppose Redmi should pay attention.  Or we all should avoid the phone and the brand.Repair would be easy as Redmi has many service centers around the country.  Except battery and music I don't see any difference or advantage over other phones for routine activities.Overall very average phone 📱 which is priced on higher side."
1,The product is not upto the mark.It gives low performance even many times the miui  stop the apps and camera quality is also poor.
3,The product is very disappointed in the camera segment. Front and back both camera is worst. It is not as 48 mp camera .Battery backup is well as 6000 mah.only vedio can play up to 13 hours after that phone is dead.if you bye for a big battery only then you can bye this product.all so processor is not as helio g85.
4,"I have ordered blazing blue colur but i have recived black colour instead of blue,But still it is a wonderful phone at reasonable cost.Battery backup is awesome and camera is amazing.I highly recommend to buy this phone from these seller"
5,Chief and best
5,Nice phone
4,"The pros of this smartphone are1. fhd+ display2. good battery life ( 2.5 days+ if only used for calling and light use,  1.5 days for overall usage like YouTube, watsapp, google meet, music, calling and gaming)3. 18w fast charge and 22.5w charger in box ( 19 - 96% in 2 hours)4. less bloatware5. ufs storage6. Stereo speakersAnd cons are1) average processor.2) average camera. (Steady photos are very good but low light needs improvement)3) MIUI 12 is little laggy.4) little heavy.5) Speakers are not that loud but works very well.So only buy if you want good viewing experience, battery life , fast charging and 22.5 w charger."
1,Front camera 3rd class.
3,Just got the phone in hand and the phone started lagging the next day.1- Performance average.2- Camera Average.3- Bit heavy and bulky too u can feel that.4- Design poor or should i say worse.5- MIUI is worst.
5,"Value For money, Sound quality is Superb, display clarity nice, overall worth for it."
1,Friends don't buy redmi 9 power smart phone.Don't waste your hard earned money to buy such disgusting phone.Performance very badBattery life very badFast charging not at allCamera quality v v poor.User friendly not at all.This is my genuine review after using it.My had wasted my money you all plz don't waste your money buying this phone.
1,"After using for 10 days My genuine review.1.Mobile always hanging.If you open camera it will hanging automatically.If you open 2 tabs,it will hanging.2. Cameras response time is too late.3. Front camera waste. It's shows you black only.4. Battery performance gud.My old Redmi note 4 is best to compare this Redmi 9 power.""My biggest mistake buying this redmi 9 power""We need a solution from mi and Amazon."
2,It's a MARKETING TRAP...IT CLAIMS to have all the best feature but they performance is below average... it's has all the features but no quality....Only Pros1.Good quality FHD screen2.Battery backup is okay.3. Speaker quality.Cons1. Below Avg camera.2. It HANGS3. NOT A SMOOTH TOUCH.4. TOUCH LAGS need to tap button multiple times one gets irritate.5 . One feels cheated because we have better option in the same price range.Worst use experience. I feel my older 3 GB ram redmi 8a is more smooth than this.My recommendation always give priority to a better Processor.
1,"Please don't buy this go for redmi note 9 pro.Camera is very bad .I seriously suggest not to manufacture redmi products in India ,all the made in India of redmi is worst ..."
1,"Full fake phone.. don't buy..u will waste ur money.. believe me...its fake , fake , fake , fake , fake."
4,"Network is a little bit down, is not so good. Battery is good. Camera is nice. Games is strong enough. Display is best quality."
5,"Greatest deal for Snapdragon 750 that too with Samsung. Buy blindly.There are many comments on display quality.But it doesn't matter that much , what we have to see in buying 5G phone is future proof.Buying 90hz display with cheap processor won't last you for year.This phone has one of the best 5G processor SD 750 which can last longer than others.There are few 5G mobiles Under 20 k which offers better display than this 1. Oppo A74: but in this the processor you get SD 480 , which is the basic version of 5G processor and below par than SD 750.2. Oppo a53s: which uses mediatek dimension 700 . Please don't compare media Tek Vs Snapdragon.Final verdict: You have to decide what you want. If you really looking for best 5G features under 20 k then blindly go for M42. Since no other company offers SD 750 processor for less than 20 k."
5,"Edit after a month of usage -1. Best in class battery - Full charge lasts over 2 days without fail2. Fast processor - I have more than 50 apps installed, but phone works without a glitch3. Camera - No one can beat Samsung in camera build and quality!Buy without a thought :)Got the phone delivered on same day of the sale/ launch. Super happy with whatever less I have used it till now. 😊"
1,Not.much excited compare to other all
2,"Please don't waste your money on this phone, I got attracted to the exchange offer as they are offering a higher discount. But looks like it's just a marketing trick.. they rejected the exchange offer at the time of delivery.. my phone had no scratches, no dents, no cracks, by citing some minor issues.. and I had to pay the balance amount to take the delivery.At this price point, there are many other phones/variants in the market with better features. The Display is not good at all with only HD+ whereas there are many phones in the market which are half the price with FHD+ feature. You can very well compare all the icons and graphics are pixilated.Moreover, only SIM1 is 5G, SIM2 is limited to 4G, no dedicated MicroSD slot.. its a hybrid sim slot."
5,"Got this for my mom. She loves it. The battery is amazing considering the fact that she uses the light mode while I use the dark mode. It comes with some junk but those can be uninstalled the phone is not heavy and the screen is amazing. I was skeptical about the hd display thing but the point is very few people can't differentiate between 1080 and 720 p. I definitely can't tell the difference.. The display is amazing. A freind told me that the charger is slow compared to other companies. The thing is my father's Samsung is still working fine and it's j5 prime , that's 5 years .. My stock Android had a 10 watt charger n 3000 mah n it works well, yes I play cod and all. Point it I feel that slower chargers preserve the battery decay better. Maybe it's just a feeling anyhow. I'm quite happy with the phone. The missing features on the camera will be fixed with a few updates as Samsung always does and in case it doesn't that's fine too . Phone is smooth and might heat on the first few charges but it will go away . It's quite light and slim and the best part is Samsung promises 3 year Android upgrades and four year security upgraded . The hd display with 750 gives great battery and smoothness . Amazon did an amazing job at delivery during this pandemic."
3,"I bought the phone after getting attracted to the banners only and here's what i found out after that:Pros - 5,000 mah Battery is Very good can go upto 2 days without charge, true 48 mp quad camera is upto the mark as expected from samsung, 750 g processor is excellent, 5G bands are supportive with more frequencies and lastly, Knox security plays a big role in making it better.Cons - Display is really bad only HD+ instead Samsung should have gone with FHD+ with this price and it has only 266 PPI which makes it even worse only thing good in display is that it is Super Amoled, In-box Charger is only 15W which is also dissapointing and aslo there wasn't any soft case inside the box or pre-applied screen protector."
1,No Pre-installed screen guard. No basic back cover. Short charging cable. Cheap packaging. Too much cost cutting. Disappointed.
1,Please don't buy this. Display graphics quality is very very bad and charger is also cheap quality
2,Positive..1. Design2. Built Quality Premium3. Snapdragon 7504. 5G5. Samsung PayNegative1. Always on Display not available (which is very common)2. Camera Quality not much impressive3. Very Common UI interfaceVerdict.Only buy for 5G other than not very much impressive.. it cost should bhi only 15k then justified.
5,Decent performance by Snapdragon 750GSuper Amoled 👌Camera 👌Battery life 👌Plastic back 👎Overall look 👌Fast charge 👎HD + display 👎 (but it not look like hd+)Overall rating 8/10
1,poor quality disply .resolution very low . totaly bad phone . never buy
5,Awesome PhoneAwesome CameraLong Lasting Battery Life5G SupportGood displayGo for it blindliy..HeadPhone Jack also providedAlso a good nonchinese phone for budget gamers😎⚡
1,"I used to zoom the screen share in MS Teams in Asus Max Pro M1  - which was quite crystal clear view . But i exchanged that phone with Samsung M42 and i regret now. If i zoom the MSTeams Screen share , everything is blur and not clear . Please regret from buying this product . Its waste of Money.Updated:I uploaded two videos of flickering issue in YouTube. Please watch and decide"
1,Pixelated display clearly visible.Poor resolution.Totally disappointed with the display quality. Not expected this from Samsung.Wost buy !
5,"I got this phone for my mother and she usually  uses her phone for long term ie 3-4 yrs. In that sense this phone is future proof been a 5g ready. Also it has very good processer(great performance), good camera n decent battery. Overall happy with the product which I bought at rs 18500!!!"
5,"About exchange: someone gave a review here on amazon that the exchange offer is a scam, no it's not, I got this device on the exchange offer only and things went smoothly.Look I know there are some cons that shouldn't have been and many reviewers have already listed it here and on various other platforms, but this is a mobile and it's working and it's good. The feel and look are amazing and it's not at all heavy, it's compatible with good gaming performance. Since it is a plastic body so while charging it might heat initially but as it reaches 100% it gradually cools down, and once charged it lasts a whole day even with video calls or gaming/ When you visit the settings section there are various amazing features, themes are super cool. Overall a good buy and many have written such negative reviews according to their perspective, due to which others will think the mobile is a total piece of crap when it's not, and trust me it's a good one and you can ask me questions if you have any doubts."
1,"Pros.1) Samsung Pay ( Which they are accepting only few bank card's).Cons.1) Worst Display Quality ( Even App Icons text also Blurred)2) Taking 2 hour's 30 minutes for full charge.3) If you use mobile for normal browsing and basic use of WhatsApp battery was coming to 52% percent in 1 hour.4) Very Short Charging cable was Given.5) I have 100 mbps internet connection but this mobile hardly Taking 20 MBPS, I tested with myself old mobile it is Taking 50 MBPS.6) THOSE WHOSE PLAY PUBG THIS MOBILE IS HELL FOR THEM WORST GAMING EXPERIENCE, HANGS A LOT. (THIS ones has 6gb ram but it actually performs likes 3 ram mobile).7) finger print sensor was very slow,  FACE RECOGNITION IS DUMB.8) ABOUT CAMERA ( After facing all this I didn't check that as if I check it will definitely fail to impress).9) When I saw the mobile design after opening the box , It remembers you the Chinese mobiles design which was in 2015 with back door open to change the battery."
2,"Phone is a decent one, it has average camera and its display is relatively good for 720P since it's a s.amoled. I have noticed whenever I try to open the folder on the extreme end by any thumb, the touch doesn't get sensed, instead I have to press directly on the folder icon by the other thumb, I don't know what's the reason behind this. Apart from this software is good, but I hate the way bloatwares are been added and there is no option to uninstall Netflix or some apps. Even to torcher the user, there is automatic download of mojo app and some useless apps, hence u have to stop the auto install and other app features on galaxy store. The most concerned thing is we don't have always display on feature and the carrier aggregation. Unfortunately even the Samsung helpdesk doesn't know that this feature is not available in this phone. There are many minor issues which samsung has to fix with updates if they decide to do it.  To the given price I personally had expected better from samsung, but it's just ok. If they update the software patch it would be a good phone."
1,Camera not good
5,Using m42 5g for 2 days now and here is my review i like the battery backup it's very awesome and while buying this phone i was bit worried about it's 720p display but it's not even noticable in day to day life use so u can buy this I bought m42 5g for my father and he is so satisfied and i have use so many smartphone till the date and i got the best battery backup on this one fingerprint is like ok ok not so fast not so slow it's average and for any questions u can ask from me 😊
2,"Display quality is very vary poor for this segment of phone, otherwise I would have given it five star."
5,"Pretty Decent for daily usage. Remember the Brand Name Samsung - Don't go with the review. Snapdragon works well. Features like Samsung Pay, Knox Security and big display looks awesome 👌.  Just go ahead 😀👍👌👏"
3,Looks and colour is stylish talking about camera and battery is not at good quality
1,Am upset of weak resolution display of this mobile... it's not up to the mark ... images is also average
4,"I made right choice eventhough initially was skeptical.Though it is not a superman but an reliable  all rounder.  Before this moto g5 s plus was my all rounder.  I am not a gamer a normal user.What I liked most:1. Battery. Refer my battery observations below.2. Lag free response.3. Decent camera, though colors are over done.4. Wifi Calling is working great with Airtel sim.5. No call drop or interruptions as I faced with moto  since at my home the mobile signal strength is low.What I didn't  like1. Too big for my convenience, cannot keep in jeans pocket and in shirt pocket will be protruding.2. Samsung Apps and other default apps which cannot be Uninstalled.3. Some missing features : Poor Keypad heptics, Alarm  cannot be repeated for certain dates, etc 4.  Ring tone and alarm volume is low. if there is any other noise difficult to hear.Battery:Charging time nearly 2 hrs  when phone is switched off.1st recharge 100%:At end of 48 hrs 5% remaing.Light usage only -  20 minutes of mobile call. 1 hr You tube video, 1 hr Watsapp video, installing 10 apps, some small and wats app message sending and reading. Throught 2 sims , Bluetooth, location and wifi all where active.2nd recharge 100%:At end of 56hrs 5% remain. Usage is almost 75% compared to 1st recharge."
4,"Have been using the phone for 3 days and the only drawback is the display of the phone. If you don't mind the display, then it is a very good phone that is also future ready. The cameras are also decent. The looks of the phone are amazing. You can go for it if you don't watch YouTube or stream videos on your phone."
1,"I have purchased this model 1 day back, but I was facing performance issue on network connectivity. And my sim2 is not working in this device. With 4GB Ram what ever apps are running the same apps are not able to work with 8GB Ram. It is the defective piece.And the support is also worst where they are not able to give the refund of the amount. They are suggesting to use the same model again with the defects. They don't require any customer satisfaction."
3,"The phone was bought for using in online classes. The voice quality was poor. My students were unable to hear me with a distance of 2 feet from the device. Replaced it once, but the replacement aslo had the same issue."
5,"One day delivery by Amazon as committed..About phone- posting review after 2days of use- not very heavy, good features, battery life is good more than 1day, fast processing, superb camera"
5,Battery  for normal use  almost 2daysBoth Camera is very goodDisplay could have  FHD+ but OKNo heating issueAndroid 11  don't see big change from  Android 9Ear speaker voice vibrates in phone body5G not in service as of now...Overall Good as on 5 days review...
5,"M42 5G 8gb/128gb is a wonderful phone  and true to its specifications. In the few days I have used it I have found it very convenient to use. No heating issue, no lag in flipping through the pages, opening of Apps etc. Response to commands is fast. On screen finger sensor works good as it responds fast enough. Hopefully the 5G functions would also work to our satisfaction. It is a very good buy at its price and it is made in India."
1,This particular model has a faulty microphone that you can notice while video calling and if you ask your 5 year old child to speak on the microphone the other side will hardly be able to hear anything. I exchanged my first phone and still had the issue you with the second phone so it is very very clear that this is the issue with the model itself ...to anyone who has purchased this particular phone I challenge them please bring your kid on a whatsapp call and ask the other other person on other side to listen and identify what the child is saying ..I bet they will not be able to to hear anything at all so good luck to all the people who have purchased this defective model. . This is not expected from a brand leader like Samsung
5,Good mobile handset with nice look
5,"Today Dt.06May2021, I have received it with awesome packaging by Amazon.Battery : For full charge (0% to 100%) it takes 2 hours 15 minutes as expected (15w charger not Bad).Display : Awesome display even it's Super AMOLED, HD+ resolution with 720 x 1600 pixels resolution.Camera : Very good.Software : One UI 3.1, Android 11Mobile Appearance : Excellent especially backside it looks amazing glossy finish.After usage couple of weeks,  its really great in terms of performance,  battery of this mobile. Very much appreciated below 20K price. One can buy without second thought."
5,Got this 8GB 5G phone at an unbelievable price. Here are my observationsPro's:-1. Big Larger Display2. On screen finger print sensor3. Expecting better battery performanceCons:-1. Though ordered a black phone received a white charger2. Either 2 SIM or 1 SIM + 1 SDSlot3. Could have provided a rubber silicon case
1,"I am facing problem while calling someone, the call gets connect but their is no audio from my side means the other person doesn't hear my voice .please  provide me the solution or replace it"
5,Battery back up is good last atleast 3 days with normal usuage.Camera is decent. Overall happy with the buy.
3,"Perfect things about the phone are weight is manageable, phone is slim, attractive look, camera is fine,The only and most important thing is the disappointing display quality (hd+). Expect much much better amoled HDR display at ₹21000.You can literally see the pixels with naked eyes.Second worst thing is you cannot return the product."
5,"Great productPros:1)excellent processor. ( can feel the change. My previous phone was samsung A5 2016.)2) Excellent battery backup. (Till date. Run 1day with all sensors)3) can't realize the 720 pixel display4) camera as usual maintains its quality.5) obviously 5G (don't know, waiting only)6)My favorite Secret folderCons1) To charge the phone it takes 2h normally. (major issue)2) absence of punch hole front camera3) expecting 64 or 108 MP primary camera4) After knowing 720 p display it may disturb you.5) I personally love side fingerprint reader.6)Samsung Please provide Headphone (no headphone, No cover)"
5,Excellent smartphone with 5g connection.... Especially samsung provides this.... It is really proper smartphone as it has SD750g processors.... It has one of the interesting features which is knox security special private protection.1. Build quality - super2. Display - hd+ sAMOLED3. Connection - 5g network especially4. Security - knox5. Camera- 48+8+5+5/20mp selfi6. Finally in display fingerprint....I love all the above features. I have become fan of Samsung m42.... Love it...

Cannot access a auto call record. Iam  fully satisfied with this modle but only on recording option im disappointed."
5,"Got this phone at a reasonable price with 8 GB RAM. Purchased last month, battery life is good as well. Would recommend it."
5,It's a good phone. Well packed and working perfectly. Camera quality is good. Earphones are included with this phone. It takes little time to charge but battery life is equally good for me. Back cover is included so no need to buy extra. Complete required accessories are provided that's really good part. My last phone was also  Vivo (v1718) and it's been more than 4 years and still that phone is working very well. I expect same durability from this phone as well.
3,All function its ok but finger print is not proper working..And its already returnable device from first customer..
4,"It seems the handset is previously Used by somebody because already the others person routine chart is mentioned there, limit of the phone already set by prious user, there is song video uploaded there ,the date of upload seems to be March on there. And for a second its 17990₹ too much."

When automatic call recording is enabled the voice is breaking intermittantly. so i disabled that feature. may be i can test it again and update the comments whether its because of memory card capacity/free space or some other issue."

5,"Happy to write 1st 100% Satisfied product review regarding Tecno Spark 7 Pro (Magnet Black 6GB RAM 64GB Storage smart phone). Liked Unique features like Kids Mode, Special functions, FREE from Harrassment filter for Spam calls and SMS, chip-assisted protection, Display Eye care setting, Truely worth of price satisfied with its features. Competes well with other top branded phones."
5,"Been using it for a few days and specs really hold up. I had just bought this as it was good value for money phone I could find with 4GB+64GB. But after using it, I realized the other features like the display, battery backup and camera are all great. Screen is highlight!"
5,"I was slightly skeptical about buying Tecno but after seeing my friends use it, I went ahead. After using it for a few days I realized why Tecno is so popular. I was never into clicking pictures, but after seeing the camera in this phone, I have begun trying my hand at photography. I feel the phone does the job more than I do. Best camera ever."
5,"I loved the camera on this phone. You can check from the pictures in my review that how amazing pictures you are able to click. This phone has a whooping 89.5% of screen to body ratio. I'm a huge gaming buff and watch a lot of movies and series. The big screen is such a delight to watch on. Also, the 180hz processor makes gaming smooth. Overall, I love this phone."
5,"I bought the phone after a lot of research,as i wanted a value for money all rounder and boy there are so many options...This one has it allLOOKS -9/10 -Looks stylish,suave,upmarket and yet simple.CAMERA- 9.5/10 - Fantastic camera at this price , both pictures and videos are amazing with great ai featuresBattery,Display - 9/10Go for it if you want a vfm all rounderCONS-1.Not really a con but it has single front flash whereas the specs mentions dual front flash,so though usage wise it's not at all an issue but you expect better communication.OVERALL-9.5/10 -- GO FOR IT!!!"
1,"Not dual front flash,Only single flash"
4,"Amazing finishing, great speed worth for money."
5,The phone works well without any performance issues like time lags or apps hanging midway. The screen resolution is excellent and gives a crisp viewing experience with bright colours and good clarity. The camera has an excellent resolution and is able to take equally vivid photographs during day and night-time. I would absolutely recommend this phone to anyone who’s looking for a seamless experience at value-for- money prices.
5,"After a month use:Happy With:-Battery Life: one time charge for more than 1 Day- camera quality: 100% satisfied with the photos with good detail- Screen good for watching movies netflix, watched all episodes of Family Man 2 on this phone. Brightness and good color- so many colorful theme options"
5,"This phone is super cool, and I think 'xiaomi' , 'oppo' or 'vivo' like brands will not provide such a phone for even 16K bucks.Its a super gaming smartphone. The battery life is awesome. The phone doesn't heat even if you play games for 6 hours (I'd tried playing about 4 hours myself, and the result surprised me) . Even all the features are of superior quality. The camera is like samsung galaxy worth 45K bucks. There is such a huge amount of features I can't even state here. Suggesting everyone to buy. 😇😇😇😄😄"
5,"I was the first person to buy a Tecno in my family. And once, others saw the performance, this is the third Tecno phone. And as usual, Spark 7 pro also hit the bull's eye in terms of value for money. The camera works amazingly video calls and even for clicking pictures in the night. Best buy ever!"
4,Nice mobile to use that. Back camara excellent. Front cam not bad. Need to improve some settings. In Mobile hotspot settings not able to manage connections.Have a good battery. But slow charging.
5,"I urgently needed a phone and I bought this phone after being recommended by a friend. It seems to have everything in it. Amazing AI camera, long battery, great display etc. Moreover, it's Andriod 11. What more can I ask for? Check the pictures I posted. The camera captures great light and has sharpness. I am a happy Tecno customer."
1,Please if you found delivery by appario private limited... Please don't buy... I got 2nd hand mobile and returned. Mobile is okay okay... But I will recommend to you go with redmi not 9... Looks great... This techno looks like dagar.....youtube videos not looks good.
5,"I love the specs. I had just bought this as it was cheapest phone I could find with 4GB+64GB. But after I recieved it, I realized the other features like the display, battery back and camera are all amazing. This phone is clearly the best phone for 10k."
4,Good Mobile Phone
5,"Hello Friends,I giving first time feedback and 5* to this mobile phone for overall performance and value for 💸 with best features."

5,I wanted a gaming phone and all the other options were very expensive. I went for this and I think I have had the smoothest gaming experience ever. I face no issues like heating up and lagging. It feels like any game on this is a cakewalk. The battery also supports several hours of gaming.
5,Budget
4,This  product is so good
3,"Overall design, finishing are fine,  but camera quality as per mega pixels given is too poor."
4,"Overall build and the finish is very nice , camera is good for a 10k smartphone , os is all Google based which isn't very great , useable storage is 17gb and rear camera can't focus on things quickly enough"
5,Very good phone battery and display lovely thank you Amazon
5,Could have been better if the finger print reader placed on screen or else back of the mobile. Because I use a mobile pouch its really uncomfortable to unlock using finger print. Other than that mobile is too good.
4,If you're looking a phone for normal usage then go for this model.*I bought 3/32 so it's for light gaming only*The design is so good and it's bigger than normal 10K phones*Fingerprint reader on power button is quicker compared to back mounted reader*Camera quality is OK*Battery backup is excellent*Charging takes time with provided power brick
2,It was no cost EMI...andI've been charged for 118/- emi process...Phone is quite good but I don't recommend...First ring.. doesn't goAfter second time... it's ringing...I don't know what's the problem...I bought this for my cousin...so don't know much..but he was facing this kind of issue..May be more...
5,"Slim n long piece, good battery life, fast accessible, fast charging, nice camera. But finger accessible is not ease of access"
5,All above

2,Hey guys the product quantity is good but the camera is not good . Pictures come blur . Rest everything is good.

4,"This review's to all those who were eagerly waiting for the phone to launch and get hands on, but before all it's always hard to get the ""DEMO"" at the earliest so.. ""IMAGES"" above are to those who can't find demos much often/needed color/to avoid contacts at stores during Covid.Pros - Leather back warmth feelCons - Back Camera's not upto the mark when compared to the phones in market and of this price range, though it has given a sleek and leather finish with minimized thickness. . It's pro fades out its Con so can go for it blindly but only if you think ""CAMERA'S"" not your ""PRIORITY""Features I thought would be there was 9.1 surround music/Dolby Atmos but it comes with:Real Sound Technology, just have a look into it if you're specific2. Super Amoled+ Display.Hassle free(Inside the box):Tempered glass comes on the phone itself so no extra work on fixing, which might sometimes go wrong.2. Silicon back case (if you're looking for touch and feel of leather back, better not use.. but use a side bumper if available for protection) Do also post where we can find side bumper, cos it's hard finding for new phones.. Thanks!Looking for a Standout design in 15-20k range? Then, ""GO FOR IT"" that's Value for money!"
4,"Hi, I am writing this review after 3 days of usage1. Firstly thanks to Amazon. Got delivered at a lightning speed. Ordered ok Saturday. Launch date was on 21st September and got delivered the same day at morning.2. Now about Oppo 17, this is very light weight, speed is good, I ordered dynamic orange. Trust me, this is the best and attractive colour I found ।l, blue is a good option too if you don't like a funky coloir।3. Camera I did not found upto the mark . Night mode is not that great but yes if you are a selfie person, go for it. I was using Ralme Xt earlier and it's camera was much better. But ok I will manage . I am a part time photographer and often I use my phone to click pics. Realme supported me a lot. Let's see how much Oppo supports.4. Speed is good. 6 GB 128 GB. Good combo. No lagging till now. Going smooth.5. Touch is awesome. Phone gets unlocks quickly. No lagging here too .Rest I will use for some more days and come back with my reviews again."
5,"i like the camera quality, images and videos are sharp and clear. there is a wee bit of noise in low light areas but it can be overlooked.it looks quite a bit like the iphone X but is largerdisplay is on par with iphone xmusic sounded as good as iphone xi could just unbox and get on with it as oppo provided the tempered glass, back cover as well. which was a pleasant surprise as I was not expecting. 😄Also the design, finger print sensor on display, face recognition .... lot of features.dual 4G standy by with an SD card is a blessing and I was looking for exactly what this phone offered at the right price and also the back cover made  of leather is so freaking rich and classy.quite happy with what I got. This is probably the fastest decision I have ever taken around buying a phone and I am hoping this will last long, like most of my other phones."
5,1st Buyer  of OPPO F17Awssm back leather and fantastic phone camera is very excellent
1,There is no inbuilt call recording&there is not inbuilt call block application without this why should we purchase oppo।very bad experience with oppo now with this purchase
4,So it's been three days since I'm using this phone and I'm completely in love with it at the price I got.1. Weight of the Phone is very less when compared to any phone in this segment and this matters a lot to me while carrying or casual music listening or any stuff.2. Back leather type wrapper is really good and gives a premium feel.3. UI is also good in terms of usage and mobile handling and compatibility4. Camera is decent for video calls/ normal phots not that great especially for shotting long-distance objects/ sceneries. But this doesn't matter to me a lot. Come on use a professional camera if you want photography at peaks.5. Design is excellent and it is the slimmest phone at 7.43mm6. Build Material quality is good.7. Sound is good but not that great for melodies or any songs please use earphones/headphones.8. Display is really good and it's out of my expectation as I'm using Samsung AMOLED previously.9. Processor is fast for general purpose and played COD and some other games at medium graphics didn't observe any lag.10. Battery is okay and keeps you charged up for one day (General usage with low- medium gaming)11. Software is fast and no clutter apps or extra apps.Overall I would definitely recommend if someone wants a nice phone for general usage which looks classy.
5,"It's a nice phone overall ,I can see so many negative reviews.ProsLightweight ,fast charging , comes with screen protector and good headphonesColor OS is nice with update for color OS in the pipeline .Good battery backup and Samoled screen with 408 ppiCamera performance can be improved by installing Gcam modConsIt's a bit over priced but again given its aesthetics I would not mind the extra costOlder processor ,but still snappy thanks to the 6gb /8gb RamI had gifted the one for my mom and she absolutely loves this phone ,yes it resembles I phone x a bit ."
1,Hi I got this phone 24 sept morning .phone is good and light weight so I love and purchased this.but this phone big point is it's not played videos like 4k videos and hd plus videos properly I can't understand this is which type of mistake is.oppo brand must solve this soon as soon possible. I also talk to Amazon customer care unit they arrange technical assistance he come 29sept  . Then let's see what type of problem is . I use before realms xt Samsung m21 and 31 they are best one chooses this for only of light weight and design ... Totally at that point disappointed ...hope to solve this problem ..........
2,"It's not worth for this amount after Unboxing and using it for a moment I feels like that, because I am using oppo mobiles more than 3 yearsBut this product is okay by weightless,fast charging  but not okay with with cameras,finger print accessibility, battery performances,And processor is snap dragon 662 nothing more specific things .So oppo have to launch little bit better quality product for this amountDynamic orange 🍊,first you realise the colour of orange and this phones colourDon't try to give fake colour or spread fake informationsSo I don't suggest to buy this product to anyone"
4,It is nice phone but it is little bit higher cost than expected in these segments
1,Quite disappointed with this handset. Although features are similar to other oppo series. The call recording option is horrible. Also the recoded mgs doesn't get stored in the device.
3,"Nice phone. Finger print sensor sometimes doesn't respond when display is off. After keeping and removing the finger, it sensor light flows after 5 seconds and then fails to unlock.First thought it's an issue with my phone. Later saw one another reviewer mentioning the same here. Looks to be an issue that they can fix with software update.OK device."
1,very bad product...camera quality not well it only saying for megapixel but giving low quality images...fingerprint sensors not working as good and also when taking videos its lagging
1,"it is the worst phone.bad soundvery slow finger print sensor,  laggingworst cameras .design is good, back cover is good , display is also very good."
3,"updated review: dont go with this phone if you need to take some good quality photos!! below average camera quality!!original review: its a bit overpriced!!bought this mobile because i got it for 15k after  offers.overall a good phone with AVERAGE cameras, good AMOLED display and is handy.but i would not suggest this for 18k"
5,"just got the phone delivered today, amazing quick service by Amazon, i am using the phone since morning and did not find any lagging issue and down play, the phone is simply super and the design is one style statement. this phone is on edge for value for money.I would like to rate 5 star."
1,"Very Bad performance, back camera is not good, picture quality is average, Hanging problem, automatic call recording features is not available, phone clock is slow, speakers sounds is not up to marks."
2,I'm writing about this review after using phone one month earpiece was defective since bigning for that I sent replacement request but turned down and through balancancc app certified that product is ok Now finger print censor not working properly and Everytime using pin to open.some defect also in Sim slot because my customer complain that your contact being  done don't buy anything from Amazon because their return and replacement policy is fraudulent that I experienced in purchase of this mobile
5,"Excellent phone, however price is on higher side as the processor doesn't matches the competitors devices. Device is sleek and stylish"
1,Over all this phone is just waste of money. Front camera results are not good. Also it's having issue in network while travelling. Earphone not working properly. Battery is not enough as described in ad. Look wise it is okay. But if you go for any other brand in this price you can get more.
5,"Best phone only price high but in offer with rs1500 back as amazon pay balence  and bank offer rs1500 back .It cost me rs 15000 ,in this segmant its best only some time while phone screen lock finger print not activate but after software update it will definetly fix😍"
4,"The phone received having a Mic issue and got replacement within 12 Hrs, But the second phone also have Mic issue, other side persons cannot hear proper voice. Headset also have issues for voice calls.Average CameraHaving Long Battery lifeBest value for money phoneFor games it is best"
1,Battery backup is very low.if mob charge 100% then we can use only for max 2 hours it it totally waste of money. Camera quality is good but battery storage is very very low ..don't buy
4,"Oppo F17 is certainly one of the best smartphone, but for those who love to have it domestically. The old age processor is the only shortcomings of this phone,but that is not causing any problems for its day to day operations. I love to have this sleek designed pretty."
3,Though RAM is high but very slow display and operation. Camera quality is also not up  to the mark as per specification . Battery life is ok. Price should be within 15k as per performance I am getting. So Not recommended.
5,I really liked product. The phone came with good quality packaging. Phone is also good. I loved camera quality and speed functioning of phone.
1,I have removed stars from 4 to 1 after using from 2 and half months. The phone is pathetic except for looks. It hangs alot.
3,"Well in terms of looks this is one of the best phones how ever there is a major issue with this phone it does not unlock easily there is a lag ,at times neither finger print sensor nor face unlock sensor respond , all though many user have mentioned about this problem still there is no update from oppo, just an average camera at this price was not expected...Price for oppo f17 should have been under 12k....."
2,Sim tray looks like used and old. Rear Camera quality is not up to the mark. Only back side design looking good. Front camera quality is OK OK.Phone runs  at normal speed.Battery charging speed also good.We have to buy fonts from themes store if we need to change.
1,"I had previously used Oppo f7 for almost 3 years and I had no complains whatsoever. That was the reason I trusted Oppo f17 but I was proved wrong. The touchscreen causes issues, battery life is disgusting. The only good thing about it is the vooc changing and nothing else"
1,"Hi I got this on September 24th, I'm not satisfied because  camera quality is not as expected, some time finger print sensor won't work unless I press power button and also I observed some hanging issue. I don't recommend this product purchase.Adding comments after 6 months.Lot of hanging issue. When I checked with service center they told that it is updated with trial version. No camera clarity, hanging issue. Totally worthless. Really disappointed. Feel like it is second hand mobile."
1,The phone started lagging since we bought it. We thought let's use it  for couple of days and check. But it started working slow and lags continuously even while performing simple actions like opening call logs for making a phone. So just think how much it will lag to play games and other heavy apps. Please do no purchase this phone at all.. waste of money.  Zero stars for this phone. Also there is no refund option available for this phone so I'm stuck with this phone now which hangs and lags continuously.
1,"Don't buy,touch not working properly.finger print not working properly"
4,"Mobile is good specially it's slimness light weight looks stylish, camera is average, but performance is normal than other a basic phone under 10 KI only deslike that Internet performance it's very slow I used multiple sim but it runs slow.as other basic oppo phone has good Internet speed."
3,"I don't know what is wrong with OPPO team, since last 2 years and 3 months I was using OPPO F9, what a great phone it was, so that only I moved up to wards F series and purchased OPPO F17, but I found it is little lowere side than OPPP F9, actually F17 must be far better than F9, but F17 is not at that level at all, in today's time mobile phone is much essential product, but F17 is very simple performance phone. If you wanted to have high performance phone than don't go this F17. Finger print sensor is not good."
1,"I was provided with a faulty mobile with both the speakers are not working (opined by your technician). The item has been replaced and again I received defective mobile with same problem. It clearly indicates that no QC has been done or intentionally defective.item has been supplied to me. Moreover, I have wasted hours of my valuable time in speaking with amazon customer care. I will think twice before purchasing a phone from Amazon and I will share my view with my friends."
1,"I have used this phone since from 4 days.I am not happy with it.Oppo which know as a good camera phone its deliberately wrong.This Oppo f17 phone had very bad camera quality.Which doesn't have basic feature of beightness,contrast and saturation.Number of cameras are 4 but none of them satisfies the quality as expected.When you click picture of some thing like furniture's it good but while taking selfie it takes really bad.Selfie is bad in manner before you clicking the streaming looks ok ok but when actually click the selfie it looks extremely bad.Plz don't waste money if you are a selfie lover,I am Redmi user which have very less price as that of Oppo still quality of Redmi is much better than this Opp f17.Wasted money 😒"
3,"The phone is nice , light weight, thin, classy, but camera is not value for money, even 10k phones gives 48mp.But meets my requirement ."
3,"Feature wise for this price segment, F17 is not a brilliant option, but if u r looking for a classy look instead of performance, it will b a good choice"
4,"The phone offers a decent package for the cost. Fast charging works amazing. Camera quality is decent for amateur use. Yes don't expect DSLR like images . The phone is slim and light weight to carry. Aesthetically the phone is quite stylish.Screen resolution is good .On the downside even with 6 GB RAM , the performance feels sluggish. There is visible lag while scrolling , or switching between apps. For those having high media usage , the phone is definitely a disappointment.  However if you intend to have a decent phone in a budget then go for it ."
3,Mobile Phone is good but mobile charger is neither same company nor so powerful.
5,"The phone is not even turning on. I purchased it barely 5 days ago. The battery is charged indeed. Tried to contact customer service who I find is brainless as usual. They want me to install the smartchk app. If I could install the smartchk app, then I don't need to return it or would not even contact them..... I googled for help, and held the volume up and power button down for 8 seconds; it powered up"
5,Good product

2,"it's a budget phone. I bought it because seller described it on amazon  as micro + micro sim; unfortunately it's not so. one slot is hybrid which can be used only for sd card. it's made in china handset. in built apps also seldom works for e.g. weather, true caller etc. In short, do not go for this one"
1,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.So my ₹1499 are wasted now..."
2,"[BIG UPDATE] IT BROKE ALONG THE RIGHT HINGE, I WAS WEARING IT NORMALLY AND IT SPLIT OPEN ON ONE SIDE.The extenders are weak. ( Pic inscuded) My boat 400s broke at the centre too. They need to concentrate less on celebrity endorsements and use the profits on materials and quality control. They still worked so I taped it up with a metal sheet. Still will give 2 stars for the sound.[ORIGINAL REVIEW]I've owned boat products such as the Rockerz 400 and some of their earphones and this is the best experience I've had with the product.Review after 1 day of use and will updatePrice I paid 1800Pros:1. Packaging is good for the first time2. The build and finish is on par with headphones costing 3 times as much.3. Range is next level, didn't experience any loss of connection in my entire house with the phone kept in one position.4. Boat headphones have always been super uncomfortable but this time they have actually thought of that.5. The cups are big and soft enough to fit your ears inside so they are over the ear.6. Base is not amazing, let's just say it's above average, the sound is like a 20 % improvement on the Rockerz 400.7. They have gone for a organic approach for the sound so the highs and lows are just ok .9. Battery life is just as advertised8. You literally can't find a better pair of headphones for less than 3k  for sure.Cons1. I was not sure about how they actually look when I ordered cos the image of the product kept changing, it had flat cups and then doughnut type cups.2. It's not as loud as I want it to be3. They didn't include a aux Cable which is crazy as they ship those with all other models.4. It does get warm in these and you will sweat5. No noise cancelling as they mentioned and passive design is not that good"
5,"This is a premium quality product from boAt-Lifestyle. It's professional grade 40 mm drivers truly deliver you to a music nirvana with a professional fine finish. The amazing battery life and the reduced charge time makes it a marathon runner. The ear cushion provides a comfy experience. The sound quality is fabulous and does not give a pain in the ear. It also is easy to carry around as it folds inwards, it also fold towards the sides which makes it extremely easy and safe to keep on a table. All over it is an awesome product."
1,"The boAt Rockerz line is boAt's super cheap lineup for budget buyers. This will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. It might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is  not something I'd ever recommend buying for your own use.1. Sound Quality - awful. Honestly, the boAt Rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. It isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. Most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. On or off, you can and will hear the outside world. Those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. The soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.2. Comfort - Horrendous. The boAt Rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. The audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. The good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. After removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. The cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. The frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.3. Build Quality - In a word - bad. See a pattern here? The headphones reflect their low price point, and are  entirely made of cheap plastic. The plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. It's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. If you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. Finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. You'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. It's really gross.5. Mic - Absolutely trash tier. You won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. I honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. Callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your PC for voice chat or conference calls. Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. It's really not worth using.4. Final words - Just, don't. Spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. The headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. Save  up some money, work at McDonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. Anything, but not these ones. The only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?1 Build"
5,"These are super comfortable and premium looking headphones. Beautifully designed with very good matt finishing.Sound quality is top notch, good for pop songs. Bass is good enough to provide a decent effect.Ratings - 4.5/5Sound quality: 9.5/10Durability: 9.5/10Bass: 9/10Material quality: 10/10Look and feel: 10/10Bluetooth: 10/10Noise cancellation: 8.5/10Battery: 10/10Cons -Aux cable not provided with the headphones, so can't tell the difference with wires."
1,Never have I seen as fragile headphone as this one. I have been delivered a product with manufacturing defect or it already damaged. The bud from the right side fell off as soon as I unpacked the headphones. Boat rockerz has not been upto my expectation. Think before buying.
5,Material is very poor quality but service also very good. Product replace after 10 month even broken. Now condition is new..👍
1,"Poor build quality. One side of the headphone broke down with normal usage within one month of operation. Never expected such a poor quality from boat. To make matters worse, in entire Hyderabad they have only one service centre which is far away at 15 Kms from the city"
3,"At 1999 they are decent.Pros1. Light weight because made of plastic2. Battery super cool @ 70 hrs3. I am happy at 40% volume, so they are super loud.4. They have thumping base5. Call quality is good for this price.6 connect easily and the Bluetooth range is excellent. I have tried them keeping my iphone in another room and roaming around the home. No distortion or disconnection.7. They fold so are easy to carryCons:1. Plasticky so can break any time2. Vocals are not clear and are dull. If they had crisp vocals, these would have been the best in the industry.3. They would need time to open up. For my ears they feel stiff and tend to heat after 2-3 hrs of continuous usage. Ears pain after this much usage.4. No case or pouch but was not expecting eaither at this price.Over all a decent product in the price range and can keep it as a spare headphone in my bag if i forget my primary headphones (Marshall Monitor BT) knowing they will always have some charge ( 70 hrs battery at 60% volume)"
3,"I bought this 3 months back and it's broken now as it was all plastic and not much flexible. The product says we have 1-year warranty but physical damage isn'tincluded. Bad experience. I have fixed it with fevi quick as a temporary solution, but I don't know how much time it would work.😢"
1,"It has got broken, very bad quality cheap product"
2,The body is plastic even the piece that is exposed upon extension. So its highly likely  to break! Mine broke and yours might be soon as well. So I'll definitely not gonna recommend this. If you already have them then Good Luck!
5,"⚫ SOUND QUALITY - Sound quality is amazing for this price and Virtualization is good .⚫ BASS - Average bass not so good or bad, it lies in the middle .⚫ COMFORT - Not so comfortable , but it is better than boat rockerz 400 , The ear cups are bigger than boat rockerz 400 .⚫ CONNECTIVITY -  Connecting faster to devices . Range is very good , i didn't face any connectivity loss upto 10m and also it has dual pairing feature . There is an audio latency when playing games and No audio latency when watching videos .⚫ CONTROLS - It is very easy to control and They have kept multifunctional or integrated controls ( Refer to the booklet provided inside the box ) .⚫ MICROPHONE - Mic is good, Not as bad as boat rockerz 400 .⚫ NOISE CANCELLATION - They have used passive noice cancellation , It doesn't not seems to reduce any outside unwanted  ambient noises.⚫ BATTERY - Standby time is amazing as mentioned by the Boat , Charging time takes upto 2 hrs 30 mins .⚫ BUILD QUALITY AND MATERIAL - They have used good plastic material but the slider for adjusting the size of the headphones is not good , the wire gets popped out when sliding . Pls be careful when sliding . The ear cups and headband cushion is soft and sweat proof , the water gets easily evaporated.⚫ DESIGN - It features an on-ear design and the ear cups are bigger than boat rockerz 400 . It is light-weight but not a sturdy design , which is not intended for jogging or running purposes . For gym it can be used to do strength or weight training or weight lifiting workouts not for aerobic or cardio workouts . The folding design is amazing for the safety of the headphones , it can be easily folded which is easy to place on the flat surfaces .⚫ LOOK - Premium look with matte black finish , looks sexy when wearing the headphones . ◼️ VERDICT : Waited for a long time to get a good wireless heaphone with premium look and design. You will never get a premium look headphone with hd sound & nice battery backup at this price segment , Overall a great value for money ."
5,"I am using Sony Headphones for over 2 years now, which were sufficiently good for me. They got damaged somehow, and new sony wireless  headphones costed a whole lot than this headphone so I would've had to buy the wired ones, so went for boat. So I'll be comparing these with Sony wired headphones in the same price range (<2000) (believe me, I've used all variants/models)Pros:1. The look: The Black ones that I bought look sick. Fallen in love. If you're a black lover like me, go for boat rockerz 450 instead of 510!🖤2. Bluetooth: it works crisp. I get range in my whole room and even when I keep the phone in my room and go into another room. Excellent.3. Price: I got them at ₹1199 at Republic Day sale 2020. Worth it.4. Aux cable: They provided me the aux cable. Everybody has confusion whether they'll provide or not, but they did to me.5. Sound Quality : Decent. Nice bass. If you have been using earphones, you'll love these headphones.6. Noise cancellation: My Sony ones didn't have noise cancellation but these do, and it's awesome.Cons:1. I've been using Sony and the sound quality of Sony is better than this.2. Bass of the sony headphones was way better than these. Believe me these are not at all bad(you'll love them) but if you are coming from Sony or JBL, you'll get a bit disappointed.3. Latency: If you want to play games with this headphones, you will have to use the AUX cable to do that. Can't play games wireless ly, because the game sound will lag too much, making them unpalatable. I tried PUBG, free fire, call of duty, etc. Nearly all of them. But I'm fine with it really, because when you play games on your phone your phone is in your hand anyway, so use the damn aux cable.Conclusion: I was getting JBL ones for ₹1999 but didn't go for them because they didn't have aux support. Sony wireless headphones do have it, but they cost a lot more (4000 atleast) so couldn't buy them as well.If you are ok with spending ₹4000 go with Sony. If you don't really need an aux cable support go with JBL. If you are ok with wired headphones go with Sony wired as they are in the same price range as these.So at this price range, these are literally the best wireless headphones you can buy. If this is your budget, go for it.I find these sexier than boat rockerz 510 but I'm a black lover and this is my opinion.If you found this review helpful, hit a thumbs up and help others."
1,THREE MAIN DEMERITS👎 NOISE CANCELATION 0% PRODUCT VERY HEAVY AUX CABLE MISSING....... BOAT ROCKERS 400 BEST. ALSO NOT FOLDABLE HEADPHONE. NOICE CANCELATION IS THE MAIN REASON TO BUY BOAT NOT JBL. BUT THIS PRODUCT VERY BAD........
1,I brought this headphone few months ago and now it broke. I just took it out n it snapped. Its even in warranty period
5,"These are the best you can get for the price of 1399/--Sound quality 5/5Used Both wired and via Bluetooth. (Tested wired on the stock aux of boat 400, also a little less bass on Bluetooth but that's expected)-Build 4.5/5Though I trust boAt but the extention of ear cups is via plastic ziplock kind of thing which may lead to early wear and cause headphones to go loose.-Design 5/5 (Over-ear if you don't have large ears)Awesome design and form factor and the cups are comparatively more comfortable and larger than boAt 400.-Inbox contents 4/5The only drawback here is that there is no aux included like in the previous versions but that's not an issue as it was foretold in item description.Edit after a month of through usage :--Comfort 3.5/5Will cause sweating and minor numbness or pain after longer usages i.e. watching complete movies etc.Battery life 5/5Working as described complete 7-8 hours of backup, needless to say it also charges quickly i.e. within 1.5-2 hours.Overall best headphones to get at the price range of 1500/- and below, just wait a bit for lightning deal and viola best offer ever."
1,"Recently ordered the product so after using it for about 6 hours constantly, here is my review in pros and cons.Pros▪Comfort level is better than jbl 450 and  previous boat rockerz edition.▪nice bass and sound quality.▪premium matte finish.▪ conectivity is pretty fast and good.Cons▪sound quality could have been better. i mean bass is good balance is good but sound quality is above average.▪no aux cable.I majorly bought it for jogging so i will update about battery backup and perfomance of this headphone afterwards.Update: perfect pair of headphones for jogging. Battery backup of 7-8 hours easily. get you through 2 days easily if you are medium user.Edit: 8 months and its broken now. i loved these headphones 😥 and now broken. Poor plastic by Boat."
4,Really Nice On ear headphones from Boat. It has really Good bass and Thumbing effect. For Full Review Do visit Technoholic Life on youtube.|Audio  test | Mic Test | Latency Test |
4,"Rockerz 450 is my Second Headphone from boAt, other being Rockerz 510.+ Packing - Comes in a great packing which looks good and easy to unpack+ Design - This is a good looking headphone with a cute Circumaural design (not that big as Rockers 510). Graphics over the ear cups is just nice. When I rub my hands over the cups and I could feel the quality of the material. I was late to notice that the cups can be rotated to 180 degrees.+ Comfort - Smaller headphone when compared Rocker 510, still the cups are large and soft enough to impart a Cozy feeling.+ Sound quality - I am using this one for general listening as well as editing my YouTube videos, and the sound quality is good enough for me.+ Volume and Playback Controls - Playback and volume control on the rear side of ear cup lets you skip tracks and adjust the volume.+ Bluetooth - Connectivity is just great. I am able to move within all rooms of a 1500 sqft Floor.+ Battery Life - I recharge the headphone once in 2 days after using it for 7 to 8 hours with intermittent intervals.+ Economic when compared with other brands in this segment.- Noise cancellation is not working as advertised.- The buttons assigned for volume aren't smooth enough and make a uncomfortable noise.VerdictA good looking, easy to carry, quality headphone, recommended for people who are looking for a good quality headphone within Rs. 1200-1600. I bought my piece at Rs. 1499. and when I write this review a week later, I see that the price came to Rs. 1199 as a part of Festival Sale. So, I think this is the best time to buy it.Moreover, Welcome/Exit messages are just Awesome.While we switch on this gadget, a Super Energetic guy says, Power on. You Plugged into Nirvana!At exit, Adieu Amigo, Powering off!love & regardsAJ"
2,"The mic of the headphones doesn’t seem to be good, a person on call is unable to hear your voice clearly even in a quiet environment. As for a noisy environment, the noise cancellation is pathetic! I fact apparently the background noise is more clear than yours. Good music quality and pretty comfortable though. In all it’s a good headset not a good headphone."
1,This is my 1st time using boat headphone but I shocked when I see I got a headphone which has some minor scratches maybe it's a used. Headphone. I continually use for 10 days. I didn't see any problem in headphone but after 10 days I see that I'm getting a little noice during charging but ignore this sound . Day by day it increasing. One morning  when I woke I see that headphone giving alot of heat but when I open all screw of headphone I see that battery is burned in fire. So don't buy this headphone brand sent me a used headphone.
5,"The product is just amazing!! It comes in a good packaging, has a great colour and I love it💙. This 🎧 can be connected to any bluetooth device. It can remain charged for a very long duration. The ear cushions provides a comfy experience. The sound quality is superb. It's noice cancellation allows u to just concentrate and feel the music. It's worth the price I paid. The main thing I bought this is that it had the calling features and it really works. This 🎧 is completely light weight. The product comes with a charger for charging and an aux cable which can be connected directly to the phone if we want as it saves charging. It also has an information manual and a 1 year warranty card. This product is a Must have!!"
5,"So Hello Guys, I Ordered Patron Tangent Evo On 29th June 2020 First All Amazon Did Good Work By Delivering This Product Within 2 Days In Mumbai Which Was Red Zone In Lockdown Due To Novel Corona Virus PandemicSo, Coming To ProductSound Quality :- Depends On Phone To Phone But Average, I Can Says Vocals Are Very Well Balanced but YouTube, Play Was Very Excellent And balanced.

1,The sound quality is good. Especially the bass is great. But one of the limbs broke after two months of use. I fixed it with fevikwik and tape but it then broke at another part. I had taken extra care handling it but the kind of plastic used is below standards. I mailed BOAT customer support regarding the same and my product was picked up from my address. After a few days I recieved a picture of my product totally damaged with no explanation given and they sent it back to me. Poor experience with the way they handled it. Also the ears start hurting within half an hour of use.
1,"Worst quality .amazon is waste for selling goods and it never meet the requirements of customer ..such a waste product from amazon that I have bought ... I need a replacement of this boat headset otherwise I’m gonna proceed legally..Loose wire connection and very delicate headset I got ,I mean even if I place it on the bed it broken such a worst product given by amazon ...I’m going share this review in all websites if u didn’t respond"
5,"This is nice one, bass is really great and sound also loud, its like mini home theater on your ears. Completely happy with this. Many not suitable for long listening as theses are on ear headphones.Manufacturer package box is perfect. Thanks to Boat"
1,Product material build is the worst of all.The headphones broke into half while adjusting the cups length just after 3 days of using.Recently Boat has been fooling customers with these horrible products that wont last even 3 days.Styrofoam  made products will last longer than these boat products.NEVER GONNA BUY AGAIN FROM BOAT.
4,This headphone is good for the price but RockerZ 510 is far better than RockerZ 450.The 510 is extra bass boosted while this headphone feels like any other normal headphone .I've used both 510 and 450 so if you wanna buy one then I would suggest you the Boat Rockerz-510 .
1,"I have purchased these headphones for my husband as a surprise. And it was so disheartening, that the product was such a failure. The headphones claimed to be noise isolation supportive, but everybody could listen to the song I am hearing. All I could feel was thump, and the headphones were vibrating as I maxed the volume. I paired my phone with these headphones,  but when I tried any other phone to be paired, it just gave me error messages ""Pairing rejected by Boat Rockerz 450""."
5,"First of all i am writing this review after intense usage during lockdown. If you want to buy it, go for it without any hesitation over jbl and mi super bass. As usual amazon's delivery was super fast.The build quality is extremely good but the headphone are made up of plastic. Quality is better than mi super bass headphones and these are very comfortable even when worn for extended periods. Bass quality is pretty good and it also has an in-built mic which cancel much of the background noise. It also has a 3.5mm audio jack so you can use it wired( without any battery usage) or wireless( on battery). The charge lasts around 8-9 hours if used for non-stop gaming like playing PUBG Mobile and COD Mobile. It has a standby tume of more than 100 hours ( yes that is true i have checked it myself) and it delivers lag free voice when playing games and it has a warranty of 1 year which can be claimed on the official website after registering the product. Note- the warranty doesn't cover any physical damage after the product has been handed on to the customer but boat's customer service is very agile.Please mark the review as helpful."
5,All of thing is good but one thing is not good is that aux cable is missing in the box
3,"It's a good build quality headphones from boat and looks good in design. Sound quality is average and bass amount is good too. If you have used any wired headphones like audio technica (Sonic) or Sennheiser(HD206), don't buy this one. You will not like the sound quality from this product. It is more comfortable than boat 400 and little better in sound quality. While using in Bluetooth mode there is 1sec delay in sound while Gaming(in Pubg) and it's effect the gameplay. This delay is not happening while watching videos or movies. I don't recommend if you are buying for gaming. It's not comfortable for long hour usage as it becomes painful after some hours. Aux cable is not included in the box."
2,"Hi guys, as expected both 450 and 400 are alike but slight high at 230hz and thump for 450 and remaining are same as 400If you wanna buy a new one of head set for bass lovers go for it if you are already boat customer of 400 no need to upgradeI also have boat 600 but it lasted for only 1yr approx due to non sweat proof and cushion  has damaged but  head set speakers are fine😍 for 450Pros1) bass2) good clarity3) comfortbut after a hour you feel discomfort but later it will be adjusting for feew weeks 450 rockerz, which i not found on boat 600( AS THEY ARE COMFORTABLE), but very much irritating on 400 rockerz4)  Battery lasted for more than 8 hrs as I used high volume5 ) value for money6) indication for max volume and connection, blue light for idle position, red even for charge and battery l7) quiet strong no room for breakage I hope they had build stronger than 4008) mention of battery in Bluetooth section how much percentage left9) connectivity is good as my home is 3 bedroom it came through two walls and outerdoor more than 15mts untill I go to down floor (400 had disconnected in 10-12 MTS )10) you can connect to two devices once only ( i have connected to iPad and mobile at once ) plays them alternative this is good featureCon's1) As it was not fully over ear2 ) it won't allow you to turn your face as it occupy whole neck (you should expand to max length )3 ) pads are cushion but the gap btwn both speakers are less so some discomfort (boat designers should realise that little bit of space is needed to design as they beat everyone )4) that's itThese heavy than boat 400 in weight and thump little bit in scale of 15/15 for 45014/15 for 400I have used 400 and 600 earlier as I suggest go for it for bass and mid lovers and budget 1500rsButtons are given as it gave on 400They are strudy enough , my previouss I got for almost 4 yrs boat 400 , and 600 last couple of years as am the first customer who bought thatt in 2015 as no one know boat at that time I have recommend for more than 50 peopleNow I have changed my opinion they broke of after 4 months I hope they are not that worthy if they broke out like this in betweenI have attached pictures so that you can handle it carefully already bought customers, or else better go for strong one rather that it's"
1,Hopeless headphones. Absolutely no base and even saound is not loud. A big waste of money. Worst product from boat that I've seen
3,"This product is not bad but not good either..... I bought it for 1400, I don't know quality of other headphones aroud this price point..... But it has some flaws... Such as...1) Noice cancelation is good if don't mind outside noice...2) Calling sucks...... It feels like ants are in my ear and they are having a party.....3) cusions are soft..... But can't wear them more than an hr....But at end of the day sound quality is good... Listening music feels great....."
1,As u can see...i brought two of them..and after using them for one month... they both broke one way or another...only in sensitive manner...donno why company is making the extendable belt with very cheap quality... although I'm a big fan of sound quality...these aren't making me to listen to it 🤦🤞
3,"Surprisingly got it for 1599 ...decent HeadphonesWith decent soundPros:Battery backup is goodLook and feel is coolGood thumping BassCons:vocals and treble might have balancedNot good for long time use as it feels irritatedMight have improved build quality from it predecessor 450Only extra Bass will not suffice good audio experience, it should be balanced , Boat signature audio is poor i think they should work on it.Overall average experience!!"
1,I have ordered headphones. I got it sound was ok not as powerful as i expect. Another problem arisen when my charging got over i try to charge headphone for mor than 2 hrs.. itz not charged after a long time. So i ordered replacement. I got replacement today just few minutes ago. Before opening item i take snapshot so they will believe me.. look at thw stickers the right one is different than left one(the circular one) means seal is broken.After opening this.. i Haven't found charging cable & on hear headphones too...Extremely disappointed..If u r going to buy through amazon...Please check it properly coz vendor will send u defective items.. or missing items...Extremely disappointed....
5,I got this @ ₹1499 bucks. The sound quality is immensely good. The bass is great. Well comfort wise I won’t say it’s that great because of its round shaped ear cushions other than in every aspect be it sound or battery life or connectivity every way it’s perfect. This is the best one can have within ₹1500 bucks. I would suggest personally to go for this one if one is looking for a budget bluetooth headphones.
5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙"
1,"The Build quality is very poor, Never purchase this product. It broke in a month even tho I was using my new headphone very carefully. It broke because the plastic used at that point is very weak and cheap.It look like they have used metal in the head band but that they have just pasted after the rotation point and it serves no Purpose.I am soo much trapped after purchasing this as they will not give service because it is considered as physical damage nor I can use it anymore. A complete waste of money."
5,BoAt gives us a good quality sound than sony headphones
5,lokking nice and desing is very good but during lockdown not able to getting product MRP
4,"These over-ear headphones sound great with thumping bass and clear vocals along with good noise cancellation and bluetooth connectivity. It also has a really good build quality with eye catching looks and texture. The mic quality is also excellent and good for video conferencing calls or recording music/karaoke. However what the makers at boat forgot to focus on, is the ergonomics! I couldn't wear these headphones even for 5 mins as the pressure of the ear cups was too much, causing pain at the ear and neck region. Hence I returned these headphones. Hope boAt concentrates more on the ergonomics next time before launching any product!"
1,"-at this price range sound is well maintained even at high peak.-bass is not soo high or not having much thump in it, pritty low in bass.-noise isolation is just in paper.-padding is well given.- its way bulky.-build quality is decent.-other side cannot here my sound.its defective"
1,Had a good review but nowUpdate : after 1month useThe headphones has showed big cracks on both the side .Extremely disappointed ☹️The build quality isDon't think it is covered by warrantyWorst design at the extentable part.
5,"Got this on the prime day exclusive sale. For Rs. 1498 u cant get a better deal than this.First i will come to the build. The entire thing is well cushioned. It is comfortable on the ears. No pressure on the ears like u just have to put it off even if u don't want to. The ears will sweat a little it's true but that is because they cover the entire year. The headband does not feel heavy at all on the head. There is no problems with the connectivity at all. It only took a few seconds to connect to my iPad air 3 and my realme 5 pro (mentioned the model so that angone having these model can buy it worryfree)Second the sound. The treble is a bit low but the base is on point. It comes both with a 3.5mm aux. So playing Pubg with this is no issue. With Bluetooth connectivity u will find latency but with the wire, footsteps and everything are clear af. There is noise cancellation but don't expect like those of bose. Obvio the price point does vary a lot. But for this range this is too good. I am satisfied with my purchase to the highest point. Just get it!!!"
4,"I bought this headphone on prime day sale for 1500/- . For this price range these are really good. I will divide this review between pros and cons.Pros:1. Unboxing experience was good it has every basic thing  aux wire and cable for charging.2 . Build quality: This is the best feature of these headphone. The pads are quite comfy . It was little on heavier side but distribution of weight is good,  it does not feel heavy on use. The buttons are made of plastic but they felt tactile. Overall it looks sturdy3 . Great design , as portrayed in the picture. The patterned pads gives premium feel.4 . Sound quality : The most important part of any audio product. I am no audiophile but i have tried several budget products and some high end products ober years so this might be helpfulThe balance of sound is good , the songs appear pleasing with a accentuated lows . It will do wonders if you like heavy bass.The mids aren't that great and sometimes they felt crushed by the overpowering bass. Instrument seperation is good and one can make out different instrument playing in the background but again they are little overpowered by bass. I know this is asking too much but boat should give a manual controller to decrease the bass like skullcandy crusher. Highs are above avg and the experience was quite enjoyable when when we were listening songs. When I was watching movies I could make out the dialogues spoken by the characters and the movie watching experience was quite enjoyable too . Overall it's a great sound experience for the price .5. Battery : No complaints here ! Great battery life . I don't know the actual backup but it lasted a week after charging it fully.6. it connected to my phone pretty easily  and the there was no drop in connection even if I move a little  away from the phone.Cons1. The bass is  little overpowering for my liking. If you can tweak using equilizer then you can find the perfect balance between all three mids highs and lows.2. It has micro-usb in 2020 which is little outdated.3. The buttons could have been a little better and while turning on the headphones there is a voice which says turned on sound is little loud even when you decrease volume.Hope you find it helpful!"
5,Very comfy i hae 1 piece
5,"boAt Rockerz 550 is the latest budget premium wireless Bluetooth headphone from Boat. The key highlights are 50mm Dynamic Drivers, 500 mAh battery, 20 hours battery life, Bluetooth 5.0 and Physical Noise Isolation.  The price of boAt Rockerz 550 is ₹2000. There is another color variant besides the Black and Red (Furious Red), that is, Black and Gray. If you are looking for a nice pair of reliable Bluetooth headphones with good sound quality and great battery life, then boAt Rockerz 550 are highly recommended. Checkout the full review on my YouTube channel with the same name."
2,My earphone has many scratches probably it is a used product.Sound 8/10Bass 7/10Treble 9/10Quality 8/10Clarity 7/10overall you will not get a satisfying experience from this headphones.
1,The headphone stopped working after 15 days.power on failure.
3,"Contents in the box: User manual, warranty card (1 year), aux cable, headphones.Headphones come with 50 mm drivers, bluetooth 5.0,  AUX cable support.The headphones are very heavy (250 gms). A good amount of padding is done which makes it comfortable to wear, but it puts a lot of weight on your head and neck so can't wear it for long period of time.The build quality is poor. After using for some time the head band starts creaking and making noise which is annoying.The sound quality is very good. Sound is loud and clear. Everything sounds bass boosted, and sometimes feels unnatural.The battery backup is better than expected. Lasts for days with moderate usage. Charges to full in an hour. Lasts long.Latency is same as an average wireless headphones. You will experience lag in latency dependent tasks such as gaming and video calls.Once connected the range is good but facing difficulties in connecting to phone and laptop.Noise cancellation felt okay at first but with regular use it has decreased.AUX cable is bad quality and loose fitting although long enough.Pros:Loud and clear audioGood amount of bassGreat battery lifeAUX supportGood amount of paddingCons:Poor build qualitySometimes bass feels unnatural (too much)Very heavyNot foldable/portableConnectivity is not good."
1,Again music crackling poping soundमुझे दिए 2 दिन हो गए हैंमैं जब इसमें मूवी देखता हूं तब जैसे ही किसी एक्टर का डायलॉग खत्म होता है और थोड़ा साइलेंस होता है तब इसमें टक टक की आवाज आती है जब दूसरा कलाकार बोलना शुरू करता है तब तक तक की आवाज आती है अगर आप म्यूजिक सुनते हो और अगर म्यूजिक में कहीं पर साइलेंस है तब वहां पर टक टक की आवाज आएगी इस टक टक की आवाज की वजह से म्यूजिक एक्सपीरियंस पूरी तरह से खराब हो रहा है यानी कि आप मूवी नहीं देख सकते यूट्यूब पर अगर आप की वीडियो अटके गी तो तो टक टक की आवाज आएगी फिर यूट्यूब पर वापिस वीडियो शुरू होगी
5,"So I've been using them for 2 days now, the sound quality is amazing (both bt and aux), noise isolation does work, for me it lasted 18 hours at 60% volume, it actually only takes 2 hours for a full charge (5v 2A adapter), for those who are wondering about the audio latency, there's no delay on most apps, for some games you might find a 1 second delay, but then again you can use the aux cable and it works fine. When you connect the aux cable you'll notice how it only detects the headphones and not the mic on the headphones, but don't worry i tested it and the mic works fine (both bt and aux). It's a great product for the price, considering the fact that it just released i do recommended you to buy these, just note that though it now says 1999 you can get them for 1500 whenever there's a sale."
4,Very bad product build
1,No battery back up at all. Everytime I take this to use it never has enough battery to switch on. I have to charge this every single day even if I had used it for only 10 minutes and had charged for hours the day before. Completely disappointed with this product. Simply a waste of money.Also sometimes there is connectivity issue as there is some interference and the sound is not clear.
1,don't buy boat products. Boat is buying a low quality china products and branding as boat in India.I given this 1 star to write a review. It doesn't worth even 1star. It is dumbest brand I have ever used. Even a 100 rs street will give more life than boat.Got broken in right side without any usage. Previously I was using boat 255 and literally I have replaced 6 headset in 1year with one side not working issue. now boat 550 has a very low quality plastic body that will break if you open the headset to place on your ears.
5,"Bought the RED version model. Design is lit as Hell.Sound quality is lit with Bass, little bit of mid and also treble.A bit heavy in weight.No lags in connectivity.Comfortable to wear, as ear cuffs are soft.After long hours of use, heats up the ear but it doesn't matter if you are in the air conditioning.Worth every Penny. No regrets.My OnePlus Dolby Atmos feature enhances the experience."
1,"Review after using this for  2 weeks :->1. Sound Quality : trash... My (Rs. 650) skull candy anti sounds way much much better than this thing.Lows are dead in this headphone, you will never be able to hear the little details, creativity in the songs.Bass is flat or no base at all , you will feel base only if you play bass boosted audio tracks, beats are very very low , even some beats are feeled bcos of headphone covers the whole ears else there is nothing that these headphone can do .In one word : sound quality of this headphone is just little bit higher than china's 150Rs. Earphones with some negligible better bass.2. Weight : this is really really heavy . I have used a lot of headphones but this is the only one which I was unable to wear for more than 1 hour , my neck hurts.3.At 30% Charge : it starts notifying battery low voice ""oops battery low"" sentence after every minute, which is really annoying if you watching movies, online class lecture, listening song.This is so annoying and makes it unable to use below 30%.4. Charger cable is approx 15cm long, which is useless .Please dont buy this product . Waste of money."
5,One problem with this because I thought of that first time I am using on ear earphones (🎧) I fill it is slipping and irritated for few minutes and when I listened to the music 🎶 beats and bass is super.phone calls and stream purpose it is good for sound and comfortablity is less due it is heavy compression and slipping down due to weight.So overall it is good to use for less time and not comfortable for longtime users.
1,Got a damaged product. Unable to insert the charge cable inside the charging slot...Did not expect this from Amazon. Returning this within 15 minutes of receiving the product in my hands....
1,Great sound quality but I get a defected peice and after 2 to 3 hours left earphone cannot give a little base bt only sound came from it
1,"I ordered this product as i have been using Boat 10W Bluetooth Speaker since last 2 yrs which is very good in Bluetooth connectivity and sound quality that is why i ordered this boat headphone but when i started using it i found some Bluetooth connectivity issue like when am playing anything the sound and voice getting break, even in 2 meter distance"
5,"Got the headphones on its release date for a price of 1350rs and it is definitely VFM at that price!!Pros :- Very comfortable and soft cushioning albeit a little heavy- Clean treble and good bass(bass lovers won't like this headphones as it's not bass boosted)- very good bluetooth range- great battery life- VFM- mic quality is surprisingly decent- noise isolation is good but not greatCons :- the stitching on the foam feels a bit gentle, and the headphones creaks when flexed... so not sure about the long term reliability- 50mm drivers is a gimmick! I used Sony xb450ap before and it's 30mm drivers were better in every way. But it's also 2x pricey and is wired.. so, you get what you pay but don't get fooled by the marketing...- Not a con, but this headphones is not for bass lovers. Bass is good but not prominent/boosted."
2,"I bought it as a cheap replacement for my Steel Series, and strictly for official teams/skype calls.What I wanted - A Bluetooth headset with Aux compatibility with a good mic. Comfort wasn't in my Wishlist as this was completely for occasional calls.The headset volume was ok, both over bluetooth and aux. Very tight on the head that, you feel an instant ""Uncomfortable noise cancellation"".Tested the mic on the phones, and my voice was nearly audible. Tested it on my laptop, and the other side couldnt even hear my voice. The voice tests shows a max of 32% even when I shouted,Moral: Dont go by reviews by kids who just need volume and bass.And Amazon has no direct return policy, So a replacement is being sent. Waste of time"
1,Having blutooth connectivity issues sometimes. Mic also not working properly.
5,"Over the ear headphones we generally see in premium category This is purely budget oriented. Seriously awesome 1st of all very comfortable over the ears but if yu use it for more than an hour you will get sweat on the ears and 2nd thing is decent sound quality decent base . 3rd is battery life and two way connectivity. Definitely at the price of Rs1499(prime day deal) simply awesome. Build quality is plastic we can't expect more at the price of Rs1499. Definitely try the product you won't feel disappointed. If you wanted to try over the ear headphones 🎧 for the 1st time in your life use this headphones so that you will get habituated the after few months go for premium brand over the ear headphones like BOSE , SONY , Senhizer etc."
5,I will not take much time..... directly comming to the point....* Sound quality beyond expectations...it really has good highs mids and lows.... Treble is a bit high but its fine ...sound is crystal clear...and immersive...* It comes physical noice isolation wich works fine.... dramatically increases sound depth...* Battery life is pretty much same as mentioned.* Bass is pefrect for all purposes...not only for gameing....not only for music....its very balanced and satisfactory ......* it could feel a bit heavy for small heads.... otherwise comfort level is 9/10 and wich is far better in this price segment.....one can easily use it for hours...* No connecting issue in my device.....yes a bit delay in gaming....but with aux...it works absolutely fine.....* Both the colour variations are pretty cool....but i orderd black and grey variant...bcz i feel this is more classy... Red one is also attractive...but its too bright...will look cheap on some dresse....you have to dress according to it....and after some frequent uses .....colour will get dull.So i prefered black version...but its ypur choice.* Over all the device is master piece of art by boat.....so pocket friendly...and beating easily so mamy other branded premium headphones....you can go for it for sure.....you will not gonna regret buying it ...trust me..
3,"Best ever crystal clarity i have ever heard from any over head headphones.🔥🔥🔥But most importantly don't buy these if you are true bass lover and need thumb in ear for every song.Built quality and comfort are best in this segment but i honestly feel they are bit overpriced for 2k boat should have launched at 1.5k.Even with 50mm driver bass is the most weakest point.But watching movies and YouTube, Netflix is 🔥🔥🔥You will be able to listen small details in videos.If you don't want bass but clarity then don't give any other thoughts.I even had zebronics zeb duke and boult pro bass boost they are beast when it comes to bass output but they lack clarity by just 20%Lows and mids are clear than any other in this segment.Suggest you to buy these only at 1.5k for 2k they are dammn over priced.Battery life is tooo good for 28hr+ than claim.You can also twist and rest on chest when not needed.Sound leakage at 90 level it's 10% but really you will listen these all around 70% volume.Me personally ☺️ was able to use them for 3hr+ continuous.Even one big advantage that non other offers under 2k is comfort 10/10,After wearing for longer session other headphones makes some inner pain feel like vacuumed ear or pressured but these problems were not at all present.And one big importantly BOAT has great After sales service than any other india lifestyle brand no worries as they provide free pickup and drop service at your home.It's all indian brand but MADE IN CHINA.But all headphones india are made in china up under 2kBoult Boost and zeb Duke are great alternative for this if you don't get 550."
5,"Here's everything you need to know.Pros:* Perfect fit* Not heavy* Decent bass* Beautiful design* Quite comfortable* Awsome battery life* No noticeable latency* Very capable to get loud* Crystal clear sound quality* Ear cups fully cover the ears* Easy to launch Google Assistant* Great connectivity (Bluetooth 5.0)* You won't hear anybody while playing music* Blocks about 80% of surrounding sound when not playing musicCons:* Would've been very convenient if it had a USB-C port for charging* Mic quality is average but I don't expect any better from headphones which aren't gaming headsets* Coming from Zakk H04 Blaze which are on-ear headphones, the bass is a little less compared to on-ear headphones* Fancy LED lights like H04 Blaze would've made it look better in dark but that has nothing to do with the headphones itselfConclusion:Bought it in a sale for 1500 INR. Good value for money and is worth buying even for the regular price of 2000 INR. Go for the red color, you'll truly admire it, the black one is quite dull. The sound quality is amazingly nice and these headphones are very capable of producing good bass. If you really like a lot of bass, use an equalizer and you'll be pleased with it. These are not active noise canceling headphones and I know that, but the passive noise cancellation is suprisingly good. Excellent purchase, no regrets."
1,"What i got was a second hand piece.The box was already opened when i got it.When i used it, surprisingly the bluetooth cuts off when i put my phone in my pocket 🤷🏻‍♂️ . What i got was already returned by someone else. Sound quality was also awful.I think it is replica. 😤Don’t go with. 🙂I returned the headphones and i got the refund. 🙂😌"
5,"Oh this is really good. Some might find the bass to be a bit low. For me it was adequate although sometimes i prefer to use an equalizer. If you want to get deep bass all the time, use an equalizer. Even if you dont use equalizer it will still deliver thumping bass. It delivers distortion free sound at high volume. Sound quality was pretty good. Sound isolation is ok. If its raining heavily you wont hear the rain at all.  The best part is i got it with 500/- discount.The bluetooth range is good. There is no distortion of bass. However when it came to call quality it was like 50-50. Could be due to my phone as it is pretty outdated (will check the call quality using other devices). Mostly i used this for watching movies or listening to music, so call quality doesnt matter that much. Watching a movie with the headphone was a superb experience. You will get that theater kind of vibe.  Ear cups and padding on the headphone is excellent. The quality of material used is premium and top notch. Overall my experience has been very good (probably the best affordable headphone i have used so far)"
1,its plastic is of low quality it degradeg with time and broke i used it for 8 months then its plastic started breaking from different areas.PLEASE DONT BUY IT WONT LAST AND 2000 IS BIG AMOUNT FOR SUCH BAD QUALITY PLASTIC.
1,"Price : 1499, Ordered during Diwali sale.Received on 11.11.20201. I received a damaged package, also the right ear cup of the headphones had several dents.2. At the very next day, it started to struggle in bluetooth connectivity.3. I placed a replacement, AMAZON was too nice and they have arranged an immediate replacement.4. But the Seller was too bad, they have sent me a package with broken seal and it was clearly an used product.(Replacement package)This made me to hate 'Appario' to the core.About headphonesPros:1. Great comfort2. Amazing battery backup3. Physical noise cancellation, not bad4. Can be connected with two devices5. Decent bassCons:1. (Bluetooth) Every time you need to reconnect it twice, after conncetion it will struggle to play audio for 10 seconds later it will be good, IDK why.2. While playing games like PUBG, it definitely need to be used in Aux mode. There is a minimum delay in audio while connected through bluetooth."
1,"Got boAt rockerz 400 the first time ,with exchange i got a refurbished product, full of dust in the box.The headphones are really bulky..No noise cancellation but noise isolation.The earcups covers your ears so the outside noise doesn't come in.20 hours backup.. superb.Bass just okaysound at max volume is unbearable coz of sound isolation, can damage eardrums coz of loudness."
1,"The decision to buy Boat headphones was a disaster. I replaced the headphones within a month of ordering since the right lobe had an issue and it got detatched. After receiving a replacement of the damaged product, I faced the exact same issue. The right lobe got detatched again that too within a month even after gentle usage. Since the product quality is pathetic and the product has an year's warranty, I either want a replacement or refund."
1,Boat when Claims number 1 headphones provider but it doesn't get paired with Sony Bravia TV. They should mention about device compatibility of product. Customer are getting fooled here after purchasing it doesn't get paired with Sony TV. Both company should resolve such issue together.
3,"Well the whole noise cancellation stuff is just for advertisement and to get along with the trend in headphones these days. It amounts to nothing.The headphones sound pretty muddy too.I paid 2k for it. For that price, they are excusable. The fit is actually perfect for me. I wore it for 8 hours straight today and tbh the only thing that made me uncomfortable was the fact that my ears got hot which isn't even the headset's fault lolI listened to ASMR while sleeping and these are actually pretty comfortable to sleep in too.But honestly, if you're getting this for even a rupee over 2k, I'd say SKIP IT. If I had paid 5k for it (original price) I would be really angry. But since I paid 2k, I feel like I got my money's worth."
1,It has stopped working within warranty period and Amazon does not show option to return or replace it within warranty period.
5,"This is my honest review after using it for 20 days, in this price range it is best one,the only problem i faced was the ear pain, couldn't wear it for more than 2 minutes, its too much tight, so i made it loose by putting it on my book for 48 hours, rest is good, price, sound, clarity, bass and wire length."
1,Received second hand headphone
4,"Im going to give a small comparison of this product with two of the headphones i have been using recently.This includes Samsung level u ( rs 2249/) and the ant audio w56 in ear wired earphone ( rs 599/)ProsDecent build qualityExcellent sound qualityApt for watching movies.Soft cushioningMicGood quality cableConsExternal noices creeps in a lot ( less noice cancellation effect).Jack is not gold plated, but I won't complain about it because the gold plating on most of the jacks of headphones in this price range will wear off after a months usage.On comparing the boat bass heads 900 with the ones mentioned above, I noticed that the bass levels were pretty much equal between the ant audio w56 and boat bass heads 900. Samsung level u has the least bass compared to the other 2In terms of audio quality, the boat bass heads and Samsung level u are in the same level, the clarity of sound is a bit less in the ant audio w56 compared to the boat .For outdoor use, I would prefer the ant audio w56 as it has better noice cancellation compared to the boat.ComfortI have read some reviews complaining about the boat bass heads 900 that it pains in the ears after a few minutes of usage. But I have not experienced such problems.Build qualityThe plastics used is not the best, but acceptable. Ear pads are well cushioned.SummaryOverall a really decent product from boat, excellent sound clarity and good bass makes it good for watching movies. Most suitable for indoor usage, good value for money ( bought it for 799 but will be available for 599 at certain times.)Audio quality 4/5Bass 3.8/5Value for money 4/5Comfort 4/5Build quality 3.7/5Thank you for your time."
4,"The Boat bass heads really live up to their name by providing amazing Bass for music lovers.Pros:1. The design is stylish, especially the white one.2. The headphone is easily foldable making it convenient to carry.3. Mic for calls.4. Excellent Bass.5. Very Cheap (Bought for around 900 during sale).6. Durable and lengthy Cable.Cons:1. You cannot wear it for more than one hour, beyond which your ears start hurting due to the tight design.2. Slight distortion at 100% sound levels."
1,"exactly after 30-32 days,mic problem, in-line mic not working, and when connected headphones it automatically mutes all volume by reducing audio levels automatically, tested on different mobile phones, problem not solved. Microphone either works or speakers. cannot use headphones for calling purpose. Your voice is not delivered to other end with this headphones. Now I don't have option for replacement or return. Obviously the seller will tell me to go to BoAt service center which is in mumbai city as shows google map and I live in Pune city. Very bad experience, my all money is wasted by this BoAt brand, I should have bought Audio Technica or scullcandy branded headphones in this same price segment. Utterly disappointing."
1,I had just got this headphones day before yesterday and by seeing them i was happy as they look cool  ...But honestly i will tell u that as  i wear these headphones like just for 2-4minutes while listening songs...my ears start paining and i remove them but still pain was there for a long time for that day .but  yeah song quality is good but still they pain..now today i had request for return of this item
4,"I got this headphone for 599.the build quality of this thing is pretty good it feels solidBass is amazing and overall quality of the sound is also nice no doubt.I am very satisfied with boAt's after sales services.my Headphone got an issue with sound (unfortunately) don't worry that doesn't mean you will also have the same issue it was just a 1 in million caseso I went to service center and without asking a single question they got me replaced with another headphones.one more thing I have to mention that you may feel discomfort after wearing the headphones for quite long, because it is slightly tight, may be eventually it will get loose."
1,Please don't purchase this product. The one side speaker is off within 2 months. The call was disconnected after connecting this headphones.Very bad product.
4,Awesome Sound but jack is not gold plated!
5,It's a original boat product ... Made in China.... Sound quality is awesome ... Disadvantage- It's going blow ur ears... If u don't like bass then don't buy it
3,The sound quality is excellent but it hurts the ear lobes after wearing them for 30 mins. Need to put extra cushioning the ones available are not enough. Also it does not have the volume buttons included.making it difficult. Otherwise it's a good buy.
5,"Let us go through the advantage and disadvantageAdvantage1) Value for money Head set that is a bass monster and clarity is awesome2) It has a bundled mike so that you can use it to pick up your call on mobile as well.3) Snug fit to the ear and really responsive sound volumeDisadvantage1) NoneI would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a new headset with mike phone. The music quality is mind blowing, awesome."
4,"Everything is good about this headphone. The clarity, noise reduction, bass is all perfect. However after using it for a month the left side stopped working. I raised a complaint with BOAT and within 2 weeks I got a replacement. I appreciate the customer service by BOAT."
5,If u love listening music... If good sound quality .. Good bass matters to u.. Then definitely buy these Headphones.. Extremely good bass and sound quality .. Durable.. Looks wise really awesome.. Noise cancelation is super awesome.. Don't think just go for it guys.. U won't regret buying these headphones at all.. Grantee..
5,"I liked the super bass feature and the attached microphone. I purchased SONY headphones and before the year ended and the warranty was over, it was completely DEAD. I hope that BOAT does not end up with the same fate. As one consumer mentioned in the review, when he contacted the makers of the headphone complaining that he should get a replacement for the faulty headphones, the company immediately arranged for a new one. The same happened with me with the SONY product but I got terribly pained running from pillar to post to get a replacement. It NEVER happened. Go for BOAT headphones. They are a value for money. I invested Rs. 799/- and I am truly satisfied with both the microphone and the speaker quality. Thumsb Up !!!"
1,"The worst headphones i ever bought. Bought these headphones for ₹749 and when i got delivery the left side of the earphones was giving distorted soundVery bad experience with boat , No sound clearity and no bass quality , its a useless productI m wondering whats the quality checking of this brand , they dont even test their products single time , very bad experience with boat"
5,Best In Class.For 799 Rs (Superdeal) I am shocked with its bass and really suggest you to buy. It also comes with a mic for great hands free voice chat.
5,Very nice headphone for all pubg mobile players.. I used to use scullcandy headphone before but the way this headphone work is brilliant.. I can identify footsteps and bullets direction more accurately than before.. Only problem is that if you have by mistakely kept high volume and if you fire akm then it might hurt your ears coz already this is a bass headphone and akm or M762's sound is very high which can give you headache or short-term deafening.. So take care of that.. Overall the product is good
1,"Please don't buy this, The product was good, worked well for two weeks. Then suddenly mic was not working. We tried contacting the customer service for Boat. But no response. Service center also not picking up call. Don't know what to do with this product now, as can't return also already crossed the return timeline due to followup with customer service since three weeks. But no action was taken. Also this is made in China. So suggest don't waste your money for this product."
5,it has a very nice look and it's worth of money..go for it and there is no chance of repent..
5,Good Product decent sound Quality in this price range its way beyond expectations. Must Buy for Pure Bass Lovers
1,"I bought boAt headphone few months back, not more than 6 months. But its right side damaged and sound is not coming. Now what I shall do? I can't take this and go for a service centre to my nearest town which is 90 km away from my place of residence. Only thing I do is I purchase another headphone either from Sony or Phillips. I advice all not to go for boAt headphones. They are not reliable. This is my experience"
4,Good looking headphone with mic.Sound quality is awesome
4,"Editing this review after 10 months, so starting with the pro'sSo the Audio quality is good you'll get surrounding feel where it's needed & if you are bass lover then you will like it very much, watching Hollywood movies on it feels great.Build quality is also good, most of the components made with plastic and then some metallic & the cushions are soft and their material quality is also good.Now the conseven though its cushions are soft this headphone is painfull for your ears if you are using it continuously, headphone fits much more tighter on your ears than it has to be so thats why...I was using this headphone with Lenovo vibe K4 note and suddenly it stopped working with it, it was working fine with every other device but stopped working on my device, even my device working well with every other headphones even i tried another bassheads 900 and it was working with my device but my bassheads 900 stopped working with my phone... i know its strange.Then few months later right side of headphone stopped working and then soon after left side gave up.Boat seems very good build quality and sound quality but i experienced 8 out of 10 headphones of boat stops working after some period, But the best thing is if your headphones gets any issue within 1 year then you'll get brand new headphones from Boat, you just have to register product and ask for replacement with details of your headphone issue.Even i got replacement for my product & it's been 2 years since i purchased this headphone and they are working super fine although i had to replace them once because of issue mentioned above."
3,To be honest you guys this headphone sound quality is horrible too much treble I see all other people claiming it has a allot of base but no I’m a base lover there’s no base if you higher up the volume it hurts the ear I didnt expect this I wanna exchange already! This was my first headphone I purchased and Im totally disappointed since I use my apple earpiece it sounds much better than this headphone such a waste of money ! Now another issue it stop working within a month and there is no option to replace also this is a horrible experience ever like thus are the worst thing I’ve ever bought online. Don’t buy it amazon lies!!! There was no option for warranty since they didn’t gave any bill or nothing !!
2,"I bought these for my Son. Both of us use the headphones.The sound quality for the price range is excellent. It got a good Bass, treble could have been sharper. However the biggest issue with this headset, is that it's too tight on the ears ( and I dont have a very big face ).After about 5 mins, your ears start to hurt ( literally hurt ).So while, the sound may be good, it's of no use when you cannot use the head set for more than 10 minutes at a stretch.2 stars only for the reason that these headsets are practically un-usable due to being too tight."
5,"I have been using the headphones since two days and I must say I am quite impressed. By looking at the photos of the product, I thought these are huge headphones. I was equally surprised to see the small box it came in when opened the Amazon packaging. After I took it out of the box, it felt really light in weight. The build quality of the headphones is good. You don’t feel in anyway that you are holding a cheap product. The fit is really snug. Good amount of cushioning for your years. There is a little bit of cushioning for the headband too which suffices the need. About the sound quality: Listening to music felt good. Nice bass, treble is good, you can hear every sound and tune clearly. However, I felt it needed a bit more sharpness. But hey, what all can you expect from a product at this price. I used it for calls. Voice quality is good. There is a fair amount of booze cancellation on the headphones. Microphone is powerful too. Overall and excellent product for its price. If you are looking for a over the ear headphones and for a good price.... this is your choice."
1,I cannot hear any music from the right side
5,"I have been using BOAT earphone since early thosand 18. And believe me guys this is truly beyond awesome. This is my first purchase after using SONY headphone, SONY is far behind from BOAt, as what i think, after using earphone/headphone of BOAT. I went for this headphone after earpiece of boAt & this is mind boggling. What a sound quality, Hats off 2 the makers of boAt. Awesome bass, treble , u r gonna hear each n every penny of sound clearly. U r gonna be totaly cutoff urself from outer world once u wear this headphone. Its material quality is very good, its totaly durable, light weight. I am giving this review after using 2 week. Dont hesitate go for it guys."
5,"I will come straight to the point. These are infact a great pair of headphones - but only when you are traveling or require active noise cancellation. Otherwise these are just a decent pair.I have been using this for a while with my laptop & iPhone, for watching Netflix & Prime Video (The Audio Source is anyways brilliant) & listening to music on Prime Music, again, the audio source is great, so I have got a decent experience with the headphones, with nice bass & decent mids. But when you turn the Active noise cancellation, the experience is in a different league - You wont hear any other voice in your vicinity. I have tested this in multiple flights as well. Even if you just turn the noise cancellation on, without any music, it will give a surreal experience, you won't be able to hear any in-cabin flight noise (engines etc.) It has actually helped me have a nice in-flight experience whether to just sleep or watch any movie.Two things which could have been improved upon are -1. With out Noise cancellation listening experience.2. Re chargeable inbuilt battery could have been used."
5,So lets start with build quality it just perfect easily foldable and very light weight had a soft metal strip at top which adjustable according to your head.. the ear coups are small so had some problems with them so there is con and this is only con if u listen to music a lot it best to avoid this since long hours of usage causes pain especially near the ear drum ... Except all the sound quality is just amazing 10/10 for that boat .. also the bass is really good u wiuld be satisfied with that also had a microphone which sounds ok..
1,"The ear-piece is so tight that ears get hurted within a few minutes of wearing it. It has unnecessary clockwise roation instead of anti-clockwise, such that bottom part of my ear doesn't get surrounded...Even a 5% volume can be heard by a person behind me. And the connector works okay in my laptop, but falls very easily from my mobile phone. Overall product doesn't seems to be sturdy, the wires seems to be can be easily break with just a small strech due to rubber-like substance.Last time I had used Mdr Zx110a which didn't had sound quality as this, but everything was sturdy, comfortable and still working after two years (with 35+ times falls from height and alot of streches), just that it got fungi right now due to moisture conditions...There is no return, only replacement with same product available, I have placed just to be sure if its the problem with only this one or every piece got the same problem."
1,"NOT SATISFIED,1. AMAZING EXPERIENCE WITH MUSIC2. NOT AT ALL GOOD FOR PUBG PLAYERS, YOU WON'T EXPERIENCE BACKGROUND MUAIC OF PUBG LIKE FOOT STEPS ECT.3. MUSIC LEAKS VERY MUCH4. MINE STOPPED WORKING UNDER 20 DAYS5. IF YOU USE IT ROUGHLY THE AUX WILL DEFINITELY GET DAMAGE6. THE CORD WIRE IS VERY VERY VERY LONG, WHICH IS VERY IRRITATING.SOME LAST LINES:-:-ONLY GOOD FOR MUSIC LOVERS, WHICH USE IT RARELY. NOT GOOD FOR GAMING OR ANYTHING ELSE.BE FREE TO ASK ANYTHING ELSE ON MY INSTAGRAM :- ayaanshaikh106"
5,It is very very good experience with this headphones. It is recommended to Bass lovers. Good sound quality.Go through it.
3,"(Ok so, headphones you buy should be based on who you are (music producer, audio engineer, DJ or a regular person).For non-music produces (normal people):This headphone is ideal for you. Please don't go for studio-quality or expensive headphones for only listening to music (because expensive headphones are for music producers and require a huge amount of power that can't be used with mobile). It comes with a small microphone in one of the wires, is foldable (easy to store even in small bags). BUT, the ear cups are really small to my ears, get heated quickly, so you can't wear it for a long time comfortably. This headphone can be used with all devices and doesn't need a lot of power like the expensive ones. And if you listen to podcasts, I don't recommend it because it is uncomfortable to wear and has bad noise cancellation feature. But if you use headphones for meetings and listening to music, this is perfect for you.For music producers and mixing engineers:I do not recommend these headphones for you. Because if we see the frequency response, it plays sounds from 20-10000 Hz (as far as I can hear). But it plays bass sounds more than other frequencies which can make you biased and wrong decisions while making music and mixing/mastering. Anywhen it comes to power, it is 80 ohms. So please don’t buy ANY cheap headphones for music producing and I recommend buying headphones that have frequency response clearly mentioned (20Hz to 20000Hz is good) with 250 ohms. Such studio-quality headphones are not cheap though. You can see more studio-quality headphone suggestions for producer s on YouTube.Hope this helps :)"
4,I brought this headphone for 750 Rupees.  It's really easy to use and I like the sound quality of it. but the only one negativity is that it's very lightweight so from my point of view it can break very easily so should not put it down.They gave this headphones with one year of warranty card so let's see how long it will be in good condition!! .and one more thing that It has good ratings and more then 30 thousand people brought this products that's why I believe it and brought it .( when its gets problem or not working that time I will update again about this headphones ) otherwise value for money.
5,I'm writing the review after 20 months of purchasing and still it is working fine.Pros:-1.Best budget headphone with in linemicrophone.2.Great build quality3.Impressive bass at this price segment4.Durable5.Good lookingCones:-No cones to discuss.you can't get better headphone than this at this price segment.I had purchased the black one at Rs749 but price keeps on changing from 749-1399 and sometimes 2199 so if want to buy this at cheaper price wait for sometime.Precaution- make sure to cover the wire by some protective layer otherwise after 1 year the wires will get several cuts due to folding  so to avoid use some protective layer around wires and then you can use this for long time
1,"Writing this review after using this headphone for 4+ months.Pros:Build and cable quality is good, no wear and tear in cables.Tangle free.Cons:Absolutely 0 on noise cancellation. At 20% volume level, anyone near you can hear everything.Painful to use for longer duration, ears starts hurting as the earpiece is not big enough and sits on the ears.Cannot use it for longer duration.Bass quality and audio quality is average."
4,"This Boat Ear phone  of mine stopped working in the Mid of April 2020.  It did'nt strike me then to check for the warranty period due to this Covid-19 lock down. Now that I am checking the old orders, I find that its just one year since I brought this product and the warranty too is 1 year.  It lasted exactly for 1 year not more not less. So the immediate question that comes to my mind is ""Is this the quality of a reputed company ""Boat"" ? I have just missed the boat by few days and that too due to this Covid-19 lockdown. Will this qualify for replacement? Please let me know."
3,I have purchased this boat earphone few months ago...😊Here I'm sharing our experience with this product.Build quality⏮️⏭️ Its build quality is Awesome and looks premium in hands when you hold it in your hands.

5,"One of the best pair of earphone for the price1} Sound quality is amazing for the price 😍2} Built quality is good but not the best but  for the budget price I can say its good ⚡3} Headphone jack is not gold plated ⚠️4} I have been using this earphone from past more than a year and have replaced it once under warranty which was super easy hassel free🎶5} I have used many other brand earphones such as JBL, Sony, Sennheiser, RHA, Boultaudio and recently Infinity and I am not a professional but have experience of many earphones so I can say this is the best sounding in budget and very comfortable in shape to use for longer duration 💯💥I can definitely recommend this earphones must buy in budget segment 🔝🔝✅🔥🔥"
5,Build quality (5/5)Durability (4/5)Wire length and tangle free(5/5)Sound quality (5/5)Microphone (4/5)Ear comfort (5/5)This product met my expectations....Thanks Amazon ❤️
5,"Love the sound quality, but moreover the services offered by this company are pretty amazing!I ordered these earphones about 9 months ago and one of the ear buds stopped working about two weeks ago, I read about their manufacturer's warranty, and registered my product on their site and filed a complaint. They, then, picked up the earphones from my address, and sent a brand new one to the same address in two weeks and free of cost."
4,"For a price of rs 400 it's worth the cost, i previously used boat bassheads 225, now i tried this for pricing it does the job.Pros,Easy fitNice qualityGood bassInbuilt micCons.It doesn't have a clip or dual coloured ear buds noraml black only.Maybe you should give blue, red colour like other products.The connecting cable will be flat unlike folded one, that quite difficult while playing games or youtube bt you figure it out gow to mangae itUpdateAfter 9 months one side stopped working and i have complained in their official website with downloaded invoice from amazon and the next day my product was picked and in next 15 days got newer one. For the 400 rs it lasted about one and half years that was good for the price and it has one year warranty compared to mi and realme 6 months warranty and you have to carry your products to their outlets.Note .While claiming warranty you have to upload invoice that has to be downloaded only in pc version as of now ,so login amzon account in seperate browser in desktop mode or use pc to download the invoice."
3,"I bought this in sept and I'm NOT SATISFIED with the purchase... Don't get me wrong, the sound quality is amazing for a earphone this cheap, but its flat... The bass kicks in only when there's too much bass in the music, else the sound feels very flat... Also the audio via the microphone is bad, and the mic is located on the split end of the cable, which is very low... At times I've heard people complaining that they cannot hear my voice clearly... Only for those who are struck with the price tag of 300-400rs... In that range its good, but if you can spend a 100rs more, get the basshead 225..."
4,"This is a very great earphone with a good quality sound, but it's not for rough usage! The sound is flat, so less bass in regular condition! But the earphone has got a very good frequency range. So still a deep bass is possible but with an equalizer. You can try my preset.  Also remember that the quality of sound also depends on your device's sound card."
5,I bought this earphone cause I had read in the reviews that they provide excellent after sales service and replace the earphone if any defect occurs. I had previously tried many companies earphones but in a few months always they would give problems. The sound quality and durability is amazing for the price. But due to rough usage one ear stopped working after 3 months. But the after sales services are amazing. They arranged a pickup of my old earphones and delivered a new pair to me after 10 days.Really happy customer
1,One of my friend has this product that's y I came for this product.  My idea is to by skull candy only but cos of my frd i came for this product. He s having good product but what I got is defective material. Actually i got this by last week at my work place. I got an emergency to travel so i left the product at my office itself. Yesterday I came and checked the product. It's a broken one. Yes it's broke at the connector area.  They hide it and deliver to me. While checking the product didn't work after full checking headset came into 2 parts. Kindly return my money back or send me a genuine product.
1,"After using it for less than one week one of the headphone wire comes from the Mic join point. It detached automatically. Yes, automatically. No pressure no pulling caused this. I did my registration and complain to their website. They sent me a ticket number through email and text message. I am so so disappointed ; don't know when pick up will happen and when I will get a non defective earphone. Such a horrible experience."
4,Got it for 400.  Okay for the price.
4,Edit : After two week of usage I realized that sound leaks from the earphone. So other people may get irritated.  Bought these earphones in a sale for 400₹. I have already used boat bassheads 225 and this time also boat doesn’t disappoint me. Here are my impressions: Clear output Quality build Low weight plastic build (I was disappointed with bassheads 225 since they have bulky metal build ) Great customer service Medium bass Decent microphone ( I didn’t face any problem during a call) Great designFor 500₹ I think it is overpriced. During Amazon sale and sometimes daily deals price drops to 400. You should definitely buy at this price. But MI basic earphones also comes at this price. If you are looking for clear sound quality you should go for mi basic otherwise for bass you should go for boat.
1,Sadly just 2 months and it is dead. the most sad part is it was sold with one year warrenty but within a month they refused to replace the item. total waste of  hard earn money.
1,"its been two or 3 weeks since i brought this item, it was working well for 3 weeks after i brought this item and then all of a sudden one of the drivers stopped working and i was like damn these earphones were made by a leading company how come they could have made such a unworthy product. and the main part is that the bass is not that good actually saying bad. so, i suggest everyone not to buy this product.  SPREAD THIS !"
4,"I haven't heard about this brand until my colleague told me about it when I was looking for earphones on Amazon. I ordered this pair after reading 80% good reviews on Amazon. It arrived within 48 hours thanks to Amazon Prime. The pair looks beautiful. The sound quality is surprisingly good for a below 500 rupees earphones. The only problem with the earphones is the fit, it doesn't stick to your ears when you are walking or running. I have to keep adjusting it every 5 minutes. Other than that, it is more value for money."
1,Volume button is broken in barely a month ! cheap product ... Not worth the buck
5,Just loved it and sound quality is awesome 😍😍 Mumbai Indian edition is the cherry to the cake😍
5,"Looking for earphones online? This may be the best choice for you.if you are a stock Android user or any user, this earphone provides the best hearing experience.I'm using this earphone since hours, but no pain in ears or head,  that means their ergonomic design really worked.The Black colour looks more classy then other colours , and its design is beautiful .if we talk about comfort.., do they well played here.,these are so comfortable .but we can purchase same audio quality earphone through the market , like ubon big daddy bass for less than 300 rs but the durabilty ,and comfort is not same as these earphones .Cable - cable is good ,it is tangle free and easy to handle.Design - impressive design , it doesn't fall from your ears even while running .Button - it provides a single button , but can fo many things with this single button if you are a android user .1. double tap to play next song .2. triple tap to play previous song .3. long press to access google assistant and directly apply operations4. single tap for play and resumeThe button is comparatively very smooth to press."
1,"Says on the pack extra bass. But no bass sound. So I installed a Equalizer in my phone and increased bass. Right earphone started giving additional ish ish sound at the end of each bass beat. The kind of sound you would hear if you increase the volume too high and the speaker diaphragm makes a sound out of extra vibration. I have used senheiser before. My toddler son  has habit of breaking things, so settled for this one. If you planned spend more. Just go for other ones. Not this product."
1,"Por sound clarity, we can't expected this type of poor quality from Boat"
4,Good sound  reasonable price
4,"Boat brand was unknown to me. I gave it a shot and bought these earphones after reading several positive reviews. For this price there are no other better earphones out there. First thing I noticed was how strong the connecting cables were, much tougher and sturdier as compared to other well known brands. The earpieces also fit tightly into the ears and seem on the harder side. They will never fall off from the ears. Sound quality is above average as compared to their next product in the hierarchy. Frankly the only missing part is the heavy bass.(this comparison is unfair as I also use Sony XB 550) Other than that an excellent product."
3,"Okay product. Will comment in 3-6 months regarding durability.These are supposed to be basshead earphones but I don't think they qualify - not at their price range.They don't really boost bass just amplify it and make the entire lower range frequency louder. As a result, if you go above the halfway volume mark, the sound sort of starts cracking and hurting ears. The problem goes away a bit when you tweak the sound settings. However, the range is small. If you optimize settings for bass, then treble starts cracking, and if you optimise for middle range sounds (can't really get a good treble), then bass starts cracking. Just not satisfactory for me.Of course, everyone's taste in music is different and their requirements from earphones are different. Obviously, I listen to everything from Opera and Death metal to bluegrass and hip-hop to rap and jazz to Punjabi upbeat songs and Ghazals. So this earphone covers only a fraction of all that and hence I do not particularly like them even for the price of rs 379 that I paid in the lightning deal. There were a few cheaper earphones that were much better than these and I only bought this because they were out of stock.However, if your taste in music covers a narrow frequency range and similar genres and you just want loud percussion sounds and don't care about much else, go for it.As for watching TV shows and Movies, earphones generally don't affect the experience that much unless they are too good or too bad. However, here too, I find that the sound gets annoying if the volume is too high and I cannot eat while watching because it amplifies the sound of my jaw too much. Plus it makes everything sound a little weird. But I guess the last part gets adjusted with use.All in all, I will try a different pair next time. I mainly checked the reviews and bought them because they were rated high on durability. If they break soon, then there will be no point in me ever buying them again. I will see how long they last."
1,"Felt like Cheap Chinese Headphones in some nice packing.Go for Sennheiser, I wasn't able to wear then single day.Pro - So Loud at full they can even bleed your ears too.Cons- High bass driven outshines the highs and the mids ( Vocals lie deep down that boom boom)- Not that comfortable to wear.- even design is So called hawk but it is not if comfort is considered.Choice is Yours."
1,Worst product ever. No bass no sound quality at all. If i get less than 1 star option i will give that.
3,I have lotsn lood Earphones. I have bass heads 225 as well. To be honest this one is for a more casual use in bikes and travel etc and there's the problem.the wires are actually not looking that strong and the lack of L pattern jack actually makes it a problem for keeping pockets jeans and riding a bike.Sound burn in is extremely important and no one reviews that way because everyone will just buy and plugin and give the reviews the drivers need to be calibrated for any speaker earphone headphone anything for a minimum of 20hrs. I have kept it on olaymode for more than 8 hrs now and this is really good. Bass is real good and serves the purpose very very well.Major points1.its not as sturdy as bass heads 225 is atleast in the feel.2.the look n feel is not premium again compared to 2253.why they didnt give an L pattern jack they only know and it sucks4.price point is great just below 400.5.most importantly the brand presence and service is great.Buy it if u r a basshead and also the vocals are great. I always listen to Arijit Singh Laal ishq from Ramleela for testing any earphone and headphone its superb... Butbuf u have a little more budget go for 225One small note for the bikers... This will be a great in helmet choice as bass heads 225 will be a little pain on the ears within helmet as it has a little longer metal ear cap vent.
1,"honestly saying, i was influenced to buy this product from my friend who is already using this product. i opted this over sony as this product is giving better sounds than that. i purchased this product and after few days of using, the left earphone started to give odd sounds. it actually giving symptoms of not going to work in future, exactly what happened within  days. it completely stopped working.i thought a product defect and applied for warranty (used for one month). then i came to know that the same problem my friend is also facing with the same earphones. his earphones also got the same wire issue.so i better suggest you to not buy this product.thank you."
5,Quality is very good & Need to improve printed logo Of Mumbai Indians or you have to write Mumbai Indians it's faint.
4,•  fast delivery and in good condition•  build quality or earphone is good and bass is excellent with this range• sound quality is good there is no pain in my ear even after continuously use or 1.30 hour
5,I got this product for 399 rs and its worthy.Tho it's not as comfort as other earphones in our ears it gives you nice music and base is okay.Its more worth than your money I'd say if you buy it for 399
1,"What I dislike about this earphone is its design. It is not at all ergonomic.There are some significant flaws. I write this, after having used Mi red phones which are in the same price range -300-400/-1. The ear buds are too small and don't give you that tight grip feel. It will fall off in the slightest of activity2. Position of mic: The mic is situated very low, at the point of intersection between 2 strings. It literally falls till you lower chest. So while talking on phone you have to hold the mic up manually near your mouth. In Mi earphones mic is placed near the right ear string, at a height near your face. That makes it easy to talk while earphones are on.3. The connecting cable at the point where you plugin to your phone is too long. That makes it prone to a lot of bending.This may cause early breakage.Having owned both earphones, I would recommend Mi over Boat.Voice quality is similar. Just above decent"
1,I bought it 3 months before was working fine suddenly it mic was not working I couldn't fond the reason I contact boat company even I have all my gadget from. Boat after my headphones u bought another one for my parentbut my one is stopped working reason is nothing the company is not ready for claim or warranty really upset the why I should go all my products with Boat so I stopped purchase it from boat
1,The product was very good for the first 10 days of my purchase but then after my calls getting disconnected automatically when headset is connected and few abnormalities happing when connected. Unfortunately the return date is expired. Don't know what to do.
1,Actually there is nothing in the product that can be appreciated..The product is promoted on the basis of quality of extra bass which is totally a fake promotion. There is no bass..and the sound quality is also very disappointed..Overall the quality of the product is very cheap and below average....An earphone of costing Rs 50 has much better quality than this product....Its my humble request to you please stop cheating customers through these fake advertisement and promotions......
5,"Just two hours into listening music on this headset, and it is really at par with many of the reputed brands..I have been a fan of JBL head sets but, this one is also is at par with it but at a lesser price.. started to like boAt as a brand and lifestyle products manufacturer. Even the shape of the ear buds is different than regular rounded shapes...Good to see some different shaped head set.Got this one during the sale on Amazon, and I feel it's value for money."
1,"Bass is not good. The sound is just like as chinese low quality product.There is no instant refund policy, first they will provide you replacement which is not useful. If not satisfied then refund for returns will take long time may be 15-20 days. The seller does not care customer."
1,I bought this headphones on basis of Amazon Rating. But quite disappointed with quality of sound.I have used many headphones and I would say this one is worst I have ever bought.More details given below -Prons -Only PriceCons -Sound quality is really worstNot comfortable fit for earsCan't listen that very small background music which can be heard on some other good quality phone'sEar buds are of low quality and not softI would recommend not to buy only on basis of low price. Pay slightly more but buy good quality headphones.Definitely NO Go ! Don't buy !
5,"I had been using this earphones from last 1  week. It' been fine. The deleivery for this product was on time. The product was not fully protected though there was only box and amazon carry bag. I would like to tell you guys its pros and consPros:-Sound quality is great.Bass is well1) Treble is ok, somehow it is diminished by 2) High tones3) Buid quality is ok.4) Design is good.Thats all pros now lets move to cons:-…Less than 2 months of usage one side already stopped working.Sound is OK, but what good a product that has no life. Couldn't find a way to replace as well.No extra strains applied, always kept coiled with velcro strap."
4,"It is a decent product from boat, decent bass treble is good.If you want to buy a earphone that explodes with bass don't go for this one, but if you want clear punch and drum sound... then you should definitely buy this as its bass doesn't blend with treble and ruin the quality...Overall the nice product if you'll consider the price also.... I bought this at 399. Also oneore thing I like about the boat is that it gives the warranty of a year so if product stop working you can simply go to product complaint site and upload the bill within a week they schedule a pickup and exchange your earphone unlike other earphone products where you have to courier them by your own."
3,"Material qualityThe earphones come with extra in ear plugs for choosing the right size for your ear. Those extra plush do not fit the earphone. Only the one that the earphone comes attached to, works. The rest of them are useless, there by throwing the size selection out the window.SoundPersonal opinion, the sound felt a little hollow, as if I was in a room hearing background echo. The sounds are very much different from all other earphones and over head headphones I have used.Also tapping the wire give you a tap sound in the ear. So if you are moving and the wire brushes against your clothing or hand, you get a disturbance in your ear. This is something I have never experienced earlier.The microphone and pause/play button works well.DurabilityOverall looks a bit fragile. Will wait on this to see if it lasts.In conclusionThe earphones do the job, a little compromise on quality."
5,Nice product...👍👍..
4,"It says 8 hrs but since I use this to watch lectures it gives more than 15hrs+ battery life.Sound quality is good, Highs & Lows are perfectly managed but to term these as Bass Heavy would be widely mistake.Overall 4 stars"
4,the base is really good. it a value for this range of money.i really liked it.only the comfort has to be more good.
1,"This product was had manufacturing defect inside the plastic band material,from which it is now broken out, that could not be visible during product receiving time period. Please do something for this automatic damaging, I wanted number of time to connect with customer care service but no any my call receiving by customer service. Please do the satisfactory advice to repair or exchange purpose because this product is under guarantee period. I was received this order on 14 May 2020."
2,"Edit: After 1 year of usage.The headphone starts developing cracks in the overhead plastic band, the padding on the earcups and head band started coming off. The boat logo has completely vanished (all this happened even after taking utmost care). The sound is still fine.Please be aware of the cheap plastic and poor built quality of the headphone. Instead of this you can buy Blaupunkt BH01 Eqz headphones which are the best at this price.PS. The gold plating on the AUX cable will come off creating much disturbance while connecting and listening to music rendering it useless.EDIT: The sound cut-offs are annoying during watching films or playing. You can't hear some dialogues at low volume.Honest review after 46 days of usage...PROS:• Good sound quality, vocals are crystal clear. Nice to see AUX cable bundled in the box itself.• You can get rich bass in Bluetooth and above average bass using the wired connection.• The ear cups are padded with good quality foam and faux leather, no pain on continuous use (Used it for 2-2.5 hours and was still very comfortable).• Value for money, Got it for 1099/- only.• Not Bass heavy but you can tweak settings to get good bass.• Good fit and design.• Good Battery backup, got 7 hrs+ on single charge. Full charge takes about 2-3 hours, the orange LED goes off when fully charged.• Build quality is good considering the price of the product.• Call quality is average (the speaker is not so loud). The headphone also tells the Caller’s Number during an incoming call.• The Latency is also acceptable at this price point.CONS:• On Bluetooth, when the volume is kept very low and the music has a very low pitch, sometimes the left-right speakers turn ON and OFF automatically. (It can be eliminated by keeping volume bar at about 50%, also no problem when connected using Aux cable). I saw this problem in boAt Rockerz 450 as well.• When kept at 100% volume the sound tends to get distorted. (Its THD-Total Harmonic Distortion is ≤5%, whereas most good headphones have it at ≤1%)• The aux cable seems to be too thin so be careful while handling it.• The earcups are not sweat resistant so take care of it."
5,Sound is very crystal clearBass is very pretty and goodValue for money
1,Bass is disgusting... Range is good but when I tried PUBG it keeps disconnecting continuously...Useless headphone...I returned it on the same day I received.
4,"Marvelous performanceIf you watch movies or series in Netflix,amazon or Hotstar this head set is perfect option Crysta clear sound may be not deep bass but you feel like theatre effect with perfect clear sound just go for it ....."
4,"Headphones are great but recieved the already used by someone headphones. Seal was broken and was reattached. Scratches were visible along side the earcups. Also when i watch something on Netflix, either the right side or the left one randomly keeps disconnecting and reconnecting Returned the product."
4,Nice
1,I have used it for 1 month after then the headphone literally breaked. Please My Dear friends a slight little push can break it. Headphone quality Is Cheap. Not for gamers. Dont Buy It
5,"Well I am writing this review after 6 months of daily usage. If you are looking for a headphone in mid range budget with awesome sound quality with a perfect bass then go for this.After my 6 months usage, I am totally satisfied with this product. The battery backup wonders me. After a full charge, if you use it 5-6 hours per day then it will last for about 4-5 days.The sound quality is also of high definition. Bass is also wonderful. Connectivity range is also good not very good. Just one thing with what I would like to say it Ok is its microphone . Microphone works well in noise cancelling but range of mic is some less.Overall you can purchase this product without any worries. I hope that you also will like it.I am regretting one thing also that is I had ordered black colour which I am not liking much as compared to other two colours"
5,Boat Rockers 310 is perhaps the best sounding product below Rs 1200. It's treble bass and volume up down functions are very good. The curved bar is soft and padded covered by leather. Once charged it can be used for 5 to 6 hours in Bluetooth connectivity mode. Aux cable and micro usb cable is provided as asseccory in packing box. A good choice to buy.
1,"Didn't last for a month... It just broke .. as you can see. As one moth is over Amazon won't take it back. Whome to blame here Amazon or boat company!!If you still want to purchase..... Then go for jbl and sony products. Atleast they'll last much longer than than this pathetic product. You may spend 500-1000 extra money, but it worth it"
1,"I have been a huge fan of BoaT and have been purchasing headphones and wireless-only from them since it is an indian company.But, i was let down on the above product. Within one month the thing is broken. The sad part is that, when I uploaded the invoice which was downloaded from Amazon itself, the company BoaT has send a message to me stating the invoice is not theirs. So weird!!!So, when it comes to faulty products they have funny excuses to say NO."
1,"Poor Basic Headphones. Highly Overpriced. Sound is normal, no special bass or noise cancellation. Build and look very cheap and basic. Buttons not strudy. Unnecessarily Big. Does not look durable. Initial reaction - Very Bad. Amazon do not return Electronics if unsatisifed, only option to replace. No use as did not like the product itself."
4,I would like to start with pro sound is good and battery life also goodNow the con's you can't use it on summer because it will heat up you're ear and you can't use it for long time because it will hurt ear overall I can say it's a good product but I can't use it on summer it's hurting my ear
1,Plz don't buy this product.. after using half an hour your ears will start paining. Instead on ads they should work on quality of products.it broke after usage of one month.totally wastage of money.
5,Super mind blowing
1,My ears and head stared paining. It's uncomfortable and the bass is also not good. The sound also bursts.
1,"No Voice cancellation in this product, for this cost, this is not worth product, Boat company is good in headset, but manufacturing such products will loose its brand image in the market"
4,Sound quality is no doubt a good point becoz of Boats company but i feel its Bluetooth connectivity is little bit pathetic sometimes it does connect with anybody else's phone and just make sure tht u have Ur phone very near 2 u otherwise there's a glitch which I heard from Google is dangerous due to the rays and I'll recommend u too charge even at 90 % battery becoz glitch starts to occur otherwise and yess it doesn't fall while exercising so that's a good point 2 me. Overall since 2 months usage it's been good and I keep it in its box only after usage and I got at a reasonable price so it's grrt fr me !
5,"After reading these reviews where some people really didn't like it and where some people loved it, I got really skeptical. I probably was about to cancel my order. But I got it anyways and It's so good. It fits my ears perfectly, it doesn't pain even after hours of usage. The sound is more than loud enough with enough bass and also has this really good theater effect. Kinda makes me look like a gamer girl not gonna lie lmao. But, anyways. So far my experience has been good. And yes it might be a little delicate but which headphones are not??? Just buy it guys don't fall for the bad reviews this headset is beautiful!!!"
4,"For the price of 1100 with bluetooth 5, its a 4 star product. Some flaws are there too. Made of plastic, so will easily degrade/break. The funtion keys only work on bluetooth mode not with AUX cable. Ear cushion not too great, after long hours it may cause pain in ears."
2,"This product has poor built quality there is no voice cancellation at first when I ordered it it was pretty well but it started giving me problems after few weeks it had problem in connectiveti with Bluetooth and in some calls it would automatically ends the call . It not at all good for gameing . It has a very poor noise cancellation fataliti . After few weeks it just broke by stretching when I was wereing it for use poor quality if you are buying it is only good for less use or it will start creating problem it has an average sound quality.it is not good for meeting ,classes, gameing  very bad quality recommended not to buy this product is very bad no noise cancellation facility very bad build quality so you should not buy this product .very bad product this by stretching it breaks so build quality is very bad it does not  has an noise cancellation facility and this auxillary works not very well so I recommend not to buy this product"
5,"Its very cool, stylish, and high quality hd bass...just superb"
2,Bought it almost 4 months ago.Works fine while using it with the aux cable. But while in bt mode the music kinda fluctuates in low volumes.( Either left or right cut off or both of them cut offs)Had it increase volume so that the music starts Playing again.Not so happy with how it sits on my head.Might look good but ergonomics are poor.The build is alos not that satisfying.Already had many hairline cracks.
2,The headphones are kinda good in terms of the audio quality and battery backup.......but the build and the quality of the headphones is not that great as the ones which I ordered broke like shown in the photo and this happened very close to the time I actually ordered it and started using it........I used the headphones as I would have used any other headphones but the headphones just came apart🤷🏽‍♂️
1,"Product broke after 3 months of usage.not happy.i have claimed for a return and am waiting for a response from boat team.though when I called the customer service and said that the issue with my complaint is that one of the bands is broken,they said they cannot help me as it is physical damage.guys I did not have a problem with the audio but it did break very soon.i don’t think I am going to get a return on this product so I suggest you to go for a different product"
3,"I am using this headphone from last 2 days, here's my experience -1. I got this one for 13992. Battery capacity is really good, 10+ hrs3. Sound quality is good4. Bluetooth connectivity is good5. The biggest problem is its ear cushions, they're really tight , you can't wear it continuously even for an hour"
1,"Don’t purchase any boat headphone from Amazon, that was duplicate product,there is number started with R printed on head band ,not present in this product..Side determination as L/R not mentioned over metallic bar over head band,no boat logo printed over apex of head band,lastly poor quality sound and bass,quality of cushion over ear cups was of cheap material.After returning that I purchased same model from Myntra,where all points I mentioned satisfied me…DONT PURCHASE ANY BOAT PRODUCT FROM AMAZON"
1,"I can't believe the experience I've had with these headphones, when they arrived, I was unable to activate the warranty for it even after following all the steps mentioned in the package. Just after 20 days one side stopped working but it would suddenly start and stop working from time to time. I tried calling a service station but no one would pick up and provide me with any assistance, after a month and a half, one side has completely stopped working and now these headphones are just a waste, I wrote them a mail as well to help me with this issue and got no response. Don't buy this product it's not durable at all and has basically no after-sales support."
3,"Pros1) Good Sound Quality with decent Bass2) Decent noice cancellation due to Tight earcussions.3) Great Aesthetics and Light WeightCons1) Sometimes there is no sound in one of the earcups2) They are not comfortable even for short period use. I ordered it specifically for online meetings but  they are uncomfortable and causes pain over ears in just 30 minutes. So forget long usage. Company claims these are""Ergonomically designed"". No they are not. It is designed such that if you increase headband size, they become more tight. There's no point of good sound quality if you can't wear them.Conclusion: Don't buy these if you looking for comfortable headphones. Buy these headphones only for their design. You can get same sound quality in other headphones for same price."
1,BOUGHT ON 29 MAY 2020. RECEIVED FROM AMAZON ON 1 JUNE 2020. MIC STOPPED WORKING ON 15 JUNE 2020.CUSTOMER CARE NUMBER ARE NOT WORKING. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. CALL ME FOR A FEEDBACK SUMEET 98101-98127
4,"This headphone is good for non-bass lovers. Like, if you don't listen to deep bass music, this headphone is good. Infact great..Rate:-Sound quality- 9.5/10Bass- 7.5/10Build quality:- 8/10Sound clearity:- 9/10Mic:- 4/10Total:- 38/50If you're buying for studies like me, then it is good option......"
3,It seems to have problem with bluetooth connection while playing audio. Sometimes I can only hear in one side and my other ear is silent. The problem often remains for a few seconds only which is good . Microphone has some problems while I'm using apps like Google Meet or Zoom. People on the other side has trouble hearing me speak. Sound is okay. Not too loud which I like. I tweaked the equaliser of my Spotify and the bass is good. Overall it's okay for now. Let's see what happens in the long run.
5,"Amazon has done amazing in getting the product early delivered, even on this period of COVID-19 Lockdown 4.0. Really Appriciable. 👏Boat is reputed brand and have a fabulious sound. Rockerz 370 (Green) looks attractive and have a very good sound with great quality. Go for it if you have a tight budget. 🎧"
5,This is a brilliant product but the fiting is a little uncomfortable on large or average size ears. But if you find a perfect place to waer it on ears it is a good chice. The bass is sooooo good and the volume is so high. The bluetooth connectivity is a lot quick than anyother product. Overall quality of the product is a lot higher than any other product
5,"I bought this to attend online classes of my college the battery life is very awesome i charge it once for 4-5 hours and it keeps working for more than a week, the quality of sound is nice but long hours of listening causes pain in ears which almost every headphones do,other than that best headphones, i purchased these at 999 in Amazon sale so at a big profit. Thanks for reading."
5,"This particular ser was not my first choice even though I wanted a set from Boat. But I settled for this when the other set was not available. Having done so however, don't have any regrets. This has great design, great ergonomics and most of all, absolutely rich and distortion free sound. Very happy with this and would happily recxomend it for everyday use!"
4,"Every product has a head and tail after it gets quality control check from the manufacturer. Heads you win, tails you lose. If you get a good piece you are lucky and if not you have to fight for refund or replacement. This is Universal procedure. For Rs.700/- you can not expect Bose earbuds. Even in high end items same head and tail formula applies. Now having said so my first piece was defective.I got replacement which is just good if not fine. Bluetooth connectivity is poor for this product otherwise rest of the functions are 4 star and if you still want a 5 star product you have to pay more for a higher quality product. For theatrical 8 D depth you can not expect that on a cheap portable device. You need soundproof and calm surroundings for that enjoyment.  I am in-depth music connoisseur and have tested all musical headphones, earbuds, portable speakers and home theater equipment.Comparing WeCool N1 to any such competitors at Rs.700/- is a deal.And to end my review I again repeat, if you get heads you are very lucky for the price you paid. Hope my review helps."
5,"Today i am gonna Share my Genuine Veiws on  WeCool N1 neckband which i have Purchased recently. I think it will be a Best Product For neckband loversPacking :The packing is perfect with neckband placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.inside contents :Wecool neckband,a small  cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).Look And Feel :The band is look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of flexible material which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.Buttons :The brick on the right side has the buttons.We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.Connectivity :Pairing it with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.Battery:The company has been specified about battery around 12hrs music playtime and 120 hrs stand by. it's giving more than12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.Sound quality :Sound quality in this neckband are amazing.The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .This neckband have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these buds are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office.

5,The nickband is really good for the price.It have great battery life and easy to use.The Bluetooth range is very good. The sound quality is very excellent and bass is too good. Noice cancellation is really good and voice calls are making clearly. Really this product is so valuable. I recommend it to as many people as possible.
5,"Likes the product very much, sound quality attracts very much, product flexibility is also at par. Easily connects into the bluetooth...very fast. 2 buds extra for the big and small size, total 3 in the box. Also in the hands free call function and magnetic locking earbuds, helps to prevent the neckband. Three buttons, volume +,- and power on/off. Easy to use. And on the otherside product branding."
5,"Wirelength is too long, battery back up is ok and can last for 1-2 days for a minimal usage without listening to music and just for calling purpose. There is no bass at all and I guess the overall could be improved. Not so good looking considering other brands available online. Voice calling is very clear and I had purchased for it for this purpose only so for me its working well wothout any hassle. I would say buy it only if you want to use it for voice calling purpose and little bit of entertainment."
4,"Review after 2 days. (My first ever Bluetooth earphone).Came with 70% charge. It has indicators -which is good.1 hour call- 100% to 80% battery.Means, hopefully 5 hours call time.Not more than that, Im sure.Signal reception is not the best.If you keep the phone in bag, the voice quality is affected (interruption/breaking).The earphone otherwise is of good quality.Not the premium level but above average.Functionally its ok.Flexible and foldable. So very convenient.Loudness is not bad. Would appreciate a little more though.Music quality good for the price.Dont expect the premium levels though.Lightweight and of proper size.The on-band switches are of good use.(Yes its plastic and feels 'plasticy')My primary use- calls and class, not music.For 700 Rs. its still not a poor choice."
5,"1st the delivery of Amazon is too good and then awesome packingThen comming to productThe experience of sound is really great we catch every instrumental sounds clearly and be joyful while listening and my rating is 4/5And then about bass, actually | expected too about bass boost but it not reached then that just good actually but | satisfied with that and my rating is 3/5Then build quality is also good with waterproof and sweat proof | liked it oneplus neversettle in build quality and my rating Is 4/5Then Battery is really brillint keka excellent really really really really really it's tooo good 10 min above 10 hrs of warpcharge full charge above 20 hrs it's really nice"
5,"Its light weighted and comfortable neck band.It charges in around 1-1.5hr and gives backup of around 7-8 hrs with stand by.It has magnetic buds but it doesn't works as a on/off function. I had to press and hold power button to power on/off.Sound quality is fairly good. There is lack of little bass but other things like treble,highs, low were decent.Its build quality is good but quality of the plastic casing is not up to the mark it gives the feel of cheap plastic.I feel wires are also vere delicate but are strong enough.But what you can expect in such a low price.For me audio quality matters while calling, other person was able to hear me clearly so audio reception is also good.The feature which I like the most is its pairing one. Once its paired with my mobile. It connects instantly with in a second whenever it powers on.Overall its a decent neck band with good audio quality."
5,"i am surprised with this brand. this is the first time i am using this brand and it totally stand upto my expectation. it is a wireless neckband with battery backup of around 6 hrs of continue uses and approx 20 hours if i use it just for calls and meetings. sound quality is good, could have been better, but no complains considering the prize range. connectivity is fast and can be easily paired. I use this while travelling and its super comfortable and easily blend in with outfits. Overall a perfect music and travelling companion."
5,"It's surprisingly good. These are good music Bluetooth earphones. Magnetic earpiece makes it a perfect choice. Don't buy this if you particular to rich deep bass music. But if it's a basic wireless headset that you want, without too much complexity, then this is the one. I highly recommend it. Easy to pair with any brand mobile phones. Battery backup should be more than 6 hours straight. I have used it for 6 hours continuously without low battery notification. Mic quality is pretty decent. The middle portion of the strap is thicker and flexible giving good grip too around your neck."
1,It is not a good product.I can't give zero star because that is not allowed.Sound and bass quality is very bad.You can't return the product ; only replacement available.I am not sure how others rated the product so high.
1,"Bought it based on the reviews. But, it's not a worth. Sound and bass quality are very poor. Bluetooth is working only for five feet distance. It seems the 5 star ratings are cooked up. And there's no return option.Dear Amazon, don't sell these kind of cheap quality, which can ruin your brand image."
1,"Sound quality... averageNoise cancellation.. poorest..Bass quality... poorestBluetooth connectivity very very very poor✍️ why people gave high rate review I could not understand,  very bad, because I totally denpands on reviews"
1,25 फरवरी 2021 को मुझे मिला इसे बापस 4 मार्च तक किया जा सकता था। 5 मार्च का इसने काम करना बंद कर दिया। अब इसे कैसे बापस करे।699  रुपये मै सिर्फ आठ दिन चला। बारंटी इसकी एक साल की दिखा रहा है। यह तो कस्टमर को लूटने बालु बात है
1,Waste of money Don't buy this.. Very cheap and bad sound quality.. spend someore money for better quality headphones... They also don't allow Return after purchase....
1,"Worst product, do not choose this even though less price. There is no option to return back.I simply ordered by see the old reviews/ratings. Looks seller manipulated all reviews... One good thing is it's less cost and Sound quality is fine.Issue with coverage and not working more than 1 meter distance. Even though it should be line of sight within 1 meter. It's almost like 1meter wired earphones or may be worst than thatGiving 1 star as there is no option to give negetive or zero."
1,Worst product which i have ever purchased on amazon..No noise cancellation feature. I read people review and then I bought this but honestly i think all the reviews where people said good excellent are totally fake comments.I Bought this and its deliver on time but quality of bluetooth connectivity was poor and when riding bike getting lots of issue on other end.Bluetooth connectivity is not god as well.My volume down button was not properly pushing so first i replaced this crap and then I return this crap. Honestly it is very bad product dont buy this.
1,"I bought it 2 days back. Sound quality is ok ok. The main reason I bought this is to use while walking or jogging.But when I keep my mobile in back pocket or bag, connectivity breaks. Also if I keep my mobile behind me, earphone doesnot work.As there is no return and only replace option, I have requested for replace expecting this is issue with this piece of earphone.Once I receive replacement piece, I will update my review.For now, I feel better for you not to buy this based on others rating.Even after replacement, I am facing connectivity issue."
1,First there was difference in left and right ear sound volume. And the replacement piece mic was not working. Sound is ok. For this price it's good if you get a working one.
1,"I don't usually write reviews, as most of the Amazon sells good products. But this time they proved me wrong.I don't know where to begin with. Ordering this product has been a mistake. First look at the product clearly suggests that it's made of cheap plastic. The control keys are not smooth to touch. You can feel the difference. Music disconnects rapidly while riding. Its as if the music is buffering with a low internet connectivity. At first I thought it was due to my mobile network connectivity. But using with internet turned off and playing the local library resulted in the same issue.Note, there is no refund for this pathetic, cheap and unreliable product. Save yourself from wasting ₹700.Pros:-Bluetooth connectivity is goodCons:-Cheap productConnectivity issues while playing musicNo Google Assistant supportLow bassNo voice controlBottomline, AVOID this product!!"
1,"After reading so many positive reviews I bought this headset. Turned out to be Rs 700 worth of crap. Sound quality is crap, bass is crap, people being called complain that I sound far away. On disconnecting the headset and using only the mobile they say it's fine now. Don't waste your money on buying such Chinese crap."
1,Dont buy this product it is not at all good .. not even a month I used it now it's not working. Customer care also not responding properly simply you ll waste ur money. And plz don't try to give feedback with one r two days take time n c how it a working then you people give feedback. Within two to three days you cannot judge the product. Others just view the reviews and buy the products even I did same but now I lost my amount. So please take time to rate the products. Zero rating is not there otherwise I would hv definitely given ZERo .
2,For music purpose its fine but for calling its too bad especially if you use metro or bus service .You wont be able to make proper call your whole journey because your sound wont reach to other person properly and this is is my second experience with this brand i first ordered earpods and returned them because of the issue and then i ordered this and thought this would work fine but problems still the same . Wont suggest anyone buy this if you use metro or bus service else its fine
1,"It is one of the worst product. It will start showing issues just after the return period get over. Bluetooth range is 5-6 meter  (open space) maximum when product is new. You can feel half meter drop every day. and at the end of returning period over, you will have 1 meter or less in BT range connectivity.Totally useless if you plan to use this with Laptop/computer.Don't go with misleading reviews. This brand have BT issue in most of its product.Battery backup is good.Sound is average. During calls, music, you will feel listening something very cheap."
1,It is not a good product.I can't give zero star because that is not allowed.Sound and bass quality is very poor. Battery also not holding charge more than 4 hour.You can't return the product ; only replacement available.I am not sure how others rated the product so high.
1,"It will work for 15 days and then boom! It just won't charge or even switch on. I understand, for such a price I cannot expect great quality but paying 700 bucks for this is also not worth it. The return window is closed and I have no other choice other than keeping this useless piece of wire. :("
1,"I don't like anything, from the first day I have to charge it 2 times means 4h it's automatically switch of over and again and doesn't on I m trying to return but they don't have a option of return I have to replace it and get same brand new product but it's already 4 days completed but still not replaced.... Totally waste of money and time....."
1,After 20 days is not working and disconnecting any time and when I tried to contact customer care but customer care is not picking the call not give an answer.
1,Battery life is good.Sound like a good.ButBluetooth connectivity sometimes disconnectedand phone & headset few distance away sound not clear.Headset in connecting with phone sometime music player pay on music sound not hear in headset is sound on phone. That time again disconnect & connect and then sound hear in headset.charging input got rust
1,"Hello.Is a very useless product .After two to 4 days of use, its battery Has become useless ..Now the it will take only one hour or two hours . I will request everyone not to take it .dont buy it. Its noise cancellation is absolutely useless, its sound quality is absolutely useless, bass quality is absolutely useless and battery backup is the most useless..Thanks #fazilkhan"
1,Connectivity is pathetic. So what is the use of other features. Do not buy. Connection is dropping frequently. Low range of coverage. Better go with Ptron brand.
3,OK ok product.. Not so gr8. Looks good.. Neck band is fine.. Bt does not have range.. We have to carry our phone always for the Bluetooth to function. Can't go for 10 m away from phone.. And Its not giving return option also.. Only replacement is available which I didn't expect in amazon. So pls be careful
1,The product did not meet expectations. The range of the earphones was less than 2 metres. Even within this range there is a lot of interference and noise. The wings are not ergonomically designed and are a pain in the ear!! I had also purchased DUMBEL Void 200 Sports Wireless Neckband in the same order and it turned out better value for money. I would recommend the latter as an option.
1,Most 3rd class quality i have ever seen. It's just 20 days gone while it's damaged internally. Whereas sound already blocked in one side. Even battery quality are too worst. This is not worthy of money at all. Should not buy to anyone!!!!!
1,Voice quality is very low ...Only 10 day working .Don't go for seller warranty they are cheater they don't reply about your concern.friend plz don't buy this product .Very very bad product .
1,Suddenly bluetooth disconnect.. Suddenly switch off.. Veste money..I suggest..Go brand.. Product..
1,"It hasn’t even been 24 hours of me using this and it already made me write a review, starting with the problem that the left earbud is the right one and the right earbud is the left one. Then comes the Zero-Bass. THERE WAS NO BASS AT ALL THE AUDIO WAS JUST SO CRINGE. THE BEST SONGS WERE MADE WORSE BECAUSE OF THIS PRODUCT, I AM INSTANTLY RETURNING THIS AND I SUGGEST EVERYONE NOT TO BUY IT AS WELL, I DONT KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE WRITING POSITIVE REVIEWS, ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING I LEFT, THIS IS SCAM IN A WAY THE MAIN THINGS WERE NOT THERE IN THE PRODUCT. NO BASS NO NOISE CANCELLATION NO NOTHING. ONE LESSON I HAVE LEARNT IS THAT USING THE FILTER “PRICE- LOW TO HIGH” WILL DO NO GOOD FOR YOU. THANKS FOR READING."
1,Worst product in Bluetooth connectivity. Its getting connected only when Bluetooth and device close to each other.. Don't buy this worst product
2,Ear pain after using these headphones.Bluetooth range is poorMicrophone is not good . It picks up surrounding ambient noises and less of your voice. Needs some tuning.Battery backup is GoodMusic is also OkSupports connecting simultaneously to 2 devices - this is not mentioned in product description but it stays connected to both my laptop and mobile and can be switched easily between them.
1,"Waste product I've seen, it is not working  in 15 days only and coming into process of warranty is also waste, because to claim warranty we need to ship to there address and if they see , and think it's eligible then only they replace it nor again we need to take charges for delivery of that product"
1,"I first owned a Bose QC35, however, I felt Bose was not innovating in terms of sound control and technology. This led me to buy the Sony WH-1000XM2 which I used for over a year without any trouble. I was completely happy with them. When Sony released Sony WH-1000XM3, I took the plunge and bought them in November 2018. After a month of using them, I began to hear crackling noises from the ear cups. I ignored them thinking they were some issue with the Bluetooth connection. This issue pursued and the noises became so unbearable that when they randomly came up, I had to immediately remove the headset from my wearing. At this point, I decided to Google the issue and was shocked to see that this was a common issue in most Sony WH-1000XM3.Most of the above issues came up in the warranty period and most, if not everyone had their headsets replaced, however, the shocking part is that many complain that the issues persisted in the new headsets too. Looking at the bright side and the brand name, I was very confident that a new Firmware release would fix everything and just as I thought, there was soon a release, although the issue was not listed, I was hopeful. The new Firmware release did not fix the issue.I still could not get the headsets to the service centre, as I had a long journey coming up, I was considering to use them and then take them to service after my trip, only because the sounds were random and sometimes, they did not show up for a day or two. This was not to be and all of a sudden, the headsets died on me, they would show up in the connection but they would not respond or play music. I tried multiple devices with no luck. It was time to make a trip to the service centre.5th February 2019 (Day 1) I reach Pranank Electronics Sony Authorised Service Centre at around 10. The place is a mess and the receptionist was at her lethargic best, but I believe, she was not trained to handle customers. I asked if I could speak with a technician, when she heard my problem, she just asked for an invoice and my headset, registered a complain and assured me there was no need to speak with anyone as this is a 100% non-repairable product and I will receive a replacement in 7 Days. Feeling upbeat about what she said, I left and went about my business.6th February 2019 (Day 2)I call up Pranank Electronics Sony Authorised Service Centre as a follow up as, on hindsight, I did not believe something could be so simple in India. I spoke with the same lady and she put me on hold and asked their technician about the status. She confirmed, the Sony WH-1000XM3 was dead and a request for replacement has been placed. I asked her if they needed to send this dead Sony WH-1000XM3 for a replacement or if the replacement will arrive without this process being done.12th February 2019 (Day 7)I call Pranank Electronics Sony Authorised Service Centre and was told they did not have an update for me. They asked me to call the Sony Toll Free number. I visit the website and raise an escalation case using my job number. I receive a response within hours. I also get a call from Pranank Electronics Sony Authorised Service Centre mentioning they had a call from their regional office and that they were being pressurised into trying different firmware's, the technician who spoke with me also mentioned that they are preparing an internal firmware which did not have a public release yet and wants to try that and see if that will fix my Sony WH-1000XM3. I was shocked to hear that everyone was working hand in hand and I was told, the local guys were getting pressure from above to keep me at bay. This really is a trust breaker on a brand such as Sony, I bought my Sony WH-1000XM3 for around Rs. 30,000 and after facing issues and bringing a dead set within 90 days and here we are where they are trying to just about make it work and give it back to me.22nd February 2019 (Day 18)As I was travelling for the 10-day gap, I could not really get in touch with them and neither my local service centre or Sony tried to get in touch with me to give me an update. I called Pranank Electronics. The technician was nice enough to inform me that the effort to not give a replacement and fix the existing one was still on. Now that they determined the problem was a faulty motherboard and they were waiting to determine the part number so could order it in. I have no words to describe this deceit. On one hand, I was told that this is a non-repairable item by every person I spoke to representing Sony and on the other hand here we are where they are trying every possible manner to just make it work and dump it on me.I write to Sony, but no response. I explain that I do not want a repair and want a replacement.23rd February 2019 (Day 19)I write to Sony, but no response.25th February 2019 (Day 21)Sony writes back acknowledging that efforts to repair the item are no longer in place and they have placed an order for a headset. We would like to inform you that, we have placed an order for headset and we are arranging the stock from our sources. We assure you that care is taken to ensure the service as early as possible. We assure you that care is taken to ensure the product is delivered as early as possible.6th March 2019 (Day 30)I write a follow up as it has been over 10 days since they placed the order. I begin to wonder if they are looking for a refurbished piece of junk to dump it on me.No response.8th March 2019 (Day 32)I write to them. No response.12th March 2019 (Day 36)I call Pranank Electronics but no one picks up. I try thrice over an hour, but no one picks up. I call Sony on their Toll-Free number. The person picks up, does not apologize, treats it just like normal. I ask when I will have my headset and I am informed that she will expedite it and I will get the replacement headset by the end of this week, which will be  16th March. Sony also has an online option to find the status of the job which is literally useless and give random results. At the moment, it displays that the product has been serviced.14th March 2019 (Day 38)I received a call from Pranank Electronics informing me that the replacement has arrived and I can pick it up. It has to be seen how this replacement works or if they have given a brand new set or a refurbished one.15th March 2019 (Day 39)Upon reaching Pranank Electronics, I was shocked to see that there were massive letters written with a sketch on the box of the headsets. I was under the assumption that these were new. To my surprise, they had repaired my headsets and were giving me back my headsets and not a replacement as promised right from day one. I called the manager of the store and he had no clue about this replacement promise that his staff and the sony centre had made. I called Sony care on the toll-free number. The person who picked up the call had no clue what was going on but did acknowledge that a replacement request was placed. I explained and refused to take the repaired headset, he asked me to hand over the phone to the service centre staff. I had no idea what he spoke but he finally told me that I will be getting a call from the service centre and that he was escalating my case with utmost priority. I was terribly disappointed.I am not sure how long this will go on for but I am having a nightmare with these, the reason I refuse to take a repaired headsets is because of their short lifetime and also because I was explicitly told that these were a non-repairable product and somehow they have repaired them."
5,"This is my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones! So NOT AN Expert opinion :P-) Noise Cancellation is like using a tight In-Ear headphones But this is more comfortable-) This will block external noise like AC, FAN, Rain etc. Block means not 100% but 80 to 90%!-) If you play music! You will not hear anything from outside world! (As I said an In-Ear headphones do the same but it will be slightly painful)-) A tight In-Ear headphones are not a replacement for Built in Noise Cancellation! I just point it out to the people who never experienced a Noise Cancellation headphones in life. This Noise Cancellation is Another level. You will only believe it when you actually get a chance to use it. NO YouTube reviews will give you the real experience.This Noise Cancellation Headphones is useful WHEN- I watch youtube videos / tutorials- I write code- I brainstorming- I travel- I go to bed and hear some songs before sleep- I need to disconnect from the annoying world! around me :)Battery life is really good. USB-C means one less cable, Fast charging is good!, Touch control is awesome, if you put right hand to right ear cup you can come back to the world you are in. it is a huge plus, when mom are dad call me! all I need to do is put my hand on the right ear cup!Overall this NC Headphone Improved my life! Here is how.- Now I can focus more on my work- Less distraction from external noise (It is not 100% But 99% of the time it is 100%)- I hate travelling because of the the sounds and noise will influence my thoughts, I actually waste my time while travel because of that. yes a good In-Ear earphone can help but this is another level. So now I can actually do my stuff in my own world using this Noise Cancellation Headphones!Value?Yes -- if you have 30K to throw away. And it will not hurt your life in any way.No -- if you need to save money for next 12 Months to get this.Sound Quality?Base is there! If you are looking for that.But the nice thing is Sony's EQ can Adapt! That means anyone can change the Sound Aspects according to there needs from the Application. Out of the box it is perfect for my taste!If someone like less base you can change that through EQ.No product is perfect so in this Model what to improve?- Only once device can be connected at a time. (Minimum 2 devices is required now a days! [eg Laptop and SmartPhone])- User replaceable ear cup cushions!- Call Quality. This Headphones have an array of microphones but when when we call someone they will hear all Background Noise. I used it for some VOIP calls, It is usable but built in Microphones on your phone will do a much better job.- More and improved NC! Yes why not. There is always room for improvements.^^ I really don't know what to write as cons.I will Update this after using this for a week or two. bye.﻿"
5,Just received my 1000MX3 . Just as you would expect from Amazon. Everything was perfect. Burned just four songs from my Apple Music playlist. That was all that was needed to make my decision. I have been using my QC 35 since the last year or so and used to use it a lot for streaming . I and my wife have a completely opposite tastes in TV Viewership therefore one of us uses the headphones. Noise cancelling is hands down better than QC 35 and sound quality is also better if just slightly so . The feature of allowing outside sound while keeping a hand on one of the cups is also very good. This is my very first impression. Maybe I’ll follow up with a more detailed review after using it more . For now I’ll say that if you’re confused between QC 35 and 1000Mx3 I’ll say go for the Sony
5,These are my initial thoughtsThey definitely look premiumSound Quality is quite impressive even at full volume doesn't distort.You will hear so much more of a song beacuse of the clarity.I am using Saavn to play music at 320kbpsNoise Cancelling is great but will still have to use it in real scenarios.Ears do feel a bit warm after sometime  but I think Mumbai's humid weather is probably to be blamed.Overall extremely excited to use themI would highly recommend these over the Bose QC35s.
4,Likes1. Great sound quality2. Amazing battery with fast charging(Type C).10 mins of charging led to 70% battery3. Comfortable to wear and Noise cancelling is great4. Bass can be controlled via connect app.In bose qc 35 there is no bass so +Point for sony5. Premium look and touch works perfectly fineDislikes1. Expensive but worth it2. Thumping sound is heard when touch is used.
5,"These are much better than Bose QC35-II. In terms of features, noise cancellation, App, Sound, battery backup, these are way ahead.  I do not own the previous  M1 or M2. I have been wanting to get these for a long time. At last, this version is the perfect one and bought it immediately.Pros:Great Sound QualityGreat Noise cancellationGreat features10 Min charge 5 Hrs playbackComfortable and no issues for long hours (At least for 3-4 Hours)As always you've the option to use the regular 3.5MM audio Jack as wired headphonesCarrying CaseUSB Type-CSony Headphones Connect App lets you tweak a lot as per your likesCons:Not good at Calls. You've to talk loud and sometimes your voice gets muffled to the other person who is talking to youNot able to connect 2 devices at once.Gets sweaty or little hot over ears after 3-4 hoursIm getting about 20-25Hrs of backup with ANC on 60% volume."
1,"I have to mention the satisfaction rate for this headphone dropped from absolutely satisfied to absolutely disappointed. Because to begin with I was quite happy with the spot-on features and enigmatic sound quality. However, quite quickly situation changed for the worse and within two months of usage, I’ve started to experience reduced volume on the right side headphone and noise cancellation has gone for a toss and is behaving as if it has a mind of its own, it is producing blurring noises on it’s own, perhaps in an attempt to cancel ambient noise. On the sound quality front, I wish to mention I am a purist and user of Apple Music, therefore I can safely say when there is some deterioration in the level of sound quality, more often than not, I am able to notice it. These headphones which are positioned by Sony as a market leader for their brand in this product category, has sadly started to produced a crackling sound on moderately high volume, more of a distortion, especially on songs with deep bass frequencies. This is something one may most probably notice on cheaper headphones which can’t handle a full-band of frequencies at play I believe. To conclude, I am highly regretting my decision of choosing this over the Bose QCIII, I wish I bought that."
1,"If you want to feel miserable about the amount of money you've put into these , sure go for it. Everytime you stretch the bands to put these over your head you are greeted with this annoying noise. It's sad to know the Sony has not done their due diligence on these cans.Everytime , almost everytime you stretch the headphones and you feel bad for yourself and the money you've put into it."
1,In call voice quality is terrible. Also couldn't connect with NFC. NC is good but is over hyped. Disappointed at this price point.
5,"I pre ordered this from Amazon on the 12th of October and received the product on 22nd after launch on 18th. Others from normal orders received it before me. Don't ever trust Amazon with pre-orders, no one there knows what pre order ACTUALLY MEANS.On 24TH OCT (2 days later) I noticed a weird noise kinda faint static on the right ear cup when the ANC turned ON. Returned the defective one and got the replacement on 26th October. A lot of others have reported this issue. This is defect is on few devices. Think of it as a minor annoyance. But even with the defect I was excited each time I used it.Keep in mind that this noise is so faint that you have turn off music to be able to notice. For me it was on the right ear cup, but people have reported this noise from either of ear cups.Apart from XM3, I have both Sony XM2, BOSE QC 35 II. Xm3 hands down the best in NC Performance. The sound quality is great, it's bass heavy (compared to the 2 above) so I like to listen to XM3 more than bose, which sounds flat and doesn't get you immersed. For context: I listen to heavy metal and rock music. The customizer in the app is awesome. Sony just sounds better than bose, maybe partly also because of hi-res audio, more HD  Codec support like LDAC,  SBC ETC.Mic and phone call performance on M3s is on par with bose. Bose is better. But XM2s were worst. I take calls from noisy environments like co work space, open parking are zone with wind gushing, in cabs in bus, etc others never complained one single time about my voice being inaudible.When you open the device it comes with 100 percentage battery charged. Sony is great, come XM2 AND BOSE, comes with 70 percent. One weird this is if app is not connect and registered it the devise says low battery even though it's fully charged.So I typically use bose when I work at office as daily driver (as it also has multi device connectivity).M3s have come a long way on comfort, and now the only con with xm3 is that my ear sweats a lot, this doesn't happen with Bose quietcomfort. I like the love the gesture controls on M3 more than button on bose. I wish there was way to lock down touch to limit unintended touch triggers.Wrt to battery life is AWESOME. One really can't ask for more. There is no standby battery discharge, my observation over 5 days of no activity. The auto off does not work because any one device is always connected.On the build quality, I like bose better. Honestly, this is the only area I like bose better.Closing thoughts, Bose is my daily driver because it allows me to connect with Mac and phone same time. I can swap and connect calls easily. Also the sound signature isn't immersive, allows me to work even when the music is on. XM3s for me are the special ones, I use them for the special 'me' time. When I am looking to just enjoy music.PS. I am a developer / maker of Story Stream a platform to publish and stream immersive audio stories narrated by RJs and Voice artists. Story stream is live on Alex and coming soon on Google assistant devices. I use these headpphones for testing my apps ;) (if you have Alexa, you can enable Story Stream from the store)And that's the only reason why I have 3 expensive headphones. If I had to pick one, it's will be XM3 in a heart beat, even though it a good 15days old now, I get excited everytime I pick it up from the case to wear! Even though the bose is newer, I don't get as excited.If you have the budget, go for it. I can guarantee that you will be very excited about using it each time you put it on. This comes from some one who got a defective product, I swear even with the defective piece I was so excited about using it each time till the replacement arrived. Honestly Sony has done a tremendous job on XM3."
1,"Here's an honest review:I read a lot of praise about this product online and decided to go for it. I really tried to like it, but the ANC caused a weird pressure drop inside the earcups. It felt like my eardrums were being sucked out.I feel that the level of comfort one would have with ANC would depend on the strength of their inner ears. It is a great product & ANC works like a charm, but do bear in mind that many users on Reddit have reported feeling nauseous and having ear discomfort on using ANC.No point in spending 29k on a pair of headphones that I would have to spend time and effort getting used to. It may feel normal for others, but ANC isn't for me :("
1,"Overall, no headphone is closer to these in the market .. I used Bose & Sennheiser they might have natural sound but their ANC hurts.. When you wear these with NC on you feel nothing in the brain its just crisp, bassy & noiseless sound.5/5 for being the best in the market ..3/5 for battery life which I feel gets affected after updates & Alexa support ..Durability 3.5/5 why? .. because they are expensive Rs 30k .. you need to be careful while in the bus or train .. as people tend to accidentally fall on you when the moving transport stops also you could hear a popup in the bass when jerk happens .. sony should fix that next time.. happened to me twice & they are not water resistant so be careful in the rain .. always carry the case .. they also feel heavier in comparison to Bose qc 35!!"
5,"Reached before 12pm today on 19th. Awesome delivery service by Amazon and Appario retail.My first NC headphone and in fact  my first over the ear headphone .  Wanted a headphone with ANC so that i can hear good music even at very low volumes. This does achieve that to a large extent.Sound quality and isolation is good even without ANC turned on. What's really commendable is that the audio with the 3.5mm wired connection in the passive mode (i.e with the headphone switched off) was also quiet decent. Do note that with the wired connection you can still switch on the phone and  enable the ANC  but the app however  remains disabled .App works only when the Bluetooth is active .Found some issues  with the app. Since app is just a softwareI hope it would be updated soon  so not reducing any star . When we try to change mode from ""priority on sound quality"" to ""priority on stable connection"" and vice versa then the music stops and doesn't restart. If you want any equaliser changes these are possible only with ""priority on stable connection"". Further many times the app just forgets your last settings of Equalizer or surround sounds and just defaults to native options. Overall the app just doesn't appear premium like the headphones and is buggy. Seems the app development team was taking a nap while the hardware team was burning the midnight night oil. Comfort is good .Don't have any benchmark of BOSE so can't compare. Even tried to lie down with the headphones . Possible  if you use a pillow and want to lie sidewise. You cannot do it on regular basis but the intention was to try to see if it's possible occasionally. So I hope it should help in train journeys for masking loud snores of fellow passengers , khat-khat sound of train and getting good sleep.  When trying to do this test in my home I actually fell asleep :). The can fits into the pocket b/w pillow and the shoulder. Of course it's not a perfect fit ( like  you are not wearing your headphones at all )  but still it was possible by adjusting yourself.The touch controls do tend to get accidentally touched in this case,  say by your biceps or elbow . I hope in future updates Sony gets an option to disable/enable the touch, say by pressing both the power and the ANC button for some time.Touch controls do sometime tend to disobey you but still not a very big issue. The touch control  also responded when I tried to use a thick cloth but somehow  very not predictable.  Tried this to emulate the gloves in winters.The pad foam  do tend to get a little sweaty after around 2hrs and had to take the phones off for a few minutes . Currently the temperature is around 28deg. The phone pad foams should work very well for winters but it appears that in suumers they would tend to get warm and sweaty in case worn for long time. No comparison with Bose so can't compare relatively.ANC is good but for the first time users it does tend to create a in cabin pressure feeling. I however got accustomed to it in few hours. Thankfully there is an option to control the level of ANC.One thing I would like to mention about ANC . I tried testing the ANC with a 1500w mixer grinder and a 2000w vacuum cleaner as well. Don't assume it would mask the sound totally. I could still hear the whine if the motor very well. If you clap your hand you can still hear a thud  but all these sounds with the music on would be muted by 70-80 percent and  won't disturb you. This is just to align your expectations of the ANC. But ANC is still awesome and it would take some time to realise how awesome it is .  I was hearing coldplay at very low volumes with and without ANC , with the water tap on at full speed  ; the difference was phenomenal. And if you like cranked up volumes then of course the ANC would be even more effective.Battery is very good . Even after 3 hours of mixed  listening  on Bluetooth it was showing as 100percent. Sound quality is good and you can customise the equaliser for two of your own choices also . Bass can be tuned very well. I wish the settings got saved in the headphone rather than in the app.The music doesn't stop if you remove your headphones. Thats strange since this feature is present even in lower models like plantronics backbeat pro available,  at 11k.Regarding call quality,  I switched on the vaccum cleaner and made a call to the other party. They never complained about not hearing me. What I have found is that , unlike in some web  reviews, when making calls the ANC does remain active and the ambient noise doesn't  reach your ears or the other  person. May be the software has been tweaked since those reviews.  However it does appear as if you are talking with your ears covered by hand.  So you have  get to get used to that feeling . Overall found the call quality to be decent .If you have a balding head like me the phones tend to slip a bit :( which is just physics  . But hairy heads won't have this issue.Nevertheless I am enjoying it :)"
3,1. Noise cancellation is overhyped. Its good but please do not keep very high expectations. It blocks 40 percent of the surrounding noise.2. Sound quality is awesome. Very good bass.3. Sound is not very loud. There should be one or two more level to increase the music volume.3. Touch control works very well.4. They look premium and are light weight.5. Couldn't charge it with OnePlus 6T charger but nokia 8.1 charger worked.6. They are not very comfortable to wear specially if you wear glasses or you have cervical problem.7. Within 10 mins of use you can feel the sweat around your ears. Actually earpads heat up a bit while in use so you cant wear it for long in indian summer.8. My product had a very poor battery life. It last 6 hours after full charge so definitely the battery was poor.9. Warranty card was missing in the packet but packing was good.10. Usb cord provided for charging is of 8 cm length only. I think it is okay. But there is no type c adaptor provided within the box.11. Google Assistant support is awesome and useful.12. Bluetooth connectivity is okay.15. Sony headphone app is user friendly and a must to have.16. Overall I don't recommend this headphone at a cost of rs 30k.
1,"I have been using Sony 1000MX3 Since Jan 21 2019. There is manufacturing defect as the quality of holding clip highlighted in the pic broke off even after careful use of the headphone within 4 months. I had reported the issue in April 2019 and subsequently visited the Sony service center in Chembur mumbai in May. The service center denied to accept the job work and took photographs to confirm to coverage in warranty. They were suppose to revert back on the status of coverage of warranty but the failed to respond. After couple of months on hassles, I went again to the service center after I getting confirmation from the support center that they will accept the headphones for repair. On JUNE 27th, I have given my headphone to the same service center. Below are the Job details. Its been more than 45 days and I am promised that next week the job will be done as the part is not available in inventory. I want my Money back or a new headphone as replacement as the product is broken due to manufacturing defect of using low quality plastic and thin clip. Horrible Service Quality."
5,"Awesome pair of headphones. I tried Bose QC 35 before buying this beast. I want to say that anyone can buy it without even a second thought. Sound quality, Battery life is superior compared to Bose. Confort is same on both. I have weard this headphones for more than 5 hours without any problems. Battery last for more than 30hrs if we turn off noise cancellation. Sound quality is great and it gives that punchy bass which people like me loves most on Sony headphones. Also we can adjust sound using the given equalizer on App.I have noted couple of points during my usage1. We cannot connect multiple devices at same time, which is a biggest thumbs down. We need to manually reconnect devices each time. I think Sony can change this behavior using a software update.2. We cannot use One plus fast charger to charge this headphones even the Sony manual says we can use any charger whose current output is greater than 1.5A. The recommended charger output range is 1A-2.5A, which I confirmed with Sony. So I am charging it with my flipkart Smartbuy charger.3. To get LDAC sound quality, we need to change one option in Sony headphone app, where we can select maximum Sound quality or stable connection. There we need to select Sound quality. If your smartphone supports LDAC, it will automatically switch to LDAC mode."
4,"Who are these for?Casual listeners will love the Sony WH-1000XM3, as it offers a huge boost in sound quality over general consumer headphones when used with Bluetooth. Commuters will appreciate the excellent noise cancellation offered by these headphones, best in the market.Very rarely will I say that a set of headphones is for “everyone,” but active noise cancelers that are comfortable and sound as good as the Sony WH-1000XM3 fall into that category.They perform well on commutes, flights, and just out on the town. Generally, these are headphones for everywhere but the computer… and even then they’re not bad if you’re not deep into the lossless audio game.Despite being largely identical in many ways to the older Sony WH-1000XM2, a few upgrades have made the brand-new WH-1000XM3 a better buy for the long haul. For example, the ear pads are deeper, and the addition of USB-C charging.I’m not sure that these tweaks are completely worth upgrading for if you already own last year’s model, but if you’re buying a new set of headphones: these go a long way to setting Sony’s offerings apart from Bose, Sennheiser, and AKG.Probably the best thing about the headphones is that you rarely ever need to use your phone to control your music. Once you’ve got the headphone app installed, you can easily navigate playback with swipes of your finger (forward, backward swipes), adjust the volume by swiping up or down, and activate your voice assistant with a long press. Initially, that assistant was limited only to the default one on your phone but the company has recently announced an update to the headphones that will give them full compatibility with Amazon Alexa as well. All you have to do is update through the Sony Headphone Connect app on your smartphone and you can choose whichever virtual assistant you want—depending on what smart products you have in your house, or simply which one answers your questions better. Additionally, you can temporarily hear the world around you by cupping your hand over the right ear cup, which makes the headphones use their external microphones to pass your surroundings on to your ears. This is great for when someone needs to tell you something, or for plane announcements.Are the Sony WH-1000XM3 well built?The chassis of the WH-1000XM3 is the same hard plastic as its predecessor, though there isn’t any fake plastic leather over the ear cups anymore. Instead, it’s now a soft-touch material that your fingers can easily glide over. At the top of each ear cup are two wide microphones that collect data for the noise-cancelling unit to destroy outside sound.Battery life-Battery life is great on the Sony WH-1000XM3, lasting 24 hours of constant 75dB playback… with maximum ANC running. This is an absolutely stellar result and should keep you protected from the outside world for long trips.How do the Sony WH-1000XM3 sound?Great, really. We’ve come to a point in wireless headphones that most of the big gripes are gone, replaced by minor ones. For the Sony WH-1000XM3, the sound is quite good, bolstered by the fact that they target a very consumer-friendly sound by default. The main takeaway here is that the headphones target a consumer sound, with emphasized bass, a little bump in the mids, and a peek at about 10kHz.It isn’t for audiophiles looking for lossless listening, so I feel like I owe you an explanation. Sony’s headphones really are best in class here, but they’re not perfect. The LDAC codec is certainly impressive by many metrics, but only when you can get the 660 or 990kbps modes. Weirdly enough, the 330kbps default connection is worse than SBC in some ways, so you may find you should dive into the developer options in your phone to lock the WH-1000XM3 into 660kbps just to be sure you’re getting the best of what your headphones have to offer. The 990kbps mode may be tempting, but for me, 660 is a great middle-ground that still exceeds my hearing capabilities.BassBass is heavily emphasized in the LDAC and default SBC modes, but you can change this by using Sony’s app if you wish. However, you may elect to keep things as they are to really feel the bass in recordings that underplay it a bit. You may find that engine noise masks a bit of the bassline and bongo thumps to the one and only recognized version of September.Mids and HighsMids take a bit of a backseat to the bass if you use the stock LDAC connection without swapping off to equalize your music. You may want to turn the bass down a bit if you’re jamming out to old Queen records.Is the Sony WH-1000XM3’s mic any good?Usually, microphones are pretty terrible on headphones, but the Sony WH-1000XM3 is the exception to the rule. While the nature of transmitting audio still means that quiet sounds might get amplified in order to mask shortcomings of the power situation, the actual technical capabilities of the microphone are quite… okay. However, it doesn’t combat the proximity effect very well, so your voice will sound bassier than it usually might.I will mention that the microphone doesn’t do so well with outside noise rejection, nor does it mitigate something called the “proximity effect.” If you have a super bassy voice like mine, you may find that phone calls are a little annoying with these headphones.Should you buy the Sony WH-1000XM3?A gadget that costs Rs. 24000 might sound like it’s too expensive, but it’s really not for all that it gives you in return. A really good set of active noise-cancelling headphones is worth its weight in gold, and the Sony WH-1000XM3 is among the best out there. Newer headphones offer some interesting ANC features like the Jabra Elite 85h, but only the Shure Aonic 50 goes toe-to-toe with the raw ANC power of the WH-1000XM3. Even if it’s not technically very different than its predecessor, that’s okay: all the WH-1000XM2 needed to be truly great headphones were a USB-C charging port and deeper ear pads… which the WH-1000XM3 provide.Active noise cancelers are the rare headphones that work well in just about any situation, and that’s why they’re so valuable. You’re not going to enjoy listening with high-end open-back headphones on the subway, after all. The Sony WH-1000XM3 are the perfect travel buddies with great battery life, solid sound, and a price point under its main competitors.Additionally, you may want to wait for the Sony WH-1000XM4 to hit the shelves, as they’re coming out soon (allegedly). When that happens, you’ll have the option of grabbing the WH-1000XM3’s replacements or grabbing these headphones at a substantial discount.Pros and cons:-Pro: Solid DesignPro: Alexa EnabledPro: Solid Battery LifePro: Deeper BassCon: Plastic HeadbandCon: High Price.If you found this review to be useful, do mark it as helpful.Cheers!"
1,These are only good for noise cancellationi sent it back coz of following issues1.the ear pad cushion had lot of wrinkles and looked old2. the touch buttons are very sensitive and get pressed accidentally a lot.. even when lying down if it touches the pillow and often if your chin will touch the left side nc button the nc switches off3. noise cancelling was not holding and went off automatic after few mins4.during call there was echo and the voice gets amplified a lot and nc didnt work during callsso returned and bought bose qc35 2 and they are much better with physical buttons which doesnt get pressed automatically and noise cancellation is superb and works during call.
1,"It's good if you are using it just as headphone, but I am using with my Samsung S9+, and listen to music and if a call comes in between, people can not hear me, I have to disconnect Bluetooth and take the call. it's not worth this money and now the return window is over, I can not give it back, don't know what to do?"
2,"It has a lot going for it. But there are many niggling problems that make it frustrating to use and make you feel that perhaps this product wasn't tested properly before release.Cons:1. Ears heat up and causes sweating.2. The sounds isn't balanced. In Ambient noise cancelling mode, the balance is more to the left wherein the left ear cup gives you more bass gain. It gives you that feeling of the right side not working properly.In passive (non-ambient sound) mode, the gain is more to the right ear cup. What kind of a joke is this? This issue is not very prominent but you'll notice it. And once you do, you just feel like dumping these cans. You don't have this kind of a problem even with headphones that cost $10. Unbelievable.3. Can't pair with more than one device.4. Doesn't pair with a bluetooth dongle which I connected to my TV.5. Mic is pathetic. You wouldn't want to make calls with these. Forget about it.Pros:1. ANC is pretty good. Does a great job with white noise. But keep your expectations in check. Also, it doesn't keep out voices.2. App. The sound profile is bass heavy in its natural state but you can use the app to tweak it to your liking.3. Touch controls are a great idea. Don't work in the cold apparently.4. I find it convenient to plug and play these using audio cable. So this way I don't need to pair every time.5. USB Type C.6. Battery life is excellent.7. Ambient sound feature is a great idea and works well.They were somewhat over my budget but I still got them because they are Sony. But I feel let down by Sony. Could a software upgrade fix these issues? Will have to wait and see. The mic is a hardware issue so that's not getting fixed ever. This is further proof that you shouldn't listen to reviewers. All they care about is getting a review out ASAP for views.So overall, I wouldn't suggest you to buy these. I personally regret buying them. Spend your hard earned money somewhere else."
1,"The ProblemIt was about a few months ago that I started noticing a creaky noise from the right side of my WH-1000XM3 while listening to some audiobooks during a walk. At first, I ignored the noise as I thought it is due to my adjustments of the headband.I tried everything from removing my glasses to trying the tightest fit to get rid of the noise. To my disappointment, none of it worked.Visiting the service centre [4th July'20]I called in sony customer care who provided me with the phone no. of service centre near me. I reached out to ""iconnect"" in Gurgaon and tried describing my problem to him to which the response was that there is no need to explain to me the problem, just drive down to the service station. Surprised by the utter rudeness of attendant.I still followed the instructions and drove down to the service centre before 5 pm ( as I was instructed).I drove around 15 km to ""iconnect"" sony authorised service centre in Gurgaon. I patiently waited for my turn in an extremely warm service centre( The AC did not function). Interaction with the service centre employeeI started to describe the issue to an unengaged attendant who was still looking at his laptop screen.Me: I have been hearing squeaky noises from the right hinge of my headphones.He: ""Quiky"" without raising his head and continuing to look into his laptop.( As if the word was funny to him)Me: Excuse me!He: Yes, Sir.Me: The right side hinge makes noises even when the headphones are turned off. It is a workmanship defect.He: I haven't heard of such an issue ever.Me: But, it is an issue with my pair of headphones.He: We haven't been informed by Sony of any such issue.Meanwhile, my father started to record this interaction.To which the employee reacted aggressively that you can't record this. ( In an agitated tone)He said I won't serve you if you keep recording and left his counter.My father yielded and put his phone back into his pocket as we drove aa long way, the headphones were expensive and were going out of warranty in a few weeks.Finally, things moved forward, the service centre employee asked one of the technicians to look into the matter. We waited for another 40 mins. Meanwhile, the negative thoughts of getting my headphones messed up and with further damage crossed my mind as this place did not seem or operated professionally The Technician arrives with his analysis.The Technician: I have checked the circuitry and problem is not stemming from the electricals but is of mechanical in nature. I facepalmed myself and said to myself ""Exactly what I described, Why did you open my headphones""Next steps. The attendant spoke to a Sony employee and described him the problem over the phone & finally created a job sheet saying with the problem described as "" Abnormal noise from the right hinge even when the device is switched off""I asked him, what are the next steps, he said that he would let me know my Tuesday i.e 7th July'20 after he sends a video of this issue to the Sony Official. ( I am not too sure is the sound could be captured in a video effectively)Current status: I am patiently waiting for any update with the fear that I would be returned my old headphones which have now been open by not so professional service centre and might be prone to malfunction and since the warranty is near its end I might have to live with a product is further messed by the service centre.Update: 7th July 20The day I was promised that I would get to know what is the status of my service request.3 Sony call centre calls - Have committed me they have forwarded my concern to the service centre.5 calls to the service station- Either the some of the phones provided are always busy or out of service.I have no idea what is the status of my service request.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After calling the service centre for the 10th time they have finally replied that the headphones have been repaired and I can collect it. Which was informed to be non - repairable defect at the day of the first visit.The situation has gone bad to worse. Kindly help. I feel that I have been ripped off of my money by making this purchase decision. My request to SonyI have been a Sony customer & Fan for long, I remember our First coloured TV was a made in Japan Sony TV, which was a matter of pride for the entire family, Second was the iconic Walkman, then the flat screen Sony Wega ( I remember being mesmerised by picture quality I saw at the store), Sony Xperia U, Sony SRS-ZR7 and the latest WH-1000XM3.I believe the quality of service is the weakest link for Sony in India and this experience would deter me to move ahead or recommend Sony products to my friends and family with confidence. Kindly take this feedback and reflect on what kind of feelings do you want to invoke when a person hears the name ""Sony"". Should it invoke the feeling confidence & high quality that arises from its Japanese origins or the brand with terrible service?Buyer Beware."
5,"I will keep it concise1. Active Noise Cancellation - Sony has pushed the boundaries of noise cancellation a notch above Bose QC35II.Tried this out in flight sitting near the engine, with the NC turned on and it felt i was at home, the engine white noise was totally nullified along with the voice of the crowd which was reduce to a mumble.2. Sound - Not as neutral as Bose but has more punchy bass and lively mids. another pros is about this headphones are. is it has a equalizer options via the sony headphone connect app which lets to change the sound according to your taste.Bose will not let you do that.3. Battery life - on paper its written 30hrs. Took a 5.5hrs flight and was using the headphones for more  7hrs straight, i got a drop of 20% on battery from 100%-80%.lasted much more than 30hrs when i used it for the first time.4. Comfort - The leather used is of highest quality and you can wear it non stop for more than 5 hrs straight without your ears getting fatigued.5- Smart features to allow ambient sounds in the headphones while walking and option to increase the focus on Voice with the headphone kept on.if you are looking for ANC headphones, it has to be WH1000XM3"
5,"I have Audio Technica ATH M50x and Sennheiser HD598 headphones that I've been using for the past 4 years. I also have Yamaha HS5 studio monitors. These are the baseline of comparison for me. I'd never wanted to buy another headphones for myself as I was already set with the two headphones (1 open back and 1 closed back) and a pair of excellent near field studio monitors for my recording deck. But one day my brother got these and was listening to them. I casually tried them on and was blown away by the noise cancellation prowess of these pair. And also was thoroughly impressed by the freedom wireless headphones offered. I was always of the opinion that wired headphone's sound quality could never be matched by a wireless headphones. It's true but these come pretty damn close!Things I absolutely love about the headphones are;1. Noise Cancellation is wonderful!. Whatever happens around you is barely audible as soon as you put these on. It may be weird at first but you get used to the active noise cancellation. And once the music starts playing, you're completely isolated in your own world. Nothing comes through once you put these on. I just totally love that about these headphones.2. Sound Quality: Now this is subjective. There are certain aspects of sound that I like in each of my headphones. On my M50x I like the analytical sound and I like that I can pick up anything and everything. But it gets a little too shrill and piercing because it's treble is too powerful and can be very very fatiguing. As for my HD598, being open back, they have good sound stage and they have the sennheiser veil. They are warm and almost flat. For laid back music listening they are wonderful and you can listen to them for 8 to 10 hours without any discomfort!. As for these, they are the best of both the worlds. The highs are clear and you can pick out the details in all the songs. The bass is wonderfully tight and strong. I've not seen such bass either in M50x or HD598. And I just love it. Even though I prefer the flat sound signature of HD598, I still like the slightly accentuated bass in these cans.3. The convenience: This was what pushed me to purchase. I can't believe how angry I got when every manufacturer in the world started removing the 3.5 mm Headphone jack. I wowed to never buy phones without headphone jack and also mentally became judgmental about wireless headphones. But after seeing my brother's Sony WH-1000XM3s I understood what I was missing out on. It's the convenience.... Not the sound quality or comfort or anything else that gets to you. I now use the headphones more often. So, essentially I'm getting more out of the money I spent on these. (And these are not cheap!). Battery life seems to be as advertised. I used these cans for almost 10 hours straight for the first 3 days and then had to charge them. These charge up in about half hour. Very nice feature.What I dislike....1. Comfort: I have large ears. Even though the cups are large enough that my big ears fit in them, they are not deep enough. After about an hour my ears start getting pinched and I have to adjust them or remove them for 1 or 2 minutes. Curiously enough, this only happens on the right earcup. Either my right earlobe is disproportionately large or the headphone cup is heavier on right side because of battery, because I've noticed that when you charge the headphones, the right earcup heats up. So either the charging circuit is there or the battery is. Whatever it might be, comfort is not as good as the sennheiser. I wouldn't even compare these with M50x on comfort because M50x suck at comfort! These are far better than M50x in comfort and a little worse than sennheiser HD598.2. Mids: As mentioned previously, I like flat sound signature, and these cans have recessed mids. The voices and instruments in the vocal range (like woodwinds) sound muted on these cans. Whereas on Sennheiser HD598 they are crystal clear. Perhaps my ears need to get used to the sound signature or have become accoustomed to flat sounding headphones. Whatever the case might be, mids are lower than bass and treble sounds in these cans. This doesn't take away from the musicality of the headphones though. The tracks sound wonderfully nice on these. You just need to turn up the volume to hear the voices (which in turn makes the instruments louder as well!) The male voices get muted a little. but female voices sound alright.In terms of sound quality considering my tastesSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.8/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9.6/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 9.4/10Yamaha HS5 --- 9.8/10 (you can hear everything in these :-)ComfortSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.5/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 6/10Yamaha HS5 --- 10/10 (you don't need to wear them)Portability/Convenience. This should be your deciding factor to buy them or not.Sony WH-1000XM3 --- 10/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 7/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 7/10Yamaha HS5 --- 0/10 (these weigh 20 kgs and need wires and a sound card to run)Other considerations1. Call quality is decent over the phone but doesn't do well with Whatsapp video call or google hangouts or Cisco Webex (Yes I used these for meetings just to see how good the microphones were. It turns out that direct calls are fine but anything else and they fall apart).2. Controls: They are a little finicky. I'd have liked physical buttons that have a certainty to them. Here you're sometimes not sure if your action has been registered. Also when your fingers are sweaty, they don't slide as easily as you'd like them to. This causes noise due to finger dragging with friction over the control surface.Overall, I'd recommend this to everyone who wants to isolate themselves from the outside world. These are very good at that. But for pure sound quality or absolute comfort, I'd still recommend wired headphones like Sennheiser HD598. The problem with wireless headphones is that the technology (bluetooth) is still advancing and it might be 5 more years until it catches up to the quality of wired headphones. Then wireless headphones will fully take over the wired headphones market because only in sound quality department wireless headphones are lacking right now. The technology of wired headphones has come to its peak. There's nothing more to be done in that. The future is indeed wireless headphones with active noise cancellation. There's a lot to be done in this aspect. These technologies are still nascent. There's lot of scope of improvement in terms of pairing ease, bandwidth of bluetooth connection, battery life and noise cancellation algorithms.These are for people who travel a lot and need sound isolation to enjoy music. These are for people who like convenience over absolute sound quality. Bluetooth technology hasn't yet caught up with the wired headphone sound quality. But it will soon. These headphones are almost there.I wrote this review because no one has been comparing wireless headphones with wired ones. I hope it helps someone who is deciding to get a new phone that doesn't have a headphone jack. If you value absolute sound quality, don't get a phone without headphone jack. The wired headphones still offer better value and sound quality but at the expense of convenience."
1,"Static noise in right earphone with ANC on. Second day of use. Got to know the problem is quite common. Sony service center after getting all details said the piece is defective.Unable to return as Amazon customer care call agents are not responding.. Putting the call on endless hold... By design I guess.Too expensive a headset to have such a problem. Windy static like noise. Goes away with ANC turned off. But we are paying here mainly for the ANC.Got the replacement headphones. Working fine till now.Update.  After five days of use the replacement headphone too had started giving out random white noise ( cracking noise) in noise isolation mode. Though less than the previous set, it may only get worse with time."
1,Sound Quality Isn't Good As I Was Expecting.......Clear Vocals.....? NOClear Bass......? NOBeats.....? Not ClearReally I'm Not Satisfied With This PairBattery Backup Is 10 HoursI'm Using Sennheiser Momentum And Sennheiser Is Much Better Than ThisRegretting Now....... I've Placed A Request For Replacement...... Let's See What Will Happen😒
2,"[6 months update]So the side clips came out on their own. Upon reaching SONY service to repair them , since its still under warranty,  they flat out refused and asked me to pay 4k for headband replacement. It's a shame that such an amazing product has got such pathetic customer support. Even after I was ready to pay , then I came to know, the part is not available in Kolkata, rather the entire casing is available @16k.[8 months update]After repeated emails to Sony Support, that made the headband spare part available and gave it to me @5k price. I got my headphone repaired and I can now use it daily. At-least that made it available @Kolkata and within semi-reasonable price. Increased rating to 2 stars for this.Verdict: Go with Bose, at-least you'll get good support.I bought this product in Amazon Festive sale 2019 with the sole purpose of using in office to block office chatter and noise. I tested for a day in office, here is my verdict.Noise Cancellation: (NOTE: I don't play songs while in office because its distracting, just the ANC is on)Good enough to be used in office with a few caveats:1. If there is a sound directed towards your microphone from short distance (office phone/laughter, someone talking right behind/beside/facing you), you can hear it at 90% volume.2. Other low frequency office noise like Equipment/engine noise but not human vocals(which is not specifically directed towards your microphone) is reduced to 10% of their original volume depending on distance . This helps you to focus.3. Office chatter (voice) happening at some distance (6ft or more) are reduced to 30% volume, so you can effectively ignore them.4. During the call, noise cancellation does not work, which is annoying. Otherwise the call quality is itself very clear with no issues.That being said, if you play music in even 20% of the volume, you can't hear anything outside (Practically 0). That helps in focus while working, but I personally can't focus while good is playing(in my mind, I'm dancing :P)Sound Quality:I didn't buy this device for sound quality, but trust me, the sound quality will blow your mind, its the best I've heard till now. I streamed Master Quality Audio (from Tidal) via wired connection, and the sound clarity, depth and accuracy is superb. You'll truly immerse yourself in audio if you stream High fidelity music via wired connection.Battery /Comfort / Build Quality:These are industry standard as expected from SONY. Anyone with SONY headphones knows that."
1,I bought this headphone 15 days back and I have already started hearing buzzing crackling noise when the music is not being played and ANC is on. There is no noise when I just wear them (ANC is off) but as soon as I switch it on it start making this koise when you are not listening tk anything. I never paid attention initially but yeah now I regret.Having used just for 5-6 times in this period this is a worst thing that could have happened to my 25k bucks. After searching for this online it seems like it's a manufacturing fault and there ain't any solution for it.
5,"using this from last 3 days.Pros:1>Awesome Noise canceling. on it and get isolated from neighbors.2>if your phone or TV supports LDAC or aptx-hd ,than you really enjoy the quality of sound.USe SBC mode with DSEE-X with VPT on mode. thats also good. bt LDAC mode gives to better depth of bass and treble.3>battery life is just awesome, used around 10 hours and still, 76% battery is available.4> My brother is having Bose QC 35II, but apart from noise cancellation and better Bass handling, nothing is too great.so if you have Bose QC35ii , no need to upgrade.Cons: Call quality at noisy place , not too much clear. sometimes it just surrounding within my ear only. but at quiet place , it's  good as expected.Overall:  worth to purchase if you have Sony TV , and Phones having with LDAC and APT-X HD support."
2,"Headphones don't cancel the human voice at all though they are very good (not great) at canceling the other noises. The reason for me to buy is to avoid distraction in office but I was able to hear the peoples voice clearly. I had to return my first pair thinking that there was some issue, but there was no change in ANC performance with new headphones. I don't think these are worth it for the price they charge. I bought these based on the Sony commercial ads and few reviews, but I was utterly disappointed with the ANC performance in canceling human voice. Not sure if this has got something to do with the new firmware 4.1.1 because I got headphones with 4.1.1 by default.I need to appreciate the seller Appario Retail Private Ltd for accepting the return and refunding the amount though the product falls under only replacement category."
5,"- The noise cancellation is amazing, you can chose what to hear and what not to hear - configuration available through mobile application.- Battery life is amazing - I have charged only once in last almost 45 days, though I am not a very frequent listener, I use it for couple of hours each day and I can still read the battery life as 50% remaining- Amazing sound quality, you can hear everything - a small test I did - heard songs that I love - could hear a lot more music and beats than I have heard so far- Overall - If you are looking for a great headphones with good battery back up, excellent sound and excellent noise cancellation - go for it, worth the price.."
1,"A person has already written about this cracking noise issue and his bad experience with this product . Even after I had read it , I purchased the product because of other positive reviews . It's a big mistake . Within 5 days , the crackling noise started from both sides . So the product was replaced by Amazon . But the replaced product was worse than the first one . Crackling noise started on the first day itself. So I returned the product and applied for a refund . Sony has to address this issue and make a fix . Thank you"
5,"Before I start with the review, let me make it clear that my tryst with noise cancellation headphones began in 2012 with the humble yet impressive Nokia BH-905 which I purchased for around 300 USD. My desire for good headphones started in the year 2008 with the wired Bose headphones and another Bose headphone a few years later. I am the proud owner of the Sennheiser PXC 550 for the past 3 years and have used it extensively to the extent that the leatherette coating has worn out beyond salvation.Although I do not claim myself to be an audiophile, I will do my best to review the Sony WH-1000XM3 to the best of my ability. This review will also compare the 1000 XM3 to the PXC 550.Packaging :-------------The headphones arrived in a decent box. The build quality of the box could be improved. The PXC 550 were packed in a much better built box. The product is made in Malaysia.Carrying case :-----------------The carrying case, although hard, is of average quality. The PXC 550 has a softer case in comparison. None of them come even closer to the immaculate carrying case which was provided with the Nokia BH-905 in 2012 !!!Build quality :----------------The 1000XM3 is pretty robust. I did not find much difference when compared to PXC 550. The main difference is that the earcups have a free sideways movement and no hard clicks. There could be confusion as to which one is left ear and which one is right. It will take some time to make peace with the fact that the left earcup has an NFC symbol on it.Ergonomics :---------------While I was used to the PXC 550 with all the buttons on its right side, the 1000 XM3 is in sharp contrast with the buttons on its left side. There is a multifunction button and a power button. The touch pad is located on the right side. There is a USB C charging port on the right side ( the updated PXC 550 still has a micro usb port )The head band is of decent quality and I did not face any trouble wearing the headphones.The earcups when compared to the PXC 550 are a tad uncomfortable to wear. While it is a known fact that around ear noise cancellation headphones will make your ears sweat after say, 2 hours of usage, I felt more comfortable with the PXC 550. Also the 1000 XM3 has an additional cushioning in front of the sound driver which is bound to  touch the ear pinna and cause you some irritation until such time that you get used to wearing the headphones.The headphones will definitely make your ears sweat. Period.So don't buy these headphones (or any around ear noise cancellation headphones for that matter ) to complain that the ears sweat !!!Noise cancellation :----------------------The 1000XM3 beats the competition upfront when it comes to noise cancellation. There is a feature to calibrate the noise cancellation and optimize it as per the situation, The multifunction button toggles between normal mode, ambience mode and noise cancellation mode. There is a feature where the noise cancellation levels can be adjusted for sitting, walking, running and transport. If ambient sound control is switched on, this feature will automatically adjust the noise cancellation levels as set by the user.Those who keep complaining about some ear pressure, please note that this is the basis on which noise cancellation works and hence there is bound to be some discomfort when noise cancellation is active. Take this from a person who has been regularly using noise cancelling headphones for the past 8 years.Sound quality :-----------------I never bothered to ponder over the sound quality when using the PXC 550 as I trusted a 30k headphone to sound well. But when I got my hands on the 1000 XM3, I did an upfront comparison between the two and I found out that the 1000 XM3 definitely sound better (by a small margin) than the PXC 550. Some rogue reviews mentioned that Sony has more bass than the others. I disagree with this statement. The 1000 XM3 has a punchier sound than the PXC 550 and hence one gets a feeling of more bass in comparison. On a lighter note, there is an option to increase bass levels using the software if the headphones aren't doing enough already !!!Connectivity :----------------Found no issues with connectivity. When compared to the PXC 550, the Bluetooth signal was just about the same strength, although the PXC 550 are a bit better. I tried out the headphones with a windows 10 laptop as well and found no issues. The headphones worked fine with my iPad air.The wired connection worked without any issues.The NFC function also worked fine.Touchpad :-------------The touch pad does a pretty decent job. But when I compare to the PXC 550, I felt that the 1000 XM3 has a slower response although it should not be much of a bother.On a positive note, there is a feature of lowering the music volume by just touching the touchpad with the palm. This feature is very useful when you want to listen to somebody without removing the headphones.Battery life :--------------The claimed battery life is 30 hours under test conditions. I did not bother to break my head over the number of hours I got with a single charge.Software :------------This is one factor where the 1000 XM3 outperform the PXC 550 by a big margin. The Sennheiser software was just a gimmick where the user could not do much than check the battery level of the headphones and a few other settings. The Sony software is very detailed with numerous settings and you can really control your headphones using the software. The headphone firmware was updated when I first connected them using the software. Beware that the update takes around 45 minutes to complete and you need to be patient.Conclusion :--------------For 19.3k during the Prime day sale, I am more than happy with these headphones. I did have an option to buy the updated PXC 550 or the Bose QC 35, but I chose to go ahead with Sony.One common issue with any premium headphone is the availability of replacement ear cushions and I still haven't been able to get one for my PXC 550. It is relatively easier to get one for the QC 35 and I hope that I don't have to beat around the bush much to get a replacement cushion for the 1000 XM3 in the near future."
5,"Yes its expensive,. But you are not getting just another headphone for the money.you literally feel like getting a companion that makes your routine daily activities much more enjoyable thanks to the awesome noise cancelling nd great sound quality.PROS:1)looks and feels premium,you'll be proud to go out with it,it looks modern esp the matte black.2)noise cancelling should not be overlooked as a small feature, it can provide you with an escape route from the fuss nd stress.now these hav the best in class noise cancelling nd itreally makes a difference.3)sound quality: i'm just an average music listener, nd for me these headphones hav made me fall back in love with my older songs bcoz i was hearing a lot more than i used...the soundstage is pretty wide nd bright, it does lean towards the base which is great for me.at higher volumes it really gives u a surround sound theatre like feel.4)software updates mean these can keep getting better in sime ways, just got support for alexa,multiple languages etc..already comes with google assistant,really useful.5)there are tiny touches that sony has added to enhance the user experience nd they all add up as big positives like ambient noise control.Cons:1)call quality is avg,but usable.2)it could take some time getting used to wearing it if ur coming from using in ears like me.3)ears do get sweaty in warm climate after some time.overall comfort could improve.Verdict: if music is a part of your day nd if u can afford it without going broke,then dont overthink it.just buy it, its worth it.Make sure u r listening with ldac nd dsee hx enabled."
1,"Within a few hours of usage, random static noise started appearing only in the left earcup whenever ANC was turned on. This noise was initially not evident when no music was playing, but later became even prominent over the audio. This is not expected of a new product. Have been using Bose QC20 for over 5 years now, but never faced an issue with ANC.Thankfully, Amazon was quick to order a replacement. Fingers-crossed as to whether the replacement will work fine as well.Edit: The replacement is working well as of now. Bit will wait for a few more weeks before changing the rating."
3,Sony should really improve on quality check and Amazon on delivery check . First I received a defective product with accessories missing and some duplicate 3.5mm cable . Replacement received in three days in which microphone was not working properly . Other end person is not able to hear my voice even in a silent room . I had to return this and expecting refund . When we go for high cost product and if quality is like this which leaves a bad remark on these reputed brands .
5,"Its been almost 2 months since i bought this and i would just say you ll never be disappointed for the money that you spent on this item. Its completely worth for each and every penny.Noise cancellation:Easily the best(est) in market right now. It not only overtook Bose in this factor but also provides a different level of experience. After using the nc in this, you would just feel every other headphones as an ordinary one.Sound Quality:Though it's not so loud, it brings you crystal clear audio with good bass. Not recommended for those who wants enhanced bass quality music. It just gives you the raw music without any scratches or hindrances.Battery:I charge it once in two weeks as I hear songs for max 3 hours a day. It only takes an hour to charge completely. It lives upto its promise of 30 hrs battery life.Usability:Buttons are little confusing at the beginning but when we get used to it, it just works like butter. Haven't used Alexa voice yet but tried Google assistant and it's one step ahead of being awesome."
4,"Noise Cancelling on these headphones is amazing... Much better than the Bose QC-25 that I own. However, the sound out of the box is too bassy for my liking. Nothing I played sounded good. Vocals were buried under the heavy bass. I managed to tweak it via the app they provide and it's great after that. Matches the Bose in terms of quality and clarity after tweaking. However, I would have preferred better tuning out of the box. The sound is also a bit narrow, but good for noise cancelling headphones.All the online reviews mention how great these sound, and that for me was the most disappointing part on opening the box. Do spend time tuning it to your liking before dismissing it completely.I would have liked if the headphones connected to more than one device at the same time. You have to manually unpair and pair with new device, which is a pain.Overall, these are the best noise cancelling headphones for travel. They are super comfortable and block out sounds really well."
4,"This is the classic issue of Sony xm3, where it makes a cracking sound, if people are not aware, the video shows how it sounds, this might happen within a day, in week, a month or a year, one never knows."
5,This is a brilliant Active Noise Cancellation headphone. When they claim industry leading noise cancellation. They mean it. I also own a Sennheiser 4.50 BTNC (Bought for 7500 last year) and this one completely blows it out of the water.I compared it with a colleague's Bose QC35 II and this is still better as far as ANC is concerned.I stood next to an exhaust fan. Silence.In office. SilenceThis is a revelation.Buy this to know what silence sounds like.The app that goes with it gives even greater control over the experience with custom listening profiles via the equaliser and also a feature called adaptive cancellation where the headphone detects what you are doing and decides to let in some ambient sound and several other features which give finer control.Full gesture control of music/calls via a touch interface and a very thoughtful passthrough gesture where temporarily the headphone reduces the volume and the ANC so that you can hear the outside world and have a conversation without having to remove the headphones.If you can afford it. Must buy.
5,"Buying Sony 1000 XM3 is one of the best decision I've made by choosing between the two Sony 1000 MX3 and Bose qc 35 ii.Pros : 1.Best active noise cancelling headphones.  2.High Res audio, Audio codec support aptX,aptX  HD,SBC,AAC, and Sony's LDACcodec which  supports all Android smartphones with Android  8.0 and above.  3.Best sound quality for best listening experience.  4.Best premium build quality.  5.Light design easy and comfortable on head  6.For bass heads amazing bass you would love it  7.Super battery life of 30hrs.  8.3.5 mm audio Jack with cable included.  9.Feature rich headphone.  10.Type C  port for quick charge.  11.Touch inputs on the outside of ear cups.  12.Sleek design comes with good sturdy carry case  13.Sony headphone app for mobile is added  advantage  14.Alexa and Google assistantCons : 1.Bluetooth 4.5 cannot connect to multiple  bluetooth devices but not a problem for me  2.Call quality is okay not great"
5,"First of all Thank You Harman for launching an affordable headphone. Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it. You won't regret afterall it is by HARMAN.#thelongestreview?"
5,"Would I recommend this product to others? Definitely yes.Pros:Light WeightBattery LifeCons:No 3.5 mm cable, only blue toothI was in search of a light weight wireless headphone that I can use for long hours. I have a Bose now but I cannot use it for longer than 2-3 hours as its heavy and ears and head start aching.This Infinity one wins there. I have used it for 6-7 hours without any aches or pains.The ear pieces do press a little on the ears unlike over-the-ear ones. This one is on-the-ear.  But it is not uncomfortable and gives a good fit.The sound quality is good too. Noise cancellation is not big. With low volumes, you can hear surrounding noise.Battery does last for a long long time. I used it daily for 4-5 hours for about 3 days with one charge. Am truly impressed with it.And it folds, hence carrying it around is convenient too.And I got it in the lightning deal at 1500 Rs. Worth the price. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a non-expensive wireless headphones with a decent sound quality.I am giving it a 4 because I am not sure of its durability. If it lasts foe 6 months at least, then I will come back and update the rating to a 5."
5,"Hi all,After a week rough usage i am sharing my opinion.i through that under 1499 INR i should not expect the headset with all features except sound,but this one made ,my through wrong.One of the best budget product it is. ""Infinity (JBL) Glide 500 Wireless On-Ear Dual EQ Deep Bass Headphones with Mic (Charcoal Black)"".Pros:--1.product quality is good on this price.2.sound quality is extraordinary,especially ""Gaana website songs"" are awesome,prime video streaming sound experience just like a theater.3. Battery backup ~20hrs is good is this product.Cons:--1.aux port not enabled in this version.2.No other reasons here."
1,Not liked because his product is made in China so that I am returning
1,"Hello Amazon Team,In the Carton box it is mentioned as Manufactured in USA but in the product it mentioned as China . This is breach case , pls look into & Update."
2,"I bought this headphone as a replacement for my in-ear headset. I attend lot of office calls due to WFH. I wanted to have a Bluetooth headphone with great battery life and decent mic quality. To be honest, I can't use these headphones for more than a hour, my ears are paining a lot. The cushioning is very poor and cheap quality. Giving two Star, as it is basic sense to design a headphone with proper cushioning for comfort. People who enjoy too much bass can be happy."
5,This product is better than its old counterpart i.e. JBL infinity 501. With more upgraded features in an affordable price and under a trusted brand. The most catchy thing is it's 36 mm driver and 72 hours playback time as compared to earlier 20 hrs. playback.
1,This is waste of money. Guys Don't go for this headset you will get lot of ear pain and you can't feel any Bass exist in it. Please don't buy it I had purchased later I found such a worst product and returned immediately.
5,Its awesome product...thumping base...ears vibrating bass..bery good sound quality and in a affordable pricing...
5,"I am impressed with sound quality of Infinity glide 510. It's a value product at a reasonable price. My initial impressions.Pros:1. Good sound quality- mids and highs are clear even with a punchy bass.2.Decent build quality at this price.3.Excellent Bluetooth connectivity and range. I am especially impressed with the range.4. Battery life of 72 hrs which is an unbelievable offer at this price.. (I can't comment on battery life now)5.Pretty decent noice cancellation ( not active)Cons:1.The Deep Bass mode is useless, which spoils the sound quality ( It is set in deep bass mode, you can change it to normal mode by long pressing the volume keys together)2. I could feel the pain on the ears after an hour's usage.I am sure, you won't be disappointed with this product. It's quite a catch at this price. Hope it will be durable."
5,"First to write the review I guess,Okay, so harman has done a superb job with the glide 500. I bought it as soon as I saw it.These are for for people on a budget looking for a pair of decent looking and decent sounding headphones.I now use it for my daily use.For the price, this is absolutely amazing.It is a plastic build yet not cheap.a nice matte finish texture,with soft cushions, I have used it for almost 2-3 hours straight and doesnt hurt my ears.Also has three buttons( volume and power) a micro usb slot and infinity branding on the headband and the sides.As for sound its a 10/10. Doesnt get distorted on bass, no screeching on treble and nice smooth mids.Smooth criminal you can call it! I have tried house, RnB , Pop, EDM. Can hear all of em suppressed sounds we usually dont hear on cheap headsets.Double tap for Your assistant, quick response and the best part. Deep bass on Pressing volume up and down together.You cant expect the skullcrushing bass, like I said, you get quality bass which doesnt hurt you. Im a Bass head myself, i really love the bass delivered by this beauty because it is well balanced.Battery backup yet to be monitored, playing wellb for around 8 hours now on no charge yet. Sounding well, overall a premium feel.  I had tried boat,boult,ant and those budget ones..Trust me this is the best Hands down.Superb job Harman, keep up the good work!"
1,"Highly disappointed and dissatisfied . Can't wear for more than 30 min as it starts to pain , completely against of claims in advertising . Battery backup claimed as 72 hrs ... practically 15 hrs . Cushion on ear cups are not soft enough. Bluetooth disconnected after 7-8 metrs ,  If one scrutinized the reviews well , he can understand that top reviews are paid or Fake ."
5,"Enjoy ""AWESOME DEEP BASS EXPERIENCE WITH LONG LASTING BATTERY LIFE"".Another Excellent product from JBL. I am already using JBL INFINITY GLIDE 500 since 6 months and that itself is having such a good battery backup with a of claim of 22 hours. In one charge it goes for a month or so with an average use of 1 hour. I have bought the product 3 times and gifted them to my brother and friends.With this new model claiming 72 hours backup, it will be just awesome. I have used it for 2 days now and with around 5 hours of use battery level has come down from 80% to 70% only.This is lightweight and more comfortable as compared to its previous Glide 500 version.Coming to its performance... It's just awesome for HEAVY BASS crazy people like me.For the best HEAVY BASS EXPERIENCE, please install DI.FM RADIO App from Google Play Store and enjoy few channels like ""Russian Club Mix"", ""Bass & Jackin House"". You will definitely love this product.For CLEAR MUSIC EXPERIENCE, you can install RADIO TUNES and enjoy beautiful music from channels like ""Mellow Smooth Jazz 🎺"", ""Smooth Jazz"" etc.At this price, it's COMPLETELY AWESOME 👌 👌 👌"
1,"Basic functionality of connecting more than 1 device simultaneously via Bluetooth is not available. You have to disconnect from one device so you can connect to other. There are better local brands having this feature. Moreover 40mm driver headset cost same or less than this one, then why should someone buy just because battery lasts for 72 hours. No one listens continuously that long. I am returning this product and so do others if they understand what I mean!!"
2,connectivity - goodcomfort level - goodcall quality - goodmusic quality - below averageeven on flac format song i miss the expected average music quality than samsung level u....
5,"I am amazed at what the Infinity JBL Glide 500 headphone has to offer.Check out the video to learn what I think about it. If you are short on time, read below- Great for listening to songs while workout (I use it daily)- A small footprint makes it look awesome!- Great bass and overall excellent sound quality- Volume increase buttons on headphones seem to be semi-connected to the phone. The volume can go higher than what's shown on the phone.- It connects to the phone in seconds- Great range!- No mute button(con)- Comfortable around neck- Voice quality is decent!If you like my review, do not forget to click the helpful button. It helps me to write and record great content for you guys! Have a great day!"
1,"Infinity (JBL)By harmanI m great fan of jbl - HKBut didn’t expect such bad experience from u.Connected to iPhoneSongs getting disturbed as if Bluetooth out of range.  But phone at 1 foot distance. Songs getting interpreted , annoying experience. Connected in android phone too. Same problem.Pls infinity(jbl)(HK)Dnt disappoint by launching lik this product.Bass is good , very clear and no distortion even in higher volume . Looks good , nice foldable compact headphones , fits nicely on ear. Soft cup feels pleasant while listening music.Could have included 3.5 jack port - aux cable can be used in case of battery exhausted.Blue light always flickering once in 5 sec , disturbing in night - which is not required to flicker."
5,"Using this infinity headphone for the past 1 week and here is the brief review:# Pros:1. Excellent bass, delight to listen music on this headset.2. Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity is top notch..It's connects very quick after pairing.3. Handset Muff's are decently soft.4. Very less external sound creep in when u r listening on minimal volume. In higher volumes, u can't figure that.5. JBL quality sound. Minimal sound distortion in higher volume. 2 different base for unique listening. Very good value for basic listeners..6. Easily adjustable headset leaf so that it can be fitted tightly according to ur head size.# Cons:1. Build quality is basic. Its more of plasticky and looks normal. The turning hinges looks fragile. Till now, no problems faced, will update it long term review.2. Power on/off becomes a tricky function..It take more than 2 sec to power on/off..During power on, it starts syncing for new Bluetooth devices due to the prolonged time.3. Call voice quality is normal. The voice is very low heated from the other end.Apart from the above, the headset is value buy and its one of the excellent, branded headphone choice in the current market."
5,"When there are thousands of headsets in the market including the cheap Chinese ones, I wanted to go for an option from top brands within my budget. Harman being a reputed brand I shortlisted this as my budget was low and purpose was for indoor use only. I am very happy with the call quality (It is at par with my Bose NC headset when you compare indoor performance) I am not a pro so could not find anything wrong with music quality. The range is good as it is Bluetooth 5.0. Lastly the comfort level is good because it is light weight."
1,"I bought as many people said its plastic, but premium. But, its not. Its a very cheap plastic.Sound is very hollow. No punch, or clarity. High and Mid are very dim, bass is ok ok. With the bass boost option, sound is Ok, else its very hollow sounding.For this price of 1499 or cheaper, Boat is way better in both build quality and sound quality.Wont recommend."
4,"1#Actually its hell of a product I have been using for quite long and this is what I feel about it:Pros-1.Battery -It has a long lasting battery as about 72hrs( as company claims) but I am sure no one using it for continuous 72hrs but what I felt is that when I unboxed the product it was 80% and after 3 days of regular usage like music,youtube,movies I was able to make 3 days with 50%remaining i.e 30% for 3 days and it took me about 45 min to chagre it up to 80%2.Sound quality and bass-This thing is a beast regarding bass and sound quality I can asure you that this wont even dissappoint you in case of sound quality and for bass,if you bass lover like me it got 2 mode-normal and deep bass.If you cant feel enough bass at normal mode you can easily shift to deep bass mode by pressing +and -button together then you will feel an astonishing bass effect even you can feel the headphone starts vibration at each beat and if this doesnt make you enough then I recommend you to meet an E.N.T for check-up Dude belive me it's crazy3.Bluetooth range-Its just great because its version 5.0 and provide greater range even after crossing 3 rooms you can get adequate range without breaking any signal4.Microphone-its like a bonus because it has good audio recording but the only problem is that it works only during calling i.e you can use it to record or send voice message in whatsapp5.Usage of buttons is just as simple as it seemsLets get to cons:(Only two minor ones)1.comfort-Actually it is only one negative thing I felt about the device after my first usage .It is a bit uncomfortable to wear and you will feel a slight pain over your pinna (external ear )after using for 1 hr ,but now I became adjust to it now I can wear it for hrs without any problem belive me,it can take some time to adjust and after that you won't feel any problem plus it's is weight less and small device so you will easily adjust within one day2.Plastic quality-(It is my feeling that )it seems to be a little fragile during transport especially keeping it in a bag so beware of thatOther than these 2 minor factor I never felt anything bad about this device.So my verdict is that I usually loves to hear music with a good bass and effect and I have used many device from Sennheiser,Ant audio,Jbl,Boat,Skullcandy,Audio technica,Sony and many more so from my experience I will recommend this device to many and I would say THIS IS THE BEST HEADPHONE IN THE MARKET THAT PROVIDE BLUETOOTH AND SOUND QUALITY AT THIS REASONABLE PRICE POINT IF YOU ARE GONNA BUY A HEADPHONE UNDER 1000 JUST PUSH YOUR MAXIMUM TO THIS PRICE POINT IT WILL ALWAYS BE WORTHY.A GOOD PRODUCT FROM HARMAN AUDIO /JBL AS ALWAYS#But all these good factors vanishes because of the horrible comfort that is why I gave 4 star.Otherthan comfort this is awesome"
1,I absolutely hated it from the moment I started using it. It feels so cheap. Even though I was sitting right in front of my laptop it got disconnected multiple times. My ears started to get hot after some time. I'm trying to return it but apparently I can only replace it. DO NOT BUY THIS!! IT IS A SCAM ! U CAN'T GET A REFUND! THEY WILL send u the same thin again!
3,"SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD, BUT THE HEADPHONES ARE TIGHT AND MAY GIVE YOU PAIN ON LONG USAGE. I have not been able to use it for long time since it's too tight for me... And Irony is Amazon doesn't want give refund to me. I want to go for in-ewr headphones but still they don't want to give the refund. And cherry on cake is Customer care shouts on the customer... @Amazon you need to train your customer care people. Ridiculous experience. Please give my money back if you can so I can have another headphones.Update: Amazon gave my money back, and i was able to buy another headphones. Thank you Amazon."
1,"Pls don't purchase it. It has a sound in right side of headphone. Harman group had told me to send this product. I had parcelled this which cost me around Rs 400. Now they have returned the item again to me without any notice. And when I called, they are saying there is no fault. Such a poor customer service.Sincere request, don't purchase it. It has a prominent sound like vibrating string. Add to this such a poor customer care. Their behaviour is shameless. They should learn from Amazon.Update on 20.nov.19: Customer service of Harman group are shameless. I had some recordings. Everytime they will say we will call you back after 24 hours. But they will never call. I am going to file a case in consumer court.Its not a good headphone at all. Pls purchase other item. Forget about customer care, sound quality is not good. There is a Continous belling soung.Thank you"

3,"Review by a semi professional...Buid quality-7.5/10(headband is thin)Noise isolation-8/10Sound leak-10/10(almost no sound leak even in full sound)Sound quality-7.8/10(instrumental separation is not good,bass is a little muddy not tight,edm/bollywood are best for this... acoustics/rock are not fit into this)Battery-10/10 (12hrs for sure)Connectivity-10/10(instant connection, connection is flawless upto 10ft)Mic-8/10(better though not best)Comparision with some popular cans-1.senn cx180/213 has 2times better clarity2.boat basshead225 has 1.2tiimes better clarity3.onemore pistonfit has 1.3times better clarity4.jbl cs300si has less clarity5.boat 400 has just a little less clarityBut but when it comes to songs with bass this one is better than almost all others(though cx180 has more pleasing bass)**Bass mode has more punchier bass than normal...those who r saying no effect their phones  r rubbish for sureAtlast i say if u get it in 1200/1300₹ then its perfect..for 1500/1600₹  u will feel less satisfied,,,wait for the discount, don't buy when its above 1500₹"
5,"Superb clarity. Bass in normal mode is enough, no need to change the EQ setting. Highs are little less bright but still comprehensible. Vocals sometimes feel muddy but looking at the price range, there cannot be better headphones. This is top notch quality in this price. Far better than Boat, far far better. No comparison, in fact. JBL is JBL."
4,"I purchased this on 28 August, it was delivered on 31 August. The delivery was good. Now to the headphones,this headphones has all the things you need to called this headphone. I mean the sound quality is excellent. Bass is good. No distortion in taking calls and decent build quality. It kinda look like jbl t460bt younger brother. I have given 4* because it has a minor issue of producing a sound like ""ting ting"" when you touch or tap right side of the headphones. But it doesn't bother that much so it's a sweet deal. Hope you can enjoy this product.Update: 27 may 2020- I have been using this for past 8 months and their sound quality is best considering it's battery life and build which is far good than other headphones available. The only one drawback is their are not much comfortable. So if you can compromise a bit then go for it."
5,"The build and sound quality of this thing is awesome. I upgraded to this after my Sennheiser cx 180 street ii broke. For all those who are wondering it comes with a 610 mah battery. I am by no way a audiophile but the sound i feel is excellent. It was by default in bass boosted mode and i switched it back to normal. Battery life, Durability all those things will be updated in a future update. I feel it was a bit uncomfortable for large head, mine is xl 😝 but not that troublesome (3/5 for comfort). Edit : The sound of the headphone is excellent after burning in for more than 10 hours. You get used to the headphones after sometime. So yeah its more comfortable now. 2 days of 3 hour per day use in medium volume gets battery down by 10%. Buy this thing eyes closed."
1,"It worked fine for first 2 weeks, It's now less than 15 days and it stopped working.Not sure if It charges properly... I can see the red light while charging. Then click and hold power button to start - power button seems to be not working.Is there any reset button to auto fix settings?It's useless now. I can't return it as after 10 days as per return policy. I have 1 year warranty. I don't know how to claim that.It's not a good experience."
1,"This is made in China product (written on the box). It's showing it's nature from first day. If sound is not played for 3-4 min and then you play any sound the headphones will not respond until you until you pair it again. I don't know if it is happening with me only. In one hour I noticed 3-4 time sound stopped for like half sec which I did not expected from JBL, me and my phone were on same bed .Sound is nice but breaking half sec between songs is not acceptable. Bad bluetooth connection.I literally search JBL is US brand but still they have quility like Chinese products."
1,"Hey guys , read this before you buyI bought the headphones 1 month ago which was around 14-15 sep. Everything was going well. Exactly after 1 week, which is 21st sep I used the headphone for 3 hrs to attend some meeting and as soon as I disconnected it the headphones stopped working.  I went to the phone shop they said they won't repair this. I wrote a complain at Harman website they had no response.. please Amazon  have a look at this product and I will wait for the reply.Regards"
4,Sound is good but will only work with mobileNot with laptop or anyother device
5,"Mind Blowing 3D surround sound Experience, I have sennheiser and Sony headphone but really this headphone is amazing, every notes and vocal r clear and bass is very very very awesome when u r switched in powerful bass such u feel with new bass experience. Overall I give full rate 5/5"
5,"Here is my detailed review of this product after a week of usage:1. Build quality:Earlier was sceptical a bit about on-ear headphone that the outer ear will pain after long use. But this one comes with great built, comfort, lightweight and handy that one can use for longer period without any discomfort.2. Sound quality:I'm an audiophile. Love to hear every single frequency from low to high and set my theatre for the same. Here comes the sound of this product it'll really produce the low frequency approx 80-100hz which is really good for such small speaker resulting good bass, clear sound with balanced trable.Noise cancellation is as expected. You'll be cut out from outer world.3. Bluetooth control and battery:Bluetooth is working as expected and can be achieved at a distance of 10-15 mtrs. Control buttons are good with proper sensitivity battery lasted 18 hours of regular use.Over all a nice product from Herman and can buy without having second thoughts."
4,"I wasn't able play pubg connecting with this headset, you will get the fire sound or foot sound with delay of 2 seconds so you can't sync the sound of game which you hear in headset and game play."
5,Infinity Glide 500 is very accurate in terms of sound quality. Build quality seems to be not so good because all is plastic. I was comparing this with Jbl T460 bluetooth headphone. The INFINITY GLIDE 500 is having puncy bass. I could say that bass is little bit overpowering...there is option to switch ON the deep base mode but believe me friends I could never feel the need to enable deep base mode. The bass is too much even in normal mode. So bass lovers will like this headphone for sure. Please allow some time to burn the headphone to produce quality sound. First day you may not feel the headphone good but believe me from second day I was just in love with this as it produces sharp details. So burning time is required to free up the components of headphone. Battery backup is tremendous...as compared to Jbl T460. Jbl T460 has just 11 hours whereas this headphone has 20 hours backup. Price is also very low.Thanks.UPDATE AFTER USING 3 WEEKS:This headphone has really became my travel mate...This has bluetooth 5.0 and it does not even disconnects in Mumbai crowded local trains. Your phone should support bluetooth version 5.0 and it will connect with this headset seamlessly. Lower bluetooth versions are also supported of course...But 5.0 is great for connectivity and battery optimization.EQ mode is not that great and it does not give any difference and there is really no need to push for deep base....it is just awesome in normal mode....Flexible to carry and travel...Great headphones.
5,"This is my first Bluetooth Overhead headphone.Reason why I do not prefer Bluetooth headphone is due to its poor battery backup and sound quality, I always prefer Wired headphones also for its sound quality.But this headphone is a game changer1. Battery Backup: this headphone is really great in the battery backup. I was an average listener and game player. So it was giving a backup for more than a week easily for me. I never thought of charging it from the day I bought it.2. Sound effect: The sound is absolutely good with some equaliser and it’s best with power amp, and some music player which has custom equaliser in Android. If you are iPhone user and wanna enjoy music in default music player , then it’s not for you. However we can install some third party music player with equaliser and enjoy the music (eg: onkyo player).And the best part of the headphones is enjoying a movie with deep bass mode. If you are looking for a headphone to enjoy movies for long time with best bass boosted high volume sound effect then go for this without thinking. I really enjoy watching Marvel collections since I’m marvel fan. Oven never enjoyed such a deep bass anywhere. Even in laptop the movies sounds great with VLC media player(subjected to best equaliser settings).3. Comfort: The headphone gives a great comfortable tight fit. I’m a big head guy and it’s really so hard. I can’t wear it for more than 20 min. But I gave the same headphone to my brother and sister, everyone is comfortable wearing for so long. So I wear it in a different angle and it helps me to fit comfort. This is definitely for round headed people, it has a huge extension but still there is no adjustment for horizontal flexible adjust fit.4. Build Quality: So good and sturdy. Light weight and foldable.5. Noise Cancellation: It gives a nice noise cancelling sound environment with more than average volume level. Compression is perfect for normal head. Since I have round and huge head, it is not giving perfect closure to ears if I extend the length of the adjustment. That’s the only problem for me. Never mind if you are normal headed.Mic: During call and gameplay I never had a complaint from other end. They can hear my voice clearly.Drawbacks: It does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack and I can’t enjoy the Dolby Atmos effect from my laptop. For this extreme bass headphone if it gives me option to connect and enjoy the music I would be so happy. But it can’t be bundles with all futures right. That’s negligible for me.Overall it’s a Best Buy for the price range. I really enjoy it and my family is enjoying with this headphone.Thanks"
2,"I was expected a lot from this Bluetooth headset, but disappointed very much.It like a normal piece, not worth to buy for Rs1700"
1,"Today, I have received Glide 500 wireless on-ear headphone. But the product is not as good as I have heard abt it. I purchased it for brand name HARMAN but sound quality especially Bluetooth connectivity is so irritating that I prefer to return this. I played music on ganna app as well as songs available in my phone but same problem exist both the time. Every 4-5 seconds a interruption occurred and sound became low. So I recommend not to buy this."
1,On Time delivery - 5 star for DeliveryAudio Quality - Not as mentioned.Calling - Too much of disturbance at time of calling.Too much of ear irritation & pain after wearing for merely 10 - 15 min.Overall review - NOT WORTH THE COST OF 1499/-Got the delivery on 27th Aug and initiated refund for the same on 28th Aug.Advice not to buy......
5,It's just awesome. I got the product at the correct time. Thank you Amazon. The sound quality is excellent. The bass is great. The earcups are very good. It gives a great experience of music . The clarity is pakka. I love this one and recommend to all. In this price it just great. Overall wonderful product.
3,Pros:1.Portable2.Value for money3.Battery life4.Sound quality5.Base is pretty good6.Good build quality.Cons:1. Itchy on ears2. If used for long causes irritation on skin3. Sometimes brings up background disturbace in voice call4. Not very good at noice cancellation.Overall its a good product to invest in
4,"OK now I will give you a detailed review of Boat Rockers  400. I am reviewing after 10days I got the product.PROS :* Light weight. It is similar to carrying a 100 pages notebook* Sound Quality at the best level especially Bass is simply superb.*Noise cancelation is at the top.. I travel by local train often.. I sat near the Window seat and used this headphones one day, I was totally amazed at its noise cancelation. I am unable to hear a little bit of sound of the Running Train.*Dual working mode. This is simply superb, even battery is dead u can listen to music* Best battery.. I charged for less than 2hrs and used it about a week.*Cheap when compared to other brands. No brand offers Wireless headphone at this rate. Most of brand doesn't offer dual working mode too.*Boat offers one year warranty for this product. Any defects BOAT collects the product from door step and repair it and return it to the door step.CONS:*Only I problem with this is that it's not durable. But it's natural that if the headphones is of light weight then it won't be durable but it is better to increase the weight rather than being less durable.* Since it's less durable you have tocarry it with any POUCH else on Neck,. If you keep in bag there are more chances that it may break.*Wired mode and Bluetooth mode doesn't have same quality for all songs. Don't know whether it's song's mistake or Rockers 400 ''s mistake.*It's very small, at the initial stage I felt pain on ears if I use it more than 15 minutes.. Later I didn't feel such pain..Now my personal opinion is, if you are looking for a good headphones at cheap rate go for it.. Wait for any special offers. I got it on INDEPENDENCE DAY SALE @ 999 INR I also got 50rs as AMAZON PAY cashback.. So effective price is 950 INR.Wait for a best deal"
5,"I'm giving you a Honest ReviewPros1. Come with both feature you can use Wireless and Aux2. It is Foldable3. 6 Hours battery life after 2 hours of charging4. Good Noise CancellationCons1. Build Quality is Not good you should buy A headphone case2. It will hurt your ear but only for sometimeWithout thinking just go for it, No big brand will give you this Feature in this costHope You like my ReviewHave A Nice Day"
5,"I thought after reading the reviews, that the product would be bad, but trust me Boat Rockerz 400 is a very nice product. I personally am using it for about 6 months and there is no such problems. The provided aux cable and micro usb cable are of good quality and will not disappoint you."
1,You gets what you pay for. The headset is on offer for 999 most of the time. It's not worth it's mrp.The headset is very uncomfortable to wear and it's difficult to use for even 15 mins during the first week. The cushion is very hard and the finishing is rough. Both not suitable for a headset which press over the ears.The sound quality is just average what you could expect from a sub 1000 headset.One more annoying issue is the automated messages on turn on and connecting.
4,"1500 for a wireless headphones.... bit firm on your ears while using it for a long time, as need to adjust it them after 10mins, but amazing sound quality and a very good battery back up for around 5 hours. Boats banging... Definitely it's a yes from me..."
5,"Being wireless headphones, I was bit unsure of the output, battery longivity and the strength of the product prior purchasing it. The following review is after 2 months of normal every day of usage of 1 and half hours during my commute.Sound quality-----------------Positives-----------1. The output of music is fine and decent.2. Syncs well with every genre quite well to give a balanced sound output.3. The quality of the sound is deliverd as it should even at high volume level prohibiting any kind of distortion during playback.Negatives------------1. When connected via Bluetooth, if you are using online music apps say gaana for streaming music and you want to toggle to a chat app say watsapp or the sms interface to write a message, a slight attenuation of sound is heard when the headphone is trying to switch from music playback  to capture and play the keypress sounds through them.2. At low volume, noise cancellation is not effective enough irrespective of the genre being played.Battery life--------------Positives-----------1. As I have mentioned before, I use them almost 1 hour and 30 minutes in a day for 5 days a week which turns out to be 7 hours and 30 minutes as total usage once I charge them full. Although I charge them after the fifth day of use but then also the battery is not low which requires immediate attention and charge.2. It is great battery performance for what the company claims and for being a budget Bluetooth headphone.3. Even if some one who is a heavy user and find their headphone as their best companion for 8-9 hours a day, once charged full, it will keep you entertained for a good amount of time.4. The headphone can be used wirelessly even if it is on charge (NOT ADVISABLE).Negatives------------1. There is no way or an indicator to check the status of remaining charge of the battery and estimate the time to go zero.2. I have observed the charging time from 0% to 100% takes almost 2 hours and some minutes. So, please make a note of it.Material quality-------------------1. The design is simple and is sturdy.2. The cushion at the over head band is ok and gives optimum comfort.3. The height adjustable extenders seems to be metal which makes product feel strong and promising for a good amount of time.4. I have read multiple reviews where they say the cushions on the driver is painful initially and persists if used for long period. As the drivers are of standard size and not too big, if not placed correctly on the ears, may create pain for few. As it is greatly adjustable, just make sure you are expanding the sides of the headphone fully and just gently keep them on the ears. Do not press them inwards with your hands much. Thus, you can get good comfort and enjoy your music.My final verdict-------------------I am having no complaints about it's built quality, sound quality and battery performance. For a even better experience, I may upgrade to an expensive and high quality product some other time if I need to. But, I am convinced to a considerable extent with the headphones."
4,Sound quality is good. Not comfortable on ears if you wear it continuously. It pains due it's tight grip. Outer plastic package cover was intact but inside headphone package was in damaged condition. Not good.
2,"My expectation was too high for Boat. I bought a Bluetooth speaker boat 600, it was great. But this headphone have some problems. It makes a small ""piiii"" kind of sound and the bluetooth connection sound is so loud and cannot adjust the sound, will damage your ear. The sound is better than intex, iball and other lower brand obviously and battery life is good. So, 2 stars is what I'm giving."
1,"TL;DRBass is good for regular songs, but disappoints with bass heavy & trance music. Extremely disappointed with the Bluetooth performance. Also, amazon needs to re-check the hours they asked us to set for work addresses.It's been hours (not days, hours) since I received this product. I'll start with Amazon.I got this delivered to my office address. It says on my profile next to the address that it is my office address. Delivery times till 6 PM. But the delivery guys choose to ignore that tidbit. They decide to deliver it at/after 9 PM. Now, since the office is closed, they decide to leave it with the security guard. They did not call me to check if it was okay to leave it with the guards. I had not mentioned that it was okay to leave it with the guards in my order details. They just decided to do so of their own accord.Now we talk about the headphones themselves. The images were misleading to say the least. The earpieces are significantly smaller than expected. I was hoping they would cover my ears, but they are too small to do so. Then comes the most common problem that they are too tight. But since the boat support guy says they will loosen over time. Here's to hoping for the best. In the meanwhile, my ears will get crushed.Here's another problem. I wear prescription glasses. Now my ears are being crushed in the front by the headphones, and in the back by the temple (and temple tips). The only good thing that came out of this experience was that my glasses no longer fall off my face when I face down.Nevertheless, I put them on, hoping to hear some music. The Bluetooth connected easily, no problems there.But, and here comes the next issue, I can't shake my head to the music & I can't turn my head if somebody taps my shoulder. Basically I can't move my head. So now it feels like I have a neck brace that does not actually support my neck.Then, a fly happened to pass by. I raised my hand to move it from the way. And lo, another problem was displayed. If something appears in between the two i.e. the phone/laptop & the headphones, the Bluetooth starts cracking. And before we start blaming this on the laptop/phone, I tested this problem with a Bluetooth loudspeaker. Things worked fine there.And just to clarify, all of these issues happened within a distance of three feet (About one meter).Then I decided to test out the bass heavy songs. Put on trance music. And I was a little surprised that it was able to keep up. However I then cranked up the bass to see what happens. And was soon disappointed. The low frequencies in bass heavy trance are not as prominent as they should be. This is noticeable when there are prolonged periods of low frequencies.The aux cable is okay, nothing great. Works fine as expected.To sum up. It's a BIG NO from me.Update 1;I received a call while listening to songs, so I tried to test out the mic and if it works. I was shouting while wearing the headphones and the person at the other end of the line still complained of low voice. This happened once, so i thought, maybe they had the volume at a very low setting, then i got another call, this time for work. They also complained of not being able to listen my voice. Then i tried calling a friend and see if it works with them, as I can ask them directly to test it out with me and have them increase/decrease their volume. But sadly, no luck there.Had to return them. Maybe this was a defected piece. Placed for a replacement product. Let's hope the replacement they send is better.Update 2;The replacement they sent me was just as bad as the original one. Meaning, no boat rockerz for me. Very bad product. Design & Quality both. Changing the 2 star to 1."
4,"I'm using this Bluetooth headphone from past 2 weeks on a daily basis.Let me help you with its genuine PROS and CONS..😊***************************************** MUST WATCH THE VIDEO FIRST 🎥*****************************************PROS⏭️⏭️★ Amazing design .★Easy to connect.★ Sound quality is good.★ bass sounds good too.★  Compact and foldable earcups.★ Soft ear cushions (but on continuous use ear become warm and sweaty.)★ easy to control through given buttons.★ Rechargeable and comes with usb cable to charge it.★ When you ping it with your device, the blue LED light Starts blinking.★ Battery life is decent.★ Light weight as compared to other.*****************************************CONS⏭️⏭️★ When it comes to use hands free calls, I have seen a bit lags issue.

5,Super Duper.... Really Rocking...Superr Bass(u can feel vibrations.. when u play bass boosted songs :D )Super Battery.Perfect Fits.Ultra light Weight.Noise Cancellation good.You might feel tight on ears...But after 2-3 days..Its perfect.Mic working good.. Next person thinks ur little bit away from ur phone.(not an issue)Cushions can be better..but can compromise at this price. :PSuper Price Got it for @699/-Go for it..!!
2,Ok where to start...Product build quality is very good no doubtBut..The two primary issues that forced me to sell it to someone 2nd hand1st Too tightIf you wear glasses... Just don't buy it..It will give you red swollen ears in pain2nd unbalanced audio..Mine one had left side louder than right one..Which was giving me another kind of headache..It's just annoyingFinally sold it to someone
1,"Sound quality is fine. Build quality is fine as well. Battery life is amazing. But, the bass is just bad (when you connect it to your smartphone). When you connect it to your lappy, the bass is good or decent enough to satisfy your ears. And never ever buy the white variant, coz it gets dirty very easily and I don't see any option to clean it. So, once it's dirty, it's dirty forever. And for pubg players, you just can't hear a thing when you play pubg using the Bluetooth mode. You'll have to connect the aux cable to hear it."
1,"It's been 2 months since I am using these headphones and I totally hate them.1. when wear the ' on-ear ' headphones, hurt your ear after a while.2. male to male aux audio cable comes with it, doesn't work.3. during a call, others can't hear you properly.4. on switching to the next/previous song you would hear a hissing noise.** seriously don't go for on-ear headphones try other typesWhat's the meaning of using a headphone to listen to beautiful music along with pain caused due to wearing it."
3,"I got it at an offer price of 1k, so I'll judge it as a 1k headphone.Comfort: Not very comfortable. Ears will hurt after a while. Especially if you wear specs. But you can wear it for an hour or so.Sound quality: Now, I don't expect audio technica quality from boat but there seems to be a common problem in all the different rockers I've tried owned by different people. There is a constant high frequency buzz whenever anything is playing. This is so annoying. The driver sounds muffled but the frequency response is mostly flat with a slight affinity for low frequency.But that constant buzzing sound though. Makes me not wanna use it. And seriously affects my opinion of this headphone.Durability: Its lasted now 4 months and has no signs of wear and tear.My suggestion is you save up and buy something better even if it is at a higher price."
1,My worst worst purchase ever on amazon..It’s not mentioned in description but it has Bluetooth version 2.0 hence you will get terrible audio quality and ringing sound constantly coming from both earpiece while listening music..you will definitely notice it on low volume...It’s 2019 and you will get 16 yrs old technology...Please don’t waste your hard earned money...Great service from amazon got my refund on 2nd day...!
1,Its not good for healthy earing my ear getPain disease with in 4days .Sound came out side even normal volluim.Full sound volume sound spread hole roomDOCTOR SAYS DON'T USE HEADSETSIf you want base sound or healthy ear .But previously I am used sony( rs.8000 )headset it's sound not came out side even full volumeMy ear also not get Pain.Boat company use cheap speakers
5,Best product i use this for my gym purpose and watching moviesI use this headphones on galaxy S8 it's have bluetooth 5.0 so that sound quality increases.pros1 very comfortable2 noise isolation is great.3 top-notch sound quality4 40 mm driver works very well.5 waired connection via aux cable is very handy and usefull for gamers6 distance range was good no lagging issuecon's1 call quality was not that greatfirst i feel sound is not that much louder after i burn those speaker for few hoursjust believe me it give unbelievable performance.really it's awesome
5,"Now its already been so many days using this boat rockerz 400.I purchased headphones from this company for the very 1st time and believe me, this one is really something beyond my expectations even it's better than many other brands I used in the past, as far as price is concerned.So here is my review, what I really observed.▪︎Sound quality is premium in terms of clarity and sharpness, not much distortion even at the maximum volume.▪︎Bit BASE centric, if you love higher bass then you are surely gonna love it.▪︎Noise cancellation is far better than any other in this price range, can surely pick it up for calls as well.▪︎Bluetooth range is pretty good, I roam around my entire house on the same floor, and feels its always connected.▪︎I never compromise with comfort, and in terms of comfortbility it is superb, it is as light, that no one can directly judge while looking at it once, but at the same time due to its lightness it is little fragile, so it should be taken care of.▪︎Battery is literally laudable, I really dont remember when I charged this one last time, I normally use 2-3 hours daily, and its around already a week without charging it.▪︎Aux Support, yes even if there is no charge we can use the aux cable provided.▪︎Price is low comparatively to other brands, so for me its always going to be a value for money deal.So at last the conclusion is, if you are searching for good bass along with comfort,lower price and yes if can take little care off, then you can go for this one without even a second thought.I will recommend this :)"
5,"It is awesome. I got the product delivery before time. Thank you Amazon.The sound quality is the best level especially bass is superb. Noise cancellation is on top and required for conference calls.Best battery backup, charging for 2 hours and I was able to manage it more than 8 hours.It comes with both features wireless and aux.It is also foldable in case required and light weight.Worth for the provided price, it is value for money."
5,"It's best one now a days  as boat is trending today because of its bass and sound quality. It's excellent in condition and durable. Just Bluetooth is weakened sometimes if charging in less or my handset problem , obviously it will but I don't know what happens and I don't care coz it works most of the time best like 9 out of 10. And the headphone is little uncomfortable if your head is big it makes my ears pain you will need time to settle it down properly."
1,"One of the best headphones in the price range.The material quality is good.Sound quality is great...Battery life ***** (5 star)But the disappointing feature is the Bluetooth range.. when I travel in train and keep my phone in the denim pocket and headphones on the ears...the music starts chopping... The Bluetooth doesn't disconnect but the music goes blank, skips..If I then keep the phone in my upper shift pocket or hold it in my hand...it then works fine. Also faced the same issue while travelling in a fast moving vehicle or walking under direct sunlight...But it works flawlessly indoors.I ordered a replacement thinking it could be a manufacturing defect...I received the product in 48 hours... So awesome delivery...and the same guy accepted my return product....but Im facing the same issue with the replacement headset as well....So it seems that the brand is unaware about this defect.I hope boatrockers get back to me on this.After a few days.... Same issue...  When I keep the  phone in the trouser pocket,  the music is not heared in the headphones... Poor reception... Tried with multiple phones/ brands...Moreover noticed a lot of issues when under sunlight.  Don't know you but I face these issues mostly when I'm under the open sky during the day."
1,Be careful. Your ears will get pain due to its poor design. Sound quality is very good but you can not use for long. They do not accept return.
4,"The charging lasts over a day if you use it a lot. Bluetooth connectivity is good, output is great. Only 1 con- if you use it for a long period your ears will hurt a little bit."
5,"Build Quality: 5/5 for overall quality but 4 for quality of buttons.Sound Quality: 5/5 for all types of music , you can listen to the details of the song with the best bass .Battery Life: 5/5 up  to the mark.Bluetooth Connectivity: 5/5 with in minute it was paired for new device it depends on your quality of the phone/laptop you are using, In this case it is oneplus phone.call connectivity: 3/5 slight disturbance at the receiving end not worth for phone on bluetooth avoid or connect the aux cable provided.Value for money: @999 6/5 :)Amazon delivery and Shipping : 5/5 with in 2 days as I am prime member :)Buy it is worth for the money you give for this product."
1,What's the point in selling resale units to customers with damaged packaging!!! If resale units are sold can't they be done in a complete new package!!!And above all the controls on the headphone doesn't work with the Audio jack plugged in!!! It only works in Bluetooth/Wireless mode!!! That's just ridiculous!!!
1,I bought this product seeing thousands of reviews and even 1-2 of my friends had it. But the problems started right in the first week.The headphones keep getting disconnected from the phone's bluetooth as soon as you pause the song or the video and this keeps happening every few seconds which is very annoying. BoAt replaced the product since it was within warranty but the new ones had the exact same issue. Seemed like they returned the same headphones back to me. Now I'm waiting for my 2nd replacement.I would request everybody not to buy these headphones at any cost.
1,"I bought this headphones, thinking that this would be a great product, after watching its ratings. Boy, I couldn't been more wrong.First, if you have glasses(specs) don't even think of buying this headphones. It hurts a lot after 10mins of wearing. You may have this pain hours after using it. Your ears will be crushed between headphones and specs' temples.Second, Even if you don't have specs, you can think of this product, But I won't recommend it.Third, It's microphone stopped working after a week of use. And won't connect with Bluetooth on my phone / laptop.Fourth, *IT CANNOT BE RETURNED! Yes, you could only REPLACE it with a new but same model. If you don't want this product, there isn't much you can do about it after once buying it.The sound quality, noise cancelling and battery backup is good though.GOD, I am writing this review with pain in my ears."
2,PLEASE DO READ MY REVIEW BEFORE BUYING IT OR YOU WILL REGRET THIS.If you are looking for good bass quality you will regret buying this product and if you want Crisp and clear sound quality you will regret it. I request you please don't buy this product at all is you want a normal quality or maybe you can say low quality headphones then you can purchase it. It's really bad quality headphone. I replaced the order so that I was thinking it was a defect part or the sound must be defect but this was my biggest mistake by doing this. They send a defect one with inside box opened already and broken headphone😡 I really don't understand why do they send this broken once why could not they check it while sending to costumers or are they doing it on purposely . Anyways I regret it buying this earphones and wasting my money and I want to return it back again and I want my money back. And I'll go some good brands like Sony or JBL. Pleaseeeee read this review I'm not any bot writing this or I'm not doing it for fun why would I waste my time and write a review 😑 Thank you.
1,"Amazon Delivery and Sound quality of the headphones are ok. Found another problems with this product. I use to use this product 3-4 times a week. Head band broke on 5th month. I called Boat customer care and they said that the band is NOT covered under warranty as it is a physical damage. Product will be covered under warranty if there is an issue with bluetooth or sound quality. if I want to fix the band, then I have to pay. I felt very bad as the band broke for normal usage. Second thing - Ear will pain if you wear it for more than 30 mins. It is unbearable after 45 mins. It is unusable now and  I switched to another brand and it is working perfectly. Bluetooth connectivity is bad. if you are using it while walking, then it gets worse. Don't think about using it over the call. bad call quality. Flimsy plastic build. I will never buy any product of BOAT again."
3,"There is only problem with this earphone - BAD Design! The sound quality is excellent, bass is good and battery backup is also good.. BUT the fitting is so rigid that once you place the headphones on your head, your ears will start paining badly in barely 10 minutes and will be red in no time.. the pressure is too much on the ears and you can't adjust in anyway to make it any better.. Too bad because this would've been a great product otherwise."
4,"The model ""boat rockerz"" itself says It's rocking...Sound quality is gud..it has good bass & one can feel  stimulation of our ear drum..The only drawback is it's not that much convenience.. one can hear songs only for few mins after that the tightness over the head causes pain in our ear & headache... It's  not recommended for long time use."
2,This product is not returnable ... And headphones are painful seriously.
1,"Bluetooth connectivity is pathetic,the moment you start the music and put your phone in your pocket and start walking,you hear grrr sound, and you keep hearing it frequently in between the tracks,and it keeps loosing connectivity completely if you are listening and walking together.bad experience.bad product."
1,"Not Expected from Boat, Waste of Money, I paid for this 1714/- I only Bought this for Pubg GameI am a Big Fan of PUBG game and please don’t even think of buying this product for playing games like PUBG. There is a sound issue while playing the game u r not able to here the sound in game delay 3 second while playing games This happened to me while playing  PUBG only. Moreover, you just can't hear a thing when you play pubg using the Bluetooth mode. You'll have to connect the aux cable to hear it.the mic quality is not so good. it's not durable. but it is better to increase the weight rather than being less durable.Wired mode and Bluetooth mode doesn't have same quality for all songs. when I put my phone into my pocket I constantly have to carry my phone in my hand and that too I has disturbances if I move sound quality is not good these are very uncomfortable not expected this from boat either it is a faulty product or boat makes such bad products my recommendation don't buy it you will regret later and they don't even change your product, Also this blue tooth has pathetic distance. I go at most 4 meters and if there’s no line of sight with the phone connection starts disconnecting.Sound quality is average and sometimes you can feel a disconnect in audio is volume is below a certain level. Build quality is such that you can't wear it for more than an hour because your ears will start to hurt. I use Skull candy headphone before this as comparison boat rocketzz 400 was dumb you can only able to hear base and little amount of songs sounds .and it's connectivity was poor only at aux mode its goodOverall it is an average product but at this price is very high,My ear will start paining after 30 minute usage. Will get distracted. So this product is not recommended for watching film. Another issue I had noticed recently is it does not connect automatically with my laptop which If I goto Bluetooth settings it shows the headphones is connected but I will need to reconnect it again..Waste of money, even my Sony 110 for 599 is more comfy.My expectation was too high for Boat."
4,I had purchased this product one year before.Pros.1) Sound it Loud and crisp2) Very Good Bass3) Very Good Battery Life (I am getting approx 5 hrs 30 mins with one charge after 1 whole year)4) Supports Dolby and Windows Sonic (I had tried both)5) Material is good6) Service is good (In past my service experience with boat is good)Cons1) Its hard one ear (I am getting pain if i use continuous more than 1 hrs)2) Materiel is good but not slandered3) Bluetooth not so powerful (some time Bluetooth starts losing connectivity if any person comes between device and headphones.Its main con is we cant use it for long it hurts on ear.
3,"It’s a nice blue tooth headset. It’s not a very comfortable one though, prolonged use can put a strain on your ears, because it’s non adjustable. The buttons are just okay, as they are not properly designed. The noise cancelling is there but not so much. The ear heads should have been slightly bigger.You can get the phone calls on this devise but it kills the clarity and microphone is not great. Not best for talking on phone, but can manage quick calls.All said, in comparison to other products of similar price range or lower it’s a good headphone. Can say it’s okay for the average sound quality which is not bad but not great either. The battery backup is good, but could have been better. The spine padding is fine. Design wise it’s simple and clean, which is a plus.So if you’re on a budget and want a decent Bluetooth headset, go for this. Don’t have high expectations and this will serve you good"
1,"Extremely uncomfortable headphones, unusable for more than half an hour, extreme distortions at high volumes, its got only battery life going for it, but the on ear design make them pretty much useless."
5,Firstly I would like to give thanks to MI for providing one of the best sounds.I bet you won't get better Bass in this price rangeBattery is one of the bestI have been using it since last 3 days but still 70% Battery remaining.Guys go Blindly and Buy this.Bass is at its best. Very soft and One of the best Headphone.
3,Feels like it's made of cheap plastic and don't sound as good as some headphones in the same price range. Also it's not very comfortable as they are small.
4,"Good headphones.I like themThe Mi Super Bass Wireless headphones are primarily built out of plastic while the ear cups are made out of soft foam which will provide for a comfortable fit even when worn for extended periods of time. Besides, the headband is also cushioned with the similar foam as the ear cups. The left ear cup on the audio accessory accommodates three control buttons which can be used to control all the functions like power on/off, play or pause and changing the music track.The Mi Super Bass wireless headphones weigh 150 gram which is evenly balanced across both the ear cups. The wireless headphones have Bluetooth 5.0 which offers a range of up to 10 m. Besides being used wirelessly, they can even be used be in a wired configuration depending on the convenience of the user. As previously mentioned, they can offer a battery backup of up to 20 hours. In terms of battery capacity, the Mi Super Bass wireless headphones are powered by 400 mAh power which can be charged via a micro USB port.The inbuilt battery takes about 2 hours to replenish from 0 to 100 percent charge capacity. They also have a built in microphone which can be used for taking voice calls, playing games and communicating with the voice assistant on users smartphone. All in all, the Mi Super Bass Wireless are a premium looking pair wireless headphones which are highly versatile and are priced aggressively.Thanks for reading the review."
4,"I am very happy by this product. i will write my review by point by point means what i like and don't  like in this price range. i have got it in 1600rs after cashback in amazon prime day sale.PROS1- Battery is awesome. easily you will get 15+ hour battery life2- Bluetooth connectivity is awesome. as it has Bluetooth 5.03- bass is very good. i will give 3.7/54- its very light weight so you can use it for long hour music.5- its cusions are not fixed, its movable means it adjusts automatically on you ears.6- you will not get big branded headphones in this price7- it look very perimium.Cons-1- its material is not good. its looks they have used cheap quality plastic.2- its not foldable.after using more than 3 days i have found this pros and cons. as per my view if you were planning to purchase this headphone in this price range. you should definitely consider this. because this is latest one also you are getting great sound."
5,Probably one of the best headphones I can take to area 51
2,the advertisement and the headline says mi super bass headphones but its not like that.first of all the built quality is good and appropriate considering the price point.the volume levels are above average in Bluetooth mode and if use aux than it would be slightly better.the main part is the sound where it lags alot.there is no thumping or super bass as advertised.it is with the decent bass with ok ok clarity.it is not for the audiophiles.mids and lows are little bit muted.and at last yes these are comfortable to wear atleast.
3,"After lot of research I was waiting for an headphone from MI which I was expecting would be light weight , can be used for long time but not good for long time use even for an hour.My ear starting paining after 20 to 30 minutes of use.Mi disappointed me."
1,I have been using JBL and boat for quite a few years. This headphone is nowhere near them. Am not sure about the rest of the positive reviews. Personally I felt this headphone is not up to the mark. Returning the product
1,"Built quality is good, but sound is like 500 rs headphone, remeber rest of the money u r just paying for Bluetooth and built quality"
5,"The bass part is definitely there, but Treble is not that much. Charging time is two hours. The charging port is standard USB 2.0 only do any mobile phone charger will suffice also."
1,I am an Mi Mobile user. That's why i jumped to purchase this one. But the headphone has completely disappointed me with respect to its actual job. It has great looks good blue tooth and battery life. but the sound is of cheap quality. tried playing many genres of songs. it fails. also the headphones are very uncomfortable. you cannot wear it for more than 15 to 20 minutes. its just a showpiece with good looks. seems they have started taking indian consumers for granted after the big market share in mobiles. this headphone is just a poor product pushed to indian market. i returned it the very next day to amazon and got refund. stay away from this one.
5,Battery>>Mi claims to have battery back up of 20 hours. it has good backup tested for more than 10 hours.It really charge fast. (10/10)Build Quality>>It is made up of plastic . it looks premium .(10/10)Sound quality >>i wanna say they made a best headphone in this price range. Really Impressed with tuning of bass. But sometimes bass  is too much. (9/10)>> Wirelessly it is sometimes lags! <<Wired it is fine! Don't buy if you looking to use them for PUBG game as it is slow and laggy.
1,Sound quality very poor. Returning this
4,"Occassion / Sale: Prime Day 2019 (15 - 16 July, 2019)Price: Rs. 1,799Effective price: Rs. 1,519 (10% discount using HDFC card + 20% off upto Rs. 100 coupon on mobile accessories)This is only a brief review, will update the review later after extensive usage and testing.Initial impressions are good, the headphones are light in weight and feel premium too. The design is Xiaomi's signature minimalist design.The headphones failed to make an impact in my case. I tried the headphones on my laptop via bluetooth, Mi A2 and iPhone 5S. Yet none of the devices are Bluetooth 5.0 but I don't think it should affect sound quality.Having said that, the clarity is low, bass feels poor and you can feel distortion at high volume levels. Also, it gets uneasy at higher volumes.Interestingly, you get 3.5 mm aux cable along with the headphones and when I used the headphones as a wired one, it regained my faith upto some extent. The sound quality improved a lot when I used it as a wired headphone through aux cable. The bass feels super punchy but the clarity still feels on the lower side.So, final verdict after testing it for around 30 minutes is that it's not the best one when it comes to wireless headphones but it does feel a good choice if you are willing to use it as a wired headphone.My rating: 3.5 / 5I'll update the review after extensive usage and testing along with pictures later. Until then, my suggestion would be, wait for a while and don't rush into buying this headphone like I did."
3,The cusion still hurts as it crushes ears.Bass is too much. The treble is lost somewhere and the music doesn't feel directed to ears.Phone/PC equilizer doesn't work while using on Bluetooth.Good for short duration: 30 min to 1 hr use at a strech.
1,"Sound quality is ok for this price but not that great as Mi also doesn’t claim it provides HD or clearer sound.Battery doesn’t actually last for even 10 hours from a 2 hours charging.Mostly usage comes around 5-7 hours battery. UPDATE: battery is not charging at all even when using 0.5A 5V charger. WASTE OF MONEY.Comfort is somewhat Ok as Mi claims.Operation with buttons is not that either with iPhone, Amazon music. Only pause/play works, no Fast forward or next/previous songs button assigned"
3,Firstly you need to keep in mind that this is a budget headphone. Do not expect it to do wonders. I am no audiophile so i am content and happy with what Mi is offering at this range. The headphones itself are fully plastic but good quality. The ear muffs are comfortable.  Better than the JBL T460BT When it comes to comfort. 20 hours of playback is something that is not offered by any other brand in this category.  The sound quality and bass are more than what i had hoped for. I previously used the Motorola pulse escape.
1,Feels and sounds like a cheap headphone.sound quality is way too bad. Better go with Mi Bluetooth earphones.
1,"Good Headphones, Sound is decent enough, connectivity also is decent, battery surprisingly lasted longer then expected.Built quality quite poor, Cheap, Cheap Plastic, Comfortable in Fit, easy to operate and easy to connect.Reasons for 2 Star Rating :-Packaging seemed fake,Right ear piece stopped functioning in a days use, Completely stopped.Dont know if its the fault of the company or if its the fake products which get delivered in place of genuine one, Very Common Problem faced on Amazon for quite some time.if it's a fake product then please dont consider my review, but who can say if its fake or not, try to get in touch with Mi customer care to verify regarding the same."
1,"First of all, the heaphones are not at all comfortable.Only the ear caps are soft, the headband tries to squeeze your head which is irritating. Wearing them for long can definitely leave you with pains.The build quality of Headphones is very bad, you can feel the cheap quality once you hold the headphones in hand for first time. I have concerns and doubts on its longevity.Other brands like kotion, boat offer better quality in terms of sound and build. Also they are far more cheaper than this one.Sound quality is the worst of all.If atleast sound was good I would have retained the headphones.Since these are ""on the ear""  headphones, it creates a kind of air lock and thats why there is so much of so called Bass which MI is  proudly advertising. This will definitely create head ache if used for hours together.Vocals are no where clear and treble is completely lost.Even at medium volumes, audio from headphones is audible outside which is very bad.Definitely a no go.I'm returning mine.To all those who are interested, look elsewhere do not buy this one."
5,Bass lovers take this immediately... deep bass and good over all sound quality.Design and looks superb and i used 5 hours continuous battery is still above 70%Value for money.
4,"Off all the ove-ear headphones, this has ranked at the top. Mainly due to it's connectivity.Things I liked1) With Bluetooth 5.0 it does have a good range and has crossed a wall barrier with no or less impact.2) Comes with Aux Cable adding another mode of connectivity3) Bass is pretty good.4) Battery life is good if not used at the highest volume5) Charging time is decent enough after complete drain out. Take a bit more that 2 hours6) Ear cuffs are soft and the band is decently tight. Though it may tend to loosen up a bit after regular use. The plus point is that it doesn't hurt the ear lobes7) Looks good with easy to reach buttons on right speakerThings that can be better1) The aux cable provided is faulty. During calls, I the voice fades out and as fix have the rotate the pin to get connectivity. Seems like the connection is not tight enough.2) Although the bass is decent enough, treble is not comparable3) Has memory of only last Bluetooth connection4) My piece did not have one of the cushion tucked in correctly and had to insert it manually. Not sure if the ear cushions are replaceableContent: Over-ear headphones, micro usb, aux cable and manuals"
4,it is also one of the good product from xioamiThanks to xiaomi
1,"First, thank you Amazon for taking the product back and saving my Rs.1799.For me the Audio was good, Build quality is fine but it failed me badly on the comfort.I have a normal size head but the pressure on the ears is too hard and painfulto be able to use for long periods (could not do 20 Mins)."
1,I made the mistake of buying these seeing Mi.The headphones look and feel cheap. The sound quality is absolutely terrible (The earphones provided with your phone have better quality than this). Bass overpowers everything to the extent that it gives you headache after wearing for 20 min. The design is not suitable for long time wearing.Better spend your money on a pair from boat or any other reputable brand.
1,"The quality is not good. No clarity in sound rather high volume. Within five minutes of listening to it, I got headache. Returned on the same dayof purchase"
5,"I was looking for a good pair of headphones under 5000 for watching TV late at night when I can't use my home theatre and this one perfectly fits the bill!It's aptly called Super Bass!Even listening to beat boxing is so WoW. Can hear the breathing in between and all.It has very pleasant sound but it's so good at slightly higher volume that I don't want to get used to it and use it for long and get a headache.It's good in terms of comfort but I am definitely buying a bigger pair of serious headphones someday but for this price, in fact, I can easily say there is nothing this, not even close for 4 times the price of this!Melody songs like _Pani Da_ feel very warm and welcoming.Bass is spot on!Volume buttons work like a charm on the fire stick which is very important for me.For movie watching, the way this delivers audio, it's probably everything you can ask for. When you don't want to disturn anyone yet you want the full home theatre effect, this is definitely the one to go for. The sounds of a gun discharging - feeling it in your gut. You get all this. It will surely put you in your own bubble, isolated. Probably not the best for office  since you definitely won't hear anyone call you.Overall, I am super happy with these and I think I might buy a few more for friends and family!"
1,"I am using this product from last 4 months and when I use Aux cable which came with the product and when switch it to Bluetooth connectivity my Right side speaker is not working and when I tried to call on 18001036286 customer care it saying constantly that all line is been busy.Amazone must have to provide Email or responsible contact detail in the Warranty section, Because when product malfunction then we can easily reach to relevant customer care. I am hustling to reach out customer care my Warranty is about to expire still not received any solution I have tried everything. DO NOT BUY MI HEADPHONES CUSTOMER CARE IS NOT WORTH."
1,Can't use after 30 min ears really hurt; sound quality is average; bass quality is bit over average; Bluetooth sucks; not worth the money; only good thing? Battery backup;returned it after 2 days
4,Pros:-Great audio quality for the price-Good amount of quality bass-Connects with both wireless and wired-light weight-looks greatCons:-Build quality is average-Ear hurts after 30 mins of use.-Audio leakage-call quality is averageOverall a good product but require some modifications.
3,"Out of 5Build quality: 3Plastic body. You can't fold it which may break easily if keep in backpackSound Quality: 3Bass is ok but not that clear, it just hump but not that punchy.Battery life: 5You don't to worry about the battery life. It last as what it says so.Bluetooth Range: 5You can still roam around with it even if you're charging your phone.Comfort: 4You can wear it for 2 hours but you got to remove it for atleast 5 mins. It's normal even with other brand like Sennheiser too.Price: 4What else can we expect? A battery life with good Bluetooth Range and yes it's comfort to wear too. But you got to compromise with sound quality which you would expect from all headphones."
2,"As opposed to its description here in Amazon:1. the bass is not at all deep,2. the bass distorts at higher levels3. the bass-treble balance is poor.4. voice becomes muffled affecting audio clarity badly.5. Noise cancellation very poor.However, I cannot stop myself from appreciating the:1. Connectivity (Bluetooth 5.0 is awesome : Definitely faster and upto 9.5 metres)2. Battery capacity (Salut!! : 18 hrs playback and 8 hrs standby on 75% volume)3. Build Quality (Not cheap at all but not sturdy either)4. Comfort (Average)5. Form Factor and Style : About the right size but folding mechanism would have been more welcomed. Full marks on Style.I personally opine the main purpose  of a headphone is the sound. And hence sound quality supersedes everything. No product bought from Mi has been a disappointment save this one. Most of the earlier products from Mi were marked manufactured in India under Make In India initiative. But these headphones are marked manufactured in China. That may be the reason or not. Returning this one back to Amazon now."
4,"My ears pain if I continuously use it for like 1-2 hours😑.I have been using this headphone for almost a year now and it is still in perfect working condition. It is available in two colors, I got the black and red one. It comes in Mi's branded box with a USB & AUX cable. So the best part is, it can be used wired or wirelessly.Quality(5/5): USB & AUX cable are quite sturdy. Headphone is adjustable and made up good durable plastic which makes it lighter in weight. Ear & Neck cushions are of good quality, nice and soft,Battery(5/5): Indeed is amazing. It takes around 2 hours to get fully charge and last around 15-18 hours easily.Bluetooth connectivity(5/5): It comes with Bluetooth 5.0 and is compatible with all phone brands. I did not face any issue in connectivity till date. It connects to two headphones to stream music from the same phoneSound Quality(4/5): As mentioned the in-built 40mm high performance large neodymium iron boron unit has a bass output that is deep and impactful and Indeed bass is powerful with good sound quality.Noise cancellation(4/5): Is amazing when listening to songs but during calls it throws lot of background noise, though the voice is crisp and clear.Altogether, it is still at the top from most brands at this price range. Go for it!!"
2,"Sound quality and bass is super for its sound driver segment,but not comfortable for ears. My ears started paining after using for 1 hour"
1,"Really Feeling totally disappointed with Mi. Bought Mi Super Bass headphone on the day it was launched. With 25 days, right side is not working. 🤦🏽‍♂️.Pros: Battery and Bluetooth connectivity.Cons:Whole room can hear what you are listening to.One side stopped working within 20 days of use.Average Sound quality."
1,"Just to make you all aware this is Made in China. It has cheap plastic built in cover. I returned it on 31st May and since then waiting for return pick up but no clue no when it is going to happen, no communication and you can not connect any one in amazon to get any detail. extremely poor customer experience from Amazon. Product is good or bad is something less worry part. Amazon platform poor experience and close communication channels is a bigger worry to me. I know this comment is not getting publish. But Hoping at least it will each to the eyes of Amazon team and they will take some corrective measure to improve the Amazon Platform experience"
2,"Product looks good but after using it for an hour, I am getting sever ear pain. Hence returning the product."
5,Started using this headset on 6th September and WFH zoom calls. It's excellent. I had no issues with it. The ppl on the other end of the call also can hear very clearly... Bluetooth range is something surprised me... It's really good. Battery life: I am using for calls for 8 to 10 hours on an off daily and on the 4th day the battery is still 30% left.Only discomfort I could say is the ear pains and sweats well I guess it's normal with any over the ear headsets. So will not mark this as product's drawback.In whole I am fully satisfied with the purchase and the product.
1,"Mi nailed it once again, I don't think you will get a better product then this at this price point. Battery is just wonderful. Well done Mi team.Revised FeedbackI noticed that volume up key is not working on 12th day, so could not returned to Amazon, then I visited MI service center and they refused to take responsibility, ultimately I dropped in e-waste collection box in same service center."
5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
4,Very nice sound quality nd good bass ..nd bass quality nd sound not harmful to hearing ...Very nice 👍👍
1,"On very first time after connect with my phone one Right side speaker are not working.Very bed product,Package are broken from inside.Please don't buy cheap items, buy at least modarate items. After reviewing all comments. Don't impress by Hrithik,Go with product quality."
3,"No return option available, placed for replacement.1. Received the product at 12:30pm,tried to turn on but it seems the battery was drained out so put it on charging using cable and power bank.2. Once plugged in, a small red light glows indicating charging process and in 1 hour that turns to blue to show complete of charge.3. At 3:15pm paired it with my phone and started playing PUBG mobile, Bass seems to be high and conversations are audible but not excellent.4. At 3:40pm I start getting ""Battery Low"" announcement during the game and headset shuts down by 3:45pm.5. Kept it for Charge again which took from 4:00pm to 5:00pm to turn blue again.6. At 6:15pm turned on headset and paired it to Phone and started playing songs on Wynk.7. Bass is good and dominated the song while FM is not good based on poor signal reception quality.8. At 6:45pm the battery low notice starts again and shuts down in 2 minutes.Received the replacement, kept the headphones on charge for 1 hour, played songs continuosly for 1 hour battery still shows 70% available. Audio is better than last one(lesser bass). However when connected with Aux cable only one side of headset is audible seems like problem with Aux cable however I can get used to this, Still not totally satisfaction but good buy at rs700-800 price mark."
4,"Good headphone at this price bass is more,moderate and  comfort. Bought at rs.820.Mic issue when on Bluetooth mode."
3,These are my honest review of the Bluetooth headphone after using it for two weeksLet me divide into two categories likes and dislikesNumber 1 likes:-1. The sound quality is average . Bass is moderate overall average in this price category.2. The play pause volume up down button are working fine.3. Battery back up is decent.4. Bluetooth range is good.Dislikes1.You can't use it's for longer period your ears starts to hurt after an hour of usages.2.Takes long to charge.3. Many times there is disturbence in the music while listening as if the Bluetooth connection is getting disconnected and connected automatically.But at this price point it's an average product .
1,"Too bad quality of these headphones. I never think that Zebronics music product quality is like this. I have a Zebronics bluetooth Home theater speaker, only bcz of that quality of speaker I bought the zebronics bluetooth headphone. But this is the poorest quality, also these are too light weight, and the AUX cable is so light. It is like that at any time it can be damaged.I request to all the people plz plz if you are thinking to buy this item,then plz forget this. If you are interested to waste your money then yess you can buy this.But according to me and my family, this is only and only wasting of money."
5,"Had always known Zebronics to provide quality speakers at fractions of cost of others, and this headset didn't disappoint either. Fits well, looks neat, and sound quality is great and seems well balanced among low-mid-high spectrum. Pleasure to use!"
4,"I purchased Zebronics Zeb-Thunder Wireless Blue Tooth Headphone in March this year from Amazon and delivered to me just 2-3 days before complete lockdown.What it OffersObviously over the ear headphoneIt's Bluetooth and so not wiredIt has a built-in FM Radio (See Con Points)Provision for SD Card to load SongsHands-free phone conversationOperates by a battery and it can be charged via  USB for which USB connector is supplied with the Gadget. Only connector no charger, please.It has a surprising and unique feature that no other Bluetooth headphone offers. It is having provision to connect to a phone or any other music source by wire and the wire is supplied with the gadget besides the charging USB connector. This helps us to continue to listen to music even when the Headphone battery needs a recharge.PROS:Excellent and superb audio quality and plenty of bass and sound which can be adjusted to your liking.Good Design aesthetically made and quite appealing to the eye.Good battery life even when not in use for days togetherBest price and easy on the pocket. Surprisingly priced very low at Rs. 772 from Amazon and it's being shown at Rs. 840- today when I checked just now (10th July 2020).CONS:FM Radio Khas Nahi hai. Its like, Is it available? Yes, available type.I could not tune it to all 10 stations that are available in Hyderabad. Normally, when we opt for FM radio,  one of the stations can be listened to, and to get another station, we need lots of patience. Instead, we can as well switch on FM radio on our phone and get it via blue tooth in the headphones.The FM Stations' reception is very poor and always with the FM noise in the background.Although the Head Phone looks wonderfully giving a very expensive look, I am afraid it may not withstand rough use. No complaints on this count so far in the last 3 months.I load my favorite instrumentals to enjoy crystal clear superb quality audio during my morning walk. I am charging it once a week. When it is paired with your phone, the percentage of charge shows in the Bluetooth interface of the phone. So accordingly, we can decide when to charge.Overall, I give 4 stars out of 5(Because of FM Radio 5th star not given) and recommend for those who keep their electronic gadgets out of the reach of children and use them gently and of course who love music with good quality audio."
5,It's amazing with high bass clear sound quality it's totally ossum
5,Like the product as described by the company. The best part is that they are comfortable. I wear them for atleast 3 hours straight sometimes but the don't hurt. AUX cable option is great when the batteries are drained.
5,"Wow! This product is just really amazing ❤️. I loved it's sound . It has a feature of extra bass. The most liked feature by me is that it has aux as well as bluetooth. I loved it ❤️. Of someone sees my review . I will recommend you to buy this product. It's amazing 👌. If some gamer is seeing this, so I will recommend you to use this product for gaming. It feels like you are in the game when you play any game wearing it. At the end I will only say that I really really really love this product 😍!"
5,"Very Good Product Budget For A Good Affordable Price And Sound Extreme Level As Mobile and PC Computer Good Bass level and Sound Quality.Not displayed battery level in Mobile,Only shown Bluetooth icon,Ear muffs also very good to wear comfort..Overall i satisfy..."
1,"frequent disconnection in charging. The red light gets on for some time while charging and the gets off. Again i take out the charger and insert it. Again the same thing happens over and over again.Sound quality is good, no complainBut charging difficulty is coming very much."
1,Too bad sound quality.no bass sound. Very worst product performance.
1,Pathetic I want to return this product but I am not able to as there is no option of return just I can replace.I really don't like the built up quality.Sound quality is also not good.Battery is also not upto the mark after full charge it works only 1:30 hrs.I need money backInfact the box is also damaged and the package came to me was also not packed properly it was also damagedThe product was full of dust as if it feels like it is used product.I have ordered a fresh product it feels like it is used and full of dust
1,I just ordered this product because of good reviews but trust me it's not at all good when it arrived at my place first time its mic was not working properly so I replaced it and the second time when it was delivered it was broken then again when I try to replace it Amazon give me the option for refund so thanks to Amazon for refund.Advice:- Not to buy this product because of cheap rates go for wired headphones at this price they are more good than this product.
5,"The battery lasts a very long time. After a full day's work, battery is at 70% for me. I guess it could last 3 work days if I didn't recharge it daily very light weight no issues with ear pain  cushion is so soft comfort this many features not available Rupees 6000 branded headphones now a days can’t say more about this product no issues at all g productIf you're an audiophile, or you care about the sound quality, all these headphones are mediocre. They are tuned to the taste of the average consumer - there's a lot of bass andSo far these work great! I'm still concerned about the durability, but I'll also only be using these guys for walks and runs around the city for the foreseeable future. Hopefully, that mitigates the risk of damage."
5,"1) micro SD card option of music is the best option to hear it without laptop.2) Battery backup is awesomely good and i use this headphone almost half day nonstop or more but no need to worry for battery level.3)10-12 feet distance no disturbance,4) AUX wire quality is low but working properly.5) material used is feels like of low quality plastic so no idea how long it will run.6) overall i am happy for this product as more than expected good sound quality i got.7) must buy item."
5,This product give its 💯 many of saying bad battery life but that is not true ihave use this headphones for last 4hours and its 50% Now  so it is nice produce nice quality evwn its ear cushion are also perfect if u want many fearures under 1000 then it is a perfect its connect with bluetooth very easily its is comfartable one of its disapointing this is light plastic use it can break if u dont care of it thanks
5,Product is very cost worthy but the delivery service is very bad....the delivery boy came to my gate shout like a freak and left the box outside gate without making any call.... its slight rain outside and the box was kept outside and delivery boy just ran away... I know one should follow the social distancing in this pandemic period but there is a civilized ways to deliver electronic products especially when there is rain outside.... I have no words to describe the such pathetic way of delivery service.... product is nice but highly disappointed by the Amazon delivery service...
1,Pls Don't buy this Zebratronic Thunder  Bluetooth is not getting connected and if at all after much deficultly Disconnects often.  Searching for a service Center and getting it repaired is very deficult since I live in a small town i have to go to a city some 423Km away.  Pls DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT you are throwing your hard earned money in garbage if you go for it.
5,"I thought it's going to be a light orange but i received a deep red which make.me very happy cause my fav color is red. Ok about the sound stereo windinf id really good, bass are really good but not the best. And it cancel noise really good  perfect for listening music or story without disturbing from around sound. And about bluetooth connect really well backup last longer than i expexted really happy but i don't know how long will that be im talking about the battery backup and one last thing we still can connect with audio jack 3.5 that really helpful if the battery backup out ang specially good for gamer. Almost forget we can control the volume, play pause, next and previous directly from the headphone which is really helpful. I will update about the battery backup later and dont forget u can charge it using mobile charger i.e micro cable charger. U will get the micro cable with this headphone free."
5,It's battery 🔋 Life is Just exellent it has loud speakers 🔊 that's why you not need to raise volume over 50% and at this volume it easily last 4 days at 2.5-5 hrs of usage...Connectivity is also good you just press power button for 2 second and it starts then it's blue light blinks till it's not connected ...start bluetooth then once you connect manually fron secound time it will connect in less than 30 second...Bass is not too great but very good and clear sound quality at this price point...And what I feel best is supported memory card and also have very DURABLE BUILD QUALITY..... And of course good battery 🔋 Life...You can buy if your budget is around 600...I got it for 600 rs in sale
1,"I got this product today. After much anticipation and offer by Amazon, I opened the box and connected it to my android using blue tooth connectivity. Sound is awesome, connected quickly checked with the device volume option, it worked fine. When I wanted to check the volume option from the headphones, I found that the volume down was broken. I changed to FM mode, it did quickly after pressing the play/pause button for a few seconds...I found that the volume was decreasing automatically.... I found that the volume down button is stuck and is pressing the volume on it's own."
5,"I know there are many bad reviews on this product but this is fantastick.I love listning songs on this and it works great awsm cooolllll and fantstick.Go for it.Don't wait just buy it now. No need to read more reviews just go for this.Go.........It's mic quality is just awsm and stunning.I love its bass.Thank you seller, zebronis and amazon to give me such a great product.It's battery life is just awsm..........."
5,"Pros:Excellent built-in quality.Bass quality is superb.SD card support.Over 8 1/2 hours of battery back.Useful while jogging, walking etc.Comfortable for hearing.Cons:Time delation.Not that good for gaming.  Totally, go for it."
5,Used it for 3 weeks and now I am writting this review. Sound quality and bass is good at this price range. Battery life is enough for a day. Wired connection can also be used if the battery is drained. The sd card slot works well. Volume controlls are nice. Noise cancellation is satisfactory.
5,"All-rounder like Kapil Dev 😁Bluetooth, superb bass, volume control, provision for direct non Bluetooth connect, can play music independent off any other device from a micro SD card , FM radio,Comfortable to wear and audio is excellent.Only thing lacking is provision of a mic to equalise music and conversation.But, I can live with that deficiency."
5,I got this Zebronics Thunder for Rs.599 which I would say is an amazing deal and like any other headphone it does has some pro's & consPro's :• It's really damn cheap 599/- as compared to other wireless headphones.• The packaging was great.• Battery back up us preety good 9hrs/per charge and it takes around 2.5 hrs to get it fully charged.• The ear cups would you a comfory experience.• The sound quality is pretty good if you listen to songs from Spotify but it lacks lil bass as per me while playing YouTube videos.Con's :• The build quality seem to be delicate so need to be little extra careful.  Over all I will rate it 4.2/5.
5,This product is great for this price go using this for 4-5 months now and just works amazing. Bluetooth connectivity is so strong that i can leave my mobile device connected with this headphones at a corner of room and walk around whole house waring these without any issues ( connectivity can easily penetrate 2-3 walls). Don't over charge it 2.5 hours is max. It works perfectly fine otherwise. Most beautiful part it is that it's over ear and soft and comfortable.
5,Best quality product from zebronicsPremium quality......Bass is good listen joker song on YouTube full for bass experience..Only drawback is FM radio range is not so goodBut working fine ☺️😊😀Highly recommended by me.
5,"Wow!. Its amazing guys 😍😍😍. Build quality is decent, but the sound quality is Awesome. Deep bass and crystal clear sound. You can hear the each of the instrumental sound in songs. If you are a normal user. Then it is the best choice. But if you are looking for a headphone for gaming, then its not recommended. Because there is some delay in game, while it's connected with blutooth. But if you compromise wireless mode and play games by connecting the 3.5 mm cable, given inside the box. Then you can go for it. Battery backup is also very good 😍"
5,"This headphone is one of the best headphones I have ever used (in this price segment). Sound clarity and quality is awesome. Bass is moving, and the equalization has been done really good. The best part is the battery backup. It has an amazing battery backup. You can continuously use it for straight 24-28 hours without interruption. I'd recommend this headphone to anyone who wants it in the budget segment. Close your eyes, and go for it!"
5,Better quality sound and battery than expected. Charges very quick in about 30 mins and a playback time of 8-9 hours. Couldn't have got a better product at this price. Purchased for ₹700 in the Prime day sale.
5,"Yes good I will recommend it best in listening music , watching videos,mainly playing ping/ free fire best experience.yes it is best in low price for listening 🎧 online classes.it has both blutooth and wired both with same sound.it us better upto some what I'm noise cancellation while listening music.i kept charging for 3 hours It worked for 4 days(**note** only for online classes daily2hrs)so buy .I bought this item in 600(**best deal of the day**)offer."
5,At first I got a broken damaged product but then I replaced with this red one and I swear this is the best low cost headphones I have ever seen. I had used a lot of products but it has some special specialities...1. Wireless Headphone2. Price is only Rs 800 which comparatively very low to other in market3. Very comfortable to wear and cusions provide xtra comfort.4. It also runs in pc very well with both aux cable and Bluetooth.5. It has also a ad card slot6. It has an inbuilt F.MI am very satisfied. Thank You Amazon. Love You 💕
5,"Excellent product for personal use.Lightweight, good battery life, ergonomic, loud, clear, robust, looks trendy.What else do we need ? And all this for a mere ₹ 649 !!!I ordered it for the kids so that I don't mind if they break it, but it eventually ended in my work table due to its wonderful quality. Ordering one more for kids."
5,"This is one of the best headphones ever. Useful for students and people who listen to music. The feature of both wired and Bluetooth mode makes it even cooler! The FM mode works fine but not great. Requires a particular alignment of the headphones in order to receive the signal. But an overall awesome product. The battery backup is very good. The cushions are soft, do not make the ears sweaty, and no earaches. They are broad and fit well, making it comfortable to use."
5,"To begin with I will recommend this product to everyone. Seller is & Amazon is very good in service & Delivery. Product Quality with regard to material, finish is very good. Look wise it is sleek item. Sound is excellent. Controls are very easy. Its On/off & Call pick at side is what it makes it superior among the other headphone. In all a very very good product. One must opt for it. It is VALUE FOR MONEY. If you are looking for HeadPhone go for it."
4,"I loved to listen music with earphones. I have already used JBL c100si & c200si. I bought this one to gift someone. I used this JBL C50HI for 3-4 days & here are some points that will be helpful to decide to buy this or not.Build- Earbuds housing made with plastic looks basic. Wire length is 1.2mtr. It is very thin & twin wire. Wire is not tangle free. It is not feel strong & durable. One good thing is L shape 3.5mm jack so you can put in pocket while sitting without no worries. Overall build quality is average.Sound- Sound Quality is well balanced. Bass is good,Vocals & acoustics are clear even on 100% volume. And as I said sound output is well balanced so it is loud & clear but not so much loud so you can listen music on full volume. You will feel the true JBL Sound with this earphones. I used it with OnePlus 3T.Earphones comes with in-line remote with single multifunctional button & Mic. Mic works good during calls.Overall sound output is good you can feel the True JBL Sound Output with it but build quality is not so good. It doesn’t look premium & durable.Suggestion- If you want listen good quality music then you can go for it but you need to use it carefully.If you want use earphones roughly then go for Realme Buds/ BOAt Earphones but you need to compromise with sound quality.Check earphones videos on my YouTube channel link in my profile."
5,"Lots of request floating in @ What the WATT - Reviews for reviewing this entry level headphones from JBL.  We got this headphones from a colleague and thought its time to post a detailed review after a week of constant usage.We tried plenty of entry level cheap headphones, time and again realizing one thing - ""The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low prices are forgotten""Summary of review1. Specifications – Mic and 1-button remote2. Reasons to buy  a. Great fit and multiple right sleeves for that perfect bass response  b. Amazing bass3. Reasons not to buy  a. Many options available if one can up the budget by 100 Rupees by JBL and other brandsDetailed reviewPackaging - The one startling thing you notice when receiving this product from amazon is what lies beneath that packaging of Amazon is a great package of JBL and JBL has not compromised on their values to provide great packaging and great sound. When you compare the same with Mi or boat its pretty evident that there is a significant compromise on the packaging in order to probably provide a good product, but the compromise in other product department is also clear when one starts discovering other aspects of say MI and boat (Rating 5/5)Design/Comfort – When choice is of great sound - its also for great aesthetics, you probably don’t want to carry an awful product in your ear/body and only enjoy great music, isn’t it ! JBL does not disappoint in design even at this entry level wired headphone. The wire is long (sometimes feels too long) but after a use of 2-3 days we find it quite manageable. The twin cable is back but JBL has some special engineering design for this good old twin cable – “High fidelity twin cable” (rating 3.5/5)Sound – In a nutshell the audio is crisp and loud. This time I believe JBL got the voice of customer and packed a great sound in great price. The beauty of these headphones is you don’t have to screw those in your ear. One of the sleeve will fit perfectly to an Indian ear and that matters for experiencing the bass properly, a bad fit will certainly be not delivering experience of good bass. The shape of the headphone tube/canal is rightly angled – honestly we have not seen such a good design, it’s a little way from typical JBL design but we welcome that change which reflects in sound positively. Low frequency – 5/5, Mid/High Frequency – 4.5/5 – Voice clarity – 4/5. Over all sound is a go from our side and we give these headphones 4.5/5 ratingDurability – We ran an exhaustive test on these headphones especially on the electrical joints/abused them and these held on to the connections really long. Infact lifted a 2KG load with the cables to test strength and they did not break at all – A specially designed test in our labsCall quality - Noise cancellation microphone is indeed a treat to the ears while on call and a one button remote is certainly value for money at the price. We give it 5/5 for the microphone and call quality. Remote is of great usage, smart one button remote in same microphone housing - wonderful (Single press - Mute/start music, Double click - Next song)Overall rating – If you are looking for a budget good sounding product and value the brand you get associated with – JBL C50HI is for you. We rate these 4/5 and not many entry level headphones get past 3.5 rating from our test lab and reviewers. So go for these headphones (pick any color from 3 available).Used it for almost 3 months now - Updating rating to 5/5 - Amazing durability"
5,"The bass response of the earphones is amazing. If the sound is distinctively clear for a song like ""smoke in the water"", imagine how impressed I would have been! The design of it is great especially because it helps in noise isolation when on call and fits perfectly (I got tiny ears :D). And the ear canal fit is amazing. Also one small trick one can do is to twist the buds after you fit in the canal (you can thank me later). I think it's great for the price you pay in comparison to all the other products within this price range + I got it during the sale. It also works great on my laptop. Absolute worth the buy according to me."
1,Bought this one reading all the good reviews but it was so misleading . JBL is known for good sound n bass but this one is complete disappointing. The sound is ordinary n no bass at all . Didn't enjoy music experience at all . Plz don't  give false reviews just becoz it's JBL . Most of buying happens reading reviews as there is no product return in electronics ones bought n only exchange with same one which doesn't really help
1,Product was good..JBL mark ..But worst delivery by Amazon..
5,"Great music.. excellent treble, good base,.. best in this price bracket😍😍"
5,"I recently bought these earphones because I enjoy listening to music at all times and with this one, it's great to do so for its fit primarily.The buds are ideal for all ear size and the canal design makes it stay in ear all times. I did like the fact that it came with 3 sizes for the ear piece, because I can share my earphone with my brother too. And it the large size fits him perfectly well. Another issue that I used to face is with 3.5mm connector is not being compatible with my mobile phone because of the mobile case, but now it is easy and fits perfectly. Compared to the products that are available in this price range, I think this is the best one! The attention to details are credible especially to the connectors and ear buds."
1,"Very POOR quality. Stopped working in 3 days. Even the sound quality is not great. Very unsatisfactory. And the wires are so fragile and thin. Go for boat instead, sturdy and way better quality."
5,"There are three things that impressed me the most: Quality of the music, clarity and durability of the product. The cable is thin but looks pretty sturdy. It's got an ideal cable size for comfortable user experience. I give it a 5/5 for the output of highs, mids and lows! The price is genuinely remarkable and maybe safe to say that it is much better than all other cheap Chinese counterparts of similar price range in the market."
5,"I bought these earphones a couple of weeks back, during a sale. I picked it up without much research simply beause it's a JBL product but I was truly impressed with what I received. A simple but great package that encased the product. I've been using it ever since & may I say, I have butter fingers and have dropped my phone plenty of times but the cable didn't rip or shred at all due to the sudden drop or anything! Giving 6/5 on the make and durability it offers. Somethings that are worth the mention are its sound quality, light weight and bass. As a student, this fits perfectly in my budget but definitely offers a music experience that is beyond any other product of this range."
5,"JBL has always been my favourite right from the first flip, used the speakers before,I have to admit but it's become my most preferred brand for earphones now. The product was not just amazing in its sound output quality but easily better than a boat, skullcandy or a sony. It's simple, tangle free and neat not a whole lot of bells and whistles but performs what it is intended to do really well. After browsing similar products of the same price, it was clear to me that this definitely is the one for me . Strangely enough, I called a few times with the mic and the sound was distinct even when I picked calls while I was in an airport. I have in fact watched plenty of videos with these & pausing it is so much easier with the precise remote button on the earphones. Obviously wasn't expecting such clarity from a product priced at such a low end of things. Fits my budget and exceeds in performance for sure. In fact, I'm so impressed that JBL has introduced a product of this price range too! Another thing that I was really glad to see that its sound quality was not distorted even on laptop."
1,"Sound quality is just ok but if cord touches any object, it humms in ear. That is worst enough to irritate you. Secondly, cord is not of quality for durability, no quality in the play/pause button too. No value for money at all as my  hp earphone is far better than this. And most important, no return, only exchange, means once your money is gone means gone. Hell of it. Sincerely, stay away from it. High brand name only but cheap ordinary Chinese product, made in china. Better to buy of other good, reputed  Chinese brand. Sincerely."
3,Angular eartips fit in your ears and feels light and comfortable. You can use this for hours and won't have any problems. Mic in this provide clear sound while calling even in noisy environments. As this earphone fit comfortably in your ears it provides very good noise cancellation and give you clean noiseless sound. Now comes to sound quality. As this comes with 8.6mm drivers sound is very good with clear vocals. Bass in this earphone balanced well. It's not too high nor too low. These are olus points of this earphone.What i dont like in this earphone that is wire quality. It's thin rubbery wire which can tangled easily.Second no volume buttons.If you want a light weight cheap earphone with good balanced sound you can go for this one or if you want better build quality and more bass you can go for realme buds.
5,This has a perfectly balanced linear sound. Neither too bassy nor too much treble. And the overall quality is good for the price too. I think it sounds almost similar to the Sennheiser CX-180 which is costlier. Also it is light and one of the most comfortable earphones that I've used.
1,Not sure whether it is really JBL or not.  In the Description mention that deep BASS.  We can't hear any BASS in the music.
3,Sounds good but the wires are not looking that durable and you cannot even return the item only replace is available so be careful before you order
5,Review of earphones :-1) Bass - 9/102) Sound clearity - 8/103) Treable - 8/104) Wire quality - 6.5/105) Build - 7/106) Design - 8/107) Plastic quality - 8/10 (considering the price)Overall the earphones are best in its segment.Bass is too good almost like JBL 150.Wire quality is thin but it is okay for this price.Must buy if you want low budget earphones.Please hit helpful button 👇 if u like the review
1,I used this with my OnePlus 6 phone and it's not a quality product. Every now and then one of them stop working and during calls the voice clarity is just okay. I got on exchanged already because the left one wasn't working and with this replaced product it's unpredictable which one would stop working. At times when I'm watching videos left one suddenly stops and during calls at times right one doesn't work.Looks like JBL stop emphasising on quality.Though earlier JBL headsets of almost the same price range worked really good for a year and more at times. Which is not the case now. Mine started giving problem in less than a month.
1,No doubt its a good headphone sound wise. But it stopped working from one side in just 2 months. They replaced the product from jbl service center but didn't provide me with additional warranty so i have 10 months warranty on a new headphone. So i really doubt that they provide you with new ones. Its going to be usefull as long as your warranty.
5,"I am using this product for more than 11 months till now.1. Mic is very good quality,sensitive to low sounds (in case you need to whisper :P )  But no button near mic.2. Easy to listen for long hours.3. Maintains the genuine bass groove and music quality JBL exhibits.4. Blue colour is extremely good looking, modern and elegant. In case it is unavailable, wait for 4-5 days maximum, it will be available soon. I got it too in that way. Thanks to Amazon for keeping up to their unique standards.conclusion: i prefer buying this over the previous JBLs i bought at 800 and above. it gives same music and bass quality, dont worry."
5,"The bass response of the earphones is amazing. If the sound is distinctively clear for a song like ""smoke in the water"", imagine how impressed I would have been!

5,"A few days ago I decided to buy a earphone within the sum of rupees 500. When I saw the earphones on Amazon it was difficult to me to choose between Boat Bassheads 100 and JBL C50HI. I was confused. So I bought both of them and after using for 2 days I returned one of them.In the next day after ordering the Boat Bassheads 100 was arrived. I used it. It is nice. Build quality was not too much durable as expected in this type of budget. Also wires are not tangle free. Its 3.5 mm pin is not L-Shaped so it's provide some pain when you plugged it in with the mobile and put the mobile in the pocket. Sound quality is nice but little bit much louder with full sound. Bass is lower than I expected. The main problem is the mic. The mic is little bit far from your lips so when you need to talk you have to hold it with your hand near to your mouth, it is a pain when talking with someone for a long over earphone. This headphone easily fitted in my ear but it becomes uncomfortable when using continuously for over an hour. Earbuds are also uncomfortable while laying on the bed.After two days of ordering JBL C50HI was delivered to me. Build quality is same with the Boat Bassheads 100. But JBL C50HI has a L-shaped 3.5 mm pin which is comfortable option to plug it in when your phone is in the pocket. Sound quality is more than I expected. Too clear, balanced and pleasant sound. Not too loud just the perfect balance. Bass is superb. The mic of this JBL earphone is placed just beside your lips so you don't need to hold it with your hand while talking with someone over earphone. It is also a perfect fit in my ear and too comfortable for long time usage. I also used it while laying on the bed for more than 3 hours continously it is perfect. In this JBL earphone's earbuds marked with 'L' & 'R' so it is easy to discover that which one will fit in which ear. I just love this one.Therefore I returned the Boat Bassheads 100. Hence I will suggest you to buy the JBL C50HI if you confused between the former and latter.But remember Boat has a 1 year warranty and JBL has a 6 months warranty. Your choice.Edit: The date is 5/11/2020 today and it has been 1.5 years since I bought the JBL earphone. Still working fine. However, the 3.5 mm jack of my mobile might has got some problem since earphones stops working after 5-6 month of daily usage. First time when my earphones were not working I called the JBL customer care because it was under warranty period. As no JBL service centre is located near my location they asked me to send the damaged product to their Gurgaon office. It costed me 35 rupees to send it via Indian Post. Within 3 days I got a new earphone delivered to my address. The same problem happend after 6 month again. Since warranty period was over and I already had taken a replacement I thought I might need to buy a new one. However, I wrote an email to JBL along with the invoices. They saved me again despite exceeding warranty period. That time I wasn't asked to send the product. They told me to cut the wires and mail a picture. I did it and got a new earphone delivered again.Customer service of JBL is incredibly awesome. 🙏"
5,Very good Sound
4,Excellent in terms of audio but poor in terms of build quality
1,"Bought this product trusting the JBL brand. But this is a sub standard product from JBL. The sound quality is not up to the mark at all. Noise cancellation... there's no such thing. Bass quality is next to nothing. All in all, a very inferior product.The lesser priced MI earphones are much better. I would suggest everyone not to go for this.Also, to top it off, I asked for a return to which Amazon said no, we can only replace. Now Im stuck with this sub standard product."
1,I bought it in October 2019 and it is may 2020 and has not been a year and one side of the earpiece has already stopped working. Probably the quality of the  product is cheaper than it's price . I didn't expect this to happen atleast for a year from a product of reputed brand like JBL. Totally Disappointed.
1,Average sound quality..Not at all durable...started giving me trouble with the mic just after 2 monthsWeird activity with my phone is happening ever since I started using these...Volume goes up and down rapidly and automatically... 👎
4,"First of all, in the past three years I have owned more than five earphones or so...when it comes to Skullcandy (which I have used three of them) seems quite good when it comes to music quality, each lasted three months since the jack or the wire started to break inside...leading to disfunctioning of the earphones...after consecutive use of three of them I switched to a Philips one, this one lasted two year...which I am glad with the outcome...and this JBL one is going to be my fifth one, as far as I know this one seemed pretty good quality when it comes to sound and bass...but I hope the wire quality could have been better... overall the durability is quite good...but let's see how long can these last...(fyi I never used earphones in a harsh way...just popping 'em into my ears for some music, while studying or during leisure time)"
2,"Sound quality is awesome but the built-in material not looks so durable.I bought it 3 times but every time I found that after few days one side gets non functional. & due to warranty policy if little bit rubber part cracked than service center won't accept exchange,so there is a waste of 1 year warranty.Please prefer Mi earphones if u want in this or less budget which is more durable."
4,Powerful bass very strong cable an unique color and design just blindly go for it
3,"I am a music freak, i always spend time listening music, i spend atleast 2-4 hrs in my day listening music.I don't recommend these earphones for a guy like me because, this doest have punchy bass which is the main thing i always wanted in my earphonesSo for bass i give ☆☆☆Comming to point ""for working out"", i also don't recommend this because as you know this pair has very low quality rubber wire which is not tangle free, so this everytime you take out these from your pocket, you'll have to spend 2-3 mins detangling your earphones. Major drawback! ☆☆After getting these pair of earphones in to you ears you have to consider and you have you accept that other than your songs you'll here lot sounds as the wire wont absorb the impact it travels into you ear, what i mean is, thes doesn't have any noise cancellation until or unless you are sitting somewhere and not letting the wire touch any of your body part, it makes sound as it touches something, ☆☆"
4,"Build quality is cheap, sound quality is not.I have used many JBLs, Sennheiser, Boat, Mi, Focal, Audio Technica, Soundmagic to name a few. It's been a while since I saw such flimsy wire on an earphone, so look for something else if build quality has more priority. It's useless talking about it, let's talk about sound.I am straightaway comparing this with the more expensive C100SI, 150SI, Sennheiser CX180 and Focal Sense 100SI although it's way cheaper. Sound is crystal clear without equalizer. In fact, all JBLs I've used have a really well balanced output. Sure, 9mm drivers on C100SI, the sennheiser and the 8mm driver on the focal produce more bass than the 8.6mm on this one. I changed the ear tips to the larger ones and it did quite the trick. Too much bass actually makes the experience uncomfortable after some time. This one has natural bass, with very good mids and highs.Comfort: 5/5. It's plastic. It stays in the ear and doesn't feel like much when it's in there. Unlike metal build, plastic is lighter and doesn't fall off + angular tips help a lot. My focal sense slides out at times and non angular design makes them uncomfortable after 30 minutes, no such issues with this one. The ear tips are super soft.Loudness: Loud enough to cause problems at high volume but not as loud as the focal sense or the sennheiser. Boat basshead is loud but emphasized bass kind of kills the sweetness on those earphones...yes, this is where a balanced output is appreciated on the C50HI. Sound perception is subjective though :)Durability: I don't think these earphones would last more than a year, none of my JBLs did, even with better wires. Roadside earphones have wires like the ones on this one. No gold plated jack but that doesn't make any difference.If you can overlook build quality and need a really good sounding earphone within 500rs, this is it. Nothing else beats it in this price range. On everything else below 500rs, sound quality suffers."
4,"First off, I would like to thank Amazon for the superfast delivery. I was not expecting them to arrive in two days, but they did.Now let's jump into the review of JBL C50HIThe overall sound quality is not great, but the bass is punchy. (If you're a bass-head you'll love them)Talking about the build quality, it's good. It doesn't feel premium, but it doesn't feel cheap as well.Noice cancellation works well on the street and public places.Another thing which I love about them is the wire length.The wire is long and it'll make your life easier while watching movies on devices.You'll be able to move around without unplugging the headphones.Overall, a great deal at the price point, you can buy it without thinking much.But if you have a Miniso store in your city, they have some great head phones under 500.I bought a pair of Miniso headphones from Miniso for 290/- and they were immense value for money.The sound quality was close to JBL CH50I."
5,Bought for Rs. 500 during Republic Day offers. This earphone is really sturdy and fits perfectly in your ears.Sound quality is brilliant. Build is sturdy. Dont have to worry about wires breaking.
5,"Model: JBL C50HI in-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black) - JBLC50HIBLKSeller: Appario Retail Private LtdManufactured Date, Place: May 2020Length: 1.2MWeight: 13.6 gDate of Purchase: 20 June 2020Warranty: 1 Year Manufacturer Warranty=== Whats different from C200SI? ===* C50HI is lighter than C200SI (5 grams) - Good* C50HI has an L-shaped 3.5 mm jack - Good* C50HI does not have a gold plated 3.5 mm jack - Bad* Build quality is average compared to C200SI  - Bad* The one button universal remote button design is different. C200SI has a better quality one  - Bad* Quality of wire is better in C200SI  - BadPros:1. Design and Build Quality: Considering the price, design is great and satisfactory build quality too. Except the microphone area, it does look classy.2. Great comfort and fitting inside the ear - thanks to the good quality plastics which makes it light weight and the soft silicone ear tips.3. Snug fit and excellent noise isolation inside the air.4. Superb sound quality. You get almost similar sound experience offered in C200SI which is priced ₹300 more.5. The Bass is also good and it is same in the other JBL earphones in this segment.6. The 3.5mm L-shaped jack is a nice addition in this range.7. Passive noise cancellation with the built-in mic works as expected.Cons:1. Average quality of the plastic built One-Button Universal Remote button. Unlike C100SI/C150SI/C200SI, the click happens to the whole half of the button instead of a round button.2. Wire quality could have been better, but cannot complain much due to this ultra budget range in which it is offered.3. Gold plated 3.5 mm jack would have been a good addition, since you get this in models starting from JBL C100SI which is just priced ₹100 more.4. In comparison with C200SI, the microphone of C100SI captures a little more noise but also you get a clearer sound along with. C200SI recording feels less noisy but sound is also a bit muffled due to passive noise cancellation.Note:The one which i got delivered first time had a defect - one of the earpiece had less volume compared to the other. Replacement got approved and the new one works great as expected, hence no issues.If you are in a very tight budget, this could be considered, else you can go for JBL C200SI which has the same sound quality but with a better build and a gold plated 3.5 mm jack.Also please pay extra attention during the usage since there is a high chance to get damaged due to the thin wires."
1,I buy this but 1 speaker is not working i hope this is not original this is copyI also choose return option but suddenly lock down  and now return option is not came I want to return this but howVery chipper I dislike thisI am sure this is not original
1,"I got this for ₹399 & for this price you are getting a JBL wired earphone. The sound quality is good & the bass quality is also good. Only the wire quality is a little delicate, you have to be really careful while using it. Overall a really VFM product 👍Update - After using 4 months, the mic stopped working...Update - After 6 minths the right side speaker stopped working...Final words:- Don't go for this product.. add 200/300 ₹ more & buy a good earphone.."
3,"I was an apple earphones user and needed something budget friendly. So thought of buying infinity and came here after youtube reviews.The sound quality is good. But it is not enough. When in high pitches,  these don't let the dialog or vocal to dominate. So you would end up increase the volume which is bad for your ears.Normal sounds it works perfectly. Call quality is good. Noise cancelation is okay for the price.Bass quality is good but not as others mentioned. You can feel the bass but won't be satisfied if you are bass lover.Sound quality is good if u can live with first point.Budget earphone which does its job.The reason for giving 3 star is, boat 225 sounds better than this. Multiple songs compared and also action sequences. Boat performs better, but it was heavy. JBL is lite but comes with these limitations.So choose well. It's not bad at all but it's a choice you have to make."
1,The item was good at first. But now it's Mike is not working. I can't talk with my headset bacause the other person can't hear anything. But I willl be able to hear what they are saying. A genuine product will get damaged within 2 months. How you could say it's a genuine product. It's the worst experience I have. Already I have purchased 2 other JBL headsets but this is the first time I have faced such an issue. Poor quality..
4,First thing that strikes u is the shape of its ear buds. After a bit of hesitation plugged in and did not remove them for 6 hours straight!!!!!! . Have used so many earphones but never have I ever felt so comfortable .No hard plastic things that hurt your ears. They r so soft that u don't even feel them even after hours. They don't drop out. So u don't have to keep on adjusting them. Didn't hear any outside noise so much so that my dad and mom were calling my name & I was blissfully unaware. Didn't even hear the door bell ring !!. Bass is loud considering I am more of a vocal hearing person. Sound output was a bit low even at full volume. I have heard cowon earphone give more output. But decent I guess. Ear buds didn't crack even at full volume. Today was the first day. Let's see how long they last ?. At this price of 499 during lightening deal they are worth it.
1,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.So my ₹1499 are wasted now..."
2,"[BIG UPDATE] IT BROKE ALONG THE RIGHT HINGE, I WAS WEARING IT NORMALLY AND IT SPLIT OPEN ON ONE SIDE.The extenders are weak. ( Pic inscuded) My boat 400s broke at the centre too. They need to concentrate less on celebrity endorsements and use the profits on materials and quality control. They still worked so I taped it up with a metal sheet. Still will give 2 stars for the sound.[ORIGINAL REVIEW]I've owned boat products such as the Rockerz 400 and some of their earphones and this is the best experience I've had with the product.Review after 1 day of use and will updatePrice I paid 1800Pros:1. Packaging is good for the first time2. The build and finish is on par with headphones costing 3 times as much.3. Range is next level, didn't experience any loss of connection in my entire house with the phone kept in one position.4. Boat headphones have always been super uncomfortable but this time they have actually thought of that.5. The cups are big and soft enough to fit your ears inside so they are over the ear.6. Base is not amazing, let's just say it's above average, the sound is like a 20 % improvement on the Rockerz 400.7. They have gone for a organic approach for the sound so the highs and lows are just ok .9. Battery life is just as advertised8. You literally can't find a better pair of headphones for less than 3k  for sure.Cons1. I was not sure about how they actually look when I ordered cos the image of the product kept changing, it had flat cups and then doughnut type cups.2. It's not as loud as I want it to be3. They didn't include a aux Cable which is crazy as they ship those with all other models.4. It does get warm in these and you will sweat5. No noise cancelling as they mentioned and passive design is not that good"
5,"This is a premium quality product from boAt-Lifestyle. It's professional grade 40 mm drivers truly deliver you to a music nirvana with a professional fine finish. The amazing battery life and the reduced charge time makes it a marathon runner. The ear cushion provides a comfy experience. The sound quality is fabulous and does not give a pain in the ear. It also is easy to carry around as it folds inwards, it also fold towards the sides which makes it extremely easy and safe to keep on a table. All over it is an awesome product."
1,"The boAt Rockerz line is boAt's super cheap lineup for budget buyers. This will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. It might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is  not something I'd ever recommend buying for your own use.1. Sound Quality - awful. Honestly, the boAt Rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. It isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. Most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. On or off, you can and will hear the outside world. Those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. The soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.2. Comfort - Horrendous. The boAt Rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. The audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. The good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. After removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. The cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. The frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.3. Build Quality - In a word - bad. See a pattern here? The headphones reflect their low price point, and are  entirely made of cheap plastic. The plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. It's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. If you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. Finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. You'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. It's really gross.5. Mic - Absolutely trash tier. You won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. I honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. Callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your PC for voice chat or conference calls. Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. It's really not worth using.4. Final words - Just, don't. Spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. The headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. Save  up some money, work at McDonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. Anything, but not these ones. The only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?1 Build"
5,"These are super comfortable and premium looking headphones. Beautifully designed with very good matt finishing.Sound quality is top notch, good for pop songs. Bass is good enough to provide a decent effect.Ratings - 4.5/5Sound quality: 9.5/10Durability: 9.5/10Bass: 9/10Material quality: 10/10Look and feel: 10/10Bluetooth: 10/10Noise cancellation: 8.5/10Battery: 10/10Cons -Aux cable not provided with the headphones, so can't tell the difference with wires."
1,Never have I seen as fragile headphone as this one. I have been delivered a product with manufacturing defect or it already damaged. The bud from the right side fell off as soon as I unpacked the headphones. Boat rockerz has not been upto my expectation. Think before buying.
5,Material is very poor quality but service also very good. Product replace after 10 month even broken. Now condition is new..👍
1,"Poor build quality. One side of the headphone broke down with normal usage within one month of operation. Never expected such a poor quality from boat. To make matters worse, in entire Hyderabad they have only one service centre which is far away at 15 Kms from the city"
3,"At 1999 they are decent.Pros1. Light weight because made of plastic2. Battery super cool @ 70 hrs3. I am happy at 40% volume, so they are super loud.4. They have thumping base5. Call quality is good for this price.6 connect easily and the Bluetooth range is excellent. I have tried them keeping my iphone in another room and roaming around the home. No distortion or disconnection.7. They fold so are easy to carryCons:1. Plasticky so can break any time2. Vocals are not clear and are dull. If they had crisp vocals, these would have been the best in the industry.3. They would need time to open up. For my ears they feel stiff and tend to heat after 2-3 hrs of continuous usage. Ears pain after this much usage.4. No case or pouch but was not expecting eaither at this price.Over all a decent product in the price range and can keep it as a spare headphone in my bag if i forget my primary headphones (Marshall Monitor BT) knowing they will always have some charge ( 70 hrs battery at 60% volume)"
3,"I bought this 3 months back and it's broken now as it was all plastic and not much flexible. The product says we have 1-year warranty but physical damage isn'tincluded. Bad experience. I have fixed it with fevi quick as a temporary solution, but I don't know how much time it would work.😢"
1,"It has got broken, very bad quality cheap product"
2,The body is plastic even the piece that is exposed upon extension. So its highly likely  to break! Mine broke and yours might be soon as well. So I'll definitely not gonna recommend this. If you already have them then Good Luck!
5,"⚫ SOUND QUALITY - Sound quality is amazing for this price and Virtualization is good .⚫ BASS - Average bass not so good or bad, it lies in the middle .⚫ COMFORT - Not so comfortable , but it is better than boat rockerz 400 , The ear cups are bigger than boat rockerz 400 .⚫ CONNECTIVITY -  Connecting faster to devices . Range is very good , i didn't face any connectivity loss upto 10m and also it has dual pairing feature . There is an audio latency when playing games and No audio latency when watching videos .⚫ CONTROLS - It is very easy to control and They have kept multifunctional or integrated controls ( Refer to the booklet provided inside the box ) .⚫ MICROPHONE - Mic is good, Not as bad as boat rockerz 400 .⚫ NOISE CANCELLATION - They have used passive noice cancellation , It doesn't not seems to reduce any outside unwanted  ambient noises.⚫ BATTERY - Standby time is amazing as mentioned by the Boat , Charging time takes upto 2 hrs 30 mins .⚫ BUILD QUALITY AND MATERIAL - They have used good plastic material but the slider for adjusting the size of the headphones is not good , the wire gets popped out when sliding . Pls be careful when sliding . The ear cups and headband cushion is soft and sweat proof , the water gets easily evaporated.⚫ DESIGN - It features an on-ear design and the ear cups are bigger than boat rockerz 400 . It is light-weight but not a sturdy design , which is not intended for jogging or running purposes . For gym it can be used to do strength or weight training or weight lifiting workouts not for aerobic or cardio workouts . The folding design is amazing for the safety of the headphones , it can be easily folded which is easy to place on the flat surfaces .⚫ LOOK - Premium look with matte black finish , looks sexy when wearing the headphones . ◼️ VERDICT : Waited for a long time to get a good wireless heaphone with premium look and design. You will never get a premium look headphone with hd sound & nice battery backup at this price segment , Overall a great value for money ."
5,"I am using Sony Headphones for over 2 years now, which were sufficiently good for me. They got damaged somehow, and new sony wireless  headphones costed a whole lot than this headphone so I would've had to buy the wired ones, so went for boat. So I'll be comparing these with Sony wired headphones in the same price range (<2000) (believe me, I've used all variants/models)Pros:1. The look: The Black ones that I bought look sick. Fallen in love. If you're a black lover like me, go for boat rockerz 450 instead of 510!🖤2. Bluetooth: it works crisp. I get range in my whole room and even when I keep the phone in my room and go into another room. Excellent.3. Price: I got them at ₹1199 at Republic Day sale 2020. Worth it.4. Aux cable: They provided me the aux cable. Everybody has confusion whether they'll provide or not, but they did to me.5. Sound Quality : Decent. Nice bass. If you have been using earphones, you'll love these headphones.6. Noise cancellation: My Sony ones didn't have noise cancellation but these do, and it's awesome.Cons:1. I've been using Sony and the sound quality of Sony is better than this.2. Bass of the sony headphones was way better than these. Believe me these are not at all bad(you'll love them) but if you are coming from Sony or JBL, you'll get a bit disappointed.3. Latency: If you want to play games with this headphones, you will have to use the AUX cable to do that. Can't play games wireless ly, because the game sound will lag too much, making them unpalatable. I tried PUBG, free fire, call of duty, etc. Nearly all of them. But I'm fine with it really, because when you play games on your phone your phone is in your hand anyway, so use the damn aux cable.Conclusion: I was getting JBL ones for ₹1999 but didn't go for them because they didn't have aux support. Sony wireless headphones do have it, but they cost a lot more (4000 atleast) so couldn't buy them as well.If you are ok with spending ₹4000 go with Sony. If you don't really need an aux cable support go with JBL. If you are ok with wired headphones go with Sony wired as they are in the same price range as these.So at this price range, these are literally the best wireless headphones you can buy. If this is your budget, go for it.I find these sexier than boat rockerz 510 but I'm a black lover and this is my opinion.If you found this review helpful, hit a thumbs up and help others."
1,THREE MAIN DEMERITS👎 NOISE CANCELATION 0% PRODUCT VERY HEAVY AUX CABLE MISSING....... BOAT ROCKERS 400 BEST. ALSO NOT FOLDABLE HEADPHONE. NOICE CANCELATION IS THE MAIN REASON TO BUY BOAT NOT JBL. BUT THIS PRODUCT VERY BAD........
1,I brought this headphone few months ago and now it broke. I just took it out n it snapped. Its even in warranty period
5,"These are the best you can get for the price of 1399/--Sound quality 5/5Used Both wired and via Bluetooth. (Tested wired on the stock aux of boat 400, also a little less bass on Bluetooth but that's expected)-Build 4.5/5Though I trust boAt but the extention of ear cups is via plastic ziplock kind of thing which may lead to early wear and cause headphones to go loose.-Design 5/5 (Over-ear if you don't have large ears)Awesome design and form factor and the cups are comparatively more comfortable and larger than boAt 400.-Inbox contents 4/5The only drawback here is that there is no aux included like in the previous versions but that's not an issue as it was foretold in item description.Edit after a month of through usage :--Comfort 3.5/5Will cause sweating and minor numbness or pain after longer usages i.e. watching complete movies etc.Battery life 5/5Working as described complete 7-8 hours of backup, needless to say it also charges quickly i.e. within 1.5-2 hours.Overall best headphones to get at the price range of 1500/- and below, just wait a bit for lightning deal and viola best offer ever."
1,"Recently ordered the product so after using it for about 6 hours constantly, here is my review in pros and cons.Pros▪Comfort level is better than jbl 450 and  previous boat rockerz edition.▪nice bass and sound quality.▪premium matte finish.▪ conectivity is pretty fast and good.Cons▪sound quality could have been better. i mean bass is good balance is good but sound quality is above average.▪no aux cable.I majorly bought it for jogging so i will update about battery backup and perfomance of this headphone afterwards.Update: perfect pair of headphones for jogging. Battery backup of 7-8 hours easily. get you through 2 days easily if you are medium user.Edit: 8 months and its broken now. i loved these headphones 😥 and now broken. Poor plastic by Boat."
4,Really Nice On ear headphones from Boat. It has really Good bass and Thumbing effect. For Full Review Do visit Technoholic Life on youtube.|Audio  test | Mic Test | Latency Test |
4,"Rockerz 450 is my Second Headphone from boAt, other being Rockerz 510.+ Packing - Comes in a great packing which looks good and easy to unpack+ Design - This is a good looking headphone with a cute Circumaural design (not that big as Rockers 510). Graphics over the ear cups is just nice. When I rub my hands over the cups and I could feel the quality of the material. I was late to notice that the cups can be rotated to 180 degrees.+ Comfort - Smaller headphone when compared Rocker 510, still the cups are large and soft enough to impart a Cozy feeling.+ Sound quality - I am using this one for general listening as well as editing my YouTube videos, and the sound quality is good enough for me.+ Volume and Playback Controls - Playback and volume control on the rear side of ear cup lets you skip tracks and adjust the volume.+ Bluetooth - Connectivity is just great. I am able to move within all rooms of a 1500 sqft Floor.+ Battery Life - I recharge the headphone once in 2 days after using it for 7 to 8 hours with intermittent intervals.+ Economic when compared with other brands in this segment.- Noise cancellation is not working as advertised.- The buttons assigned for volume aren't smooth enough and make a uncomfortable noise.VerdictA good looking, easy to carry, quality headphone, recommended for people who are looking for a good quality headphone within Rs. 1200-1600. I bought my piece at Rs. 1499. and when I write this review a week later, I see that the price came to Rs. 1199 as a part of Festival Sale. So, I think this is the best time to buy it.Moreover, Welcome/Exit messages are just Awesome.While we switch on this gadget, a Super Energetic guy says, Power on. You Plugged into Nirvana!At exit, Adieu Amigo, Powering off!love & regardsAJ"
2,"The mic of the headphones doesn’t seem to be good, a person on call is unable to hear your voice clearly even in a quiet environment. As for a noisy environment, the noise cancellation is pathetic! I fact apparently the background noise is more clear than yours. Good music quality and pretty comfortable though. In all it’s a good headset not a good headphone."
1,This is my 1st time using boat headphone but I shocked when I see I got a headphone which has some minor scratches maybe it's a used. Headphone. I continually use for 10 days. I didn't see any problem in headphone but after 10 days I see that I'm getting a little noice during charging but ignore this sound . Day by day it increasing. One morning  when I woke I see that headphone giving alot of heat but when I open all screw of headphone I see that battery is burned in fire. So don't buy this headphone brand sent me a used headphone.
5,"The product is just amazing!! It comes in a good packaging, has a great colour and I love it💙. This 🎧 can be connected to any bluetooth device. It can remain charged for a very long duration. The ear cushions provides a comfy experience. The sound quality is superb. It's noice cancellation allows u to just concentrate and feel the music. It's worth the price I paid. The main thing I bought this is that it had the calling features and it really works. This 🎧 is completely light weight. The product comes with a charger for charging and an aux cable which can be connected directly to the phone if we want as it saves charging. It also has an information manual and a 1 year warranty card. This product is a Must have!!"

1,The sound quality is good. Especially the bass is great. But one of the limbs broke after two months of use. I fixed it with fevikwik and tape but it then broke at another part. I had taken extra care handling it but the kind of plastic used is below standards. I mailed BOAT customer support regarding the same and my product was picked up from my address. After a few days I recieved a picture of my product totally damaged with no explanation given and they sent it back to me. Poor experience with the way they handled it. Also the ears start hurting within half an hour of use.
1,"Worst quality .amazon is waste for selling goods and it never meet the requirements of customer ..such a waste product from amazon that I have bought ... I need a replacement of this boat headset otherwise I’m gonna proceed legally..Loose wire connection and very delicate headset I got ,I mean even if I place it on the bed it broken such a worst product given by amazon ...I’m going share this review in all websites if u didn’t respond"
5,"This is nice one, bass is really great and sound also loud, its like mini home theater on your ears. Completely happy with this. Many not suitable for long listening as theses are on ear headphones.Manufacturer package box is perfect. Thanks to Boat"
1,Product material build is the worst of all.The headphones broke into half while adjusting the cups length just after 3 days of using.Recently Boat has been fooling customers with these horrible products that wont last even 3 days.Styrofoam  made products will last longer than these boat products.NEVER GONNA BUY AGAIN FROM BOAT.
4,This headphone is good for the price but RockerZ 510 is far better than RockerZ 450.The 510 is extra bass boosted while this headphone feels like any other normal headphone .I've used both 510 and 450 so if you wanna buy one then I would suggest you the Boat Rockerz-510 .
1,"I have purchased these headphones for my husband as a surprise. And it was so disheartening, that the product was such a failure. The headphones claimed to be noise isolation supportive, but everybody could listen to the song I am hearing. All I could feel was thump, and the headphones were vibrating as I maxed the volume. I paired my phone with these headphones,  but when I tried any other phone to be paired, it just gave me error messages ""Pairing rejected by Boat Rockerz 450""."
5,"First of all i am writing this review after intense usage during lockdown. If you want to buy it, go for it without any hesitation over jbl and mi super bass. As usual amazon's delivery was super fast.The build quality is extremely good but the headphone are made up of plastic. Quality is better than mi super bass headphones and these are very comfortable even when worn for extended periods. Bass quality is pretty good and it also has an in-built mic which cancel much of the background noise. It also has a 3.5mm audio jack so you can use it wired( without any battery usage) or wireless( on battery). The charge lasts around 8-9 hours if used for non-stop gaming like playing PUBG Mobile and COD Mobile. It has a standby tume of more than 100 hours ( yes that is true i have checked it myself) and it delivers lag free voice when playing games and it has a warranty of 1 year which can be claimed on the official website after registering the product. Note- the warranty doesn't cover any physical damage after the product has been handed on to the customer but boat's customer service is very agile.Please mark the review as helpful."
5,All of thing is good but one thing is not good is that aux cable is missing in the box
3,"It's a good build quality headphones from boat and looks good in design. Sound quality is average and bass amount is good too. If you have used any wired headphones like audio technica (Sonic) or Sennheiser(HD206), don't buy this one. You will not like the sound quality from this product. It is more comfortable than boat 400 and little better in sound quality. While using in Bluetooth mode there is 1sec delay in sound while Gaming(in Pubg) and it's effect the gameplay. This delay is not happening while watching videos or movies. I don't recommend if you are buying for gaming. It's not comfortable for long hour usage as it becomes painful after some hours. Aux cable is not included in the box."
2,"Hi guys, as expected both 450 and 400 are alike but slight high at 230hz and thump for 450 and remaining are same as 400If you wanna buy a new one of head set for bass lovers go for it if you are already boat customer of 400 no need to upgradeI also have boat 600 but it lasted for only 1yr approx due to non sweat proof and cushion  has damaged but  head set speakers are fine😍 for 450Pros1) bass2) good clarity3) comfortbut after a hour you feel discomfort but later it will be adjusting for feew weeks 450 rockerz, which i not found on boat 600( AS THEY ARE COMFORTABLE), but very much irritating on 400 rockerz4)  Battery lasted for more than 8 hrs as I used high volume5 ) value for money6) indication for max volume and connection, blue light for idle position, red even for charge and battery l7) quiet strong no room for breakage I hope they had build stronger than 4008) mention of battery in Bluetooth section how much percentage left9) connectivity is good as my home is 3 bedroom it came through two walls and outerdoor more than 15mts untill I go to down floor (400 had disconnected in 10-12 MTS )10) you can connect to two devices once only ( i have connected to iPad and mobile at once ) plays them alternative this is good featureCon's1) As it was not fully over ear2 ) it won't allow you to turn your face as it occupy whole neck (you should expand to max length )3 ) pads are cushion but the gap btwn both speakers are less so some discomfort (boat designers should realise that little bit of space is needed to design as they beat everyone )4) that's itThese heavy than boat 400 in weight and thump little bit in scale of 15/15 for 45014/15 for 400I have used 400 and 600 earlier as I suggest go for it for bass and mid lovers and budget 1500rsButtons are given as it gave on 400They are strudy enough , my previouss I got for almost 4 yrs boat 400 , and 600 last couple of years as am the first customer who bought thatt in 2015 as no one know boat at that time I have recommend for more than 50 peopleNow I have changed my opinion they broke of after 4 months I hope they are not that worthy if they broke out like this in betweenI have attached pictures so that you can handle it carefully already bought customers, or else better go for strong one rather that it's"
1,Hopeless headphones. Absolutely no base and even saound is not loud. A big waste of money. Worst product from boat that I've seen
3,"This product is not bad but not good either..... I bought it for 1400, I don't know quality of other headphones aroud this price point..... But it has some flaws... Such as...1) Noice cancelation is good if don't mind outside noice...2) Calling sucks...... It feels like ants are in my ear and they are having a party.....3) cusions are soft..... But can't wear them more than an hr....But at end of the day sound quality is good... Listening music feels great....."
1,As u can see...i brought two of them..and after using them for one month... they both broke one way or another...only in sensitive manner...donno why company is making the extendable belt with very cheap quality... although I'm a big fan of sound quality...these aren't making me to listen to it 🤦🤞
3,"Surprisingly got it for 1599 ...decent HeadphonesWith decent soundPros:Battery backup is goodLook and feel is coolGood thumping BassCons:vocals and treble might have balancedNot good for long time use as it feels irritatedMight have improved build quality from it predecessor 450Only extra Bass will not suffice good audio experience, it should be balanced , Boat signature audio is poor i think they should work on it.Overall average experience!!"
1,I have ordered headphones. I got it sound was ok not as powerful as i expect. Another problem arisen when my charging got over i try to charge headphone for mor than 2 hrs.. itz not charged after a long time. So i ordered replacement. I got replacement today just few minutes ago. Before opening item i take snapshot so they will believe me.. look at thw stickers the right one is different than left one(the circular one) means seal is broken.After opening this.. i Haven't found charging cable & on hear headphones too...Extremely disappointed..If u r going to buy through amazon...Please check it properly coz vendor will send u defective items.. or missing items...Extremely disappointed....
5,I got this @ ₹1499 bucks. The sound quality is immensely good. The bass is great. Well comfort wise I won’t say it’s that great because of its round shaped ear cushions other than in every aspect be it sound or battery life or connectivity every way it’s perfect. This is the best one can have within ₹1500 bucks. I would suggest personally to go for this one if one is looking for a budget bluetooth headphones.
5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
4,Very nice sound quality nd good bass ..nd bass quality nd sound not harmful to hearing ...Very nice 👍👍
1,"On very first time after connect with my phone one Right side speaker are not working.Very bed product,Package are broken from inside.Please don't buy cheap items, buy at least modarate items. After reviewing all comments. Don't impress by Hrithik,Go with product quality."
3,"No return option available, placed for replacement.1. Received the product at 12:30pm,tried to turn on but it seems the battery was drained out so put it on charging using cable and power bank.2. Once plugged in, a small red light glows indicating charging process and in 1 hour that turns to blue to show complete of charge.3. At 3:15pm paired it with my phone and started playing PUBG mobile, Bass seems to be high and conversations are audible but not excellent.4. At 3:40pm I start getting ""Battery Low"" announcement during the game and headset shuts down by 3:45pm.5. Kept it for Charge again which took from 4:00pm to 5:00pm to turn blue again.6. At 6:15pm turned on headset and paired it to Phone and started playing songs on Wynk.7. Bass is good and dominated the song while FM is not good based on poor signal reception quality.8. At 6:45pm the battery low notice starts again and shuts down in 2 minutes.Received the replacement, kept the headphones on charge for 1 hour, played songs continuosly for 1 hour battery still shows 70% available. Audio is better than last one(lesser bass). However when connected with Aux cable only one side of headset is audible seems like problem with Aux cable however I can get used to this, Still not totally satisfaction but good buy at rs700-800 price mark."
4,"Good headphone at this price bass is more,moderate and  comfort. Bought at rs.820.Mic issue when on Bluetooth mode."
3,These are my honest review of the Bluetooth headphone after using it for two weeksLet me divide into two categories likes and dislikesNumber 1 likes:-1. The sound quality is average . Bass is moderate overall average in this price category.2. The play pause volume up down button are working fine.3. Battery back up is decent.4. Bluetooth range is good.Dislikes1.You can't use it's for longer period your ears starts to hurt after an hour of usages.2.Takes long to charge.3. Many times there is disturbence in the music while listening as if the Bluetooth connection is getting disconnected and connected automatically.But at this price point it's an average product .
1,"Too bad quality of these headphones. I never think that Zebronics music product quality is like this. I have a Zebronics bluetooth Home theater speaker, only bcz of that quality of speaker I bought the zebronics bluetooth headphone. But this is the poorest quality, also these are too light weight, and the AUX cable is so light. It is like that at any time it can be damaged.I request to all the people plz plz if you are thinking to buy this item,then plz forget this. If you are interested to waste your money then yess you can buy this.But according to me and my family, this is only and only wasting of money."
5,"Had always known Zebronics to provide quality speakers at fractions of cost of others, and this headset didn't disappoint either. Fits well, looks neat, and sound quality is great and seems well balanced among low-mid-high spectrum. Pleasure to use!"
4,"I purchased Zebronics Zeb-Thunder Wireless Blue Tooth Headphone in March this year from Amazon and delivered to me just 2-3 days before complete lockdown.What it OffersObviously over the ear headphoneIt's Bluetooth and so not wiredIt has a built-in FM Radio (See Con Points)Provision for SD Card to load SongsHands-free phone conversationOperates by a battery and it can be charged via  USB for which USB connector is supplied with the Gadget. Only connector no charger, please.It has a surprising and unique feature that no other Bluetooth headphone offers. It is having provision to connect to a phone or any other music source by wire and the wire is supplied with the gadget besides the charging USB connector. This helps us to continue to listen to music even when the Headphone battery needs a recharge.PROS:Excellent and superb audio quality and plenty of bass and sound which can be adjusted to your liking.Good Design aesthetically made and quite appealing to the eye.Good battery life even when not in use for days togetherBest price and easy on the pocket. Surprisingly priced very low at Rs. 772 from Amazon and it's being shown at Rs. 840- today when I checked just now (10th July 2020).CONS:FM Radio Khas Nahi hai. Its like, Is it available? Yes, available type.I could not tune it to all 10 stations that are available in Hyderabad. Normally, when we opt for FM radio,  one of the stations can be listened to, and to get another station, we need lots of patience. Instead, we can as well switch on FM radio on our phone and get it via blue tooth in the headphones.The FM Stations' reception is very poor and always with the FM noise in the background.Although the Head Phone looks wonderfully giving a very expensive look, I am afraid it may not withstand rough use. No complaints on this count so far in the last 3 months.I load my favorite instrumentals to enjoy crystal clear superb quality audio during my morning walk. I am charging it once a week. When it is paired with your phone, the percentage of charge shows in the Bluetooth interface of the phone. So accordingly, we can decide when to charge.Overall, I give 4 stars out of 5(Because of FM Radio 5th star not given) and recommend for those who keep their electronic gadgets out of the reach of children and use them gently and of course who love music with good quality audio."
5,It's amazing with high bass clear sound quality it's totally ossum
5,Like the product as described by the company. The best part is that they are comfortable. I wear them for atleast 3 hours straight sometimes but the don't hurt. AUX cable option is great when the batteries are drained.
5,"Wow! This product is just really amazing ❤️. I loved it's sound . It has a feature of extra bass. The most liked feature by me is that it has aux as well as bluetooth. I loved it ❤️. Of someone sees my review . I will recommend you to buy this product. It's amazing 👌. If some gamer is seeing this, so I will recommend you to use this product for gaming. It feels like you are in the game when you play any game wearing it. At the end I will only say that I really really really love this product 😍!"
5,"Very Good Product Budget For A Good Affordable Price And Sound Extreme Level As Mobile and PC Computer Good Bass level and Sound Quality.Not displayed battery level in Mobile,Only shown Bluetooth icon,Ear muffs also very good to wear comfort..Overall i satisfy..."
1,"frequent disconnection in charging. The red light gets on for some time while charging and the gets off. Again i take out the charger and insert it. Again the same thing happens over and over again.Sound quality is good, no complainBut charging difficulty is coming very much."
1,Too bad sound quality.no bass sound. Very worst product performance.
1,Pathetic I want to return this product but I am not able to as there is no option of return just I can replace.I really don't like the built up quality.Sound quality is also not good.Battery is also not upto the mark after full charge it works only 1:30 hrs.I need money backInfact the box is also damaged and the package came to me was also not packed properly it was also damagedThe product was full of dust as if it feels like it is used product.I have ordered a fresh product it feels like it is used and full of dust
1,I just ordered this product because of good reviews but trust me it's not at all good when it arrived at my place first time its mic was not working properly so I replaced it and the second time when it was delivered it was broken then again when I try to replace it Amazon give me the option for refund so thanks to Amazon for refund.Advice:- Not to buy this product because of cheap rates go for wired headphones at this price they are more good than this product.
5,"The battery lasts a very long time. After a full day's work, battery is at 70% for me. I guess it could last 3 work days if I didn't recharge it daily very light weight no issues with ear pain  cushion is so soft comfort this many features not available Rupees 6000 branded headphones now a days can’t say more about this product no issues at all g productIf you're an audiophile, or you care about the sound quality, all these headphones are mediocre. They are tuned to the taste of the average consumer - there's a lot of bass andSo far these work great! I'm still concerned about the durability, but I'll also only be using these guys for walks and runs around the city for the foreseeable future. Hopefully, that mitigates the risk of damage."
5,"1) micro SD card option of music is the best option to hear it without laptop.2) Battery backup is awesomely good and i use this headphone almost half day nonstop or more but no need to worry for battery level.3)10-12 feet distance no disturbance,4) AUX wire quality is low but working properly.5) material used is feels like of low quality plastic so no idea how long it will run.6) overall i am happy for this product as more than expected good sound quality i got.7) must buy item."
5,This product give its 💯 many of saying bad battery life but that is not true ihave use this headphones for last 4hours and its 50% Now  so it is nice produce nice quality evwn its ear cushion are also perfect if u want many fearures under 1000 then it is a perfect its connect with bluetooth very easily its is comfartable one of its disapointing this is light plastic use it can break if u dont care of it thanks
5,Product is very cost worthy but the delivery service is very bad....the delivery boy came to my gate shout like a freak and left the box outside gate without making any call.... its slight rain outside and the box was kept outside and delivery boy just ran away... I know one should follow the social distancing in this pandemic period but there is a civilized ways to deliver electronic products especially when there is rain outside.... I have no words to describe the such pathetic way of delivery service.... product is nice but highly disappointed by the Amazon delivery service...
1,Pls Don't buy this Zebratronic Thunder  Bluetooth is not getting connected and if at all after much deficultly Disconnects often.  Searching for a service Center and getting it repaired is very deficult since I live in a small town i have to go to a city some 423Km away.  Pls DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT you are throwing your hard earned money in garbage if you go for it.
5,"I thought it's going to be a light orange but i received a deep red which make.me very happy cause my fav color is red. Ok about the sound stereo windinf id really good, bass are really good but not the best. And it cancel noise really good  perfect for listening music or story without disturbing from around sound. And about bluetooth connect really well backup last longer than i expexted really happy but i don't know how long will that be im talking about the battery backup and one last thing we still can connect with audio jack 3.5 that really helpful if the battery backup out ang specially good for gamer. Almost forget we can control the volume, play pause, next and previous directly from the headphone which is really helpful. I will update about the battery backup later and dont forget u can charge it using mobile charger i.e micro cable charger. U will get the micro cable with this headphone free."
5,It's battery 🔋 Life is Just exellent it has loud speakers 🔊 that's why you not need to raise volume over 50% and at this volume it easily last 4 days at 2.5-5 hrs of usage...Connectivity is also good you just press power button for 2 second and it starts then it's blue light blinks till it's not connected ...start bluetooth then once you connect manually fron secound time it will connect in less than 30 second...Bass is not too great but very good and clear sound quality at this price point...And what I feel best is supported memory card and also have very DURABLE BUILD QUALITY..... And of course good battery 🔋 Life...You can buy if your budget is around 600...I got it for 600 rs in sale
1,"I got this product today. After much anticipation and offer by Amazon, I opened the box and connected it to my android using blue tooth connectivity. Sound is awesome, connected quickly checked with the device volume option, it worked fine. When I wanted to check the volume option from the headphones, I found that the volume down was broken. I changed to FM mode, it did quickly after pressing the play/pause button for a few seconds...I found that the volume was decreasing automatically.... I found that the volume down button is stuck and is pressing the volume on it's own."
5,"I know there are many bad reviews on this product but this is fantastick.I love listning songs on this and it works great awsm cooolllll and fantstick.Go for it.Don't wait just buy it now. No need to read more reviews just go for this.Go.........It's mic quality is just awsm and stunning.I love its bass.Thank you seller, zebronis and amazon to give me such a great product.It's battery life is just awsm..........."
5,"Pros:Excellent built-in quality.Bass quality is superb.SD card support.Over 8 1/2 hours of battery back.Useful while jogging, walking etc.Comfortable for hearing.Cons:Time delation.Not that good for gaming.  Totally, go for it."
5,Used it for 3 weeks and now I am writting this review. Sound quality and bass is good at this price range. Battery life is enough for a day. Wired connection can also be used if the battery is drained. The sd card slot works well. Volume controlls are nice. Noise cancellation is satisfactory.
5,"All-rounder like Kapil Dev 😁Bluetooth, superb bass, volume control, provision for direct non Bluetooth connect, can play music independent off any other device from a micro SD card , FM radio,Comfortable to wear and audio is excellent.Only thing lacking is provision of a mic to equalise music and conversation.But, I can live with that deficiency."
5,I got this Zebronics Thunder for Rs.599 which I would say is an amazing deal and like any other headphone it does has some pro's & consPro's :• It's really damn cheap 599/- as compared to other wireless headphones.• The packaging was great.• Battery back up us preety good 9hrs/per charge and it takes around 2.5 hrs to get it fully charged.• The ear cups would you a comfory experience.• The sound quality is pretty good if you listen to songs from Spotify but it lacks lil bass as per me while playing YouTube videos.Con's :• The build quality seem to be delicate so need to be little extra careful.  Over all I will rate it 4.2/5.
5,This product is great for this price go using this for 4-5 months now and just works amazing. Bluetooth connectivity is so strong that i can leave my mobile device connected with this headphones at a corner of room and walk around whole house waring these without any issues ( connectivity can easily penetrate 2-3 walls). Don't over charge it 2.5 hours is max. It works perfectly fine otherwise. Most beautiful part it is that it's over ear and soft and comfortable.
5,Best quality product from zebronicsPremium quality......Bass is good listen joker song on YouTube full for bass experience..Only drawback is FM radio range is not so goodBut working fine ☺️😊😀Highly recommended by me.
5,"Wow!. Its amazing guys 😍😍😍. Build quality is decent, but the sound quality is Awesome. Deep bass and crystal clear sound. You can hear the each of the instrumental sound in songs. If you are a normal user. Then it is the best choice. But if you are looking for a headphone for gaming, then its not recommended. Because there is some delay in game, while it's connected with blutooth. But if you compromise wireless mode and play games by connecting the 3.5 mm cable, given inside the box. Then you can go for it. Battery backup is also very good 😍"
5,"This headphone is one of the best headphones I have ever used (in this price segment). Sound clarity and quality is awesome. Bass is moving, and the equalization has been done really good. The best part is the battery backup. It has an amazing battery backup. You can continuously use it for straight 24-28 hours without interruption. I'd recommend this headphone to anyone who wants it in the budget segment. Close your eyes, and go for it!"
5,Better quality sound and battery than expected. Charges very quick in about 30 mins and a playback time of 8-9 hours. Couldn't have got a better product at this price. Purchased for ₹700 in the Prime day sale.
5,"Yes good I will recommend it best in listening music , watching videos,mainly playing ping/ free fire best experience.yes it is best in low price for listening 🎧 online classes.it has both blutooth and wired both with same sound.it us better upto some what I'm noise cancellation while listening music.i kept charging for 3 hours It worked for 4 days(**note** only for online classes daily2hrs)so buy .I bought this item in 600(**best deal of the day**)offer."
5,At first I got a broken damaged product but then I replaced with this red one and I swear this is the best low cost headphones I have ever seen. I had used a lot of products but it has some special specialities...1. Wireless Headphone2. Price is only Rs 800 which comparatively very low to other in market3. Very comfortable to wear and cusions provide xtra comfort.4. It also runs in pc very well with both aux cable and Bluetooth.5. It has also a ad card slot6. It has an inbuilt F.MI am very satisfied. Thank You Amazon. Love You 💕
5,"Excellent product for personal use.Lightweight, good battery life, ergonomic, loud, clear, robust, looks trendy.What else do we need ? And all this for a mere ₹ 649 !!!I ordered it for the kids so that I don't mind if they break it, but it eventually ended in my work table due to its wonderful quality. Ordering one more for kids."
5,"This is one of the best headphones ever. Useful for students and people who listen to music. The feature of both wired and Bluetooth mode makes it even cooler! The FM mode works fine but not great. Requires a particular alignment of the headphones in order to receive the signal. But an overall awesome product. The battery backup is very good. The cushions are soft, do not make the ears sweaty, and no earaches. They are broad and fit well, making it comfortable to use."
5,"To begin with I will recommend this product to everyone. Seller is & Amazon is very good in service & Delivery. Product Quality with regard to material, finish is very good. Look wise it is sleek item. Sound is excellent. Controls are very easy. Its On/off & Call pick at side is what it makes it superior among the other headphone. In all a very very good product. One must opt for it. It is VALUE FOR MONEY. If you are looking for HeadPhone go for it."
5,"posting this review after 2 weeks of daily usagethis headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels), battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned up to 12hrs on box.it takes 2-2:10hrs to fully charge.sound quality is excellent, very clear and loud, bass levels are great. tried it with many different devices like laptop,pc, smart tv and mobile, sounds great on every devices specially it sounds more better on mid end and high end devices.calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice but still not that worse experiencebuild quality is great, has soft touch plastic finish on outer side. perfectly fits on every as size is fully adjustable.one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy your music without any interruption.overall this headphone is best buy for money. if anyone need a great big size headphone at this price then i will definitely recommend this"
1,Please avoid buying this product. I brought today not even used for 1 hrs not satisfied1. Call Hearing is not clear /Unable to hear other person2. Hearing songs is good but no bass at all3. Bluetooth connectivity takes time to connect
3,"These are about average headphones. The build quality is ok.I did not quite measure the battery backup time, but it usually lasts me for a couple of days with intermittent use for music and youtube videos.The headphones work well with the aux cable.There is a distinct lag when watching videos with the headphones in Bluetooth mode.The sound is clear and balanced. Bass is not heavily boosted.The microphone is not quite effective for calls. The people who I spoke to on phone, using these headphones, gave feedback that my voice was very low and with some distortion.The earmuffs are ok, but I would have preferred them to be a bit larger. They did not cover my ears completely, so I found the earphones somewhat uncomfortable after an hour and half of continuous use."
3,"Build quality looks below average, the aux & charging cable provided with the headphones are of poor quality. Sound is just okay and bluetooth works just fine.I dont think they are gonna last very long. I'm not even sure if they are worth ₹700."
1,Sound quality not upto the mark. No balance between vocal and bass. Feels like Noisy audio.Bluetooth mode have lag when playing games(not in milliseconds it produces 2 sec lag).Lag doesn't comes when aux is connected.Mic doesn't work when Aux cable connected. They should have provided aux cable with mic.This design gives more pain to ear. Ear can touch inside parts and it irritates. Cushions not good or big enough to give space between ear and headphones.Once you connected via bluetooth no way to unpair from the headphone. You must turn off bluetooth on mobile/pc inorder to connect another device within the range.So Finally I returned this product.
1,it is so hard on ears and after 5 to 10 minutes you will feel the pain irrespective of your head size.
5,"Awesome product in under 1k, too loud to handle as I like to listen on lower side of the volume for the benefit of my ears and hearing ability in the long run, good connectivity, great battery life, need to charge it only after 4-5 days when I m using it 2-3 a day, nice padding around the earpices as they cover up entilre earand sit on the skull so no pressure on the earlobe even if used for longer time, the best part is that there is no it hing or discomfort because of the sound.The bass and volume is very good, at full volume, you can use it as a speaker if you wish, just the volume buttons are reverse than one expects, the lower one is at the top and the higher one is at the bottom of the buttons.Picking a call is tricky, because it blares at full volume which is too loud for the ears, its like an explosion; makers should do something to keep it at medium or last set level for receiving calls."
5,I ordered it for my kid. It's has all features required for its education. It has a good sound quality. Very easy to connect. It's battery backup is also really good. Came with an aux cable to an additional thing very helpful in case no battery.
1,"Sound good but very low ,pathetic for calling hoens sound every 3 sec . Only for listning music not for calling purpose."
5,Very very nice productBest in class sound quality battery backupBassCan be used with aux if battery drains Value for money. You can't get anything better than this. Period.I think best headphone in this price so go for it😎I am so happy
1,"- Power button got stuck inside. Could not operate.- Adjustable band was just too tight and was not working, was scared while pulling/pushing that it might break.- Volume-up/Volume-down/Play-Pause buttons did not work.- Mic did not work, other was person was barely able to hear with lot of noise.- Over the ear/head it was just too tight/heavy.- Because of above problems, requested for replacement. But, replacement sent by seller was used product in used box with missing aux cable and usb cable. Box was cello-taped (original packaging was missing). Amazon packing was also broken/tampered with.- Had to request for replacement/order cancellation.- Delivery person was kind enough to accept return. And, Amazon was kind enough to consider case and issue refund.- Overall good experience with Amazon & Delivery person. But, product was not good quality (although it was listed as best seller) and seller did not do good thing in sending used product as replacement."
1,Recieved a damaged piece. First it shows 90% battery then 40 in 5 minutes. One side works well another side is not working properly. After 2 hrs Bluetooth connectivity has been stopped working. Aux cable is working but one ear only . Hope they send me another good one after returning this .
1,"Worst product that I bought from amazon.It was very tight and you could only use it for a minute and the product only last for 2 days .It was very bad experience for me from the Ptron customer service.But amazin saved me,they took the product and gave me revund via cheque ,thanks amazon.Do not buy this product and waste your money.It is the only product that I returned to amazon.So I recommend you not to buy it.If you need a good experience please buy any other products.The sound quality is also average."
3,"ProsLight weightSnug fit, over the ears, comfortableGood bluetooth range, 30 feet.BT connects immediatelyClear audioAffordable, comes with Aux cable which is a plus as compared to other headsets.ConsNo Bass, not for music lovers, songs sound very flatBT disconnects during callsIf you wear spectacles, then the snug fit presses the specs into the head and causes painEars heat up if used for >20 mins, causes discomfortNo noise cancellation, you can hear everything going on around you unless you keep volume very high. I prefer low volume.The ear muff material is light weight but flimsy, dont expect it to last very long.Overall, a decent headset."
1,The aux cable stopped working after one month. The volume decrease button stopped working after 2 months. Please stay away from this product. Seems that an old stock is being pushed now.
5,This Wireless Bluetooth Headphones has High bass which delivers each n every music details crystal clear. It is super comfortable to wear and stay on the head while I am working out in the gym. I am super impressed with this headphone performance and i will recommend for music lovers
3,"Buttons shown in the pic didn't work, so replaced the headphones, but to utter dismay one button on the new headphones does not work.Sound is okay, don't expect miracles at a cost of Rs 699.Packing was very shabby, a brown cardboard wrapped around the original paper box. No bubble wrap or plastic envelope like you get on other Amazon orders."
4,"Look - GoodBuild quality - OkBattery - ExcellentBass - Can hear bass all over track, but can't feel the punch of base. Not bad bass like BOAT device. Not good as SONY.Sound clarity - Due to all along bass, vocals and instrument sound suppressed a little, like BOAT headset.Sound quality - Good for BOAT lover, Bad for JBL/SONY loverFitting - For 30 min its ok , after that feel little discomfortSound quality become better when connected with aux cable."
5,"Like the rock-solid Bluetooth Connectivity - my previous Sony Earbuds needed to be paired again after every hour or so, but the pTron stays connected as long as it is left paired!Decent Sound Quality, especially with Bass Boost and 3D Sound on in Windows 10 - there is nothing on the Headphones for all this...Quick to recharge as well - no hassles there, except maybe that the Red Charging light is so tiny, one has to look squint-eyed to check if it is on, even in a completely dark room! 😂If you have small ears, this Over the ears Headphones will suit you well. If you have larger ears like I do, you will do well to let your ears out free, from time to time!Bottom line - for the money you pay, it is an excellent buy!"
5,"First of all lets talk about its quality it is quite good and they are very comfortable to wear we can wear these headphones nonstop for hours and simply enjoy the music, movies or Webseries thanks to the foam padding on ear cups.I am impressed by its battery backup we can listen music  for 12hrs non stop without any disturbance it is good to take these headphones with you on a long journey. I purchased this product for listening bass boosted workout music while performing exercise if you are doing exercise from long time and lack motivation while workout i recommend you these headphones because i found its sound quality amazing it has similar specifications to those products who are very much expensive so if you are looking for headphones which consist of good specifications at a reasonable price then go for this product"
2,"Edit: Just want to verify, I got a new one today, but the design looks different, and even the sound quality differs, as compared to the previous one. The previous one had a thunderbolt through the o of the ptron logo. I hope this is genuine, right? Btw. The previous version was much better... the highs were perfectly balanced. It was crisp and nice. But the new ones have muddled bass and not so clear treble. Greatly Disappointed."
4,Over all good product in my case it stopped working from one side within 4-5 days but replacement done by Amazon is really appreciated within a day now new one working fine but I didn't like the beats as compared with sony of boat but in this prise it's good deal
5,"I used many types of headphones i am not satisfied anyone and I purchased this after seeing its features. I would like to share my experience here, I am fully happy with this pTron headphone.In the box, there is a headphone, charger cable, headphone-mobile plug wire, and manual. As the described the product comes the same. This headphone has high quality bass and sound effects.pTron Studio wireless over-the-ear closed-back headphones are known for their comfort as well as their sound quality. Worth for money."
4,"Writing the review after 1 week usePros:1.Nice bass2.Light weight3.Battery life is top notch. I continuesly played song on repeat and it played for whole 24 hours straight.4. Bluetooth connectivity is good.but gets problem when you are in another room.5.Noice cancellation is best...I can barely hear anyone even on 20% volumeCons:1. If you are a sweaty person then your ears will get sweaty while wearing.2. The adjustment functionality got loose in 2 days only. But as my head is big I Ignored it. Thats why Igave 4 stars otherwise it is a 5 star product.3. Aux cable is cheap.I have to buy new one in future.Conclusion:If you are having low budget but want to buy good quality headphones,then this is the best buy in the market.Dont waste your hard earned money in so called branded headphones.They eventually give the same sound experience as this one.(I Had one Sony headphone sometimes back)"
5,"Best product at this price...I am using it from last 3weeks, the sound system is awesome.The bass and treble which is at par than expected.Also the look is beautiful.Overall i think its the best headphones at this price range."
5,Writing this review after using the headphones for 7 days.Headphone material is very good and the headrest padding is soft and gives comfort for using it for a long duration. The ear cushions are very soft and fits properly on the ear i.e covers complete ear and reduces external noise. The ear cushions allows to wear the headphones for long duration without causing pain to ears.Sound quality has been superb with crystal clear audio quality and covers every minute  sounds/instrumental sound. The bass quality is simply amazing 😍😍.Bluetooth connectivity has been good and no issues while connecting with different devices.Battery life is exceptional..... I have been using it on daily basis for 2-3 hours and it has 80% charging even after using for 7 days. Standby battery consumption is very low.The Aux mode doesn't gives the same experience what it provides on the bluetooth mode but worth the experience.Simply amazing and worth the money 😍
5,"First, I was mainly purchasing these headphones for the wireless and battery features. What I received was a great quality sound, and greater battery life than stated.Pros:- Battery Life - This was one of the biggest reasons for purchasing these headphones. I was looking for a set of headphones that would last longer than 4-6 hours and stumbled across these. I run the headphones for ~6-7hrs a day for four days. On the fifth day, I run the headphones until they turn off on their own. This normally happens around noon. This gives me a battery life of about 28-32 hours, beyond the stated 25 hours.- Great Design – I fell in love with headphone, from the time I set my eyes on it. It is stunning looking and great design.- Sound Quality - The old headphones I was replacing with these were kind of tinny in sound quality. These headphones have really rich deep bass. I was extremely pleased with the sound."
5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
4,Sound quality is awesomeBluetooth if we keep the phone far say away from your body and listen to music there is no issues..  When u walk the Bluetooth kinda stops frequently..  But will start playing again after one or 2 seconds..  It has FM..  Good headset for this price range...  Charge is awesome..  If u fully charge it..  It lasts for 6 to 8 hours continuous play...  After that u can use the auction cable. ..
1,"😔 Great disappointment! After reading positive reviews, i got impressed and placed an order on 06.10.2020 and received he headset on 09.10.2020 and i paid Rs.899/-The headset is not getting charged and the charger provided is getting alarmingly overheated within a minute.  I am highly disappointed.  However i thought aux cable is there. But what a surprise... when aux cable is connected, only one ear is working.. 😔I want to return"
4,The headphone looks classyGood strong material unlike my last LEAF headphone very cheap materialFast bluetooth connectivityButtons are well workingSound quality also Good and bass surrounding is really good except one problem the sound is lil low frequency i always have to use full volume to Feel the musicBattery life also going well
1,"Not satisfied with quality.1st of all the ear cushion and head support are made of reggine so in 2 minutes you start feel sweaty and in 10 minutes it start irritating. Even in AC.Sound is poor and noice cancellation is okay.Also bluetooth has issue as it reset volume to highest after every call.I am Using patron in ear bluetooth devices 3 pieces, they are good. Not this one, its waste of money."
5,"It's one of the best overall performer amoungst all Bluetooth headphone according to me. I have many headphone and I love using different headphones. This headphone is superb because of following reasons,- Sound quality along with bass is very clear and amazing. Treble, Voice are good too- Material used is of good quality- Battery life is much longer. So I can listen extra music- Range of the earphone is quiet good compared to other Bluetooth headphones- Earphone is having in-built mic and the control buttons because of which it makes me easy to receive calls or change the music.- Excellent sound performance with clear high sound- Great Design which makes headphone more stylish- Reduces external noise- One of the best earphones in the price range- Overall it is value for money."
1,wireless stops after 10-15 minutes. I agree that if it is idle it can stop/disconnect. But in my case I was having conference call of more than 1 hour. In that it started disconnecting after 5-10 minutes. I thougt may be some issue with me. Again it happened in the middle of the call.So it it is either the defective piece or the product is not good.
4,"Bluetooth connectivity is not that strong, while moving around in outdoors, but in indoors , its quite good. connection is stable. i am using in my desktop pc by using TP-Link USB Bluetooth Adapter, its works fine, no latency issue while watching YouTube. Only while gaming pc, sound via Bluetooth does not work, so i purchased 2male to 1 female  headphone splitter cable and 3.5mm male to male aux cable to solve this issue. Only thing to to complain the soft cushion cover arround the ear is not that good quality, it will come out slowly very fast, even with deliciated use. Since its only 800 bucks, its hard to complain."
5,It's awesomeIn 899 it's superb actuallyNoise cancellation is also at high levelGive superb bass as wellNoise is clear as crystals soundsBattery life is almost enough for a dayWhen comes to comfortableAlmost after using it  for 4/5 hoursI didn't feel now I have to take it offBecuz it's light in weightAnd give awesome comfort when we are Using it
1,"I have ordered as per Ptron said to avail warranty of my previous ptron product.Ptrons says that we should buy something priced equal or more than for which we want to claim warranty and they will process the refund once we receive the new product.So this way, Ptron is increasing it's sell.Otherwise the quality of headphones in this price range is far better in OTHER BRANDS.Ptron is using CHEAPEST MATERIAL to build product which would not even last till it's warranty and would ask customer to buy new product which means that Sales would go high and also they could show to their investors that How much Customers trust Ptron that they buy products regularly.Also, Ptron customer care doesnt read the Email thread properly and reply based on their presumptions.Ptron Customer Care never works on phone call. They will provide a Number which is never gonna connect your call to the customer care.I have It's been a month since I have submitted warranty claim for my previous product and still they have not even acknowledged that they would be making refund"
1,"I bought this product for good sound, but one side speaker turned out to be defective. The replacement speaker also turned out to be defective. The first one was getting lighter sound from the speaker, but one of the replacement speakers was coming from the same sound. Do not get caught in the cheap, but it is best to take expensive to take. This is nothing in front of the boat."
5,"The product is just amazing!! It comes in a good packaging, has a great colour and I love it💙. This 🎧 can be connected to any bluetooth device. It can remain charged for a very long duration. The ear cushions provides a comfy experience. The sound quality is superb. It's noice cancellation allows u to just concentrate and feel the music. It's worth the price I paid. This 🎧 is completely light weight. It also has an information manual and a 1 year warranty card. This product is a Must have!!"
3,Product is good but Warranty support not hassel free by ptron.  They ask for courier the product to Telangana for services.  Its take too much time n metal harrassment for customers.  Telephonic customer care is wasted of time. Waiting times too much n then phone cut.And no support from amazon also.Very poor after sale service.
1,On Time delivery - 5 star for DeliveryAudio Quality - Not as mentioned.Calling - Too much of disturbance at time of calling.Too much of ear irritation & pain after wearing for merely 10 - 15 min.Overall review - NOT WORTH THE COST OF 1499/-Got the delivery on 27th Aug and initiated refund for the same on 28th Aug.Advice not to buy......
5,It's just awesome. I got the product at the correct time. Thank you Amazon. The sound quality is excellent. The bass is great. The earcups are very good. It gives a great experience of music . The clarity is pakka. I love this one and recommend to all. In this price it just great. Overall wonderful product.
3,Pros:1.Portable2.Value for money3.Battery life4.Sound quality5.Base is pretty good6.Good build quality.Cons:1. Itchy on ears2. If used for long causes irritation on skin3. Sometimes brings up background disturbace in voice call4. Not very good at noice cancellation.Overall its a good product to invest in
4,"OK now I will give you a detailed review of Boat Rockers  400. I am reviewing after 10days I got the product.PROS :* Light weight. It is similar to carrying a 100 pages notebook* Sound Quality at the best level especially Bass is simply superb.*Noise cancelation is at the top.. I travel by local train often.. I sat near the Window seat and used this headphones one day, I was totally amazed at its noise cancelation. I am unable to hear a little bit of sound of the Running Train.*Dual working mode. This is simply superb, even battery is dead u can listen to music* Best battery.. I charged for less than 2hrs and used it about a week.*Cheap when compared to other brands. No brand offers Wireless headphone at this rate. Most of brand doesn't offer dual working mode too.*Boat offers one year warranty for this product. Any defects BOAT collects the product from door step and repair it and return it to the door step.CONS:*Only I problem with this is that it's not durable. But it's natural that if the headphones is of light weight then it won't be durable but it is better to increase the weight rather than being less durable.* Since it's less durable you have tocarry it with any POUCH else on Neck,. If you keep in bag there are more chances that it may break.*Wired mode and Bluetooth mode doesn't have same quality for all songs. Don't know whether it's song's mistake or Rockers 400 ''s mistake.*It's very small, at the initial stage I felt pain on ears if I use it more than 15 minutes.. Later I didn't feel such pain..Now my personal opinion is, if you are looking for a good headphones at cheap rate go for it.. Wait for any special offers. I got it on INDEPENDENCE DAY SALE @ 999 INR I also got 50rs as AMAZON PAY cashback.. So effective price is 950 INR.Wait for a best deal"
5,"I'm giving you a Honest ReviewPros1. Come with both feature you can use Wireless and Aux2. It is Foldable3. 6 Hours battery life after 2 hours of charging4. Good Noise CancellationCons1. Build Quality is Not good you should buy A headphone case2. It will hurt your ear but only for sometimeWithout thinking just go for it, No big brand will give you this Feature in this costHope You like my ReviewHave A Nice Day"
5,"I thought after reading the reviews, that the product would be bad, but trust me Boat Rockerz 400 is a very nice product. I personally am using it for about 6 months and there is no such problems. The provided aux cable and micro usb cable are of good quality and will not disappoint you."
1,You gets what you pay for. The headset is on offer for 999 most of the time. It's not worth it's mrp.The headset is very uncomfortable to wear and it's difficult to use for even 15 mins during the first week. The cushion is very hard and the finishing is rough. Both not suitable for a headset which press over the ears.The sound quality is just average what you could expect from a sub 1000 headset.One more annoying issue is the automated messages on turn on and connecting.
4,"1500 for a wireless headphones.... bit firm on your ears while using it for a long time, as need to adjust it them after 10mins, but amazing sound quality and a very good battery back up for around 5 hours. Boats banging... Definitely it's a yes from me..."
5,"Being wireless headphones, I was bit unsure of the output, battery longivity and the strength of the product prior purchasing it. The following review is after 2 months of normal every day of usage of 1 and half hours during my commute.Sound quality-----------------Positives-----------1. The output of music is fine and decent.2. Syncs well with every genre quite well to give a balanced sound output.3. The quality of the sound is deliverd as it should even at high volume level prohibiting any kind of distortion during playback.Negatives------------1. When connected via Bluetooth, if you are using online music apps say gaana for streaming music and you want to toggle to a chat app say watsapp or the sms interface to write a message, a slight attenuation of sound is heard when the headphone is trying to switch from music playback  to capture and play the keypress sounds through them.2. At low volume, noise cancellation is not effective enough irrespective of the genre being played.Battery life--------------Positives-----------1. As I have mentioned before, I use them almost 1 hour and 30 minutes in a day for 5 days a week which turns out to be 7 hours and 30 minutes as total usage once I charge them full. Although I charge them after the fifth day of use but then also the battery is not low which requires immediate attention and charge.2. It is great battery performance for what the company claims and for being a budget Bluetooth headphone.3. Even if some one who is a heavy user and find their headphone as their best companion for 8-9 hours a day, once charged full, it will keep you entertained for a good amount of time.4. The headphone can be used wirelessly even if it is on charge (NOT ADVISABLE).Negatives------------1. There is no way or an indicator to check the status of remaining charge of the battery and estimate the time to go zero.2. I have observed the charging time from 0% to 100% takes almost 2 hours and some minutes. So, please make a note of it.Material quality-------------------1. The design is simple and is sturdy.2. The cushion at the over head band is ok and gives optimum comfort.3. The height adjustable extenders seems to be metal which makes product feel strong and promising for a good amount of time.4. I have read multiple reviews where they say the cushions on the driver is painful initially and persists if used for long period. As the drivers are of standard size and not too big, if not placed correctly on the ears, may create pain for few. As it is greatly adjustable, just make sure you are expanding the sides of the headphone fully and just gently keep them on the ears. Do not press them inwards with your hands much. Thus, you can get good comfort and enjoy your music.My final verdict-------------------I am having no complaints about it's built quality, sound quality and battery performance. For a even better experience, I may upgrade to an expensive and high quality product some other time if I need to. But, I am convinced to a considerable extent with the headphones."
4,Sound quality is good. Not comfortable on ears if you wear it continuously. It pains due it's tight grip. Outer plastic package cover was intact but inside headphone package was in damaged condition. Not good.
2,"My expectation was too high for Boat. I bought a Bluetooth speaker boat 600, it was great. But this headphone have some problems. It makes a small ""piiii"" kind of sound and the bluetooth connection sound is so loud and cannot adjust the sound, will damage your ear. The sound is better than intex, iball and other lower brand obviously and battery life is good. So, 2 stars is what I'm giving."
1,"TL;DRBass is good for regular songs, but disappoints with bass heavy & trance music. Extremely disappointed with the Bluetooth performance. Also, amazon needs to re-check the hours they asked us to set for work addresses.It's been hours (not days, hours) since I received this product. I'll start with Amazon.I got this delivered to my office address. It says on my profile next to the address that it is my office address. Delivery times till 6 PM. But the delivery guys choose to ignore that tidbit. They decide to deliver it at/after 9 PM. Now, since the office is closed, they decide to leave it with the security guard. They did not call me to check if it was okay to leave it with the guards. I had not mentioned that it was okay to leave it with the guards in my order details. They just decided to do so of their own accord.Now we talk about the headphones themselves. The images were misleading to say the least. The earpieces are significantly smaller than expected. I was hoping they would cover my ears, but they are too small to do so. Then comes the most common problem that they are too tight. But since the boat support guy says they will loosen over time. Here's to hoping for the best. In the meanwhile, my ears will get crushed.Here's another problem. I wear prescription glasses. Now my ears are being crushed in the front by the headphones, and in the back by the temple (and temple tips). The only good thing that came out of this experience was that my glasses no longer fall off my face when I face down.Nevertheless, I put them on, hoping to hear some music. The Bluetooth connected easily, no problems there.But, and here comes the next issue, I can't shake my head to the music & I can't turn my head if somebody taps my shoulder. Basically I can't move my head. So now it feels like I have a neck brace that does not actually support my neck.Then, a fly happened to pass by. I raised my hand to move it from the way. And lo, another problem was displayed. If something appears in between the two i.e. the phone/laptop & the headphones, the Bluetooth starts cracking. And before we start blaming this on the laptop/phone, I tested this problem with a Bluetooth loudspeaker. Things worked fine there.And just to clarify, all of these issues happened within a distance of three feet (About one meter).Then I decided to test out the bass heavy songs. Put on trance music. And I was a little surprised that it was able to keep up. However I then cranked up the bass to see what happens. And was soon disappointed. The low frequencies in bass heavy trance are not as prominent as they should be. This is noticeable when there are prolonged periods of low frequencies.The aux cable is okay, nothing great. Works fine as expected.To sum up. It's a BIG NO from me.Update 1;I received a call while listening to songs, so I tried to test out the mic and if it works. I was shouting while wearing the headphones and the person at the other end of the line still complained of low voice. This happened once, so i thought, maybe they had the volume at a very low setting, then i got another call, this time for work. They also complained of not being able to listen my voice. Then i tried calling a friend and see if it works with them, as I can ask them directly to test it out with me and have them increase/decrease their volume. But sadly, no luck there.Had to return them. Maybe this was a defected piece. Placed for a replacement product. Let's hope the replacement they send is better.Update 2;The replacement they sent me was just as bad as the original one. Meaning, no boat rockerz for me. Very bad product. Design & Quality both. Changing the 2 star to 1."
4,"I'm using this Bluetooth headphone from past 2 weeks on a daily basis.Let me help you with its genuine PROS and CONS..😊***************************************** MUST WATCH THE VIDEO FIRST 🎥*****************************************PROS⏭️⏭️★ Amazing design .★Easy to connect.★ Sound quality is good.★ bass sounds good too.★  Compact and foldable earcups.★ Soft ear cushions (but on continuous use ear become warm and sweaty.)★ easy to control through given buttons.★ Rechargeable and comes with usb cable to charge it.★ When you ping it with your device, the blue LED light Starts blinking.★ Battery life is decent.★ Light weight as compared to other.*****************************************CONS⏭️⏭️★ When it comes to use hands free calls, I have seen a bit lags issue.

5,Super Duper.... Really Rocking...Superr Bass(u can feel vibrations.. when u play bass boosted songs :D )Super Battery.Perfect Fits.Ultra light Weight.Noise Cancellation good.You might feel tight on ears...But after 2-3 days..Its perfect.Mic working good.. Next person thinks ur little bit away from ur phone.(not an issue)Cushions can be better..but can compromise at this price. :PSuper Price Got it for @699/-Go for it..!!
2,Ok where to start...Product build quality is very good no doubtBut..The two primary issues that forced me to sell it to someone 2nd hand1st Too tightIf you wear glasses... Just don't buy it..It will give you red swollen ears in pain2nd unbalanced audio..Mine one had left side louder than right one..Which was giving me another kind of headache..It's just annoyingFinally sold it to someone
1,"Sound quality is fine. Build quality is fine as well. Battery life is amazing. But, the bass is just bad (when you connect it to your smartphone). When you connect it to your lappy, the bass is good or decent enough to satisfy your ears. And never ever buy the white variant, coz it gets dirty very easily and I don't see any option to clean it. So, once it's dirty, it's dirty forever. And for pubg players, you just can't hear a thing when you play pubg using the Bluetooth mode. You'll have to connect the aux cable to hear it."
1,"It's been 2 months since I am using these headphones and I totally hate them.1. when wear the ' on-ear ' headphones, hurt your ear after a while.2. male to male aux audio cable comes with it, doesn't work.3. during a call, others can't hear you properly.4. on switching to the next/previous song you would hear a hissing noise.** seriously don't go for on-ear headphones try other typesWhat's the meaning of using a headphone to listen to beautiful music along with pain caused due to wearing it."
3,"I got it at an offer price of 1k, so I'll judge it as a 1k headphone.Comfort: Not very comfortable. Ears will hurt after a while. Especially if you wear specs. But you can wear it for an hour or so.Sound quality: Now, I don't expect audio technica quality from boat but there seems to be a common problem in all the different rockers I've tried owned by different people. There is a constant high frequency buzz whenever anything is playing. This is so annoying. The driver sounds muffled but the frequency response is mostly flat with a slight affinity for low frequency.But that constant buzzing sound though. Makes me not wanna use it. And seriously affects my opinion of this headphone.Durability: Its lasted now 4 months and has no signs of wear and tear.My suggestion is you save up and buy something better even if it is at a higher price."
1,My worst worst purchase ever on amazon..It’s not mentioned in description but it has Bluetooth version 2.0 hence you will get terrible audio quality and ringing sound constantly coming from both earpiece while listening music..you will definitely notice it on low volume...It’s 2019 and you will get 16 yrs old technology...Please don’t waste your hard earned money...Great service from amazon got my refund on 2nd day...!
1,Its not good for healthy earing my ear getPain disease with in 4days .Sound came out side even normal volluim.Full sound volume sound spread hole roomDOCTOR SAYS DON'T USE HEADSETSIf you want base sound or healthy ear .But previously I am used sony( rs.8000 )headset it's sound not came out side even full volumeMy ear also not get Pain.Boat company use cheap speakers
5,Best product i use this for my gym purpose and watching moviesI use this headphones on galaxy S8 it's have bluetooth 5.0 so that sound quality increases.pros1 very comfortable2 noise isolation is great.3 top-notch sound quality4 40 mm driver works very well.5 waired connection via aux cable is very handy and usefull for gamers6 distance range was good no lagging issuecon's1 call quality was not that greatfirst i feel sound is not that much louder after i burn those speaker for few hoursjust believe me it give unbelievable performance.really it's awesome
5,"Now its already been so many days using this boat rockerz 400.I purchased headphones from this company for the very 1st time and believe me, this one is really something beyond my expectations even it's better than many other brands I used in the past, as far as price is concerned.So here is my review, what I really observed.▪︎Sound quality is premium in terms of clarity and sharpness, not much distortion even at the maximum volume.▪︎Bit BASE centric, if you love higher bass then you are surely gonna love it.▪︎Noise cancellation is far better than any other in this price range, can surely pick it up for calls as well.▪︎Bluetooth range is pretty good, I roam around my entire house on the same floor, and feels its always connected.▪︎I never compromise with comfort, and in terms of comfortbility it is superb, it is as light, that no one can directly judge while looking at it once, but at the same time due to its lightness it is little fragile, so it should be taken care of.▪︎Battery is literally laudable, I really dont remember when I charged this one last time, I normally use 2-3 hours daily, and its around already a week without charging it.▪︎Aux Support, yes even if there is no charge we can use the aux cable provided.▪︎Price is low comparatively to other brands, so for me its always going to be a value for money deal.So at last the conclusion is, if you are searching for good bass along with comfort,lower price and yes if can take little care off, then you can go for this one without even a second thought.I will recommend this :)"
5,"It is awesome. I got the product delivery before time. Thank you Amazon.The sound quality is the best level especially bass is superb. Noise cancellation is on top and required for conference calls.Best battery backup, charging for 2 hours and I was able to manage it more than 8 hours.It comes with both features wireless and aux.It is also foldable in case required and light weight.Worth for the provided price, it is value for money."
5,"It's best one now a days  as boat is trending today because of its bass and sound quality. It's excellent in condition and durable. Just Bluetooth is weakened sometimes if charging in less or my handset problem , obviously it will but I don't know what happens and I don't care coz it works most of the time best like 9 out of 10. And the headphone is little uncomfortable if your head is big it makes my ears pain you will need time to settle it down properly."
1,"One of the best headphones in the price range.The material quality is good.Sound quality is great...Battery life ***** (5 star)But the disappointing feature is the Bluetooth range.. when I travel in train and keep my phone in the denim pocket and headphones on the ears...the music starts chopping... The Bluetooth doesn't disconnect but the music goes blank, skips..If I then keep the phone in my upper shift pocket or hold it in my hand...it then works fine. Also faced the same issue while travelling in a fast moving vehicle or walking under direct sunlight...But it works flawlessly indoors.I ordered a replacement thinking it could be a manufacturing defect...I received the product in 48 hours... So awesome delivery...and the same guy accepted my return product....but Im facing the same issue with the replacement headset as well....So it seems that the brand is unaware about this defect.I hope boatrockers get back to me on this.After a few days.... Same issue...  When I keep the  phone in the trouser pocket,  the music is not heared in the headphones... Poor reception... Tried with multiple phones/ brands...Moreover noticed a lot of issues when under sunlight.  Don't know you but I face these issues mostly when I'm under the open sky during the day."
1,Be careful. Your ears will get pain due to its poor design. Sound quality is very good but you can not use for long. They do not accept return.
4,"The charging lasts over a day if you use it a lot. Bluetooth connectivity is good, output is great. Only 1 con- if you use it for a long period your ears will hurt a little bit."
5,"Build Quality: 5/5 for overall quality but 4 for quality of buttons.Sound Quality: 5/5 for all types of music , you can listen to the details of the song with the best bass .Battery Life: 5/5 up  to the mark.Bluetooth Connectivity: 5/5 with in minute it was paired for new device it depends on your quality of the phone/laptop you are using, In this case it is oneplus phone.call connectivity: 3/5 slight disturbance at the receiving end not worth for phone on bluetooth avoid or connect the aux cable provided.Value for money: @999 6/5 :)Amazon delivery and Shipping : 5/5 with in 2 days as I am prime member :)Buy it is worth for the money you give for this product."
1,What's the point in selling resale units to customers with damaged packaging!!! If resale units are sold can't they be done in a complete new package!!!And above all the controls on the headphone doesn't work with the Audio jack plugged in!!! It only works in Bluetooth/Wireless mode!!! That's just ridiculous!!!
1,I bought this product seeing thousands of reviews and even 1-2 of my friends had it. But the problems started right in the first week.The headphones keep getting disconnected from the phone's bluetooth as soon as you pause the song or the video and this keeps happening every few seconds which is very annoying. BoAt replaced the product since it was within warranty but the new ones had the exact same issue. Seemed like they returned the same headphones back to me. Now I'm waiting for my 2nd replacement.I would request everybody not to buy these headphones at any cost.
1,"I bought this headphones, thinking that this would be a great product, after watching its ratings. Boy, I couldn't been more wrong.First, if you have glasses(specs) don't even think of buying this headphones. It hurts a lot after 10mins of wearing. You may have this pain hours after using it. Your ears will be crushed between headphones and specs' temples.Second, Even if you don't have specs, you can think of this product, But I won't recommend it.Third, It's microphone stopped working after a week of use. And won't connect with Bluetooth on my phone / laptop.Fourth, *IT CANNOT BE RETURNED! Yes, you could only REPLACE it with a new but same model. If you don't want this product, there isn't much you can do about it after once buying it.The sound quality, noise cancelling and battery backup is good though.GOD, I am writing this review with pain in my ears."
2,PLEASE DO READ MY REVIEW BEFORE BUYING IT OR YOU WILL REGRET THIS.If you are looking for good bass quality you will regret buying this product and if you want Crisp and clear sound quality you will regret it. I request you please don't buy this product at all is you want a normal quality or maybe you can say low quality headphones then you can purchase it. It's really bad quality headphone. I replaced the order so that I was thinking it was a defect part or the sound must be defect but this was my biggest mistake by doing this. They send a defect one with inside box opened already and broken headphone😡 I really don't understand why do they send this broken once why could not they check it while sending to costumers or are they doing it on purposely . Anyways I regret it buying this earphones and wasting my money and I want to return it back again and I want my money back. And I'll go some good brands like Sony or JBL. Pleaseeeee read this review I'm not any bot writing this or I'm not doing it for fun why would I waste my time and write a review 😑 Thank you.
1,"Amazon Delivery and Sound quality of the headphones are ok. Found another problems with this product. I use to use this product 3-4 times a week. Head band broke on 5th month. I called Boat customer care and they said that the band is NOT covered under warranty as it is a physical damage. Product will be covered under warranty if there is an issue with bluetooth or sound quality. if I want to fix the band, then I have to pay. I felt very bad as the band broke for normal usage. Second thing - Ear will pain if you wear it for more than 30 mins. It is unbearable after 45 mins. It is unusable now and  I switched to another brand and it is working perfectly. Bluetooth connectivity is bad. if you are using it while walking, then it gets worse. Don't think about using it over the call. bad call quality. Flimsy plastic build. I will never buy any product of BOAT again."
3,"There is only problem with this earphone - BAD Design! The sound quality is excellent, bass is good and battery backup is also good.. BUT the fitting is so rigid that once you place the headphones on your head, your ears will start paining badly in barely 10 minutes and will be red in no time.. the pressure is too much on the ears and you can't adjust in anyway to make it any better.. Too bad because this would've been a great product otherwise."
4,"The model ""boat rockerz"" itself says It's rocking...Sound quality is gud..it has good bass & one can feel  stimulation of our ear drum..The only drawback is it's not that much convenience.. one can hear songs only for few mins after that the tightness over the head causes pain in our ear & headache... It's  not recommended for long time use."
2,This product is not returnable ... And headphones are painful seriously.
1,"Bluetooth connectivity is pathetic,the moment you start the music and put your phone in your pocket and start walking,you hear grrr sound, and you keep hearing it frequently in between the tracks,and it keeps loosing connectivity completely if you are listening and walking together.bad experience.bad product."
1,"Not Expected from Boat, Waste of Money, I paid for this 1714/- I only Bought this for Pubg GameI am a Big Fan of PUBG game and please don’t even think of buying this product for playing games like PUBG. There is a sound issue while playing the game u r not able to here the sound in game delay 3 second while playing games This happened to me while playing  PUBG only. Moreover, you just can't hear a thing when you play pubg using the Bluetooth mode. You'll have to connect the aux cable to hear it.the mic quality is not so good. it's not durable. but it is better to increase the weight rather than being less durable.Wired mode and Bluetooth mode doesn't have same quality for all songs. when I put my phone into my pocket I constantly have to carry my phone in my hand and that too I has disturbances if I move sound quality is not good these are very uncomfortable not expected this from boat either it is a faulty product or boat makes such bad products my recommendation don't buy it you will regret later and they don't even change your product, Also this blue tooth has pathetic distance. I go at most 4 meters and if there’s no line of sight with the phone connection starts disconnecting.Sound quality is average and sometimes you can feel a disconnect in audio is volume is below a certain level. Build quality is such that you can't wear it for more than an hour because your ears will start to hurt. I use Skull candy headphone before this as comparison boat rocketzz 400 was dumb you can only able to hear base and little amount of songs sounds .and it's connectivity was poor only at aux mode its goodOverall it is an average product but at this price is very high,My ear will start paining after 30 minute usage. Will get distracted. So this product is not recommended for watching film. Another issue I had noticed recently is it does not connect automatically with my laptop which If I goto Bluetooth settings it shows the headphones is connected but I will need to reconnect it again..Waste of money, even my Sony 110 for 599 is more comfy.My expectation was too high for Boat."
4,I had purchased this product one year before.Pros.1) Sound it Loud and crisp2) Very Good Bass3) Very Good Battery Life (I am getting approx 5 hrs 30 mins with one charge after 1 whole year)4) Supports Dolby and Windows Sonic (I had tried both)5) Material is good6) Service is good (In past my service experience with boat is good)Cons1) Its hard one ear (I am getting pain if i use continuous more than 1 hrs)2) Materiel is good but not slandered3) Bluetooth not so powerful (some time Bluetooth starts losing connectivity if any person comes between device and headphones.Its main con is we cant use it for long it hurts on ear.
3,"It’s a nice blue tooth headset. It’s not a very comfortable one though, prolonged use can put a strain on your ears, because it’s non adjustable. The buttons are just okay, as they are not properly designed. The noise cancelling is there but not so much. The ear heads should have been slightly bigger.You can get the phone calls on this devise but it kills the clarity and microphone is not great. Not best for talking on phone, but can manage quick calls.All said, in comparison to other products of similar price range or lower it’s a good headphone. Can say it’s okay for the average sound quality which is not bad but not great either. The battery backup is good, but could have been better. The spine padding is fine. Design wise it’s simple and clean, which is a plus.So if you’re on a budget and want a decent Bluetooth headset, go for this. Don’t have high expectations and this will serve you good"
3,No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.
1,"This  earphones are unreliable, i bought it before 15 days meanwhile right side ear buds got cracked automatically and it got divided in two parts, and sound quality is also not that much good but ok, one more thing bass is not good as it is a boat earphones.Guys,Also for the proof i have attached picsPlease see and think before buying​ this unreliable product.Thanks."
4,"i bought itfor 999,I purchased it second time, gifted first one to brother. This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.Comfortable on ear."
4,"I'll get straight to the pros and cons of Boat Rockerz 255 Pro Bluetooth earphones.PROS:1. Sound- compared to the non-pro version, it seems to me that there's slight improvement in quality. Not that it is very noticeable, but a slight improvement.Bass- has got good quality and quantity of bass compared to others in the same price range. The bass is clean, tight and is not muddy like realme bluetooth earphones.Vocals- the vocals are clear and crisp.Loudness- it is loud enough to be heard in a noisy environment.2. Comfort- the earphones are comfortable to wear but without the ear guides. Maybe that's just me, but wearing along with the ear guides gave me pain in the ears which eased off once the ear guides were removed.3. Design- it is of neckband design that is comfortable to wear. The buds have got magnets in it which helps it stick to one another when hanged down so that no tangling occurs.4. Colour- comes in some trendy colours like yellow, teal green, blue and red. The youngsters would love this just for that.5. Fast charging- gets completely charged in just an hour and has got high voltage protection too.6. Sound isolation- nothing to brag about but comparable with others in the same price segment.7.Mic- the calls were very clear. The person at the other end told me that the voice was audible without any disturbances and indeed very clear.8. Connectivity- this has got the A2DP feature. So dual connectivity is present and I did not experience any connection drops of any kind.9. No Lag- there was no lag experienced while playing PUBG.CONS:1. Battery- this is the biggest gripe anyone could have with this earphone. The battery gets emptied quickly compared with its peers. Though there's fast charging one would expect headphones in this price range to last at least 10 to 12 hours but not Rockers PRO lasts for almost 6 to 8 hours. That's what I got out of them and that was not enough.2. Price- the asking price of 1599rs is high. You may get it for 1200rs during offers. Even then it is not value for money because of the poor battery backup.3. No auto on-off with magnetic buds- the feature which is present in Realme bluetooth earphones. This feature could have improved the battery life of this pair very much but alas it doesn't have it.Final words:Boat Rockerz 255 Pro bluetooth earphones are good in terms of sound quality and trendiness but lack in terms of battery backup. Though there are several pros than cons it all comes down to the battery life and this one loses out on that badly.Other options in the same price range - LoodAudio Everloop (good @1169rs), Boat rockerz 255( when in offer @ 999rs), Blaupunkt BE50(999rs during offer or even @ 1399rs), Sony WI-200( pricey @1699rs and high in treble), Realme bluetooth earphones(@1599rs poor in sound quality but better in all other terms).Thank you for reading. Cheers!!!"
1,"After 11 days, the charging port isn't working and now I can't even return it. Wat to do ?? I know there is one year warranty but it is only been 11 days. C'mon boat, please send me new one."
5,Its Awesome... Good sound quality & 8-9 hrs battery life... Just waww look... 😉 I brought just 999 rupees...But Amazon's Packageing system is Very bad... Very poor packaging... Flipcart's packaging system is much better than Amazon...
1,Its sound quality is adorable. overall it was good but just for 2 weeks after that it stopped working and since then it never powered on again. I am claiming for warrenty and it is still undergoing.
4,"Hey Guys,,,,,,, it's Value for money if you get under ₹1500. Bass was quite good it's thumping & Deep Bass tuned for Basshead type peoples. Vocals and treble also balanced if you used this below 80% volume. Instruments separation also quite nice. Battery Performance was Outstanding you got approximately 33-34 hours on 100% volume. While gaming little bit or minor delays in video & Audio but when watching videos on youtube or other video platforms on smartphone i didn't notice any delays. Also comfortable in my testing when using continuously 6 hours. Dual pairing worked. IPX7 water certification is good i tested it properly no issues. But you didn't get call vibration feature also no smart magnetic earbuds.I gave 4 stars because of overwhelming Bass on full volume.-:UPDATE CONS:- Guys still(9th feb) Using as primary earphone i Observed slight Hissss Noise in Background while listening music or watching videos. I observe more while not in use i means connected with smartphone but not in use or playing music. It's Big Con for a Audiophile type person. Keep it in mind before Buy."
3,After one month usage reviewing this .Pros-1- sound quality2- design3- weight4- batteryCons1- very bad mic for talking2- can't use while riding bike3 - Music is too loud
1,The product durability is 1 month..I just lost my bill details so i cant claim my warrenty .. But this earphones built quality is bad . It stops wrking completely after 1 month sep 14 to nov 11 👈 life span .. Dont lose ur bill details incase u want that warranty..  And after purchasing u must register ur product in boat's site for replacement and warranty
1,What on earth is the use of buying such product when it stop working in one month....your happiness sailed off like a BoAt.... #Disappointed
3,Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.
5,Just Spellbpund !!!Simply go for it with no 2nd thought. It's value for the money ( even exceeds my expectations when compared to some high priced JBL and Skullcandy ones ). Bought it for 1200INR and using it seamlessly without any complaints for last 5 days.Sound is clear and loudness is enough even in crowded areas. Phone calls are good and no irregularities in voice reception. Battery lasts for over 10 hours for me on constant usage. Charging is fast enough. Overall satisfied with this product from BOAT 😀
4,The sound quality is good. I mean it can’t be compared with Senheiser or Bose but its worth the price.Perfect to use while running; the earbuds are so comfortable that you wouldn’t even feel they are plugged in.
1,Right speaker is not working at all. Useless product.Big disappointment.
4,"Nice product,Rockers 255 pro is much better than Rockers 255....gud one from boat"
5,"Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro."
1,Product stopped working in a month time
1,"Below average product. Not happy at all.Pros : good sound qualityCons : very uncomfortable, silicon buds are not soft. Bought a memory foam bud pair to use it.Battery life is just ok. Once give a low battery alarm, dies within 2 minLittle heavy on earsNo return possible"
5,Sound quality and build quality is good.. Battery backup is one of the best thing i liked in it.. Definitely you will enjoy the bass of this ear phones...
3,"The product is a good buy if you are looking for a decent Bluetooth earphones with a reputed brand.Sound quality 4/5)- pretty good with good amount of bass.Durability (4/5)- the material seems durable and the earphones are light weightBattery life (3.5/5)- It has a decent battery life of upto 5-6 hours playtime on 80% volume.Connectivity (3.5/5)- gets connected with seconds but sometimes gets disconnected within a small rangeCall quality (3/5)- call quality is decent, the person on the other end of the call can here you clearly however you need to place the mic exactly near your mouth. Sometimes the call gets distorted."
4,This sound and bass quality is good battery life good noise cancelling is good but its wire is too long and uncomfortable which is not looking good wire is starting from top its looking bad but anyway everything is ok
5,"Got it today, really loved the product.. awesome sound.. i was thinking to buy the Airpod but a friend suggested this to me.. Why spend so much!! So i ordered this and this really is amazing.. it looks good.. have great sound and doesnt hurt ua ears!! I am totally satisfied with this and couldnt say about battery as i have got it, today itself!"
2,The product is not worth for 1500/- rsYou can get maximum sound but no quality.It seems they have worked hard on Volume level but not on sound quality.Packing was good.Delivery was fast as it took only one day to deliver.Two stars for packaging and delivery.
1,Rightside speaker stop working within 20 days.
1,"Although sound quality is good, but then whats a purpose of buying a wireless earphone when its controls (buttons) doesn't work. I bought this product withing a week controls where stop responding cant switch on or do anything.replaced it got refund bought another piece different color that worn out in a day.Both the time seller was "" Appario Retail Private Ltd"". So i leave it to your wisdom whether you want to buy this or not. I will never buy this brand at least from this platform."
4,Overall good!But I am unable to connect two devices simultaneously. Please Guide how can i do that.Thank you!
5,Don't you guys check the product before selling ? just received the product and one side of the earphone is working and the other is not !
5,"I am a prime customer of Amazon and I always purchase a product after so much research bought these boat rokerz in the sale in 1099 and trust me I am blown away by these I have used sony and other headphones in the price range of 5 & 6k but this is just similar to them in this price range ""sound quality"" 10/10 ""battery life"" seems good not tested for as described but will update soon ""durability"" 10/10 perfect fit no pain no discomfort.... Really boat has done a fantastic job with amazing music quality with superb bass in all highs mids &lows ..... Just go for it."
3,"he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality."
1,"Let me tell you about the product in Details,1. Sound Quality is good. It is harmless for ears. Not too loud but traffic noise can't disturb you while listening music.2. Look is awesome but wires are too lengthy.3. Battery Backup 'WAS' awesome. Six to seven hours after 1 or 1.30 hours chargingBUT4. Product is not CHARGING AFTER ONLY TWO DAYS OF PURCHASE. And it is not acceptable. That's why the rating is ONE (lesser than one is not available though)I will change my ratings and review too but after the replacement or refund against this product.And one more thing, do not put too deep to this thing in your ears, it might be painful after few minutes.RegardsSIDDHARTH"
4,👍🏻Boat rockerz 255 pro is a just good product.Battery : 6/10Overall sound : 8/10Bass : 8/10Treble : 6/10Mids : 6/10Highs : 5/10Build & Feel quality : 6/10Calling quality : 8/10Bluetooth connection : 7/10Allover product is OK OKThis problem is very minor (Negligible) : Some time bluetooth loses its connectivity for 0.5sec and again connects automatically.At Full volume there is no distortion in sound.Sound of earphones doesn't feel noisy.There is good effort from boat.AWESOME product for runner and gyming peoples.I got this product in 1299/-But i have written this review in perspective of price 1899/-
1,"Defective product. Not working, had to return the defective product."
4,"◾Things We Like✔️Battery life is good enough to provide 10 hours of continuous use.✔️Designed with perfection to provide a smooth experience without any pain in ears.✔️Sound quality is decent and it offers normal to tremble and bit lower bass.✔️Comes at a very low price point which makes it perfect for that thing.◾Things We Didn’t Like❌Connectivity time is really high that it can frustrate you.❌Durability is the concern as some people have negative reviews about it.◾Verdict✔️As you look at such a low price point, there is no doubt that boAt is rocking in the section of great earbuds. If you want to enhance the music listening experience then you can easily go for other versions but if you have a tight budget then this one is the perfect choice to go for."
1,"The item has been rendered defective three times in less than two months of usage. The first two times was due to charging issue and the third time due to sound distortion. Being under warranty, the item has been repaired the first two times and now I have registered a compliant for the third failure. The product has spent more time at the service centre than I have used it. Am completely dissatisfied with the reliability of the product."
1,"No matter what is excellent in a product, it doesn't matter if it doesn't turn on after a day.You guys are enforcing a replacement for a failed model.We can't keep working with warranty and keep the product in manufacturer's shed for days.Got shut down in two days. Boat needs to review this product.Bottom 14% reviews say the same problem, issue with charging.I have purchased 5 boat devices so far I am disappointed for the first time because of this product and ""enforcement"" for replacement.This leaves me no option but to stop believing in BOAT's own customer service for the problems posted by customers. Amazon just play with its policies. Its the manufacturer who needs to go beyond and hel it's customers.Refund me for this defective product and I would like to purchase a new one of different model or make."
1,Cant hear from more than 60% volume.it will hurt your ears and hit directly to your brainBattery 100 to 60% than 0ReturnedBass 6/10Trebles 2/10Sound quality 5/10Battery 4/10Mic 7/10
5,"I just brought it in last week, and to be very frank,it's really Awesome. Beyond my expectations.Sound quality is like having your own personal home theatre,too clear and loud enough, you can listen every single bit of music.And coming to battery backup, they said it's 6hrs but it's more than that, for me it's working near about one and more.I will say,Go for it."
2,"Boat blue tooth 255, ye doubt Voice quality is amazing for 30 days or so you will be big FAN or Boat but after 30days.. voice from of the side going down and even after 35 days you will not be able to hear anything from one sideBoat Service on same again so pathetic , raise an complaint almost 10days back  for replacement or rapair but after 10days its reaches to their rapir center, not sure how many more days Boat will take to repair... Big Suggestion DO NOT BUY THIS"
1,"As falsely claimed by Boat, doesn't have AptX. Could not use the AptX codec to play music on my phone.Though, decent bluetooth earphones for the price.Additionally, Boat products are not listed on the products subsection on aptx website. This means, they don't support AptX codec.Ps: Have used other AptX devices on my phone successfully."
4,"Height adjustment is good but not suitable for a small head. Cable quality is good. Very thick cable. RGB LED of RG logo changes loops wise, It looks good. Mic quality is good. The bass is super cool but the audio pitch is little low. Awesome for gaming. Worth buying at this price range. Comfortable for long uses. Earcups cushion is good. Covers full ear which makes it more comfortable."
5,Great headphone for the price (799Rs is what I paid)plz don't spend more than that.the ear cups are large (and yes the circumference of my ears is huge hahaha) and comfortable. Earlier i had bought the cosmicbyte one (Rs1200) and they had small earcups so wearing it for one cs go compi match was a painful experience.  ..if you don't have a headphone or if you are in search of a good not so expensive headgear  I would suggest go for it. The in built mic is also very clear.( I personally use a mb800 condenser mic)..
5,"Best gaming headphone under Rs.1000, I got it for just Rs.798 (I got lucky I guess). go for this if your budget is low.It also has amazing bass to it..but you have to lower it in the sound setting when you have to play game like pubg..I hear footstep and can recognise where the sound of bullet is coming from...this headphone has improved my gameplay..the headphone is not that heavy...at start you feel heavy but after 10 min you will feel nothg...amazing good quality headphone at lowest price."
1,DON'T BUY THISI don't how people are writing good review about this headphones.  This headphones are really really bad. The sound is TOO LOW. I can't hear anything in any games. In PUBG PC the footsteps are not audiable at all. Even while playing music also this headphones don't perform well at all.When I first ordered this headphones the first piece was defective and the right side was not working. The replacement was given but this is complete disappointment.
5,I've been using this for a month now and I can safely say that it's a legit gaming headphone.The sound quality is dope :• The bass is perfect for hearing footsteps• The treble is also really good cause the sound of gunshots don't distort even at high volumesThe cushions on the earcups tho is starting to go flat (not much but just a lil decrease compared to when it was new) but I think that's what happens when you use it for a long period of time everyday.Highly recommended from an fps gamer.
1,The product box was completely damaged!Worst delivery ! I guess they have put some heavy products on headphones or treated this product way too harsh. There were also scratches and smudges on headphone like it was used by someone. Other than that headphone was comfortable and nice.Reall poor delivery by Amazon👎
3,"I'll give honest review to new Buyers. I bought redgear cloak in September 2019 for ₹899. Its a very good headphones no doubt but but but , every coins has its down sides. So first let me share my good experience about these headphones. I mainly bought it for gaming like pubg , cod , minecraft etc. The build quality for 900 rs headphones is much much better than most of other existing headphones in the market. The quality of RGB is amazing but the effects are random you can't control RGB. Another good thing is you got a volume controller on headphones itself. it's also got a 3D sound effect. Now let's talk about the downside , the sound quality : the sound quality isn't best enough its just average + my headphone's right side driver was producing very low sound volume which is very annoying. Secondly you need a Audio + mic splitter for using it on mobile which cost you extra bucks. The last thing i faced with this issue is its Audio jack stopped working after almost 7 months of use and i didn't get the replacement yet because of the ongoing lockdown. Hope redwood interactive will replace my unit as it is under 1 year warranty. After my opinion headphone is about okay okay and I'm rating 3 stars for it.Pros1. Beast build quality.2. Aggressive pricing.3. Damn good RGB.4. Eardrum cushioning.5. Auto adjustable headband.Cons1. Low quality audio jack.2. Unbalanced volume.3. No 3.5 mm jack.4. Too big for small ears.5. No RGB controller."
5,"I am writing this review on 30th Jan 2020 after using this product for 3 months.I am a casual gamer and mostly bought these headphones for playing both competitive and offline games and since I was in a tight budget. The sound quality is great and I can clearly hear all sorts of sounds needed in competitive matches (footsteps, reloading etc.) The volume is good and usually, you won't require more than what is providedThe only thing which could be improved can be the mic. This bendable thing can make most mics malfunction quickly than fixed mics. But you can't expect everything on an 800 bucks Headphone.Finally, I would definitely suggest you get this mic if you are tight on budget.You can always increase your budget and go for better Kotion Each or Cosmic Byte headphones for RS.1200 and above.EDIT: So after 1 year and 1 month of usage, I am finally ordering a new headphone, the problem in this one being that the leather covering on the cushion fell off, causing irritation in the lower part of my ear."
1,"If you plan to use this headphone on a new age laptop or a gaming console like Xbox or PS4 it will not work as it has old style wiring where there are 2 separate jacks for sound and Mic which most new laptops and consoles do not support. This is not shown in the pictures.Also Amazon does not accept return of this product so once you buy it you are stuck with it.Edit: Amazon did make an exception and accepted a return so ""Thank You Amazon"""
1,I am writing this review after 3 month. The head phone looks good but the quality is not that good. The 3.5 mm Jack that connect to the pc showed some issue after a month of use as the cable is not braided and the headphone cushions are good but you will feel pain on your ear after some hours of use. If you want a headphone then go for a braided one. Never expected this from redgear
1,It's just too heavy.  Even adults cant use it for more than 5 minutes.  You will certainly become a Cervical spondylosis patient.  There should be some standards for such devices for health safety.. this one is a big health hazard.  I have not used other gaming headphones but buyers must consider the  WEIGHT of the headphone before buying.
5,"I bought this Headphone in November Starting for my personal work and I have to say that this is one of the most comfortable and best headphones you could get under Rs.1000 .I bought this for a price tag of Rs.899 and I really feel that it is value for money product .You might be thinking about what are the pros and what are the cons of this headphone , so I have mentioned all of the pros and cons below -Pros (Advantages) -1. Very Comfortable Gaming Headphones (The first moment I wore these headphones , I had a feeling of joy as the cushions in the headphones were so soft and it really felt like I could wear it forever :D)2. Clear and Crisp Sound Quality3. Strong , Durable and Good Quality Cable4. RGB Lightning is unique in it's own way5. Perfect Design which gives premium look and feelCons -1. After wearing for almost 4-5 hours ,  I felt like my ears were paining a bit , but now I think I am getting used to it , so It would vary for every person .2. The microphone does it's work , but the recording quality of Microphone is not that good.At last I just want to say that if you are looking for a budget gaming headset , then you must go for this one .Even if it is under Rs.1000 , GO FOR IT!!I hope this review would have helped you guys in deciding whether to buy this product or not .Thank You!Have a nice day :)"
4,"First of all very bad n pathetic packaging/handling by Amazon. But due to no damage to product I didn't returned it.Now about this product, is actually good even it's imported from China it's distributed n marketed by Indian company Redwood's Interactive based in Mumbai.1. For gaming if your compared it with other headphones in same price category it is good but not so loud. While gaming if your game or hardware can output more audio then it's good cause this headphones can go more louder with amplification.2. As I said audio is good but not loud for 2.1 stereo sound. But if you are watching any  7.1 audio channel video then it's really feels good.3. For comfort I have used it for more than 4-5hrs with allgrown hairs(thanks to Lockdown) n didn't feel any problem as cushioning is good and comfortable. Also earcups are large n deep so you don't feel any pain + it feels light weight.As per price to performance ratio this is perfect headphones with RGB.Let me know if any one have questions regarding it."
3,"Before I offer my critique about the product, I would first want you to know that products below 1,000rs are known to be limited by something.If you've used any headset before and were pleased with the sound quality, then you wouldn't like the Cloak.The headset has some very important flaws that competitive gamers need to consider:1. It's got low sound output.2. Directional sounds are not clear. Sometimes when the enemy is on the left, the sound may seem as though coming from above or below.3. Muffling sound. When firing weapons, the audio can drop to a very low level.4. The headset doesn't know how to handle multiple audios. It tries to compensate by automatically lowering the volume of multiple audio.The better part about the headset includes:1. A decent microphone2. Comfortable3. Cost-efficient4. RGB lightsHowever, notice that the headset is first a good audio delivery tool instead of a style element.If you have been gaming for over 2+ years, I wouldn't recommend this headset."
2,For an under 1000 INR headphones it's passable. Sound is not loud so need to push windows volume full. Design is quite attractive. RG logo shines with light loop preset.As far gaming the headphones are not comfortable for long hours. It pushes your side a bit hard and lead to slight headache.Volume Rocker is built in.Mic is ok ok as it need to put quite close to the mouth. All and all its an passable product. For hobbyist it's a steal in this price range. It has the best design in this price range not too flashy not too bore.Serious gamers don't buy.
5,"Awesome product...When I first saw them, I was like they are soo big.. but when you wear them, ah the comfort 🔥I played with this on for like 3hours continuously and I didn't feel any discomfort.Sound quality is pretty good but they are not very loud or maybe they have noise cancellation technology idk but I have to max the volume almost everytime .Rgb is very good and bright changes colours automatically and is pretty bright tooo..Overall just goo for it.."
5,"GOOD FOR dealy use comfortable cushions I used for almost 7 to 8 hours for playing csgoBut sound quality is not good for gaming .cosmic byte gs410 s sound quality is way better than this headphone but this headphone offers a good comfortCons- surround sound is not good traking enimies in cs not ez with thisNot 5.1 or 7.1 sound ,dont expect at this price pointMic quality is very nice my dad use this headphone for singing song on starmaker and the quality is of songs come way good"
5,It is quit decent deal . Mic is pretty sensitive catch up background noise good for audio recording of we edit for stream for startup it fine but need more improvement in noise rejections of back ground ... CCTV mic condenser are great for such a application if company use... I am engineer and create circuit so as this aspect I recommend such good product for gaming or as aid .. dac improve all over performance ..
5,The headphones are great but there are 2 jack instead of 1 so you have to buy a converter (Rs100-150) from your nearby local store if you don't have 2 jack laptop. Otherwise the audio is great (for gaming only). Don't expect too much bass as it is a gaming headphone. The RGB panel on sides has 3 LED bulbs fitted inside which change color from time to time and make a great looking addition to your gaming set-up and isn't even too costly. Recommend.
5,"I generally don't bother writing reviews, but I just wanted to appreciate this headphone. I mean for the price the headphones sound as good as I can really imagine. I have used the G430 before ( which was sort of mid-high end for it's time), and really coming to these earphones I really cannot say that they logitech sound better. These can get surprisingly loud and still sound crisp. I am no big audiophile but as a CSGO player, I don't think I have ever found myself complaining about the sound. I have carried these around often, it has often fallen off from my desk, I have pulled its wire hard, sometimes it has even got under the roller of the chair, yet the wire hasn't snapped or any issues whatsoever. Thank you redgear! I really liked this product."
4,"comfortable earcups, covers whole ear.multi coloured lighting on each side. (not customisable)mic quality is poor.build quality is great for a 900 rs headphone.the sound has a weird 3D effect to it. sure, this helps to locate enemies quickly in FPS games but it takes some time to get used to this new effect, and there is no option to turn it off or disable it, trust me i tried.great for listening to music.takes some getting used to for gaming."
1,Not working also the delivered piece is very different from the one shown in the picture.. Seems to be a dummy piece.. very bad quality..
1,"Very very bad in comfort..Bhai jab kaan hee dard karenge toh fir aachi sound quality ka kya mtlb, jab 20 minute se jada  pehan hee nhi paoge toh ese headphones ka kya faayda, isse aacha toh cosmic byte ke hee le lo bhalae hee thodi build quality kam hhh unki par kam se kam comfortable to hh, long time tak pehan toh paoge..YouTube pe jis-jis ne review kiya h unki mat sunna unko toh paise mille h toh aacha hee batange..Mai bata rha hu na inn headphones ki reality...Mai toh pachta rha hu, total waste of money...😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫"
2,"First of all, if I was judging the headphone based on looks, comfort and build quality.(5/5) Nothing and I seriously mean it, nothing comes close at this price range. They are perfect accessory for a gaming rig and that's all. Sound was too low when I got it; I thought it was faculty, so I replaced it. And second one was same as well. Sound was soo low I had to turn equaliser to max on all channels just to hear foot steps in games. Hence, I returned them as sound was priority for me.In conclusion, if you want a RGB gaming asthetic headphone only for the show buy this. It's cheap but looks way better. There is non customisable RGB, they are really big and will enhance look of your rig. But that's it no point in buying for gaming or audio.P.S. If they re-release these headphones with better audio, I would buy it in a heartbeat even at double the price."
2,"Pros: Good bass, good volume level, great for listening to music and zoom meeting, comfortable for someone with a small head.Cons: hard to distinguish the footstep direction, above and below sounds the same, especially for games like Rainbow Six Seige where sound matters a lot,most annoying thing is the unbraided cable, whichs tends to curl up a lot after a few months of use.Update: The headphone  pin has loose contact doesn't work properly and  the cable curls up too much."
1,"When on a video call or voice chat, the person on the other side can hear himseld through the headphone mic.Confused?There is so much sound bleed through the headphone, that the mic pics it up! The person on the other side of the voice call can hear the leaves outside your house brushing against each other and they can hear themselves through the mic. And the mic, oh god. Constant thumming sound because of the ceiling fan. Sound quality is terrible. You'll have to use equalizers to make any use of this.I later realised only the left side was working. This was due to the bad contacts on the headphone jack. This was also creating an audible ""hiss"" even with nothing running on the PC. Probably due to the hyper low quality mic picking up all the ambient sound in the neighbourhood.The ear cups are huge and soft, but immediately create a lot of heat around the ears the moment you put them on. I have a large head, and the ear cups fit me well and prevented any airflow in or out of the area enclosed by the ear cups. This however, did not prevent all the sounds from around me from leaking into the ear cups made for a bad audio experience.Build quality is okayish and the headphone looks fantastic. No braided cable though. It has three inputs, a USB input that powers the RGB, an audio jack and a microphone jack.It's HUGE and screams ""GAMER"". The RGB is beautiful, and almost every penny of the 899Rs that you pay for it went into the RGB looking good. Because nothing else seems to matter to Redgear, or most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers that bought this piece of trash. . As an accessory, the Redgear Cloak will look beautiful on your gaming table. But as a sound output device, it gets zero points.I will be replacing it right away, because unfortunately, there are no returns.Edit: Ordered a replacement unit that worked fine for 2 days and then the mic just stopped working, and the headphones keep disconnecting again. Returning. Worst experience I've had on amazon so far."
1,I will not recommend this to anyone venturing into gaming and streaming.The mic is awful and the headphone drivers are utter trash. Voice is crackling and not clear. Treble is very high and bass is pretty non existent.
1,I am a pro Counter Strike player and i had alot of difficulty to hear the footsteps of the enemy. Dont go for this product for gaming. Comfort is 90/100.
4,"Got this just for 899 (Best would be 799!!) though it is a great purchase for me.Body: Built for this headphone is very good enough. Plastic ear cups, huge cushion, metal frame, RGB Logo, Red colored mic head!! Loving it!Sound: Sound worths Rs 899! Good enough Bass and Treble. Loudness also worths its price.  There is controller on the backside of the left ear cup. Controller adjustment is nit so satisfying but it is negligible as we an ootion in your PC or Laptop to adjust volume!Mic: I hope you are not finding a noise cancellation enabled mic in the budget of Rs. 1000. Yes, it does not have such noise cancellation! But if your celling fan is running and you are attending a live meeting (Classes, Seminars..) in that case it would not fetch that fan sound. But in case of recording it would.. slightly!! Just a basic mic!Connectivity: It has 3 ports. Two Trs connectors (Speaker & Mic Separate) and one usb to power up those RGB lights. You have an option to uplug the usb if you don't want lights. No need of usb connection to get sound and record audio.Overall it is a great purchase!! Once it was out of stock for 3-4 months later it was available for 899, then i awaited for more 3 months for price drop!! Waiting for 799!! Alas!! This does not happened!!  Then bought it for 899!Go for it! You won't regret!"
1,Such a disappointing product for any price segment. Very bad sound quality. Mic doesn't work. Very heavy... You could break your neck and sweat like a pig. They are very brilliant..they don't provide an option for refund because they know how bad the product is. And not at all for gaming. Not even a bit. Please spend a little more if you are looking for a headphones that can give you better sound while playing FPS games.
5,"I owned Redgear Headphones before which I used for 6 years and they finally broke after rough use. These are better in build quality and the sound is really good. I have Dolby atmos for PC and they sure improve the Sound quality. There is not much difference between these and Logitech gaming headphones. They are good for entry-level gamers who have a budget for accessories. The RGB lights cannot be controlled, They keep glowing. The mic is really good, No static and background Noise"
5,"This is the best budget headphones guys, you can blindly choose this one and the reason I am saying this because of the following pros amd consSo the pros are1> being at the price of rs 899 it is the best buy2> for those of you who have rgb madness, get rgb on the ear cuffs and the microphone, though the mic has only a red color led3> the mic quality is awesome it is omnidirectional and has a very good audio quality for gamers who record or stream on twitch or YouTube. The mic quality is better than the cosmo 7.1.4> the wire quality is just fine and will last longer.5> it is super comfortable and looks stylish when you sit in front of your rgb gaming setup turning off the lights.Cons are1> the volume adjust scroll wheel is behind the left ear cuff. It is not attached to the wire which other headphones have.2> you *CANNOT* control the rgb of your headphones, so the gamers who have a single colour theme on their setup, this might not be the headphones you are looking for. But, who care for only quality and looks can definitely buy this.I hope this helped you all :)"
4,"I'm using Redgear Cloak the sound quality is decent microphone is okish and you'll need to buy a audio splitter for this headset the cushions are very comfortable and your ears are completely covered in the cushions 7/10 as per meFor Games like CSGO and Valorant this thing is good considering the price factorThe wire is thick and 2 feet longThe RGB has 3 ""PRESETTED"" modes you can't change any of the colors the microphone is also illuminated and glows in Red ColorNow the important part comes Smartphones for playing PUBGM you can easily play PUBGM and use the mic and headphone at the same time all you need to get is a splitter it'll cost around 70 bucks at a local market and you'll be able to use the RGB via the OTG but I wouldn't preffered that because it will drain the battery much faster overall you can get this headset for sake of playing PUBGM tooGet this product under 1k you are good to goGG"
3,"Its a great product overall, bit pricy , with in a month only sound stopped in left head phone due to poor pin (lose connection) internal wire must have been disconnected. So i have to fiddle around with the sound jack pin to get it working, its very annoying everytime... So i stopped usung it, the product came with warranty, but no warranty card, website was given, even their contact number is not present, nothing came in the box, even the user manual was missing... I have no idea what to do to get it replaced or claim it under the warranty..."
4,"i didnt even expected that in this budget under 1000Rs will get this good Headphone .. im AMAZED with REDGEAR's built Quality as its PREMIUM. Its looks like it is of 4000-5000RsSound Quality - 4.0Built Quality - 5.0Gaming - 3.0Wiring - 5.0Looks - 4.9Noise Cancelling - 4.0best under 1000rs , its best !! MUST BUY under that RANGE"
3,"Redgear Cloak Wired RGB Gaming Headphones with Microphone for PC is the Best headphones under ₹ 900/~.Pros:-1)Sound quality is good.2)Mic quality is decent.3)Comfort is also good.4)It's a stereo headphones not 7.1 virtual surround , but we can hear sound clearly.5)Looks like Professional Gaming Headphone.Cons:-1)Wire(cable) is not BRAIDED, very cheap quality of cable is used in this headphones.2)Not single USB, there are 2 aux(green aux for speakers , red aux for mic) and 1 usb for rgb light."
1,"Don't fall into the other good reviews which are at the top, this headphone sound quality is poor than those 100rs Chinese earphones, the sound is very low and bad quality. Although the only mic is the good thing in these headphones, if redgear fix or improves sound quality, definitely it would be the top choice of gamers."
1,"Very bad product, don't buy this product, sound quality and mic quality is very bad, but good looking, but good look is not matter. I am returning this product."
3,The sound quality is good but the volume is too low at 100% volume it sounds like 50%. Without ac you cannot wear it for long periods even for an hour. For my head size I feel the clamping force could be a little more and wire could be braided. These are the only cons and the rest of the headphone is good specially the microphone at this price.
3,"I'm only gonna tell the bad things so you know the rest is good/acceptable1. Really Really uncomfortable and that's the main reason why I returned it, it wasn't much heavy but the clamping pressure was so much and the headphone doesn't have another way to adjust the pressure or distribute it evenly because it's a cheap headphone let's be honest, the clamping pressure was so much, my jaw started to hurt after few hours of use and it wasn't very pleasent and it wasn't very comfortable to say the least.2. The ear cups are big but If have big ears, it's not gonna fit.3. The sound quality is alright, you can use something like Voice Meter to increase or tweak the sound but at highish volume, the bass sounds literally like farts, yes, no bass, sounds like farts.4. The ear cups are just not much, for this kind of design, it's not much."
2,I bought 2 sets and after 3 months the left earplugs of both of them stopped working.
5,Don't let the cost fool you this is better than any other 1k earphone by famous brandsm. Philips is good old manufacturer who sells to most other brands.
5,Good earphone in this price range
5,"Writing review after using them in the worst possible way for 6 months...- Dragged on floor- Crushed under my butt😅- Soaked in water for an hour ( forgot to take out from jeans while washing)They still work like a charmAlthough I didn't expect such quality while buying, I guess that's what Phillips is ! QUALITY"
1,Don't buy this product...it is a worst product.i used only 3-4 month after that one ear piece is not working..when I went at philips service centre  they denied that it will not be replaced because of Warren period is expired.....but on Amazon clearly mentioned that it has 1 year warranty ....now I m complete stuck....I can't see any direction..even I suggest that not buy any product of Philips... completely disappointed.........
2,I don't know whether my my piece was a fake one or not but its quality was like a 100rs earphone. Plus the left side stopped working after 1 week or so. Soundoutput is bad. Just bad for me. retutned it to amazon
5,"Best earphones in the price under 400. Before this i had order boat 225 earphone which was costly and worst earphone cause it was itchy and paining in the ears so i returned it. I think old is platinum so i gave chance to Philips brand. Nice sound quality, microphone also good. Made in china mention on the microphone and it proves again that why the chinese manufactured products are good.Not for those who are looking for higher bass quality sound.Simple made earphone,  build quality is very lighty which i like it. So go for it...."
4,PROS:Good Sound QualityComfortableBuilt In MicrophoneCall Attend ButtonDeep BassOk PriceYou get an philips brand
5,"I got this on November 20, 2018. Today is April 10, 2019 as I write this. Nearly 5 months using everyday for hours on end. Still working on both earpieces. I hope it works up to 1 year... That will be awesome. I will update when it stops working."
1,With in 11 days the speaker got damaged and not working now. Poor quality in sound effects. Waste of money. I think this is not original philips and amazon is supporting for duplicates. Don't go with Amazon .Please.
5,The sound quality is surprisingly amazing.. never expected such fantastic performance from such cheap earphones. Phillips is a trusted choice when it comes to earphones and music systems. However the thin wires don't seem to be much reliable for rugged usage.P.S. to avoid disconnection of wiring from earpieces due to unintentional stretching just put a small knot (semi tight) just short of all d three ends which can absorb the shocks ib themselves. See pic
5,"Many reviewed like poor bass and sound quality but the fact behind this is, it has higher impedance value. so for the low end phones or devise whose output power from 3.5mm jack is less you cant except a great quality audio from this earphone. if it is connected to a little high end audio device or to a amplifier then the output will be superb.For me the sound is comparatively less when compared to my boat and another Philips over ear headphone as they have low impedance value (between 16 to 24), but when connected to a guitar and keyboard amplifier the sound is awesome. the other two headset mentioned above produced a noisy sound when connected to amplifier."
2,Right earpiece stopped working in a month!! Sound quality is excellent! If not for that right earpiece it was a 4.5 star
1,it is so obvious that your products are NOT tested for working quality before dispatch. My last three purchases were example of my statement. 1. Executive chair--handle broke on normal weight. 2. Kitchen timer- not working. 3. Philips earphones -one side only working. 4. Leather shoes 1CM less than ordered.Your return policy is skewed to your advantage.I am now stopping certain purchases from Amazon.An unsatisfied long term customer of four years.
1,Failed with in 3 months ..very disappointing 😡
1,Worst worst worst deal ever!I have brought this for the second time ...assuming that first one was malfunctioning because of my phone's port...but I was wrong this headset was the culprit behind .. Nd the same problem happened with this one again ... It's better to get local earplugs than buying this useless deal!
5,great earphone. good bass ever I heard from earphones. good noise cancellation microphone and earphone. helped a lot while driving a bike. earphone sits perfectly in ear. no pain even after long use.  thanks to bass quality and noise cancellation I can enjoy listening music and can take call even in crowded streets.
5,"I bought this second time, My first one I gave to my brother and now I bought it again because of my brother is still using it for the last 7 months, At this price with this sound quality is awsome don't look for anything else just buy it without any hassle. Don't get confuse with any other comment"
1,"The damn thing doesn't work.It became useless for me in just a week's time. If I am not wrong this would be my first Philips product which stopped working within 5 days of working. It gives disjointed sound, there is a irregularity in the sound. There has been not mishandling of the cord or the headset but Amazon would not take it back because the return window is closed. This kinda short window on return of electronic goods is quite unjust because we do not buy things out of pure necessity and hence sometimes when one procures a product, he or she takes a week or so in opening the product or strat using it."
1,The sound quality was good but within 6 months they are not working. You would expect the amount of money you are paying would give you something reliable.
1,"Voice recording using mic sounds like you're being heard in a Radio.Sound quality : is terrible, like you hear when a speaker is kept inside a bucket.Absolutely Ridiculous.Durability : I used it for hardly 40 minutes for two days. On the third day it worked in the morning for 20 minutes, I kept them aside and used after a another three days and Boom!... Within a week's usage (approximately) one earbud stopped working. Disappointing beyond all measures.Value for money : I had a pair of earphones that I ordered before them for HALF the price, and they lasted for FIVE months. Their sound /mic quality wasn't the best but was DEFINITELY better than this crap. Money wasted.Conclusion : I bought a joke."
4,"Unlike the V sound signature of other headphones below 1000 budget, this one is balanced. Something like the sennheiser cx180.It's not like the bass isn't there - very low frequencies are amplified and mid-lows are flat. Vocals are perfect. Treble is just there. Can listen to audiobooks all day which is why i bought this.The mic is a bit lower than desired but those who hear me in call isn't complaining."
4,"ANNEXURE 6 Dec 2020 -One bud is gone today! Just 3.5 months!? Shame...1. It seems a jenuine item and a good buy. Box wasn't sealed though, and not sure if that's how it should be. The item is new alright.2. Sound is nothing special but it is fairly good. Perhaps the output level is a bit low.3. MRP on box is 399. At 299 - I am happy.4. Earbuds are of a good design - comfortable and easy to wear. But it's difficult to identify L n R sides.5. Mic is good.6. Cables are soft but sturdy. Sets of extra coushions are included alright.7. I find NO mention of warranty info anywhere! This is confusing and concerning.8. The box is very highly oversized. That's a lot of paper wasted. It's totally unnecessary. Philips should consider a box of one third size."
4,"I bought this on 8th Aug,2020. And it certainly stopped working on 18th April,2021. As this earphone comes with an warranty of 1year, now I want to see what warranty can do. But I couldn't find any window where products within warranty period can be contacted. So I'm not sure how much warranty period means for philips or Amazon. Consider this point while buying because if you aren't interested in warranty of the product, this same quality product you can get in less price."
2,Came to know after receipt of the product that it is made of China... Although I searched while purchsing but could not find the manufacturing country.... Purchased Phillips understanding that it will not be from China...Very much upset that I did a big crime betrayel to my Indian Soldier...Request Amazon team to information of origin of country on the products while purchasing...Request other fellow Indians not to purchase this product...This is China made
5,"This product has 10mm drivers and provide rich bass with balanced mids and treble. So for any music genre, these will be helpful.Product quality is good, mic is sensitive enough for general talking but not as sensitive as Philips 2405.Using for a long period does not cause any harm (if you listen music at low volume) and earbud quality is good, not very easily breakable as some more 'aggressively marketed' products have.Down side is warranty of 6 months only and this product cannot be registered to the Philips website. I guess for warranty issue, we have to call the vendor not the service centre. So, keep the invoice copy with you.Overall, a just enough good product with decent sound quality but nothing special about to be mentioned."
1,"Pathetic product do not buy at all!I used then 7-8 times hardly and they were gone, no sound nothing, better to go with MI only, even if they are 50 bucks costlier they at least function for 4-5 months h der heavy usage. Either this product is fake or Phillips is not what it used to be at one point of time."
4,"When it comes to earphones, Phillips always ended up coming through.I went through multiple cheap earphones that would break down within weeks. This is the second Phillips ear phone I bought and the first one lasted nearly 2 years! I am enjoying this second one as well!The earphones fit comfortably in the ears and don't cause pain when in use. They connect to the mobile phone, the laptop and the tablet and provide clear voice and music in all of them.Max. My issue is that after a certain point, the buds fall off if by mistake you stand up while connected to the laptop. But they can be easily attached back. If you lose one, there are spares buds provided.The buds are also easy to clean and maintain. No worries, no problems. Go ahead and try it!"
2,I have been using the old Philips She earphones (the spectacularly low priced o es with excellent comfort and bass) but had ro buy this since the former is out of stock. This earphone is very uncomfortable especially if you use it while lying down in bed. My biggest issue is regarding the comfort or lack of it while using it especially while sleeping.
4,The headphone fits nicely and comes with additional 3 pairs of different sized ear plugs. The mic is crisp and quite audible from the receiver's side. The cable could have been better. The audio is good but the BASS is very much overpowering resulting in not a good listening experience.Can't complain much considering the price point at which the item sells.
1,"Sound Quality is very bad. Producing troubling noise from Right side earphone.Poor audio calling. This will happen after 30 days. So one cannot replace in Amazon and will be forced to Contact Phillips Customer care.Phillips customer care:1. Worst and very rude behaviour. Pathetic experience.2.. Don't have any mindset for replacing the part.3. They even scold you for telling that product is not working.4. You have to go to Phillips service centre 10 or more times for resolution. (Service centre person response: If you want come, this is the rules)"
4,"Clean, clear crisp and detailed. Hope the specs are also displayed on the website as printed on the box... Like 20hz~20khz, 103db, ect. The description by the seller says noise cancelling - this is not true. Noise cancelling headphones are of different construction and build quality. This is Philips and recommended for its genuine quality and value for money always. I recommend, and the bass quality is pretty good!!"
4,"One of the best earphones, and that too this cheap. Definitely recommend to go for it without having any 2nd thoughts. I have tried boat, MiVi, earphones, bluetooth headset, and airpods and let me tell you, they all let you down. For an awesome gaming exp I got a Cosmic Byte Gaming headset that surprisingly turned out to be insanely amazing. Just out knocked it out of the park. But since it's a complete headset, it falls in a very different category of listening devices.All in all, if you are looking for an amazing accessory for very affordable price, do go for this without waiting for a 2nd opinion."
4,Went through so many products before selecting these...trust in Phillips and earlier I used Phillips Base + so I decided to brought these budget Headphones...Very Fast Delivery by Amazon and the product received in good condition..the wire quality is very good at this price tag...Bass Quality is very Good felt little bit low at initial but after changing Equalizer settings you will get good bass.. and Sound Quality is also very good ...overall it's the best product at this price range..
4,"dont expect too much from it but still i am surprised at the decent sound and bass quality it delivers at this price. packaging from amazon was kinda OK.. but still it was fine.you can definitely go for this headphones without a doubt if u r on a tight budget. i have used senheisser, boat, wecool, sony xbr.. so trust me when i say this, it definitely delivers above average sound quality and bass.. philips has always met my expectations no matter how small or big it is."
1,This is a worst product I hate Philips a lot... I bought this product received it from amazon within 3 days.... And after 4 days left speaker stopped working and then I got it replaced by amazon... And after 6 days again left speaker stopped working then within 2 days more both speakers stopped working... Worst product by Phillips don't buy it at all plzzz.... Waste of money
1,"The sound quality is good so it can work good as headphones rather than one with Mic. I didn't believe it will be such a poor quality that person can't hear properly. Don't buy as you can get better one from competitor like Boat which last for long time without any issues.In short, not worth to buy with Mic, can work good as headphones"
3,"I bought this over the ptron ones thinking this may be made in India. Sigh.. nope.. its working alright, but I ended up buying made in china nonetheless. Don't go for it if that is your criteria too.. maybe try boat or some other company. i should have asked before too. Otherwise as a product it is Philips quality.. works fine. I may update this review again once these go bad to share what was the product life cycle."
4,"The headphones are great for this price. Oy thing I did not like is the jack. Its straight. My phn has headphone jack on the lower side. Because of this, it's quite difficult to use this straight jack headphone. Apart from this, the sound is great, bass is good too, I have been using them for 3 months now, so I will say it is durable."
3,"Well to begin with the sound produced by the product is superb even the bass is good but the problem with the product is it's endurity which doesn't last long and one of my earphones got the sound got ripped.Anyways then miraculously I found a headphone in my local market which was rs.50 and was able to complete with this one and even better, but the only problem with it was the earplug which is a little slippery so I decided to change the earplugs and sell it in amazon, please look forward to the earphones"
4,"NOTE:@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,BUILT QUALITY :------------------● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.● JBL  - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●COMFORT :------------● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●LOUDNESS :-------------CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.●●  WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :---------------------------------------------I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :----------------------------------● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :PNOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●CUSTOMER CARE :--------------------● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●CONNECTIVITY :------------------All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.VERDICT :----------I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.Hope this review helps you make sound decision."
1,It worked fine for around 1.5 months and thereafter sound from one of the speaker became almost nil.Two more negatives1) Does not contain volume control2) Identifier to distinguish between left and right speaker is not easy to find and read on day to day basis
5,"I have used sony MDR-XB series earphones/headphones for a long time ..I have used XB-30EX, XB-55AP, XB-650BTI just got one issue in all the sony products that they don't last long more than a year.Even my XB650BT which costed me approx ₹6000 last october(2017), started giving me issues on its right speaker.So my openion on JBL C100SI is that YOU CAN DEFINITELY PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT..!The reason for this is because u can't find any difference in SOUND QUALITY/BASS/SOUND CLEARITY between double/tripple time costing any other product than this JBL earphones.I am using this earphones for more than 4 months and they just sound like my old sony earphones but @ just half the price range.So i suggest you to choose wisely what you need."
1,A reqular buyer on Amazon. But this time completely thugged. The description says Origin India. But have been delivered a Made in China Product. Unfortunately I discarded the box and bag and stuff so unable to return it. But this time is a complete disappointment. A complete different description to what is sold.Even second purchase it's made in china. Posting image.
3,"After using the JBL in-ear headphones for about 10 month the product started showing problem in it's right earpiece.I am trying to connect to the JBL customer care but every time Amazon is providing a number which is not working. The toll free number are always busy of JBL customer service.So if anyone is interested in buying this earphone don't buy it because the after sale services are really bad and probably the worst compare to other earphone products.Lastly, if anyone know how to claim the product please kindly share it with me."
1,This product is not worth the money.My earphone didn't even last 3 months.Now I want to exchange it in warranty but don't know how to do it and I am stuck with a faulty piece.
5,I think it's a one of the most best in quality earphone introduced in marketBecause I have already use earphones like boat headbass100One more and like sony.. senhensierBut after reading some reviews  about this product. I have purchased it from amazon #JBL C100SI is awesome sound effects than other earphone that I have already mention aboveI think it suits almost all mobilesBut some mobiles for best sound and beat we must  adjust equalizer then it produces awesome sound effectsFor both sound and bass .Don't think so..Go for this beast JBL C100SIAnd purchased just for 549 on sale..
4,"Best in dis price Range.Best part of dis earphones dat is tangle-free. Sound quality is owsm,bass is gud, u can hear every single detail.But one thing i want to mention here dat if u r looking for d beat earphones in dis price range wid mic den go for it.And if u don't need a mic den go for Sennheiser CX180 ."
4,"I have been using this headphone extensively for last 4 months. I have found it durable and easy to use.It's sound quality is better than Boat 225, which was my previous earphones and a competitor of the JBL's one in this price range. Clear sound, good bass and an overall great experience.If you want a quality earphones from a trusted brand, go for this one, you won't regret.PS ~ Amazon was lightning quick with the delivery too."
1,"Buying because 'JBL'? Well don't or you would regret it later.1 side stopped working, and going to the service centre 20 km away(okhla) only service centre in Delhi isn't worth it.But waste you money if you really want these 👍"
4,"I am writing this review after about 6 months of use as most earphones i purchased under Rs 1000/- never lasted for even half a year.Surprisingly these are still working well (*touchwood*) despite my rugged use.Pros:- Great external noise cancelation.- Good clarity while watching movies- Reasonably decent bass levels of the price. They wont let you down when the beat drops :P- Being an Audiophile whose working for brands like Yamaha, Jamo Dynaudio, mission amd many more these are the best for music to hear ever subtle note however I have to keep in my that I paid 599 for these on a lightning deal which makes the superb value for money while listening to music.- Gold plated connector pin for higher conductivity.- Clear microphone quality over call or while recording a vlog.- lightweight due to which they are not a burden on your ears and don't fall of your ears easily.- Cable spread adjustable lock built-in.Cons:- Gold plating on connector pin is slightly wearing of after 6 months.- There are better bass heavy earphones at this or lower price point. But this is very subjective to the genre of music you listen too. As to much bass kills the Mids & Highs. So you can call these headphones as balanced.Conclusion:Go for these if you're looking for a pair of branded earphone under 999/- with a microphone which will last you for a reasonable long time & have good quality balanced sound for movies and music.If you found this review useful make sure to hit the HELPFUL button under the review.  Happy shopping  Gills Guide."
1,Within one month left speaker not working. Waste of money.. Don't buy it
5,Superb product!! This is my 2nd time buying these earphones. Before these I purchased Sennheiser cx 180 street 2 but in just 3 months the sound quality dropped to minimum. Had to switch back to JBL.So here's the detailed review...Pros :1. Sound : Too great. Had to put my sound bar to half. Quality doesn't lessens even at the max sound. Bass is superb too.2. Built quality : marvelous built. One thing I like about JBL is that they make slight changes even if the launched model is way old. Built quality has been upgraded. Only thing I wanted was L shaped lead but it's fine.3.  Noise cancellation : great noise cancellation. You can totally rely on this. Once you put on everything will seem great about it.4. Ear comfort : fits too well. You won't need to adjust them once you've put them on.Cons : apart from the normal shaped lead I didn't found any cons about it. It will last for more than an year and can even work for more than 2 years if handled carefully.Hope this will help you decide.Have a nice day!!
4,"I have used a variety of earphones like boat, soundmagic, Panasonic, Sony, Flipkart smartbuy and few more. This earphone from JBL the c100si has clear sound and decent base.Cons1. packaging is very average and the seal sucks because it can be easily tampered and yet go unnoticed.2. Bass loudness is average at best but is very clear though. this is definitely not for bass lovers. Its adequate but its not punchy like boat or Panasonic.3. Treble is a bit high at times and may get irritating4. No angled 3.5mm Jack, might be an issue for some.Pros1. Excellent clarity all over the frequency range2. Decent build quality, looks like it will last for a year3. Mic is good enough for calling purpose.Overall a decent product from a well known brand at an affordable price."

5,Better than boat 225 caz it does not loose easily from ur ear. No meaning of sound if u not comfortable with headphone.I was suffering huge problem with boat 225 when it looses from my ear during normal walking. but it sound is too loudy .C100si is low but has crystal clear sound. Also it fits easily in ear.I am listening songs mostly at night while sleeping but u can not sleep facing your ear to pillow causing some irritation with C100si.And with boat 225 It is anyhow not possible caz it has pole like length of lid and u feel pain.I wanted to buy Sennheiser caz it is more good in respect of comfortablity but due to absence of mic ( which is necessary in PUBG) I forcefully buy C100si.
1,3rd class product from jbl😡. build quality nd sound quality is very poor. Bass is very low..and 1 ear tip is missing...i want to return this but no optionfor it. Guys dont waste your money for this crap.
1,"This is a solid earphone. Although I don't like the sound quality over Sennheiser cx180. But since it has mic and I wanted to play PUBG mobile so I am satisfied with it.Second thing I don't like about it is the design of earbuds. They are always falling out of my ears. I had to replace the ones with a pair from Samsung.Third, the cable is not durable. I must clarify that I use earphones extensively with my smartphone. The cable of this earphone is broken from the joint near headphone jack. Even though it's been barely six months.I am not satisfied with this."
5,"Firstly,I would thank Amazon for their timely and hazzle free delivery.Comming to the earphones, I am using them since last 1-2 months and the overall experience is just what I expect from a JBL earphone worth Rs. 800. Sound quality, material quality and durability is perfectly what I had hoped for. They come with a mic so that is an advantage which makes them a complete package earphone to buy in this price range. I believe most of you know JBL is a brand and hence it goes without saying that it would offer the best in class products. So its a very wise option to buy in this prize range."
4,I Bought this headphone for one of my friend and she is very happy with its AMAZING sound quality.:)It a better choice to gift this product to your music lover friends.Go for it..
1,"I was used it for 5-6 Days.Their are 2 outputs based on my experience.1. When used it Slightly Loose in ear :- i felt Treble/Vocals was so high an no base either you listen music or on call.During calls over night (2hrs) use my family member were easily able to listen what other person speaking on call.after use it make me deaf for shorter time and whole night and next day it cause me headache.2. When used  fit in ear.You feel high base still Treble are here, I felt it that my ear drums was poping.I listened music continue for 30 mintus using YouTube, Goolge Music , Mi music, different Phone but result was same. When i removed it from ear it cause deafness for some time and drowsiness and pain in earOver call still high vocalsSame result for Si200 model but base is lacking and clear audio"
1,JBL has only 7 Service Centers in India....!! Earphone is not working right now so I have to travel from Pune to Mumbai to replacement ??  Check the service center list before buying any JBL product.... Worst customer care experience ever...!! took me more than 30 min. to connect with customer care....!!
5,"Pros:-1.Excellent noise cancellation for this price range. And if the music is on, you won't be able to listen majority of things going on outside. Even in great traffic, it cuts the noise to half of the original intensity without any music. With music,it cuts off the noise upto 97%.2.Sound is perfectly balanced.It was a great experience to listen to all the genres with it.I had absolutely no problem with it. It's been a year now since I am using them and they are still perfect man!👌👌👌3. Mike is located at the perfect spot and has a good power if catching sound. The mike button also works pretty well.4. Have recommended it to all my friends and they loved it too.Con:-This may be only in my case. Because my ears are the smallest ears to be found(according to my family and friends)😄😄😄 and only the smallest size of ear buds fit in my ears. And I didn't get the smallest size of earbuds with this earphone.So, had to arrange it from outside.That's not a big issue as it seems. But lemme tell you, if the earbuds are not fitting perfectly inside, then, audio experience and the noise cancellation property, all goes in vain because your earphones would be falling out of your ear every now and then which is very irritating.2. And being from a middle class household, Honestly it was a bit costly for me🙄...but i saved money and purchased it.No regrets for that. It's awesome.But to prevent any damage to it,I covered it up with  cover(spiral wires).Otherwise, no problem at all. It's the perfect earphone in this price range👌Totally happy😊"
1,"I bought a pair of JBL earphones on 21/5/2020. It worked perfectly for a few months after which the left side of the earphone stopped working. I launched a complaint @ JBL for the replacement. The customer care gave me an address, which was far away from my house. They said it was the only center in Pune for the replacement of the product.After reaching @ the given address, I was told that the concern facility that they had stopped the service of JBL since past two months & they have even informed JBL about it but JBL didn’t changed the address @ their portal. After having wasted half of my day and getting such terrible service, in fact no service at all I had no option but to inform JBL about their employee’s grave misconduct. I requested to speak to their manager but instead of transferring my call they kept it on hold for more than half an hour.It was a hideous experience for me. I do not recommend you to buy their products as the after sales service is appalling and careless to say at the least.The customer service is supposed to be there for the customers benefit and not for making them roam all around the city just to exchange a product which stopped working in a couple of months which was well within the warranty.I have made a decision that, now onwards I will not be buying any product of JBL. Guys, pls be careful while buying anything of JBL."
2,"After using this with SONY MDR-EX150AP and CX180.Sound qulity: cx180 lil bit driven by clarity, jbl lil bit driven by base, prefer sony because it has right proportion of base and clarity.Mic: cx180 doesn't have mic others two have.Durability: cx180 don't even last 3 months. One side stopped working, though I had repaired I was not satisfied with the durability. Sony and jbl are still working fine. Will have to see, both seems durable.Comfort: Normal use SONY feels more snuggly and comfortable. JBL comes out often while you are using(I tried changing the bud with lil bigger one but it feels uncomfortable, I'm using with spare bud that's included with my sony headphone and now feels ok). CX 180 fits and feels well but not upto the mark of SONY but while sleeping CX180 is more comfortable because of its less protruding design.***JBL- Other nearby people can easily hear what you are listening (slightly better when used with sony buds)Price: JBL wins.So you decide.Update:JBL stopped working both sides after 10months."
1,"I have been using this for about a week now, and it is already not working at times.  A heavy object was placed over the product, I agree, but I am sure any product has to be sturdy enough to withstand some pressure.  I have to throw this away in another month or so because the quality of the wire is so thin that even a minor mishandling of the wire will mean you are losing the entire money spent on the product.After purchasing cheap earphones for many many years, I decided to buy a branded product. I feel this is not worth it, buy an inexpensive product, comes under your computer, throw it away and buy the next one if you want to buy a product and treat it like a reincarnation of god because it is so feeble in quality is not my cup of tea."
1,The headphone I received was not a genuine JBL product. The sound quality appeared like fake JBL headphone sold by street-vendors. I have an old JBL headphone of same model and there was stark difference in overall audio quality. Never expected this kind of product quality from amazon seller. I have requested a replacement and hope that I get a genuine JBL product.
5,"Perfect birthday gift to music lover.Sound quality are awesome. It s very comfortable and work perfect for listening for long hour.

5,"I am actually this product (earphones) continuously for 20 hours a day (be it listening to music, or talking) and I am fully satisfied the quality of sound it is providing. Actually the best one can have in this price range. Even in crowded place or wherever I go, it provides me full satisfactory audio quality, and smooth experience. It fits into the ear so finely (and light weight) that I didn't have to bother about it or put it off while I am in bike or cycle. So, basically, it is worthy my money and I am writing this as a satisfied customer of this product. Thank you Amazon."
5,Headphone review1. Packaging good2. Made of premium quality plastic3. Very comfortable no pain in ears after using it for 2 hours4. Noise reduction is very good5. Bass is little less but trebble is quite good and very balanced voice.6. Very good branding.7. Mic availableBad thing is wires are not tangled free and JBL should provide a pouch to carry.Otherwise better than Skullcandy and Mi basic earphone. If you don't need mic go to Sennheiser.Overall satisfied with the product...!!
5,"Firstly, I have been using this earphones for about two months, and I haven't seen one single problem. The length is a little too long, but it's okay. Noise cancellation is just mind blowing. Even if you just put them on and not play anything also, you can't hear people talking around you. But if it's at full volume, even if battles are going on around you, you can't hear them(a little exaggeration, haha) If you are an extreme basshead, please go for boAt. The bass in this earphones is basically non existent, but hey, you don't buy JBL for the bass, but for the pure sound(which is wonderful, by the way) Even if you are a person who likes the Apple model of earphones, and not the shove in the ear type(like me), you won't find any problem with the comfort, thanks to the angled design. Finally, definitely buy this product, but wait until the price becomes 549 Indian rupees(about 7.45 US Dollars, 6.09 Euros) , because Amazon sometimes makes it 700 Indian Rupees(9.5 US Dollars, 7.78 Euros). Whatever type of person you are, you will find these earphones an absolute delight. I loved them, and I have given them a 5 star rating on everything except the bass. I recommend the white version(ONLY CAUSE IT LOOKS BETTER). Hope this review helps a lot of people. If it helped anyone, please say so. I will feel happy."
1,"Noise cancelling not working. Other party can clearly hear my tv sound, my kid shouting.while on call...jbl just making people fool by saying active noise cancelling technology but what is this_ other party can clearly hear all nearby sound along with my voice. Planning to file a legal case against this since they are duping, defrauding customers."
4,"Well it's brand is popular, but it too has pros and cons:-Pros---*Crisp sound quality*Mic is excellent like mics of Samsung*No distortion even at 90-100 volume*Enough loudness*Noise cancellation is good at that priceCons---*Bass is not up to the mark treble is relatively high*Wire is also average gets tangled, but is manageable*No clipsThat's all thanks for reading, tag it helpful if you liked."
1,"Totally disappointed by the quality of earphone. It did not even stand for one year. One of the earpiece is not working.And above all that they have worst service centre in Hyderabad. I don't understand how can they tied up with a service centre (Sri Sai communication)  which has got so many bad reviews, don't they are worried about their reputation. I lost my money. I had a high expectations from JBl and Amazon."
2,"Here i mention few points about the product,1. Packing is good.2. wire is delicate, which may get teared soon.3. not having "" L "" shaped connector, due to this many times earphones get disconnected while keeping in pocket.4. Will be good only for music tat to with less bass sound .5. No option to receive the call in headphone, even if we receive manually the sound is low.6. After successfully using for year, i put it to dustbin as only right side headphone worked.Suggested product: boAt BassHeads 225"
1,"No noice-reduction feature, this makes it useless for talking on call.While talking on phone, my actual voice going to the other end is very little, instead the other end can perfectly hear my surronding disturbance. I have to hold the mic and keep it very close to mouth in order to let other person hear my voice. But my wife talking on phone in background can be perfectly heard by the other person on call."
5,"Today I would like to compare it with Realme Bud 2.In terms of build quality Realme slightly better. Realme is 1inch longer than JBL c100si. But Realme gives 6 months warranty and JBL gives 1 year warranty. Both has mic. But JBL has one control button and Realme has three buttons, one control button and other two to increase or decrease volume. JBL hasn't any rubber band/strap to organise it's cable. Realme cable are braided nylon cord whereas JBL use normal rubber material cable. Though both are tangle free, but Realme is better in terms of cable quality and to manage it's cable than JBL.Now comparing sound quality, I found JBL far better than Realme. Many YouTube blogger said that Realme sound is best in ₹600 -700 price range earphone segment because of it's 11mm driver. They gave better position to Realme than JBL. Though Realme has 11mm driver, but it's sound is noisy. JBL sound quality is smoother than Realme. Bass and treble everything is clear and the sound doesn't disturb your ear. I can say it sounds like Sony music system. You will surely love to listen music with JBL c100si earphone.In terms of fitting, both are good. But JBL has little bit edge over Realme because of it's shape. And Realme is slightly heavier than JBL.Regarding call quality, I didn't find any difference in call quality in either of these earphones. The sound is clear in both ends.Hope this review will give you a clear idea to choose the right one...👍"
2,"I am here with a comparison to boat100(my old earphone) to JBL100PlugBoat : It has a good quality silver plated plug.JBL: It has a golden plated plug but the design seems to be vulnerable. May cause disconnection if bend carelessly.Chord wireBoat: very strong high quality thick wire which can last for longJBL: very thin , light weight structure which I think will not have long life.It got cut within a week.worst.MicBoat: it's little longer with good material quality.JBL: small low quality, light weight material but the function seems to be good.It has got small clip to stop the unwanted movement of mic.HeadphoneBoat: The design seems to be special and overall good.JBL: Standard design with a better fit.Sound qualityBoat: Good sound quality.JBL: Good sound quality with more bass.WarrantyBoat: warranty is thereJBL: No warranty. Just throw away if damaged.Verdict: With almost same sound quality, Boat seems to be having the upperhand according to me due to the built material quality. In JBL,The chord wire, mic and the plug neck seems to be vulnerable. And there is a ""made in China"" sticker in JBL too(If you are bothered about the make).The cost of JBLCS100 is more than even Boat225, so you can even go for that."
5,"Jbl C100SI is one those rare earphones which stands right in my demand.Using this earphones for more than 3 years still working perfectly so if you are looking to buy earphones for urself so i am going to share Pros & Cons According to me -PROS -1) Good Highs & Lows.2) Noise cancellation to an extent.3) equipped with bass.4) Excellent In line microphone.5) extra ear cups of small, medium,large.CONS -1) Light wire quality.2) Tangled wire.3) Less Wire Length.So, if u are planning to buy earphones you will happy because it also works very good while playing online games using this earphones.So from my side its a go go ..👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻I hope you like my review of you have any questions do ask i will be more than happy to give answers.ThankYou..."
2,"This earphone comes in the league of Sennheiser and Soundmagic as far as sound quality is concerned! Sound quality is very similar to those company earphones! However the frequency response is only between 20hz-20khz so deep base is absent(should be lower than 20hz). The depth in sound is also not present unlike soundmagic earphones which have depth! The biggest issue with these earphones is that it is very uncomfortable! Due to the size and shape of the earphone it occupies the ear fully and puts pressure on it, so many of you will feel uncomfortable using it(unless you have bug ears and ear opening!). Buy it if only if you are on a budget, want good sound quality and have big ears!"
1,"Guys,  guys do not buy this product its a scam this product things to start malfunctioning after a few days the voice clarity is not good you will not appreciate this headphone if you are a bass lover and problem is that the sounds are not clear and one of problems and I phase personally during the usage of these headphone was that it tends to fall of the Year it's not comfortable to wear and Tear quality is very bad this things to stop working you have to be really really really care for you don't wanna Domestic Product it's really easy to damage it and it's not a good product its not by any means a very solid build product and it's definitely not durable"
4,"Material quality is good but I can't say anything about it's durability. I feel that if you handle it carefully then it's good but if you just roughly use it then may be you broke the headphone from speaker folding side. Sound quality is good at this prizepoint don't expect to much. Although, I receive some day defective product as because right side of speaker is noisy. Some unnecessary noise comes from right side of speaker. I requested to Amazon for replacement hopefully it'll replaced by good product nor defective one."
5,Best Sony headphone for the what you spend. Good sound and build quality. I have been using this for 1 and half year. Only thing happened is material covering the earcups started to peal off. But usable. No issue with the sound or any damaged parts even after rough use.
4,"Okay.... Let me get this straight.... I havent been using this headset for straight up 4 years... I have tried many a headphones and in-ears after this... But for the first 2 years i had no other choice but to use it..... I still use it every now and again these days.... And that should make my review CLEAR as i will give you all of the the wholistic view of the headphones...(MIDRANGE ONLY-audiophiles dont laugh) (ONLY HEAVY READERS MAY READ THIS WHOLE... BUT I WILL TRY TO MAKE IT AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE)For me i have tried BOAT in-ears which come around 599 or 499, JBL heasets which come around 799....and currently Jabra smart halo which was given to me.... Price is around 5000-7000.... Bluetooth headsetNow starting the review.... You must have read the above review and gotten a general idea of the sound quality and its lightweightedness...OKAY these are REALLY LIGHT and COMFY headsets... It doesnt clamp onto your ears like other on-ear headsets...PORTABILITY is on par.... The build is such that it could be folded and there are no useless curves so you can throw them into your bag and do not worry about it being crushed...The third is the main and its the SOUND QUALITY... damn... I am still shocked till this day... How were they able to pack these sounding drivers in there.... And the fact that it was available to me 4 hears ago... Probably lower than this price... I got it for Rs.499 which is just a total steal..... The sound is kinda FLAT.... And if you are a PROPER LISTENER... this is obviously a PLUS POINT.... It has a SOUND SIGNATURE very pleasing to hear and should not build up TENSION and ADRENALIN in the moments where you just want to.... SLEEP...... or relax.... Also somewhat FLAT signature lets you listen to the song the way it was meant to be BY THE ARTIST...Also the sound is WIDE...It doesnt feel that the sound is only playing inside your head... YEAH it is pretty much the best SOUND STAGE you can get at this priceNow before you get too excited... Let me throw to you some of its defects in sound like a saucy villian MUAHAHAHA.... FIRST is that of its loose fit....yea it fits nicely but after 8 to 10 months these becomes kinda loose... So the volume decreases... Doesnt effect the SOUND QUALITY though....Second is bad... But not for all...it is that it has a LOW VOLUME.... If you want to listen to high volume music.... This headphones doesnt go that far... You may be able to increase it through some apps...but it is not that high from default....Third is the NOISE-CANCELLATION.... These have almost no noise cancellation... So if you are in a loud environment... You may hear the music but only with the rumbles of the real world....(For me it is not a disadvantage as i hate noise cancellation but for many it is so I added)The FOURTH is the REAL DEPTH in sound.... Although the sound is organic... But the depth in the sound is really low.... In ears have a greater depth compared to headphones...IN CONCLUSION.... If your budget is under 700...definately get this one for comfort and relaxation... If you are a ADRENALIN JUNKIE... get an in-ear...those go up monstrous in volumes and bass...Also i think i dont need to write about DURABILTY....its been freaking 4 years and i havent had a single issue of time with this thing....Thats all for now folks...THNX FOR READING....and damn you are a heavy reader.... I owe you one"
5,This may not match the more expensive audiophile grade headphones in terms of sound quality but for the price paid it compares very favorably. The bass is good but not overpowering like in so many headphones of this class. The sound is well balanced though it suffers a wee bit on the extreme highs. Overall a good pair of headphones for daily use with laptops and mobile phones.
5,The material quality is Good enoughSound is the main parr of this headsetDurability is far better then otherGreat go for itI get it at only 499 rsDuring festive offer
3,Writing this review after using this heaphone for almost one and half year.Sound quality is not that good. It is low as compare to other brands.Bulit quality is also not very well.As this is cheapest headphone available in market dont expect too much from it.Plus the warranty is for only one year.It means after one year if headphone havunv any damage will not get repair as it is nin repairable prouct only replacement is avaible in warranty.I will suggest this if you want to buy headphone under 600-700₹ range go for it or else go for jbl.
2,"They are decent but are very fragile . Also the fact that it has cable on both sides kind of very much annoys. Also in this range only there are many other good options which have less reviews and popularity. I also say and read all those good reviews and was mistaken with buying them. Also even now after 2 months of use the aux cable always muffules up all the sounds. Also the fact that they do not offer mic is very annoying too. They are really bad for calls and pubg gameplays . Also they have low sound levels as compared to other headphones and a base which is next to none. Also not comfortable for long time. Noise cancellation is just very very little. Also do forget about warrenty because they will not replace it and they are inrepairable. Also for warrenty you would have to pay heavy shipping charges. So , if it stops working just go get a new one. Overall not worth to buy on the name to tag "" sony """
4,"Writing this review after 8 months .The only precautions needed to me was to remove the sweat around my ears before listening , because it damages the black cover . Good sound,  not to much heavy bass. Perfect for normal music lovers. cushion covers give the feeling of noise cancellation upto 50%."
4,SONY headphones with a tough cable and pin. The ear pads can be folded which makes it compact and convenient to carry. These headphones do not possess a mute control and volume control. Reasonably good sound output.The headphones stopped working  within one year from the date of the invoice. Contacted the Sony India Customer Care after getting the contact number from Amazon Customer Care. Excellent service from Sony India Customer Care. They provided the address and telephone number of the nearest Sony Authorized Service Centre.  Produced  the defective headphones at the Sony Service Centre together with a copy of the Amazon Invoice. The headphones were replaced  FREE under warranty with a brand new headphone. Please note: Warranty is valid for ONE YEAR FROM DATE OF INVOICE.Thank you Sony for the exemplary customer service.
5,"Very good sound quality. Actually better than a few higher priced headphones. The sounds are clear and well differentiated, clear vocals."
5,"This is my first on ear headphone, after first day use I can say that it's the best headphone in this price range . I bought it for ₹570/- . Sound quality is excellent and bass is really good. I'm a huge music lover, I have listened to Sony and Boat ...but If you want to feel the music, if you want to get the rythm of the song, if you want to get the original quality of the song when it was recorded...then Go for this Sony product. Boat basshead 900 has more bass but the sound is coarse , you can't feel it,voice is not that soothing. But this Sony headphone makes allows to hear every bit of sound very clear at this price range. It would be better1.if black option were there2. band was of metal 3.more cusion were there. One thing more, it has gold coated jack that is also a big plus point for Sony.Sound 5/5Bass 4.5/5Overall quality 4.5/5"
1,"The headphones dont live upto the Sony name. The Bass is so low that you cannot enjoy a good EDM. The sound is so low that you cannot hear anything in a crowd. The headphones feel plasticy and dont even feel durable. I thought that Sony would be a good brand to invest money into, but, it would have been better to buy a BoAT or something similar."
2,"I purchased this headphone on January. First few months, it was all smooth, amazing sound quality. But after 3-4 months, one side stopped working. I managed with one side. But today the other side also stopped working. Duhh!!! It's not been even a year. This is not expected from a brand as SONY. I used to recommend this product to my friends. Now i won't ever buy or recommend SONY products."
4,"The over all quality of the product is 4 star as compared to its priceVery comfortable ,long lasting using it since 1 year and again odered the same,the bass quality is good but sometimes the speaker dosen,t work so.etimes when i listen music one of the speaker stops working and then i change the song and it starts working it has been happened 2 times when i odered new one,s"
4,"Not for listening to music. I bought it to watch documentaries. It has a high treble and low bass. Great for voice and not thump thump of music. Box say 1350/-. Got it for 645/-. Looks genuine Sony with a warranty card as well. Been using it for a month now, and no problems.  Fits comfortably on the ears. Keeps out environment noise (not completely, just enough). I bought it to watch study videos. Worked for me."
3,Okay product. Sound quality is not great so I would've preferred some other product. But it's okay @₹500.
3,"This is sony's only entry-level low budget overhead phone.Look wise it may give you appeal that it CAN produce the best sound for the buck, but sadly, it's not!The 30mm drivers sony claims is not producing sound as one would expect by its looks.here's what the sound quality is; (Scale : Good, Moderate and Weak)1. High Range - Good.2. Mid Range -  Good.3. Low Range - Weak.Even though, in specs the freq response is 12-20000 Hz, the low range is very weak. So, the bass feels very flat.4. Surround (Phase distinction) - Moderate.So, you  cannot feel much depth in audio. The music appears playing closer to your ear drum rather actually reproducing studio quality. Also, left/right channels feels having crossover.5. Definition - Good.Thus, you can decode the tracks/instruments in the songs, this is because of the good mid & high frequency response.6. Sound Isolation - Moderate.Ideal to listen in calm and mildly noisy environments like parks, restaurants, work & home. Cant completely isolate cab/bus noises.7. sound production & detailing- Apparently, i feel there is also mix in freq ranges between high, mid and low. OOps! that's not good. Not from you sony!IF YOU CAN SHELL OUT EXTRA BUCKS, THEN LOOK FOR OTHER SONY OVERHEAD MODELS OR SEEK FOR OTHER BRANDS IN THIS PRICE RANGE.AUDIOPHILES STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE."
1,"I made a big mistake after bought it. Because Amazon's price & explanation about this item is very attractive. And if a person read this, he surely purchase it and ordered it. Then waiting for arrival of product by feeling of smartness.After purchased it I fully disappointed and astonished. It feel like a salesman (who sell his items in train or bus stop). Please don't purchase it. It's sound quality is like only an local earphone.And this is non-returnable."
5,"Very good product & quality is also outstanding of the headphone materialin this price range.product is very good.Light weight,sound is awesome.You can use it very long time because of light weight.Cousin is not hard it is very soft like cotton.I like this product very much.my ear feels soft touch."
5,Sony MDR-ZX110Bass 👌👌👌
1,"on every 11 months the left side ear piece goes off no sound , once exchange befor a year of purchase again on the completion of eleven months the same problem repeats with the new one replaced on warranty. so bad product"
1,"I ordered the product on 5th Sep. Delivered on 16th Sep. Now by 20th Oct the product stop working. Just one month the product was live. It looks like not the original product they gave me.When we received the product it was not in a company blister package, was just wrapped in a bubble sheet inside the amazon carton. My son unpacked it and he did not mention it at that time. Otherwise then n then I should have returned the item. It was a defective item or something else they had delivered. Appario Retail is a renowned retail in Amazon Store. Not expected such service from them.Now the headphone stopped working. This headphone I ordered for my son's online school use. Now he is not able to use this. If Appario Customer service is reading this, please contact me, and please replace the item."
1,"Actually I was looking for my daughter. I found it to be a good one. However, the left ear sound was different than the right one. Tried playing different music from different units. The output was not that satisfactory. Similar type of headphone brought 6 months before of JBL with same budget. Compared both JBL is good with the same budget.  However, after return similar product was delivered on the next day. Thanks."
1,"The product is very good but I have been using it for two months and after 2 months it has broken itself, its body cheap is of quality."
4,"I've been using these headphones for a year now and is in excellent condition. Well, it was, until two days ago when my cat decided to be curious about it.the best feature  - comfort. I've not been able to find another brand of headphones that are so comfortable to wear for long stretches of time.like:- comfort- sturdy (it's seen some rough days with my travelling and generally careless handling.- not very expensive- decent amount of noise cancellationdislike:- sound quality - the quality is decent, but considering that sound quality is one of the primary purposes of headphones, one'd have expected it to be better. But it's still on par the with Boat and JBL products in this price range. If you are the type that relishes music, I'd suggest you look elsewhere- mic: by far the biggest disadvantage.  i listen to music on my phone, so I'd really have liked to have a mic so that i don't have to change headphones everytime i get a call."
3,The headphones worked fine for a short while but then there was a problem with the jack. The same thing happened to the headphones of another friend of mine who had a similar pair.
1,"Of about fifty products that I have so far bought from Amazon over the last three years, this is the only item that I did not use for more than 2 weeks. This headphone is fake and did not work. I had to trash it. I lost my money."
4,Headphones quality is awesome so does the build. Wire build is also good. I would rate 3 out of 5 for noise cancellation and 2.5 out of 5 for max volume. Another thing is you have to be careful while opening and folding it. The part which does the job is delegate and has to be handle with care. I was expecting a good volume with bass. Bass depends on the music device.
5,"Sound Quality is okay but i think sound is too low as i compared a chinese headphone which made me surprised,that sounds too good here on this all driver calibration is good and have a medium bass but you'll not get that expectations. The price is Slightly very low so we can not expect anything more.All I Dont like in it is its Uncomfortability the cusion is too low to get a better grip and comfortable fit.allthough you can go with any other brands and can buy something else like boat headphones which is good in bass and also better than this invest some more and get some more.Sony Audio Is a very good and excellent company but only if you invest some more on it.And Now it is upto you.Thankyou."
2,"Beautiful product. Foldable, which makes it easier for storage and carrying, compatible with all devices with an audio jack... Good dustproof material and awesome quality with plastic. The wire is a problem due to tangling with other cables. It is fine with itself and has minimal tangling. Affordable and has a decent sound quality which is amazing for the price you pay for the product. For a budget below Rupees 1000 this is a smart choice. Product is durable, but with using the plastic arc will bend wider to give a better fit, now is this a defect or a special mechanism is a tough decision because mine has bent wider which is causes the headphones to slip-off my head which is giving me a tough time. The product is really nice but not for use if you’re aiming to use it more than a year."
2,"Using it for more than a year now. This earphone is working fine but still I had to order a new earphone today (another company) as I got tired of extremely low level of volume output.. Sound quality and performance is great, but even if you keep volume to maximum (both for device and streaming platform), the output is terrible.. I use it for prime, hotstar, laptop movies etc. and faces the same issue most of the time..  and yes I dont have any hearing problem, I am using another earphone too which has way better output..  If you want to use it for watching movies or for songs, please buy something else, otherwise it will just spoil your music experience.."
1,They are among the worst headphones 🎧 under ₹1000. I got them for ₹900 in the month of April 2020 and now in July end 2020 they have started to work very badly. There is a problem in the aux cable. There has been no physical damage. Also due to corona virus spread in india they cannot be fixxed rn. Simply waste of money
5,"Below ratings are for the quality we get considering a price.Build  -  Good (better than expected) 4/5Sound  - Better than I thought considering the price. 5/5Bass - I'm not a bass lover but it's really good. 5/5Volume levels are more than enough for me for both Mobile and Laptop. Pressure on your ears depends on your head size also, I feel little pain only for few minutes after long usage but that's not an issue for me. For less use like 1 or 2 hours, there won't be any pain. Still it differes from person to person.So, overall the product was better than I expected and I'm really happy with it."
5,"A Earphone came free with this as already shown in above pics. Its just amazing, loved it. Battery backup is 6-7 hours continously, if you use music at high notes and more then 8 hours, if you listen music on normal notes continuosly. Voice is also amazing. Buttons were superb. Noise cancellation is good. Magnetic feature. USB Cable free inside. Vibration mode available. Charging time is very less. Calling feature."
4,"Good  product, good quality"
4,Very good
5,Good product
5,Must buy.. very reasonable and good quality.. value for money 💰
4,Good and rich looks... Loved it..
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT
4,Sound
5,"Best head phone in budget. Seller is of v. Much cooperative. As he changed the defective. Thanks amazon, seller,as well as supply chain."
1,Heavy
5,"The headphones end in two cables, one usb and one 3.5mm audio jack. The Audio jack of course is for the audio, and the usb cable is for the LED lights. You can use the headphones without the usb, in that case the LED lights will not work. So, perfect for phones. The cable is high quality and durable, and it's also braided. There is significant foam padding, which makes it much more comfortable. There is one volume controller and one microphone on/off switch. Both work well. It has an extendable mic, and the sound quality is amazing. Totally recommend for gaming, you can easily hear footsteps/gunshots in games like PUBG, Call Of Duty, etc. As a call of duty player myself, I really love these headphones. They are really comfortable and I wear them for hours everyday. Though I wouldn't recommend these for listening to music. The LED lights will also drain your laptop's battery. These are amazing for gaming/meetings/online classes. Pictures are attached for your reference 😊😄."
5,Headphones can isolate your ambience very well!Microphone quality is up yo mark.Sound quality is very good.Will update after one week of usage.
5,very helpful product voice quality is good there are seven colours blinking we can reduce and increase the volume of head phones and the mic is also very good and the packing was also good.
1,"i am totally dissatisfied with the item for reasons ,1. From the beginning the microphone was not working. 2. Very uncomfortable to wear it as it will pain your ears after some time.3. Sound quality is average.4. the USB provided is very tight , as you press it may damage the socket.Regret for choosing this item."
5,A great product for its price range I have bought this for WFH and is doing  pretty much good job.Will give more updates after some weeks 👍
4,When the headphones arrived at my house the amazon box is in good condition but the inner box of headphones was not good but the good thing was that the headphones was not damaged....So this is the review after 5 days of delivery and headphones is so good you can clearly hear the footsteps and gunshots in pubg mobile and i also play pubg pc and the footsteps is so clear in that game also . The headphones also has noice cancelling but not too much noice cancelling the mic is also clear that your friends can hear you clearly....The rgb is not controlled by us the patterns are good and rgb looks so cool . The bass is decent and also the gaming headphones does not require any bassMy opinion to buy this because this is worth of money . Thanks amazon and cosmic byte 🙂🙂
3,"Product is good but i don't like delivery  system bacause when it delivered me headphone box is open from bottom , so I request to Amazon pls fix your delivery system anyways product is very very good  bass , trouble , RGB lights  is good but sound is low . But I observed why sound is low because of your ears to do not damage your ears because when you buy a over head headphone so it chance to damage your ears so I respect the developers of cosmic byte"
1,"The build quality and LEDs are nice. Sound quality for games is good, not good for music. It has USB and 3.5mm jack. But USB is ONLY for LED lights. Cannot listen to audio via USB. You have to plug in the 3.5mm jack to listen to audio. Worst is, this is not even returnable, only replaceable"
4,Headphones is plastic build and is a budget gaming headphone. The base quality and sound quality is not that good but just okay. Also you cannot use mic and headphones at the same time you will need to buy a splitter with which u can use both headphones and mic. To boost your sound I'm using external software (Boom 3D) which is very good and the mic sound quality is also crystal clear.Budget wise its good but it should have given a splitter to use mic and headphones at the same time.
5,"It is an excellent product for a price as low as ₹1100! The over the ear headphones are very good and have the quality of 360 degree sound. There is a button for the mic to switch it on or off, which is very helpful in case of gaming. There is also a volume button and the braided cable is very protective. Even after long hours of gaming (6-7 hours), I couldn’t even feel a single bit of pain in my ears and the headphones have a variety of 7 RGB lights on either side of it. I highly recommend this product as per my experience for those who have long hours of gaming and are looking for a gaming headphone under the price of ₹1500. I have had the experience of playing games like PUBG, Rainbow Six Seige, etc. on the PS4 console. You can easily make out where the footsteps/noise is coming from, which is very helpful in games like these. Plus, the cable is very long which is helpful if your gamestation is a bit distant from your comfort place. So, I highly recommend this product!"
5,"First Let's talk about Build QualityIt's made of plastic but it does not feel cheap.It feels premium. Build Quality is Amazing.It's very comfortable. Overall cushioning is very good.You can wear them for hours and it will not be going to pain your ears.It comes with a Single 3.5 mm audio jack.So you can easily connect it with your Phone, PC or any device that has a 3.5 mm jack.Let's Talk about the main thing - Sound QualityWhile watching Videos or Listening SongsThe sound quality is Excellent.The bass is very good, Vocals are clearly audibleIn full volume, Its sound is very loudNoise Cancellation is also very good, If you listen to songs in full volumeYou will hear nothing that is happening outside.Like Talking of People, Vehicle sounds, etc.)I have tried a few games with it like PUBG, Call of Duty, Rocket League.I can easily spot the location of the enemy.Bullet fire sound was coming with full bass.My experience was Superb.Mic Quality is also good.It will not be coming with noise cancellation.So it will capture background sounds (fan sound, breathing sound, etc.)You also get RGB light in them at both the side.Just plug the USB cable in the port and you are done.The main thing is you can not control light manually.It will change automatically and after few minuteslight of both sides gets unsynced.This is not a problem but I thought I should tell you this too.Cable Quality is also very goodIt's like a tangle-free wire.There is a small problem with it:The USB cable and 3.5 mm audio cable is very close to each other.So if you are using a device in which the USB port and 3.5 mm audio port are a little far away from each other then you will able to connect only one port at atime in that device. (or by using  wire extension buying it separately)Let's talk about final conclusion.If you are having a tight budget and you are looking for a gaming headphone with RGB lightthen you can purchase them blindly."
1,Recived a tore box pasted with cello tape then i try to search invoice of the product but there was no invoice in the box. I opened the box and checked whether the headphones are properly working or not. Left side no sound and low sound quality. Feeling cheated . Don't buy this product there are many other good options. Worst seller ever. Finally returning the product
5,I previously ordered the GS410 Gaming Headset but this has a got a little better sound quality than GS410 and has got balanced sound and bass quality and the build is also great and mic quality is just awesomeIt was also delivered well before the estimated delivery time and the packaging was also done goodAnd the lights are like icing on the cakeOverall its a very good headphone for nearly every purposeLoved it ❤️❤️ just go for it 😊😊
5,"I have received this product yesterday.I was scared by the reviews but when it was delivered, the packing was very good.I have used this for few hours and found it a very nice product. Sound quality, comfort, quality, etc everything is good.Value for money."
2,"I had purchased this product after trying to find the availability of good headphone with this kind of mic for connecting to the meeting/calls, as i was facing some issue with my normal headphones that has mic built on wire.the headphone quality is not good, the plastic may break if not maintained properly.first of all it is not gaming headphone because you cannot wear it for more than 15-20 mins. , your ears will start paining even thought they are over the ear headphones, the reason for that is there is not soft cushion kind of thing over the internal plastic, they have just covered it with thin cloth.secondly i noticed that option to mute the mic does not work on the Teams application, even thought you mute it on the headphone you still need to explicitly mute it on the application otherwise people will still be able to hear you.only for the camouflage design and lighting i am giving it 2 star."
5,"i liked the way it delivers the audio,everything is so balanced.the bass, the noise cancellation, etc.i ordered gs420 earlier but that was a little heavy and didnt fit into my ear,  but this GS430 has high level comfort as compared to gs 420,  i feel no pain in this gs430,i can even play pubg for constant 3-4 hours ..tysm amazon and cosmic byte 😻"
3,"I know how difficult is to choose a product nowadays is. The Cosmicbyte Headphone is good enough to handle your daily work like Online classes, Zoom meetings & some gaming. Don't have big expectations from it. Sound is mild & just average. It's not the loudest you can get.  It's just ok ok. If you're getting it under or around 1K only then go for it."
3,It's good gaming headset for the price(850) I purchased it not for the RGB but for the foldable mic. The package was in extremely poor condition and the headset was just wrapped in bubble wrap in the box. I returned it the first time as I thought it was tampered but the second one came in the same condition but unopened so I took it. Redgear and ant headsets are available at the same price but I didn't want seperate connector for headset and mic as I use a gaming laptop. Buy it if you are looking for a headset under 1000 rupees which looks cool and has a decent mic. But beware of the packaging as it is very bad and has the risk of getting the product damaged or tampered.
3,Initially excited as the cushion of the headphone is very soft like a teddy bear but the sound quality is disappointing. crisp is missing and bass as well. good for kids online classes and games but not for movies and songs
3,"This is the packing of the item. No seals either. If Amazon wants to give Refurbished products to Customers then please mention it. Dont sell used items tagged as new. Quite disappointed.About Product:Works fine.Get a Equalizer if you want to use it anything else other than gaming.Cables are braided, quite happy with that.RGB Works too.Edit on 7 June 2021:Still working fine, although product looked refurbished it didnt malfunction anytime. No issues at all."
5,Very nice and value added  product. Pricuct was as per description specifications it also has led light which glow once connected to any USB device. I am happy with the product and also with the delivery time.
4,All the things are awesome but there is just one thing that is not good. It's the noise cancelling of the mic. If you want a budget gaming headset then definitely go for this one
5,"This is an amazing headset.Rgb- the lighting is nice a subtle and not too flashy,it's just the right amount,it is not controlable,it cycles and blends in 7 colorsBulid-it is a very sturdy bulid and good construction it also has a very cool mic construction tooSound- it has amazing sound and no distortion on full volume and the bass is amazing,the full headset starts moving so that is an amazing plus for meCompatibility- I have used this on xbox,pc, android and iOS and all devices did very well with no issues"
4,"Great Deal at this Price.Review After 5 Days of Delivery;I usually use it for online meetings & games( haven't tried FPP ), voice quality is excellent & Music( not for bass lovers, but we always have equilizer, which gives decent bass ).Build quality is superb especially the wire.The 7 RGB COLOUR s are great.I use it almost whole day , it's so Comfortable around the 👂.That's it go for it guys."
4,The product is just as mentioned. Have to say that I am really pleased with the quality of the packaging and the box that it came in. The cable seems very robust and not easily prone to wear and tear like other headphones. It is extremely long and would be very good if you just wanna sit back and watch a movie form a distance from your PC. Its got Good Bass!! but i do have to say that it does not the 7.1 surround sound. Apart from that everything is really good.
5,"Best Headphone at this price forget about Sony, jbl this one is mind blowing. The wire quality is awesome also sound is good but if you are a MUSIC LOVER then go for other. THIS IS SPECIALLY FOR GAMER AND MEETINGS."
5,I play cs go 90% of the time and sounds too goodPros : cable is braidedRgb is minimalToo good for Gaming can hear the footsteps and everythingSufficient wireMic gives good feedbackHas an on/off switchHas volume controlCons:Padding slightly cheap material usedQuality can be better 3/5Flat sound no bassOverall 3.8/5Very good value for under 1k
3,I bought this product after reading a lot of reviews. Basically my requirement was to get a headphone with a mic for daily long audio based meetings. Even though it met my requirements the right earphone isn't working after 3 months of usage.Pros:1.Mic is pretty good2.External noise is cut down well. I am often in meetings while there is welding or external noise nearby but participants don't feel any disturbance.3. Mute and volume switches are very helpful.4. A pretty long cordCons1. Right ear phone not working in 3 monthsNeutral - Not much use for the color lights other than showing kids
4,"I think this is one of the best over the ear headphone of this price range. I got it for 899 rupees and i don't feel any deep regret for choosing this product.First of all , i shall not recommend this for listening music. Because i think this headphone couldn't provide that sweet deep bass. But the pitch is good and vocals are clear.This headphone is mainly for gaming...😅😅as it's name refers. You can easily spot enemies in games like PUBG.The quality of this product is also not bad. This headphone is not so rigid because it is flexible but the material used is high grade plastic.I think you don't feel premium when holding this headphone, but when you wear this someone else looking at you will feel  ' this is classic...'🌈.Also Amazon delivery and packing is next level..🔥I'm satisfied with this product...😍❤️"
2,"I used this headphone for about 30mins and the weight of this headphone caused a lot of discomfort to my ears.If comfort is your first priority, i'd suggest you skip this and try something else.As for the audio quality. It is not that good but at this price, i suppose it is manageable"
4,"I bought this headphone after a recommendation from a friend who also plays COD Mobile.This headphone produces outstanding results for its price tag. Audio quality is very good and you will not have any issues while using it with a game like PUBG Mobile or COD Mobile. (Device: Redmi Note 8 Pro)However, in terms of comfort, it is not the best and your ears will start to pain a little after using it for a couple of hours straight.Overall, I recommend buying this product. You can go for it."
1,Received the headphone in fully damaged packaging condition.
2,I bought them mainly for footsteps and used them for about 10 hours daily for a week.You can hear footsteps but not very precisely and can't be too sure about enemy location.There is almost no latency and microphone is quite decent.Wearing them continuously for hours is little uncomfortable and it's quite sweaty around in hot.Average music quality.Don't recommended these
5,"Amazing looking with good quality ear cushion and sound . At starting 3-4 days you will feel like headache sensation , but u will get used to it don't worry . If u didn't get used to it then I advise you to return it caz few pple wouldn't like it. That also means u wouldn't be able to use many other headphones with noise cancellation or sound suspending headphones.  No sound escapes outside no matter how loud it is inside . Led lights on ur ear won't work if ur using phone , only works when ur using USB plug to connect to pc or xbox or PS4,5 . It's not really delicate and not foldable , so I wouldn't recommend it for outside purposes . Good luck 🤞"
5,"These are just superb. I've been using the cosmicbyte gs410 for 1.5 yrs now and thought of buying these when they were up for sale and trust me they are worth every penny.The sound is excellent you hear the enemy footsteps very clearly and you can easily guess where the enemy is coming from. I used these in games like valorant, cs:go and call of duty and these work effortlesslyThe led's are also really goodThe mic quality is decent it captures low frequency sounds well and cuts off the background noise to 80% but still you can hear some background noisesThe packaging was also very good.Overall a very good product for 850rs would recommend every budget gamer to go for these.Thank you amazon!"
1,Sound wise is okay I’ve had headphones in the same price range with better sound quality... the first time I got the product the LED lights were not working and asked for a replacement.. the second time I got the set the LED lights still weren’t working even though I mentioned while placing the replacement order that they were not working... I feel like it’s a misconduct on the part of the seller And was quite disappointed overallEdit: two weeks after use the right side isn’t working anymore. Don’t buy it.
5,"These headphones are the best I have ever bought till now. Impressive weightlessness despite looking big in hands. Good for everything (music, gaming, calling, etc). Pretty strong wire. Good bass. Overall everything was perfect as I wished it should be in under Rs. 1500 Mostly headphones with less prices are not considered good but this one's an exception. Too perfect. I just love it."
1,Reviewing after few months of use.. the headphone is good. But you have to buy a 'spliter or two-in-one line' seperately to get this thing working. And they dont even give a spliter with the headphone. Very disappointed.. and for using spliter maybe there are some up and downs in your voice when you are using the mic..
1,Not working properly.. Within one month it's not working.. I just wasted my money
3,"problem while playing PUBG :-when turning on ingame Mic audio decreases to 20% and suppressed surrounding voices and have to turn ingame mic off to let it work properly ..Build quality is very good ,mic also very descent and RBG also superb . I face problem in Ios . my friend baught gs410 but he is also same problem in Android . We both got refund ..But only problem is with pubg .IDK is this a pubg problem or headphone  ..IF U R LOOKING RHIS ONLY FOR MUSIC AND ONLE CLASSES✔️ .. Headphone is good but nor for PUBG 🔴🔴🔴"
1,"No good product, no good sound, and no good bass. Total vest money"
4,Good Product as both wired & wireless provision.
1,Fake product delivered with package already open on delivery. Speaker on one side of the headset stopped working after 10mins of use. Terribly disappointed with Amazon. Think twice before ordering electronics from Amazon.
3,Sound quality is amazing. However it becomes painful within minutes of using the headphones
5,"I have been using these headphones for over a month and, to be honest, I am really happy with headphones. It sounds really nice and plus the fit is excellent for my ears. I highly recommend buying these."
1,3.5 jack stops working after three days
5,More relevant for the kid to attend her online classes
5,Its worthy for this price and best quality sound i have ever heard
3,The sound quality is not very good as it should have been.
4,I gifted it for my husband.. pretty good sound .. but noise cancellation is ok ok I can still hear my baby crying with full volume ..
3,Pros:-Sound quality is awesome.-Comfortable on head- easy to controlCons:- Conectivity issues many times.- Lack of basic features like auto-connect etc.
5,"Design: a retro look, good touch and feel available in 3 colours all of which will feel premium and sturdy. Its quite flexible as well.Accessories: a usb charging cable, 3.5mm cable both very good quality same colour as the headphones. No carry bag though.Battery life: so right out of the box i charged it up for about 2 or so hours straight and it has lasted me for about 28 hours at 80% volume. My personal opinion is that the battery life is superb.Comfort: it is an on ear headphone so for some it may not be that comfortable. Having said that, my dad (hardly uses any listening device) was able to use it for 1 hour straight on a call without discomfort so That should not be a hinderance unless on ear phones are not your type. Me personally, i have used both over and on ear and this one is comfortable to wear. The clamping force is just about perfect for me.Noise cancelling: well firstly its not over the ear so passively speaking it does not cut out as much as an over the ear would. But once put on and listening, i frankly did not hear sounds outside of the music, even while sitting with family and they watched tv. But if active noise cancelling is one of your main criteria then no, it does not have ANC.Sound quality: right, so this is what I believe the main aspect of any headphones. If you are a basshead don’t go for it. Its not like you will be disappointed but you’d rather not go for it bcz there are so many other options with emphasis on bass. I felt that these are well balanced, with decently recognizable and fun basslines and good clear mids and highs. The sound feels bright and clear. If you are into rock n roll, metal, and genres of that type it should be a satisfying buy. I guess it fits best for casual listeners and audiophiles alike.Is it worth the price? Yes.Considering all the aspects absolutely. Again my emphasis on sound quality, its clean, bright, guitars sound great be it clean or distortion. Percussions are tight as well. Just not the super thump bass generally expected out of headphones, that’s all.Slightly more refined and better than marshall major II.So to sum it up, in a price range of under 10k this is a good choice, great choice even, if you have a specific taste in music genres like i mentioned above.Aside, do check your headphones for being original. There are videos on YouTube for the same."
3,"SOUND: if you hear at 80% volume it's very good, clear mids and High. But if you raise the volume to 100% it just kill the overall experience.BUILD : BEST IN CLASS that I can say weight overall build etc. Only issue you'll face is with the plastic hingeBattery: As advertised 30+ which is the best buying point for me.Comfort: if you are not used to on ear headphone, please don't buy this, it was the only one reason for me to return the product. Because if you can't enjoy the product there is no use to it. Couldnt listen for more than 30 mins and 2 hrs over a Day.I'm better off with on ear headphones.BTW I got this for 5400 in Amazon sale😍😍 but really unhappy for returning such a great product.Wish they could stay with me 😢😢"
1,"Received the box open with tapes unsticky.Opened the box and tried the headphone. Sound was great, it was really great in music.Then tried calling, sound in calling is very less and I had to talk louder.Then I dismantle the ear ad to scan the code and I found a different number in the code than the one given on the box.Adding some photos for the reference.Review the original website before making any purchases."
4,"If you are a bass head ,this is not the headphone for you.If you need to experience crystal clear mids and highs and like to hear  instrumentals go for it.Pros1.Awesome sound clarity.2.Supports Aptx connectivity.3.Awesome battery life 30 hours4.Great build quality. Its very easy to replace the ear cushion and also the aux cable with mic.Cons1.Bass is comparatively lox,but its decent.If that bothers you, go for sennheiser 4.40BT2.Clamping of headphone is a little bit on the tighter side.Hope that this will reduce eventually on regular use.3.Lot of fake marshall products are out there in the market.Beware !!  Two simple methods to check the genuiness of your headphone  1.Remove the right earcushion of your  headphone and scan the qr code.It should  match with the code given at the bottom of  your headphone box.  2.Connect your headphone to a device which  supports aptx connectivity and check whether  the Bluetooth audio codec has changed to  Aptx automatically."
5,"Unless the product is really good or really bad I don't write reviews. These headphones are so good I couldn't resist writing a review. I have used them for almost 2 months now and got them in sale for 5400 post bank discounts, so yes I got them really cheap.Sound quality is really awesome. Remember you need to give a good input else no headphone will sound good. But even if you listen to YT music it should be fine although it's not the best input and if you really want to get best output you should listen to lossless music or something remastered as it makes a lot of difference. Treble can get really sharp at some places, so use equaliser to fix it as per your preference. I like treble and I use stock phone equalizer. Bass is just right for me and this is how it is suppose to be, unless you listen to a lot of house music where you need the thumping feel.Look and build quality: Very premium retro look and sturdy build quality. Couldn't get better. It's height can be adjusted for better fit. As most have mentioned in their reviews it can get a little uncomfortable after prolonged use. Initially your ears might hurt and also feel warm and it will take time before the headphone loosen up a bit and you start feeling comfortable.Battery life is good too. Doesn't take long to recharge and lasts really long. I charge once a week and usually usage could be anywhere between 10 to 20 hours per week.At a price point of around 8k I don't think you can ask for more.Please note if you are not used to On-Ear headphone you may not feel good about the whole experience. You have to get used to it first and then judge the headphone. Else buy in-ears orTWS but then those won't have the same out especially considering the price as you simply can't cramp the hardware in a small space without making the thing expensive. For eg. the driver, this one has a 40mm."
4,"A great product with excellent battery life,it just goes on forever. Excellent controls and the sound is clear , sparkly with good tight low end. Overall great fun. The sound has attack , a slight forward nature with speed. Not for people looking for rich dark dense sound. Stereo imaging is good and space between instruments is good too when not pushed hard. This observation is for Bluetooth only. Great for Rock , Hip Hop and fast paced music. Recommended."
1,"If you have never ever used a headphone before in your life, DO NOT BUY THIS.First of all if you have a kind of huge head, this headphone is going to be a pain. You CANNOT sit with it for more than 3 mins (or I would say more than 1 song). I don't know about small head people though.Coming to the build quality, it is the best. This looks soo plush it should be kept in the showcase or something.Sound quality was such a major let down to me. Since I never used a headphone before (used to always use in-ear earphones Sennheiser ones), thought that a headphone would provide me with superior sound. NOPE. IT DID NOT. My friends swore that the sound quality was very good on this one and since it being MARSHALL, how could they go wrong? Well they went wrong duh. Also I am a rock/metal/alternative rock/pop/punk person. Basically i listen to literally EVERYTHING. From Blink 182 to Iron Maiden to Taylor Swift lol and this headphone sucked in every one of the songs.Coming to the battery life, dude idk if marshal put a car battery or something in there but this headphone didn't die at all! I failed to drain out the battery even after a week of usage without the heaphones on my head :pVerdict : don't go for these please. I managed to get a refund. Save your money.Buy some PIDILITE/ITC/HDFC shares instead of this."
5,"Convenience - Battery Life is refreshingly long and enduring, Single button Control is the highlight & my favourite feature. Small form factor after folding makes it an Ideal travel companion.Sound Quality & Connectivity- No Complaints, Bass Lovers would ask for more but for me that would be an overkill. Bluetooth Connectivity Is hassle-free & the wire option is extremely useful.Aesthetics & Fit - Leather vinyl & squarish ear cups give it a retro Style vibe. Brass accents are a matter of taste.. Fits is surprisingly comfortable, however continuous usage beyond 2 hrs will hurt the ears. I often use it for watching movies connecting it via Bluetooth to TV and it’s extremely immersive .Elegant  but a Delicate DarlingOnly for home and travel use, not for workouts or rough use. So, people who like taking care of there possessions would cherish this product."
1,"The sound quality is really poor. I’ve had cheaper Sony earphones which sounded much better. It is not meant to be noise cancelling but that’s okay. For a pair of earphones which I paid almost 8000 bucks for, it’s really crappy. To top it all, the packaging looked like it had been picked up from the back of dirty warehouse."
5,"Wow. This is so amazing. My 1st purchase of an item from Marshall and its the best out of all the headphones I have used.1. Audio -I bought it mainly for Audio and it has delivered. Audio is so pure and clear even at full volume.Every call, song, video on this headphones sounds so proper.2. Battery -2 weeks since I have bought it. Daily usage of 4 hours and I have charged it only once.3. Comfort -Initially people would find it difficult to adjust but it gets comfortable in a week. That’s what I faced.Overall - Awesome brand. Awesome headphones. Definite buy!"
5,Initial impressions:Its an original product verified bar code also verified bluetooth codec support for aptx.Sound quality is great though i am not a audiophile but for me its more than just ok.Grabbed the deal at INR 5406 including cash back.Tried calling via ios and android  it worked flawless.Yet to test it on pc and mac.Battery seems to be ok its just 1-2% drop after 40 minutes of play.Grip is good tried during running it was intact on ears though i won't recommend it for workouts.Better than in ear coz it will reduce chances of ear damage but listen at low volumes after all health is important.Noise cancellation is average please avoid in case you are considering noise cancellation.Not for heavy usage I may be wrong here but I am not a heavy user and max I can wear any headphone or earphone is just half an hour or 45 minutes
5,"I picked this after a long research and it was a great choice. Product came sealed and you can also verify the genuineness with bar code on box and bar code scanning inside right headphones. The sound quality is really good. I have Bose home system and B&W in my car. The quality of sound is comparable with different music types. It’s really classy looking and feels good on ears. Although I found bass on heavier side but at no point you feel it’s too much. Jazz and instrumentals are great. Pls don’t buy this if you want to use during exercises and running. It’s not cut for sweat, rough use. Phone calls are crystal clear and there is no issue other person to hear you. Great for conf calls. Although it connects with only 1 device at a time. Can be connected with amps. It also has a feature to plug another user through wire if you want to share music with someone sitting close. Battery times is amazing personally I tested about 28-30 hours. Pls pick this if you listen to music heavily or on conf calls for long. This is a brilliant buy!"
5,"Was looking for a good pair of headphones for official calls, so the key criteria was good voice quality and long battery life. These headphones have exceeded my expectations. Call quality is amazing at both ends. Battery easily lasts a week with at least 8 hours of use everyday.Now to music, these headphones deliver! The music is crisp and clear, not overly bass boosted, just the right amount. Very enjoyable and these actually have a soundstage!Best part is that one knob that controls everything, no need to fiddle on the earcups trying to find the button.3.5 mm port for wired usage is an added advantage.Highly recommend."
1,It's a duplicate product.. I don't know how an assured seller like appario can give a duplicate order.. Asked for a replacement.. Hope this time I will get an original product
4,"The product is awesome, looks good, sound quality is better than other players. The only thing that hurts is the drop in price, just after 5 days of buying it the price of this product dropped faster than my grades, that is disappointing, I guess current price (6,200 INR) is GREAT for this product (price dropped by 17.3%)."
5,"This is a first time, i have bought a Marshall and these do not disappoint. If you don't want to active cancellation, this shud be sufficient from noise cancellation perspective. If you on a budget for Premium headphones, these are best you can get. For the first time, the price in india is cheaper than the U.S amazon.. From sound perspective, Bass is balanced(not too much nor too low), High's very good(sound does not  get distorted), Low's could have been better but still is ok.. Microphones are good and voice  on the other end is clear. Battery Life is amazing.  Bluetooth connection is reliable"
5,for my needs I wanted a long lasting battery in my bluetooth headphones and this gives an amazing 30 hours it's a lot for my needs of about 6 hours a day which is pretty long.....this is where I discovered the problem....the earcups are just not cushioned enough....this might sound stupid but it gets really uncomfortable I wear them without glasses and it still hurts after a couple of hours and worsens over time....dont get it wrong the build quality is amazing it's all metal and leather with high quality soft touch plastics....I love the design as well it gives a classic 1980 vinyl vintage look which might be subjective but personally I LOVE the design.....I'm giving 5 stars tho maybe i expected too much of comfort after coming from over ear studio headphones....definitely recommend this if you want a cute small powerhouse package with an amazing sound signature and performance with an enormous battery life and good build quality
4,"So it’s been almost a week since I got these and here is my take on them :1) These are quite classic and have a rugged look when it comes to aesthetics so good job in this sector.2) To be very honest I am not a hard core music listener so the less bass factor doesn’t bother me much .3) For me the voice is crisp , good high and lows and over all a decent music output at this price it could have been better .4) now comes comfort , so for the first few days they are pain in ass , you can’t even wear them for 15 mins but I noticed gradually you get used to it .Overall take is this a good looking classic styled pair of headphones which are good at what they do but at this price segment they could have been better ."
5,"Pros :- Superb sound quality.- Looks absolutely stunning.- Excellent Battery life.- Well balanced audio(not too bassy and I like it that way).- Can be used as a wired head phones also in case you are running out of battery (ships with an aux cable).- Audio can be shared with someone with a 3.5 mm jacked head/earphones simultaneously.Cons:- As with any other headphones, you can't wear this for hours together.- In 2020 it doesn't have the latest version of Bluetooth and doesn't support Aptx HD. But that is kind of nitpicking as it was released in 2018.- Doesn't support connections to multiple devices at once.Some people are complaining that it doesn't do noise cancellation. Well this isn't meant to do that and the manufacturer nowhere mentions it cancels noise. Look for models with A.N.C on their website if this is what you are looking for. That said, it does a pretty good job to isolate your surroundings."
4,"After purchasing the product I read so many negative reviews regarding the originality of the product. Also people gave negative reviews to the Appario retail seller as well. This scared me about the geneniunity of product. But thank God! Nothing goes wrong. Product is original and arrived early. Sound is awesome.If you like dj songs. Then it is not for you. The balanced sound may upset you. But trust me guys, you will enjoy the silent songs. Each and every instrument is clearly audible. Not for bass lover.Hats off to battery backup of this product."
4,"The signs is amazing. Its really great product, pricing is also nice. However I noticed that sound over Bluetooth is much better than when connect the cable. Which uslly is not the case in other headphones but thats how it turned out for me.These are not meant for noise cancellation so don't expect any and start giving bad reviews for same. Its not meant to do that but it doesn't hinder in any way with the music.Microphone does great job as well.Build is sturdy, but since these are on the ear rather than over the ear they will hurt on ears after a while. There is no getting away from it.All in all great product at this price point, although I would have liked a control over equaliser but its okay."
2,"Inspite of most reviews that mentioned these headphones are uncomfortable tower over long period,made the mistake of picking it up, ears pain real bad if worn close to an hour. Battery life is good. Sound quality for this price is good (sale price) , lows don't get picked up and is not extra bassy, would fit the requirement if you are upgrading from basic headphones, if you are used to high end ones definitely would not like the sound. What really works is the design, they look really attractive."
4,"Used ths headphone around 1 month now, 1st about sound quality waaw osm, i already using skullcandy crusher wireless, it sound quality s better thn skullcandy its my opinion, 2nd battery life im using ths around 1 month still i wont charging it up yeh still 40 % thr, i wont use more than 1 hour, 3rd comfort yeh here its lacking, i use spec so it creates some pain aft 30 mins use, bit hig Clamping force i think, but sitll it s goood headphone, 👍🏾, if yu aptex or hifi quad dac, yu wll goo out tha world😴"
5,"Pro:1. Good sound quality.2. Great battery life, easily lasts about 3 days if using 8 hours daily3. Good comfort, I wear specs so sometimes it hurts but if you don't have glasses, the comfort is amazing!4. I love the one button concept! Fast feedback and actions.5. Easy to carry.6. Fast charging, takes about 2 hours to get it fully charged.7. Comes with a high quality charging and 3.5mm wire.8. lightweight.""Good to have""/cons1. Not supper comfortable. If you have a humidity in air then it get a bit uncomfortable for long use.2. After using for about a month, it seems the head band feels slightly loose, still pretty sturdy though.3. No carry pouch or box."
5,"Fabulous product.Sound quality is excellent. It's very comfortable on the ear, it does cancel noise but it's something that disappointed me. If we compare it with cheap Motorola headsets they do better noise cancellation.Anyways if you love to listen to music then you will definitely love it, you can hear all instrument sounds clear. I don't have words to describe its sound quality but it's simply amazing."
4,"Good sound quality - good details but slightly muted bassAmazing battery backup - usually charge last more than 2 weeksSlightly over valuedSolid buildFor me the ear cup is not comfortable, it may be for me, my wife wasn't much complaining but soft ear people stay away, buy any alternative from Sennheiser or Sony."
5,"The sound quality is just great, really good for listening music, playing games, attending the meetings and stuff, but the downside is it's kind of heavy on your ears after wearing it for over a period of an hour or so, and leather makes my ear sweaty, so I use it very carefully to avoid damages on the ear piece of it, but overall at the end I was always a fan of Marshall products so this was definitely a great purchase for me, and trust me when I say this it's a great sounding product for that range, because I buy atleast like 2-3 earphones/headphones in a year, and so far this has been one of my best."
3,"The headphone is so aesthetic and classy. It doesn’t  look huge while wearing which is a plus. I got the brown colour, It’s not a very obvious looking brown. It’s a darker shade, so looks almost black in low lighting.Coming to functionality, the sound in the headphone was lagging while playing games on my iPhone and MacBook. The lag would sometimes show up in YouTube videos also.I had to return the product for this reason.Comfort wise, if you wear glasses like I do, then you cannot wear this for longer than 30 minutes, coz the sides of your ears will hurt.I wish I could have kept the product it was so beautiful and the sound quality was amazing. I was stunned at the kind of details that this headset picked up on videos I had heard on other devices before and never noticed.Unfortunately the product lags with Apple devices while playing games like pubg or COD"
4,"Positives:- Great design and built quality. Look great once worn.- Great sound quality- Once adjusted, it fits properly on the ears. No ear pain or irritation.- The 3.5mm jack helps with the connectivity with my PS4 controller- Connects to all types of devices i.e., Android, iOS, Windows 10, etcNegatives:- Sometimes it doesn't connect to devices very smoothly. Takes 1 -2 ON/OFF, even with already paired devices.- No volume control button on the headphones.- Noise cancellation is not that great.Overall a great product, very happy with the purchase!"
4,"I had bought the same headphones in black four months ago. And then bought the same for myself today, because they have the best sound for any one who prefers blues songs. The sounds aren't overbearing but rather true. They are not meant for people who like heavy bass. The product looks elegant and has the best feel for its price. Bought it for 5400 during the sale.It isn't worth it at the 9k markup as at that range you would want over-ear headphones. As these do tend to hurt the ear after 2-3 hours of use. The battery life is also excellent. This is also not for someone with large ears.Also these aren't noise cancelling but after turning on the music you can't really hear anyone else. And the mic catches all sounds so if you are someone who want's to use this for office meetings, make sure you don't live in a loud area.P.S I had made a mistake, after connecting it to my phone, I couldn't find the device on any of my other devices. Make sure that light does turn blue and blinks for connecting it to a different device.(Make sure to press the button down a little longer then for turning it on)"
4,I love the retro look and the brown color especially is classic ! The headphones are awesome in sound quality and clarity..also easy to set up and get going .. a carry case is sourly missing and that should be a must in this range .The fit and finish is of nice quality and the gear is lightweight yet robust..The headband doesnt protrude a lot and is quite snug . Usb to microusb charging cable and Aux cable are of excellent qualityI am a little skeptical about bluetooth range though.need to test more.. Few meters away in the same room felt like there is a little drop in the clarity ..going to another room for sure makes it break due to walls  . Overall a nice experience so far ..more comments after a week’s walking together !
5,"Have been using the Major III BT for over 4 weeks.Likes:1. Great clarity of sound.2. Bass is well balanced. Does not appear to be lacking or heavy, either way.3. The lone, multiple function switch/button is probably my favourite feature.4. Build quality is excellent. The premium-ness comes through.5. Bluetooth connects easily with my phone, though with my old laptop it takes time if I have to connect the Major after having used some other BT device.6. Light-weight and easily portable.7. Battery life is impressive. Rated at 30hrs which is more than enough for my usage.8. Attending calls is hassle free and quality is very good.Dislikes:1. Continuous use for around 2 hours presses down on the left ear enough to get uncomfortable. Advisable to take a break.2. Three or four times there's been an inexplicable distortion for 1-2 seconds during play.3. Outside sound does filter through at lower volumes as there is no ANC though it's no deal breaker.Others:The longevity of the soft, padded material is yet to be seen. I hope it'll be easily replaceable when the time comes.I was worried about the genuineness of the product initially having read about spurious products. Cross referenced the QR code to find that it's genuine. It's a risk with all expensive purchases I suppose."
4,Pros: Battery life is a big plus. For me it went past 2 weeks without a charge.Sound Quality is awesome. Mic is crisp but could have been a bit louder.Superfast connectivity. Although I face connectivity issues with Windows. So I use the wire instead.Cons: Doesn’t have memory foam. Long term wear will cause ear discomfort. No noise cancellation
3,"I bought these Marshall headphones at 6500 rupees and the price was less(about 2k) than the one Marshall website was selling.However, the service of Amazon completely ruined my experience. Let me share my ordeal.The package I received was sealed from the outside but when I opened the package and to my horror I found the box was tampered with and it contained some other cheap fake headphones like the ones used in some call centres (definitely not Marshall). I immediately tried to call the helpline and after a lot of hassle an executive got in touch with me who gracefully agreed to deliver the headphones of MY choice for MY money.Finally, the return request was placed and after some 2-3 days another package came.The package was again sealed from the outside and ""Marshall"" box inside still looked like as it have been tampered with very poor tape sticked to keep the box intact( as you can see in the picture). However, with great pleasure I opened the box and thankfully I found the headphones of my choice. But, the unboxing experience was not upto the mark of what I expected but rather a disappointing one.Nonetheless, the experience of using Marshall major 3 bluetooth is just on another level.Here are my ratings:Build quality: 9/10Noise cancellation: 8.5/10Bass:9/10Treble:9/10Overall sound quality:9.5/10Battery life: 9.5/10Bluetooth connectivity:9.5/10Overall experience: 9.5/10However, at this price range(upto 9k) nothing beats Marshall. It even has its own unique smell(a good smell) which I thought would go after using it for sometime but it doesn't seems to go even after using it for a month.The built and look is no less than premium.It's just a brilliant combination of leather and high-end plastic material.Even though it's not over the ear headphones but it still feels very soft on the ear thanks to leather finishing. For me, the headphones do well in every department.My bet would be if you want something like all-rounder which doesn't compromise in anything then maybe check it out.Thanks!!!."
2,"Disappointed, not upto the mark product.Pro's: Nice sound quality for rock and jazz ,bass is what you'll feel not that thumping.Cons: design is totally disaster specially if you have medium or large size ear this piece will not at all gonna fit you and you can hardly put them on for 20-30 mins.It s very uncomfortable on ears.cushion is not that good.** There is no return policy for this headphones ,amazon and appario should look into this"
1,"Dear Apario Retail. This is a gift I gave my mother and hence they opened it on Birthday and when she did, she found one ear speaker has no sound. By the time return time was over. I am not asking for return, kindly replace the item. 8K is a stiff amount. Kindly assist"
5,"Sound Quality - Bang on and as expected out of this classic masterpiece. The perfect crispy tone of rock music with tye adequate amount of bass.Looks - well that matters and this one tops the list.Battery life - wont comment much on it right now, but seems pretty good.Last verdict - dont wait, just order it!!"
5,Like:It's originalGood soundLightning deal at 7kDislike:Not comfortable for long hoursCannot connect multiple devices same time
5,"First of all Thank You Harman for launching an affordable headphone. Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it. You won't regret afterall it is by HARMAN.#thelongestreview?"
5,"Would I recommend this product to others? Definitely yes.Pros:Light WeightBattery LifeCons:No 3.5 mm cable, only blue toothI was in search of a light weight wireless headphone that I can use for long hours. I have a Bose now but I cannot use it for longer than 2-3 hours as its heavy and ears and head start aching.This Infinity one wins there. I have used it for 6-7 hours without any aches or pains.The ear pieces do press a little on the ears unlike over-the-ear ones. This one is on-the-ear.  But it is not uncomfortable and gives a good fit.The sound quality is good too. Noise cancellation is not big. With low volumes, you can hear surrounding noise.Battery does last for a long long time. I used it daily for 4-5 hours for about 3 days with one charge. Am truly impressed with it.And it folds, hence carrying it around is convenient too.And I got it in the lightning deal at 1500 Rs. Worth the price. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a non-expensive wireless headphones with a decent sound quality.I am giving it a 4 because I am not sure of its durability. If it lasts foe 6 months at least, then I will come back and update the rating to a 5."
5,"Hi all,After a week rough usage i am sharing my opinion.i through that under 1499 INR i should not expect the headset with all features except sound,but this one made ,my through wrong.One of the best budget product it is. ""Infinity (JBL) Glide 500 Wireless On-Ear Dual EQ Deep Bass Headphones with Mic (Charcoal Black)"".Pros:--1.product quality is good on this price.2.sound quality is extraordinary,especially ""Gaana website songs"" are awesome,prime video streaming sound experience just like a theater.3. Battery backup ~20hrs is good is this product.Cons:--1.aux port not enabled in this version.2.No other reasons here."
1,Not liked because his product is made in China so that I am returning
1,"Hello Amazon Team,In the Carton box it is mentioned as Manufactured in USA but in the product it mentioned as China . This is breach case , pls look into & Update."
2,"I bought this headphone as a replacement for my in-ear headset. I attend lot of office calls due to WFH. I wanted to have a Bluetooth headphone with great battery life and decent mic quality. To be honest, I can't use these headphones for more than a hour, my ears are paining a lot. The cushioning is very poor and cheap quality. Giving two Star, as it is basic sense to design a headphone with proper cushioning for comfort. People who enjoy too much bass can be happy."
5,This product is better than its old counterpart i.e. JBL infinity 501. With more upgraded features in an affordable price and under a trusted brand. The most catchy thing is it's 36 mm driver and 72 hours playback time as compared to earlier 20 hrs. playback.
1,This is waste of money. Guys Don't go for this headset you will get lot of ear pain and you can't feel any Bass exist in it. Please don't buy it I had purchased later I found such a worst product and returned immediately.
5,Its awesome product...thumping base...ears vibrating bass..bery good sound quality and in a affordable pricing...
5,"I am impressed with sound quality of Infinity glide 510. It's a value product at a reasonable price. My initial impressions.Pros:1. Good sound quality- mids and highs are clear even with a punchy bass.2.Decent build quality at this price.3.Excellent Bluetooth connectivity and range. I am especially impressed with the range.4. Battery life of 72 hrs which is an unbelievable offer at this price.. (I can't comment on battery life now)5.Pretty decent noice cancellation ( not active)Cons:1.The Deep Bass mode is useless, which spoils the sound quality ( It is set in deep bass mode, you can change it to normal mode by long pressing the volume keys together)2. I could feel the pain on the ears after an hour's usage.I am sure, you won't be disappointed with this product. It's quite a catch at this price. Hope it will be durable."
5,"First to write the review I guess,Okay, so harman has done a superb job with the glide 500. I bought it as soon as I saw it.These are for for people on a budget looking for a pair of decent looking and decent sounding headphones.I now use it for my daily use.For the price, this is absolutely amazing.It is a plastic build yet not cheap.a nice matte finish texture,with soft cushions, I have used it for almost 2-3 hours straight and doesnt hurt my ears.Also has three buttons( volume and power) a micro usb slot and infinity branding on the headband and the sides.As for sound its a 10/10. Doesnt get distorted on bass, no screeching on treble and nice smooth mids.Smooth criminal you can call it! I have tried house, RnB , Pop, EDM. Can hear all of em suppressed sounds we usually dont hear on cheap headsets.Double tap for Your assistant, quick response and the best part. Deep bass on Pressing volume up and down together.You cant expect the skullcrushing bass, like I said, you get quality bass which doesnt hurt you. Im a Bass head myself, i really love the bass delivered by this beauty because it is well balanced.Battery backup yet to be monitored, playing wellb for around 8 hours now on no charge yet. Sounding well, overall a premium feel.  I had tried boat,boult,ant and those budget ones..Trust me this is the best Hands down.Superb job Harman, keep up the good work!"
1,"Highly disappointed and dissatisfied . Can't wear for more than 30 min as it starts to pain , completely against of claims in advertising . Battery backup claimed as 72 hrs ... practically 15 hrs . Cushion on ear cups are not soft enough. Bluetooth disconnected after 7-8 metrs ,  If one scrutinized the reviews well , he can understand that top reviews are paid or Fake ."
5,"Enjoy ""AWESOME DEEP BASS EXPERIENCE WITH LONG LASTING BATTERY LIFE"".Another Excellent product from JBL. I am already using JBL INFINITY GLIDE 500 since 6 months and that itself is having such a good battery backup with a of claim of 22 hours. In one charge it goes for a month or so with an average use of 1 hour. I have bought the product 3 times and gifted them to my brother and friends.With this new model claiming 72 hours backup, it will be just awesome. I have used it for 2 days now and with around 5 hours of use battery level has come down from 80% to 70% only.This is lightweight and more comfortable as compared to its previous Glide 500 version.Coming to its performance... It's just awesome for HEAVY BASS crazy people like me.For the best HEAVY BASS EXPERIENCE, please install DI.FM RADIO App from Google Play Store and enjoy few channels like ""Russian Club Mix"", ""Bass & Jackin House"". You will definitely love this product.For CLEAR MUSIC EXPERIENCE, you can install RADIO TUNES and enjoy beautiful music from channels like ""Mellow Smooth Jazz 🎺"", ""Smooth Jazz"" etc.At this price, it's COMPLETELY AWESOME 👌 👌 👌"
1,"Basic functionality of connecting more than 1 device simultaneously via Bluetooth is not available. You have to disconnect from one device so you can connect to other. There are better local brands having this feature. Moreover 40mm driver headset cost same or less than this one, then why should someone buy just because battery lasts for 72 hours. No one listens continuously that long. I am returning this product and so do others if they understand what I mean!!"
2,connectivity - goodcomfort level - goodcall quality - goodmusic quality - below averageeven on flac format song i miss the expected average music quality than samsung level u....
5,"I am amazed at what the Infinity JBL Glide 500 headphone has to offer.Check out the video to learn what I think about it. If you are short on time, read below- Great for listening to songs while workout (I use it daily)- A small footprint makes it look awesome!- Great bass and overall excellent sound quality- Volume increase buttons on headphones seem to be semi-connected to the phone. The volume can go higher than what's shown on the phone.- It connects to the phone in seconds- Great range!- No mute button(con)- Comfortable around neck- Voice quality is decent!If you like my review, do not forget to click the helpful button. It helps me to write and record great content for you guys! Have a great day!"
1,"Infinity (JBL)By harmanI m great fan of jbl - HKBut didn’t expect such bad experience from u.Connected to iPhoneSongs getting disturbed as if Bluetooth out of range.  But phone at 1 foot distance. Songs getting interpreted , annoying experience. Connected in android phone too. Same problem.Pls infinity(jbl)(HK)Dnt disappoint by launching lik this product.Bass is good , very clear and no distortion even in higher volume . Looks good , nice foldable compact headphones , fits nicely on ear. Soft cup feels pleasant while listening music.Could have included 3.5 jack port - aux cable can be used in case of battery exhausted.Blue light always flickering once in 5 sec , disturbing in night - which is not required to flicker."
5,"Using this infinity headphone for the past 1 week and here is the brief review:# Pros:1. Excellent bass, delight to listen music on this headset.2. Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity is top notch..It's connects very quick after pairing.3. Handset Muff's are decently soft.4. Very less external sound creep in when u r listening on minimal volume. In higher volumes, u can't figure that.5. JBL quality sound. Minimal sound distortion in higher volume. 2 different base for unique listening. Very good value for basic listeners..6. Easily adjustable headset leaf so that it can be fitted tightly according to ur head size.# Cons:1. Build quality is basic. Its more of plasticky and looks normal. The turning hinges looks fragile. Till now, no problems faced, will update it long term review.2. Power on/off becomes a tricky function..It take more than 2 sec to power on/off..During power on, it starts syncing for new Bluetooth devices due to the prolonged time.3. Call voice quality is normal. The voice is very low heated from the other end.Apart from the above, the headset is value buy and its one of the excellent, branded headphone choice in the current market."
5,"When there are thousands of headsets in the market including the cheap Chinese ones, I wanted to go for an option from top brands within my budget. Harman being a reputed brand I shortlisted this as my budget was low and purpose was for indoor use only. I am very happy with the call quality (It is at par with my Bose NC headset when you compare indoor performance) I am not a pro so could not find anything wrong with music quality. The range is good as it is Bluetooth 5.0. Lastly the comfort level is good because it is light weight."
1,"I bought as many people said its plastic, but premium. But, its not. Its a very cheap plastic.Sound is very hollow. No punch, or clarity. High and Mid are very dim, bass is ok ok. With the bass boost option, sound is Ok, else its very hollow sounding.For this price of 1499 or cheaper, Boat is way better in both build quality and sound quality.Wont recommend."
4,"1#Actually its hell of a product I have been using for quite long and this is what I feel about it:Pros-1.Battery -It has a long lasting battery as about 72hrs( as company claims) but I am sure no one using it for continuous 72hrs but what I felt is that when I unboxed the product it was 80% and after 3 days of regular usage like music,youtube,movies I was able to make 3 days with 50%remaining i.e 30% for 3 days and it took me about 45 min to chagre it up to 80%2.Sound quality and bass-This thing is a beast regarding bass and sound quality I can asure you that this wont even dissappoint you in case of sound quality and for bass,if you bass lover like me it got 2 mode-normal and deep bass.If you cant feel enough bass at normal mode you can easily shift to deep bass mode by pressing +and -button together then you will feel an astonishing bass effect even you can feel the headphone starts vibration at each beat and if this doesnt make you enough then I recommend you to meet an E.N.T for check-up Dude belive me it's crazy3.Bluetooth range-Its just great because its version 5.0 and provide greater range even after crossing 3 rooms you can get adequate range without breaking any signal4.Microphone-its like a bonus because it has good audio recording but the only problem is that it works only during calling i.e you can use it to record or send voice message in whatsapp5.Usage of buttons is just as simple as it seemsLets get to cons:(Only two minor ones)1.comfort-Actually it is only one negative thing I felt about the device after my first usage .It is a bit uncomfortable to wear and you will feel a slight pain over your pinna (external ear )after using for 1 hr ,but now I became adjust to it now I can wear it for hrs without any problem belive me,it can take some time to adjust and after that you won't feel any problem plus it's is weight less and small device so you will easily adjust within one day2.Plastic quality-(It is my feeling that )it seems to be a little fragile during transport especially keeping it in a bag so beware of thatOther than these 2 minor factor I never felt anything bad about this device.So my verdict is that I usually loves to hear music with a good bass and effect and I have used many device from Sennheiser,Ant audio,Jbl,Boat,Skullcandy,Audio technica,Sony and many more so from my experience I will recommend this device to many and I would say THIS IS THE BEST HEADPHONE IN THE MARKET THAT PROVIDE BLUETOOTH AND SOUND QUALITY AT THIS REASONABLE PRICE POINT IF YOU ARE GONNA BUY A HEADPHONE UNDER 1000 JUST PUSH YOUR MAXIMUM TO THIS PRICE POINT IT WILL ALWAYS BE WORTHY.A GOOD PRODUCT FROM HARMAN AUDIO /JBL AS ALWAYS#But all these good factors vanishes because of the horrible comfort that is why I gave 4 star.Otherthan comfort this is awesome"
1,I absolutely hated it from the moment I started using it. It feels so cheap. Even though I was sitting right in front of my laptop it got disconnected multiple times. My ears started to get hot after some time. I'm trying to return it but apparently I can only replace it. DO NOT BUY THIS!! IT IS A SCAM ! U CAN'T GET A REFUND! THEY WILL send u the same thin again!
3,"SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD, BUT THE HEADPHONES ARE TIGHT AND MAY GIVE YOU PAIN ON LONG USAGE. I have not been able to use it for long time since it's too tight for me... And Irony is Amazon doesn't want give refund to me. I want to go for in-ewr headphones but still they don't want to give the refund. And cherry on cake is Customer care shouts on the customer... @Amazon you need to train your customer care people. Ridiculous experience. Please give my money back if you can so I can have another headphones.Update: Amazon gave my money back, and i was able to buy another headphones. Thank you Amazon."
1,"Pls don't purchase it. It has a sound in right side of headphone. Harman group had told me to send this product. I had parcelled this which cost me around Rs 400. Now they have returned the item again to me without any notice. And when I called, they are saying there is no fault. Such a poor customer service.Sincere request, don't purchase it. It has a prominent sound like vibrating string. Add to this such a poor customer care. Their behaviour is shameless. They should learn from Amazon.Update on 20.nov.19: Customer service of Harman group are shameless. I had some recordings. Everytime they will say we will call you back after 24 hours. But they will never call. I am going to file a case in consumer court.Its not a good headphone at all. Pls purchase other item. Forget about customer care, sound quality is not good. There is a Continous belling soung.Thank you"

3,"Review by a semi professional...Buid quality-7.5/10(headband is thin)Noise isolation-8/10Sound leak-10/10(almost no sound leak even in full sound)Sound quality-7.8/10(instrumental separation is not good,bass is a little muddy not tight,edm/bollywood are best for this... acoustics/rock are not fit into this)Battery-10/10 (12hrs for sure)Connectivity-10/10(instant connection, connection is flawless upto 10ft)Mic-8/10(better though not best)Comparision with some popular cans-1.senn cx180/213 has 2times better clarity2.boat basshead225 has 1.2tiimes better clarity3.onemore pistonfit has 1.3times better clarity4.jbl cs300si has less clarity5.boat 400 has just a little less clarityBut but when it comes to songs with bass this one is better than almost all others(though cx180 has more pleasing bass)**Bass mode has more punchier bass than normal...those who r saying no effect their phones  r rubbish for sureAtlast i say if u get it in 1200/1300₹ then its perfect..for 1500/1600₹  u will feel less satisfied,,,wait for the discount, don't buy when its above 1500₹"
5,"Superb clarity. Bass in normal mode is enough, no need to change the EQ setting. Highs are little less bright but still comprehensible. Vocals sometimes feel muddy but looking at the price range, there cannot be better headphones. This is top notch quality in this price. Far better than Boat, far far better. No comparison, in fact. JBL is JBL."
4,"I purchased this on 28 August, it was delivered on 31 August. The delivery was good. Now to the headphones,this headphones has all the things you need to called this headphone. I mean the sound quality is excellent. Bass is good. No distortion in taking calls and decent build quality. It kinda look like jbl t460bt younger brother. I have given 4* because it has a minor issue of producing a sound like ""ting ting"" when you touch or tap right side of the headphones. But it doesn't bother that much so it's a sweet deal. Hope you can enjoy this product.Update: 27 may 2020- I have been using this for past 8 months and their sound quality is best considering it's battery life and build which is far good than other headphones available. The only one drawback is their are not much comfortable. So if you can compromise a bit then go for it."
5,"The build and sound quality of this thing is awesome. I upgraded to this after my Sennheiser cx 180 street ii broke. For all those who are wondering it comes with a 610 mah battery. I am by no way a audiophile but the sound i feel is excellent. It was by default in bass boosted mode and i switched it back to normal. Battery life, Durability all those things will be updated in a future update. I feel it was a bit uncomfortable for large head, mine is xl 😝 but not that troublesome (3/5 for comfort). Edit : The sound of the headphone is excellent after burning in for more than 10 hours. You get used to the headphones after sometime. So yeah its more comfortable now. 2 days of 3 hour per day use in medium volume gets battery down by 10%. Buy this thing eyes closed."
1,"It worked fine for first 2 weeks, It's now less than 15 days and it stopped working.Not sure if It charges properly... I can see the red light while charging. Then click and hold power button to start - power button seems to be not working.Is there any reset button to auto fix settings?It's useless now. I can't return it as after 10 days as per return policy. I have 1 year warranty. I don't know how to claim that.It's not a good experience."
1,"This is made in China product (written on the box). It's showing it's nature from first day. If sound is not played for 3-4 min and then you play any sound the headphones will not respond until you until you pair it again. I don't know if it is happening with me only. In one hour I noticed 3-4 time sound stopped for like half sec which I did not expected from JBL, me and my phone were on same bed .Sound is nice but breaking half sec between songs is not acceptable. Bad bluetooth connection.I literally search JBL is US brand but still they have quility like Chinese products."
1,"Hey guys , read this before you buyI bought the headphones 1 month ago which was around 14-15 sep. Everything was going well. Exactly after 1 week, which is 21st sep I used the headphone for 3 hrs to attend some meeting and as soon as I disconnected it the headphones stopped working.  I went to the phone shop they said they won't repair this. I wrote a complain at Harman website they had no response.. please Amazon  have a look at this product and I will wait for the reply.Regards"
4,Sound is good but will only work with mobileNot with laptop or anyother device
5,"Mind Blowing 3D surround sound Experience, I have sennheiser and Sony headphone but really this headphone is amazing, every notes and vocal r clear and bass is very very very awesome when u r switched in powerful bass such u feel with new bass experience. Overall I give full rate 5/5"
5,"Here is my detailed review of this product after a week of usage:1. Build quality:Earlier was sceptical a bit about on-ear headphone that the outer ear will pain after long use. But this one comes with great built, comfort, lightweight and handy that one can use for longer period without any discomfort.2. Sound quality:I'm an audiophile. Love to hear every single frequency from low to high and set my theatre for the same. Here comes the sound of this product it'll really produce the low frequency approx 80-100hz which is really good for such small speaker resulting good bass, clear sound with balanced trable.Noise cancellation is as expected. You'll be cut out from outer world.3. Bluetooth control and battery:Bluetooth is working as expected and can be achieved at a distance of 10-15 mtrs. Control buttons are good with proper sensitivity battery lasted 18 hours of regular use.Over all a nice product from Herman and can buy without having second thoughts."
4,"I wasn't able play pubg connecting with this headset, you will get the fire sound or foot sound with delay of 2 seconds so you can't sync the sound of game which you hear in headset and game play."
5,Infinity Glide 500 is very accurate in terms of sound quality. Build quality seems to be not so good because all is plastic. I was comparing this with Jbl T460 bluetooth headphone. The INFINITY GLIDE 500 is having puncy bass. I could say that bass is little bit overpowering...there is option to switch ON the deep base mode but believe me friends I could never feel the need to enable deep base mode. The bass is too much even in normal mode. So bass lovers will like this headphone for sure. Please allow some time to burn the headphone to produce quality sound. First day you may not feel the headphone good but believe me from second day I was just in love with this as it produces sharp details. So burning time is required to free up the components of headphone. Battery backup is tremendous...as compared to Jbl T460. Jbl T460 has just 11 hours whereas this headphone has 20 hours backup. Price is also very low.Thanks.UPDATE AFTER USING 3 WEEKS:This headphone has really became my travel mate...This has bluetooth 5.0 and it does not even disconnects in Mumbai crowded local trains. Your phone should support bluetooth version 5.0 and it will connect with this headset seamlessly. Lower bluetooth versions are also supported of course...But 5.0 is great for connectivity and battery optimization.EQ mode is not that great and it does not give any difference and there is really no need to push for deep base....it is just awesome in normal mode....Flexible to carry and travel...Great headphones.
5,"This is my first Bluetooth Overhead headphone.Reason why I do not prefer Bluetooth headphone is due to its poor battery backup and sound quality, I always prefer Wired headphones also for its sound quality.But this headphone is a game changer1. Battery Backup: this headphone is really great in the battery backup. I was an average listener and game player. So it was giving a backup for more than a week easily for me. I never thought of charging it from the day I bought it.2. Sound effect: The sound is absolutely good with some equaliser and it’s best with power amp, and some music player which has custom equaliser in Android. If you are iPhone user and wanna enjoy music in default music player , then it’s not for you. However we can install some third party music player with equaliser and enjoy the music (eg: onkyo player).And the best part of the headphones is enjoying a movie with deep bass mode. If you are looking for a headphone to enjoy movies for long time with best bass boosted high volume sound effect then go for this without thinking. I really enjoy watching Marvel collections since I’m marvel fan. Oven never enjoyed such a deep bass anywhere. Even in laptop the movies sounds great with VLC media player(subjected to best equaliser settings).3. Comfort: The headphone gives a great comfortable tight fit. I’m a big head guy and it’s really so hard. I can’t wear it for more than 20 min. But I gave the same headphone to my brother and sister, everyone is comfortable wearing for so long. So I wear it in a different angle and it helps me to fit comfort. This is definitely for round headed people, it has a huge extension but still there is no adjustment for horizontal flexible adjust fit.4. Build Quality: So good and sturdy. Light weight and foldable.5. Noise Cancellation: It gives a nice noise cancelling sound environment with more than average volume level. Compression is perfect for normal head. Since I have round and huge head, it is not giving perfect closure to ears if I extend the length of the adjustment. That’s the only problem for me. Never mind if you are normal headed.Mic: During call and gameplay I never had a complaint from other end. They can hear my voice clearly.Drawbacks: It does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack and I can’t enjoy the Dolby Atmos effect from my laptop. For this extreme bass headphone if it gives me option to connect and enjoy the music I would be so happy. But it can’t be bundles with all futures right. That’s negligible for me.Overall it’s a Best Buy for the price range. I really enjoy it and my family is enjoying with this headphone.Thanks"
2,"I was expected a lot from this Bluetooth headset, but disappointed very much.It like a normal piece, not worth to buy for Rs1700"
1,"Today, I have received Glide 500 wireless on-ear headphone. But the product is not as good as I have heard abt it. I purchased it for brand name HARMAN but sound quality especially Bluetooth connectivity is so irritating that I prefer to return this. I played music on ganna app as well as songs available in my phone but same problem exist both the time. Every 4-5 seconds a interruption occurred and sound became low. So I recommend not to buy this."
1,"The product was delivered as per the schedule, but the most worrying and dangerous incident happened, just after receiving the product it was connected for charging and within few minutes the earphone got busted , the outer part melted and all the inner part came out.I am sincerely requesting Amazon,  seller , and the brand to do better quality check before selling. what if this incident had happened while using the product , it would have been brutal.Though I appreciate amazon’s quick action in taking back the product and refunding the money, but please take utmost care henceforth."

5,These Zebronics zeb symphony Wireless earphones are the Best By it Prices .Earphone Sound Quality Is very Good At Full Volume Anyone Can here The Vocals very clearly. And The Main Feature of these wireless earphone is Battery Life Give Great backup. Bluetooth Connectivity Is As a Good Then Others. Almost it's a Best.
5,Im a type of guy who analyze all aspects including others review regarding the product. product is excellent for this budget(value for money). Sound Quality is Normal.Not like JBL quality. still its worthy. OVERALL you can trust and buy Zerbronics everything they could for the quality...SoundQuality is NORMAL.
5,"The product built quality is good. I am using it on daily basis, it's really light weight. Sound quality is really good for this price tag. You will get all basic features and button controls which every neckband offer's . It's really good product at this price."
4,Excellent product in this price zonor...Zebronics made it nice...I ordered this item after seen article in a magazine.. Really liked it...Now one side earphone not working..
1,Poor product. Battery gets heated and damaged in one week after purchase.So 0 star cheap chinese product
5,"Using bluetooth headset for very first time was new experience for me. Zebronics has made it simple with this product to use and explore the features. Amazing sound quality with noise cancellation feature.The rest of the thing I liked about the product are.1. Voice Assistant Support to call , play music or browse2. Full charge in 45 min with playback of 10 hours3. Connectivity in less than 5 sec4. Clear voice connectivity while a call.It's also good while running or jogging with fixed support in ears. A well suited product under Rs 1000 to experience wireless connectivity."
5,"A very good bluetooth earphones in this price range. Sound is very clear without buffer while talking to someone, listening music or watching videos and quality is amazing, the bass is very deep doesn't hit in the ear. Durability is excellent as I used it for 3 continuous days by charging it only once and is a value for money product."
5,"Battery backup was awesome near about 5 hour's on regular use, quality was so too good, and connectivity timing very less."
5,Ok
4,Wonderful product with good price....
4,"You want to go for a Bluetooth headset with best price then go for it.....it serves the purpose while watching videos , hearing songs and for voice & video calling.....But if you are a music lover and you r in need of some quality music , then I would say NO.... Becoz my normal sony headset music quality cannot be compared with it....but as a Bluetooth headset it's serves the purpose with decent battery stay....."
1,Defective piece was sent to me. No return or refund allowed. Hence lost rs 749.
5,"1. I would like the buttons to be a little more pronounced so that it is easy to feel. 2. I would like to have the last number redial facility by double pressing the volume decrease button 3. I would like the neckband to be capable of replacing the earphones & wires with just a simple plug in, plug out option.Probably if it had all these I would have given a full 5 star rating."
4,"Personally liked the output of Audio especially for this priceBut, while playing Pubg there is a small lag while firing the gun...Gun sound is coming late by 5 seconds"
5,I have found only one issue the mic is not working properly.You can hear the voice clearly but if you speak through bluetooth it will not work.you have to use your mobile for that.Built quality is fine.Sound quality is good.
5,It's battery life lasts up to 6 to 7 hours if u use this to talk or listen music and usually it lasts up to 10 to 15 days. If I say overall this will be best for the person who can't take their phones with their hand for a long time. They can keep their phone in the pocket and can easily do their works for a long time . If I say in my point of view it is a best product it works good for me. I really like this product very much.
3,"From product durability to sound quality i understand it is just average. But at this price it reached the expectations. But warranty card not received. At product description at amazon it claimed one year warranty but not received the same.  The product packaging also not at all sealed but the courier cover was tactfully sealed. Apart from that everything and feature working fine.  Buttons are little bit rigid.  I tested voice assistant feature _ worked properly; distance range of bluetooth it is 10m; battery back up _ for 4hrs play it consumed 25%.  But i just reviewing on day one usage.  I shall update after a monthUpdation after 2 months usage:Battery backup, connectivity is awesome. Battery giving12 hrs backup with nonstop music playback. It is also connecting to Mi 4C pro TV. This is an added advantage who is having the said smart TV.Updation after 5 months usageMic not working. Hence, now it is only used to listen multimedia.  I have mailed written complaint to the vijayawada (as fit for my location) serice centre as shown in the service centre list as available in official zebroinics website.  But there is no reply from them.  It shows after sales is not available even under warrantyUpdation on 17/10/20Only left speaker working. But battery backup is still awesome. 10 hrs backup. It stolen my heart in this aspect.  No support from the service center.  Warranty is useless whether it's is a year or ten without support."
5,"Using since past 6 months, even used for long duration customer calls , battery backup is aweome .Sound quality is super good ,after so long addicted to music due to mind-blowing  sound output .At this price it's superior neckband available in the market with almost double price. once ur not using Bluetooth automatically goes in sleep mode so no need to off the headset.Best buy at unbelievable price .No problem with call function ,"
5,It's a mind blowing product. Iam using it for half manth. Specially the battery life is too good it's more than 10 hours. bass quality is little low but overall it's a value for money product.Only disadvantage there is a few service centers in West Bengal.
3,"For 700rs it's a decent gamble. The bass quality is poor. It has like zero bass. The sound volume is decent.While talking on a call with the earphones on, it is sometimes unclear for the other person to understand so I suppose the microphone isn't good.But if it's just for listening to songs or watching movies without the annoying cord then it's a okay go for product."
5,"Absolute best product you get for that amount of money, don't look on other reviews, I use these earphones for almost 12-13 hrs a day and never it has ever felt uncomfortable, currently I'm using the second pair of these head because my first one acidently broke and 2nd one also has the same comfort as ever, on the count of 1 to 10 for comfort, I will give it 11 !!!"
5,"I bought two of these - one for me and one for my sis. At first, I received a faulty pair but a replacement was sent to me in no time. I have been using this for about a week now. These headphones are amazing for the price. The sound quality is good, easy to pair with Android or iPhone. Once fully charged, it lasts  for a good couple of hours. I would say go for it!"
5,"Good earphone with good range and battery backup which is enough for 2-3 days with normal 3-4 hours usage per day. Allows multiple pairing, voice assistant. Overall good and cost effective"
5,Nice budget product......normal bass with light weight quality..if u thoughts to buy economic Bluetooth gadget nah..u can definitely buy.....highlight here is worth for money 👌👍
3,"Bought this product in seek of trouble-free listening to music and comfortness around one and a half month back. Initially, I loved it really as it almost tallied my expectations. But, I don't really aware what's wrong with this - left side of its stopped working suddenly, as if am handling it hardly like I used to with the normal headphones. Now, the option to return is also unavailable. Feeling like dump it into garbage 🤪🤪😠😥. Sound quality is good but definitely not recommended for the rough handlers.👎🏿"
5,"This earphone looks very good. It is very flexible also.The sound clarity is also good.There is no proper mention of how to turn on the earphone in the user manual. For this I had to watch some YouTube video.Apart from this, everything looks good."
5,"One of the best products available in the price range. You can go for Boat and JBL too, but at this price range, considering I use it mostly for calls, the battery is way better than other lasta almost 2  days if I only use for calls.Sound quality if good for music, noise cancellation is not upto the mark. Its also water splash resistance."
5,"Good product, easy to connectNo noise cancellationHigh bass songs give some vibrations in earphoneValue for money"
5,Very good quality at this prize.Sound clear and loud.Hands free call loud and clear.Battery life upto11 hours.Overall it is good bluetooth headphone.
5,Super bass and noise cancellation best in this range to buy an new wireless Bluetooth earphones and its is good for movies and games and battery long last 1 days with full charging and if gaming it lasts 11 - 12 hours of gaming
5,"Personally I feel zebronics is a trusted brand. This neck band is really remarkable for its 13 hrs long battery back up and sound quality too. Along with this neck band I am using products like web camera, led multimedia keyboard and mouse ...all are working really good.Thank you !!"
4,It claims 30 ft coverage from the device. Actually it has less than 10ft.
1,Just don't buy it..It's wire brakes easilyI have so worst experience with zebronics. In one month my bluetooth earphone was workingJust add some money and buy Boat Rockers 255It is much better in all case.. and its sound quality is just awesome.

5,I have been searching for an everyday use headphone for quite a long time now. This one successfully fulfills that requirement of mine. I have to mention a few characteristics that have attracted my attention- This in-ear wireless Bluetooth headphone is very lightweight and very easy to carry around. It gives quite good noise cancellation and helps me ignore the surroundings when I am outside. Build quality of the material is surprisingly robust. I did not expect this good material quality and design at this price range.Treble and smoothness of sound is well maintained in the headphone. Bass is a bit low but I found it quite satisfactory as well. Lightweight and good noise cancellation are two main characteristics that helped me select this headphone amongst others.
5,"This wireless headphone is very attractive, very light in weight and premium in appearance. Its build quality is also very good, I have been using it for 6 days, I have a very good experience, its sound quality is good. It has a light indicator  Also, Mike is doing well at the time of calling.  Battery backup I got 5-6 hours.  Overall this is perfect for music lovers."
5,"I just brought it in last week, and to be very frank,it's really Awesome. Beyond my expectations.Sound quality is like having your own personal home theatre,too clear and loud enough, you can listen every single bit of music.And coming to battery backup, also noise cancellation is great, and bass quality is too good, so I like this product so much."
5,Product built quality is very good and wire length is quite long so i can easily move my neck around..i love the sound quality of product.Its very light weight and battry life is also very good...Overall love the product and in this price its full value for money product..
5,"I ordered this neckband earphone on prime day sale and it's a steal on this price.At price of 499/- sound quality is superb,other than this bluetooth neckband is super lightweight,once your wear around your neck, you can almost forget it.Thickness of this neckband is suitable for all and very comfortable and because these neckband earphone are magnetic, it is very hassle free.Vocals are very crystal clear in this earphone and has good deep bass.Overall I must say these wireless neckband earphones are total value for money for me."
5,"Sound quality is perfect, good bass.  The assortment of ear pieces made for a perfect fit. I use these daily on my train ride to the office and during workout. The quality of the material was just right for me,  not too soft and not too hard. I really liked it.  The battery life is pretty great as well."
5,"When i open the box ,i got sexy looking neckband,I can say pTron providing good products to us . Everything works perfectly like noice cancellation,bass is descent,this one is good at this price"
3,No bass only treble
1,One day use left head phones not work
5,"It's best earphone I hear on earphonesIt's good in sound quality,gets extra buds and cable too in the box given, battery back is also good almost 4-5hours per full charging of earphone, it's also light weightThank u so much u PTron for having a very good product under this amountIt's look like better to compared other products at this price.The use in half the cable is around the neck as a band and mass wire.it is also chepar compared to the other products and it's can use in the while driving as well as running time also"
1,"Zero product, worst customer care service, product was faulty , i made the request to the ptron site, mailed them, but didn't got response even after waiting for 15 days, the number they mentioned in theri website  didn't connect , not even once, and the service center is in Hyderabad, far far away from agra city, so it was a total loss of 500 indian rupees, but it provided me a lesson that don't invest in cheap products and companies , cheap will always be cheap.Worst experience."
1,"It is a disappointment that Amazon calls such products Amazon's Choice. The Entire Money has gone waste. The Packaging of this product was cheap like anything. The Earphone has no branding on its earpiece looks like a roadside earphone. The Earpiece is large too. The Neck band is sturdy but over-sized. Battery Backup, Bass, sound and noise cancellation is brilliant. But what is worst is its blue tooth connectivity. it does connect to multiple devices at a time and do not get disconnected automatically, it is also easy to connect, but there is a huge issue in switching between Calls and Audio - The Connection is lost every time and sound gets scaringly distorted and shrilled and broken, that one has to restart or reconnect every time even a call comes that you dont pick up. Mic is very very poor and the other side hears nothing, neither is the other side's sound clear. My 850 bucks wasted. Wish I could replace for some other better earphones."
5,got it delivered withing 3 days. packaging was good. Its sound quality is simply awesome as compared to its fair price. very good value for money option for budget oriented people like me. battery life is also decent. mine lasts for at least 6 hours of continuous playback and frequent calling. BASS effect is crispy clear and simply superb.Definitely a go for this price.
1,"Pls don't buy, i know you are going to see about all the comments positive, i am going to give the reason for that too. First of all, when you will buy the product, for the first 2 weeks it will work perfectly and you will think that the product is very good but after 2 weeks problems will start arising. One of the earbuds will stop working, after  week the other earbud will also stop working. Now if you will try to claim the warranty than you will first find that they will say that they are going to reach you in 2 days but that will not happen. They will never reach to you, you will try to reach them using their customer care number but believe me they will never attend your call. Now how i am saying this i will tell you. In December 2020 i bought this product, after using it for one week i thought that it is a very good product and i suggested this product to my relative and after 2 weeks of use it stopped working and all that happened that i told you. Same happened to my relative. Its been around 1 month no one came for the replacement of the product. Now i will tell you how everyone is saying that this is a very good product. This is because almost everyone post their review under a week and all of them thought that it is a good product. I would  recommend not to buy, instead collect 2 to 3 hundred rupees and go for a better company such as boat so that atleast if a problem arise they will resolve it. pls"
1,"My personal suggestion is do not buy this headset. Those who are planning to buy this headset please check with other well reputed brand like samsung , Or JBL, Bose, Or Jabra. Don't go because it is in cheap rate little bit in high price best quality product you will get. This product mainly problem is that it is very soft product wire connected to the battery part means left side and right side volume control buttons and off /On buttons that connection of wire is not good if you used to with1/2 month then it getting loose wire from that main points please go through the ruff n tuff headsets. After using it 1 month it starting problems like not charging properly. Suddenly it stop working."
1,"This product is only suitable for YouTube streaming for educational purposes only... Absolutely sucking sound quality... Poorest of the poor in terms of sound and those who gave it a 4,5 star might haven't heard music ever in their life... Pathetic.. just keeping it as alternative for online classes in covid 19 times."
1,"This headphone is worthless at any given price! I purchased it on 1st Jan 2021 and on 16th Jan 2021, it stopped turning on. I tried contacting the customer support over the call and email, but nothing worked. It give me hard days to reach to the customer support. Finally I got in touch with the customer support team. They don't have any service center and you need to ship the product to their warehouse. I did ship which costed me INR 160/-. Then it took multiple followups and 3 weeks to get the replacement. The customer support team also informed now it won't get replaced. That means, if the product stops working now (even in the warranty period) I need to throw it in dustbin since no replacement is going to take place. At the end, the product costed me total 760 (600 for product and 160 for shipping). And if in case I need to get it repaired, I may need to do further expense of 160 again to ship. So at the end, you are not getting the product at 600 but more that that. Better to invest in good brand and purchase better headphone then keep wasting money.-------Just to add-on, the second headphone which I received are continuously getting disconnected while on call. So the money spent here was complete waste..."
4,Bought this product on prime day for Rs 499. Overall a good product for this price.Pro's:Good build qualityClear audio qualityGood battery lifeCon's:No bass at allSound frequency is lowOverall a good neckband to have under Rs 500 (except for the bass).
1,Poor meterial..sound quality seems like very cheap headphones like you will find out in the street the may cost around 100 rs.. as it is a made in india product..still I would suggest and expect better quality in near future.. looking forward on serious evolment in their range of products
1,"I'm writing this after using for 1week& Returned bcozVery poor productPain in ears due to the design of earbudsMic is worst, trouble while in callBattery stands for maximum 2 hours after charging 1hourVery bad don't buy"
5,"PROS: 1. BATTERY (LIFE AS PER MY NON-STOP USE) 9 HRS TALKING AND LISTENING MUSICS, VIDEOS. 2. CRYSTAL CLEAR SOUND QUALITY. 3. LITE WEIGHT, YOU NOT EVEN FEEL THAT THE NECKBAND IS THERE. 4. WIRE LENGTH IS SUFFICIENT. 5. BLUETOOTH COVERING AREA IS ALSO VERY GOOD IN COMPARE TO OTHERS. 6. VERY FAST CONNECTING WITH PEERED DEVICES. 6. CALLING SOUND QUALITY IS ALSO VERY GOOD.CONS: 1. BASS IS NOT ENOUGH (DUE TO FITTING ISSUE), 2. NO NOISE CANCELLATION IS THERE. 3. EAR BUDS ARE NOT FIT TO EAR PROPERLY. YOU FELL THAT BY HOLDING THOSE TIGHTLY WITH YOUR HANDS. I AM USING THE SMALLEST RUBBER GRIP THAT THEY PROVIDE AND SOUND QUALITY IMPROVES LITTLE BUT THE PROBLEM IS STILL THERE. 3. THE SOUND IS NOT LOUD ENOUGH WHILE PLAYING VIDEOS, I TRIED IT ALL KIND OF VIDEO FORMAT. YOU NOT ABLE TO LISTEN PROPERLY IN OUTSIDE AND CROWDED PLACES.OVER ALL I LOVE THIS HEADPHONE CONSIDERING ALL THE ISSUES."
1,"Well, it was broken in two days when I tried to remove it from my neck. Then I thought that I can still use it for a walk but now the plastic cover over the charging slot does not open, maybe it is fixed with glue. Shame on Amazon for selling such 3rd class stuff.Update - Last week other side was broken as well when tried to remove it from my neck after a morning walk. This time I had to click a pic and post it. This is stillbworking though as those tiny wires are still connected but i bet won't last very long."
5,There is no doubt it is very best product. When my 3 friends recommended it then I buyed it and after receiving that product I really shocked sound quality is just impressive really loved that product
1,Purchased on 29th may 2020. Now right  earplug is not working.. truely chinese.. it is less then 7 months .. It is a ok product for Rs 799. But unfortunately i was misguided that this is a MADE IN INDIA product. This is a MADE IN CHINA product and i was looking for something that is MADE IN INDIA. BE VOCAL FOR LOCAL. AND I REQUEST AMAZON TO MAKE IT MANDATORY TO MENTION MANUFACTURING COUNTRY.
1,"I don't like this earphone at all, bass is missing, sound is soo sharp that it hurts ear and creates headache...im using redmi k 20 pro, so it this earpiece is not at all good for this phone...ispite of making all sound settings it is impossible to get a good sound. While calling, the receiver gets low volumes, so i prefer calling by my phone only.Really disappointed 😭buiyng earphone from market is a good option, atleast we can check it before buying, n can select the good one.Wired earphone is much much much better than this tangent lite bluetooth earphone."
1,"I have been using it for 4 months or so, since Aug-2019, but the left side speaker has stopped working. There seems to be some loose contact and if I try to move the wire around, then I sometimes the sound sputtering out of the speaker. The usage has not been much heavy in terms of handling as it is generally lying around my neck the whole day and only taken out at night. The buds are put in the ear just while answering the calls and are just left downwards otherwise; the magnets in the earbuds ensure that the buds remain in place. So given the handling, the build quality is poor. Or perhaps the design is fragile as I feel that the wires get stressed out when the ear buds are not in ears but just left down.Second issue is that the device silently gets powered off, especially after ending of a call. Its a problem especially if used while driving as you would not hear the ring at all as the device has turned off.Overall, not happy with the product.Update on 28-JanThe second speaker has also stopped working. So it goes into trash. Company is not reachable for so-called warranty."
1,"Don't waste  your money on this brand...surely the band looks good but build quality is very cheap and terrible. My headphone only last for month before it's left ear piece stopped working. Even I tried reaching pTron Customer care, to claim warranty but after 3 weeks of back and forth emailing, I realized they never interested in providing warranty, it's their strategy to drag feet so that customer will give up after some time.Pathetic product and even worst customer care, don't fall for attractive pricing as product is not worth half of that. You will regret buying this."
3,I am writing this review after using this product for almost a month. Quality of sound and noise cancellation is very good. The issue I have with this phone is that it does get disconnected by itself esp. after the end of phone conversation. Though it does get connected automatically immediately but often it goes into power off mode.Please take care of this issue and then it is 5 star.
1,I got the headphone at 899 it’s working good only 2days after working only right side. I’m really disappointed i put replacement request. Might be seller send to me a refurbished product because product come damaged box and also dust particular on headphones
1,"Product is overall good and there is no compromise with the material looks. But if we talk about the sound quality which is the main feature of the product, it's not good at all. The voice is not clear and on the very first day the product is not working. So I returned it back. But Amazon service is fabulous 👌."
4,Worth every penny.Phone calls - 9.5/10Music - 8/10 ( bass is just fine )
1,I re-ordered product as first product that I received stop charging in 5 days. Then I placed request for replacement  and second product that I received has very weak wire that broke down during fair usage.  Cheap and very useless product.There is no rating for quality. I would have given zero star. Pls don't buy this product ever.
5,"posting this review after 2 weeks of daily usagethis headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels), battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned up to 12hrs on box.it takes 2-2:10hrs to fully charge.sound quality is excellent, very clear and loud, bass levels are great. tried it with many different devices like laptop,pc, smart tv and mobile, sounds great on every devices specially it sounds more better on mid end and high end devices.calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice but still not that worse experiencebuild quality is great, has soft touch plastic finish on outer side. perfectly fits on every as size is fully adjustable.one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy your music without any interruption.overall this headphone is best buy for money. if anyone need a great big size headphone at this price then i will definitely recommend this"
1,Please avoid buying this product. I brought today not even used for 1 hrs not satisfied1. Call Hearing is not clear /Unable to hear other person2. Hearing songs is good but no bass at all3. Bluetooth connectivity takes time to connect
3,"These are about average headphones. The build quality is ok.I did not quite measure the battery backup time, but it usually lasts me for a couple of days with intermittent use for music and youtube videos.The headphones work well with the aux cable.There is a distinct lag when watching videos with the headphones in Bluetooth mode.The sound is clear and balanced. Bass is not heavily boosted.The microphone is not quite effective for calls. The people who I spoke to on phone, using these headphones, gave feedback that my voice was very low and with some distortion.The earmuffs are ok, but I would have preferred them to be a bit larger. They did not cover my ears completely, so I found the earphones somewhat uncomfortable after an hour and half of continuous use."
3,"Build quality looks below average, the aux & charging cable provided with the headphones are of poor quality. Sound is just okay and bluetooth works just fine.I dont think they are gonna last very long. I'm not even sure if they are worth ₹700."
1,Sound quality not upto the mark. No balance between vocal and bass. Feels like Noisy audio.Bluetooth mode have lag when playing games(not in milliseconds it produces 2 sec lag).Lag doesn't comes when aux is connected.Mic doesn't work when Aux cable connected. They should have provided aux cable with mic.This design gives more pain to ear. Ear can touch inside parts and it irritates. Cushions not good or big enough to give space between ear and headphones.Once you connected via bluetooth no way to unpair from the headphone. You must turn off bluetooth on mobile/pc inorder to connect another device within the range.So Finally I returned this product.
1,it is so hard on ears and after 5 to 10 minutes you will feel the pain irrespective of your head size.
5,"Awesome product in under 1k, too loud to handle as I like to listen on lower side of the volume for the benefit of my ears and hearing ability in the long run, good connectivity, great battery life, need to charge it only after 4-5 days when I m using it 2-3 a day, nice padding around the earpices as they cover up entilre earand sit on the skull so no pressure on the earlobe even if used for longer time, the best part is that there is no it hing or discomfort because of the sound.The bass and volume is very good, at full volume, you can use it as a speaker if you wish, just the volume buttons are reverse than one expects, the lower one is at the top and the higher one is at the bottom of the buttons.Picking a call is tricky, because it blares at full volume which is too loud for the ears, its like an explosion; makers should do something to keep it at medium or last set level for receiving calls."
5,I ordered it for my kid. It's has all features required for its education. It has a good sound quality. Very easy to connect. It's battery backup is also really good. Came with an aux cable to an additional thing very helpful in case no battery.
1,"Sound good but very low ,pathetic for calling hoens sound every 3 sec . Only for listning music not for calling purpose."
5,Very very nice productBest in class sound quality battery backupBassCan be used with aux if battery drains Value for money. You can't get anything better than this. Period.I think best headphone in this price so go for it😎I am so happy
1,"- Power button got stuck inside. Could not operate.- Adjustable band was just too tight and was not working, was scared while pulling/pushing that it might break.- Volume-up/Volume-down/Play-Pause buttons did not work.- Mic did not work, other was person was barely able to hear with lot of noise.- Over the ear/head it was just too tight/heavy.- Because of above problems, requested for replacement. But, replacement sent by seller was used product in used box with missing aux cable and usb cable. Box was cello-taped (original packaging was missing). Amazon packing was also broken/tampered with.- Had to request for replacement/order cancellation.- Delivery person was kind enough to accept return. And, Amazon was kind enough to consider case and issue refund.- Overall good experience with Amazon & Delivery person. But, product was not good quality (although it was listed as best seller) and seller did not do good thing in sending used product as replacement."
1,Recieved a damaged piece. First it shows 90% battery then 40 in 5 minutes. One side works well another side is not working properly. After 2 hrs Bluetooth connectivity has been stopped working. Aux cable is working but one ear only . Hope they send me another good one after returning this .
1,"Worst product that I bought from amazon.It was very tight and you could only use it for a minute and the product only last for 2 days .It was very bad experience for me from the Ptron customer service.But amazin saved me,they took the product and gave me revund via cheque ,thanks amazon.Do not buy this product and waste your money.It is the only product that I returned to amazon.So I recommend you not to buy it.If you need a good experience please buy any other products.The sound quality is also average."
3,"ProsLight weightSnug fit, over the ears, comfortableGood bluetooth range, 30 feet.BT connects immediatelyClear audioAffordable, comes with Aux cable which is a plus as compared to other headsets.ConsNo Bass, not for music lovers, songs sound very flatBT disconnects during callsIf you wear spectacles, then the snug fit presses the specs into the head and causes painEars heat up if used for >20 mins, causes discomfortNo noise cancellation, you can hear everything going on around you unless you keep volume very high. I prefer low volume.The ear muff material is light weight but flimsy, dont expect it to last very long.Overall, a decent headset."
1,The aux cable stopped working after one month. The volume decrease button stopped working after 2 months. Please stay away from this product. Seems that an old stock is being pushed now.
5,This Wireless Bluetooth Headphones has High bass which delivers each n every music details crystal clear. It is super comfortable to wear and stay on the head while I am working out in the gym. I am super impressed with this headphone performance and i will recommend for music lovers
3,"Buttons shown in the pic didn't work, so replaced the headphones, but to utter dismay one button on the new headphones does not work.Sound is okay, don't expect miracles at a cost of Rs 699.Packing was very shabby, a brown cardboard wrapped around the original paper box. No bubble wrap or plastic envelope like you get on other Amazon orders."
4,"Look - GoodBuild quality - OkBattery - ExcellentBass - Can hear bass all over track, but can't feel the punch of base. Not bad bass like BOAT device. Not good as SONY.Sound clarity - Due to all along bass, vocals and instrument sound suppressed a little, like BOAT headset.Sound quality - Good for BOAT lover, Bad for JBL/SONY loverFitting - For 30 min its ok , after that feel little discomfortSound quality become better when connected with aux cable."
5,"Like the rock-solid Bluetooth Connectivity - my previous Sony Earbuds needed to be paired again after every hour or so, but the pTron stays connected as long as it is left paired!Decent Sound Quality, especially with Bass Boost and 3D Sound on in Windows 10 - there is nothing on the Headphones for all this...Quick to recharge as well - no hassles there, except maybe that the Red Charging light is so tiny, one has to look squint-eyed to check if it is on, even in a completely dark room! 😂If you have small ears, this Over the ears Headphones will suit you well. If you have larger ears like I do, you will do well to let your ears out free, from time to time!Bottom line - for the money you pay, it is an excellent buy!"
5,"First of all lets talk about its quality it is quite good and they are very comfortable to wear we can wear these headphones nonstop for hours and simply enjoy the music, movies or Webseries thanks to the foam padding on ear cups.I am impressed by its battery backup we can listen music  for 12hrs non stop without any disturbance it is good to take these headphones with you on a long journey. I purchased this product for listening bass boosted workout music while performing exercise if you are doing exercise from long time and lack motivation while workout i recommend you these headphones because i found its sound quality amazing it has similar specifications to those products who are very much expensive so if you are looking for headphones which consist of good specifications at a reasonable price then go for this product"
2,"Edit: Just want to verify, I got a new one today, but the design looks different, and even the sound quality differs, as compared to the previous one. The previous one had a thunderbolt through the o of the ptron logo. I hope this is genuine, right? Btw. The previous version was much better... the highs were perfectly balanced. It was crisp and nice. But the new ones have muddled bass and not so clear treble. Greatly Disappointed."
4,Over all good product in my case it stopped working from one side within 4-5 days but replacement done by Amazon is really appreciated within a day now new one working fine but I didn't like the beats as compared with sony of boat but in this prise it's good deal
5,"I used many types of headphones i am not satisfied anyone and I purchased this after seeing its features. I would like to share my experience here, I am fully happy with this pTron headphone.In the box, there is a headphone, charger cable, headphone-mobile plug wire, and manual. As the described the product comes the same. This headphone has high quality bass and sound effects.pTron Studio wireless over-the-ear closed-back headphones are known for their comfort as well as their sound quality. Worth for money."
4,"Writing the review after 1 week usePros:1.Nice bass2.Light weight3.Battery life is top notch. I continuesly played song on repeat and it played for whole 24 hours straight.4. Bluetooth connectivity is good.but gets problem when you are in another room.5.Noice cancellation is best...I can barely hear anyone even on 20% volumeCons:1. If you are a sweaty person then your ears will get sweaty while wearing.2. The adjustment functionality got loose in 2 days only. But as my head is big I Ignored it. Thats why Igave 4 stars otherwise it is a 5 star product.3. Aux cable is cheap.I have to buy new one in future.Conclusion:If you are having low budget but want to buy good quality headphones,then this is the best buy in the market.Dont waste your hard earned money in so called branded headphones.They eventually give the same sound experience as this one.(I Had one Sony headphone sometimes back)"
5,"Best product at this price...I am using it from last 3weeks, the sound system is awesome.The bass and treble which is at par than expected.Also the look is beautiful.Overall i think its the best headphones at this price range."
5,Writing this review after using the headphones for 7 days.Headphone material is very good and the headrest padding is soft and gives comfort for using it for a long duration. The ear cushions are very soft and fits properly on the ear i.e covers complete ear and reduces external noise. The ear cushions allows to wear the headphones for long duration without causing pain to ears.Sound quality has been superb with crystal clear audio quality and covers every minute  sounds/instrumental sound. The bass quality is simply amazing 😍😍.Bluetooth connectivity has been good and no issues while connecting with different devices.Battery life is exceptional..... I have been using it on daily basis for 2-3 hours and it has 80% charging even after using for 7 days. Standby battery consumption is very low.The Aux mode doesn't gives the same experience what it provides on the bluetooth mode but worth the experience.Simply amazing and worth the money 😍
5,"First, I was mainly purchasing these headphones for the wireless and battery features. What I received was a great quality sound, and greater battery life than stated.Pros:- Battery Life - This was one of the biggest reasons for purchasing these headphones. I was looking for a set of headphones that would last longer than 4-6 hours and stumbled across these. I run the headphones for ~6-7hrs a day for four days. On the fifth day, I run the headphones until they turn off on their own. This normally happens around noon. This gives me a battery life of about 28-32 hours, beyond the stated 25 hours.- Great Design – I fell in love with headphone, from the time I set my eyes on it. It is stunning looking and great design.- Sound Quality - The old headphones I was replacing with these were kind of tinny in sound quality. These headphones have really rich deep bass. I was extremely pleased with the sound."
5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
4,Sound quality is awesomeBluetooth if we keep the phone far say away from your body and listen to music there is no issues..  When u walk the Bluetooth kinda stops frequently..  But will start playing again after one or 2 seconds..  It has FM..  Good headset for this price range...  Charge is awesome..  If u fully charge it..  It lasts for 6 to 8 hours continuous play...  After that u can use the auction cable. ..
1,"😔 Great disappointment! After reading positive reviews, i got impressed and placed an order on 06.10.2020 and received he headset on 09.10.2020 and i paid Rs.899/-The headset is not getting charged and the charger provided is getting alarmingly overheated within a minute.  I am highly disappointed.  However i thought aux cable is there. But what a surprise... when aux cable is connected, only one ear is working.. 😔I want to return"
4,The headphone looks classyGood strong material unlike my last LEAF headphone very cheap materialFast bluetooth connectivityButtons are well workingSound quality also Good and bass surrounding is really good except one problem the sound is lil low frequency i always have to use full volume to Feel the musicBattery life also going well
1,"Not satisfied with quality.1st of all the ear cushion and head support are made of reggine so in 2 minutes you start feel sweaty and in 10 minutes it start irritating. Even in AC.Sound is poor and noice cancellation is okay.Also bluetooth has issue as it reset volume to highest after every call.I am Using patron in ear bluetooth devices 3 pieces, they are good. Not this one, its waste of money."
5,"It's one of the best overall performer amoungst all Bluetooth headphone according to me. I have many headphone and I love using different headphones. This headphone is superb because of following reasons,- Sound quality along with bass is very clear and amazing. Treble, Voice are good too- Material used is of good quality- Battery life is much longer. So I can listen extra music- Range of the earphone is quiet good compared to other Bluetooth headphones- Earphone is having in-built mic and the control buttons because of which it makes me easy to receive calls or change the music.- Excellent sound performance with clear high sound- Great Design which makes headphone more stylish- Reduces external noise- One of the best earphones in the price range- Overall it is value for money."
1,wireless stops after 10-15 minutes. I agree that if it is idle it can stop/disconnect. But in my case I was having conference call of more than 1 hour. In that it started disconnecting after 5-10 minutes. I thougt may be some issue with me. Again it happened in the middle of the call.So it it is either the defective piece or the product is not good.
4,"Bluetooth connectivity is not that strong, while moving around in outdoors, but in indoors , its quite good. connection is stable. i am using in my desktop pc by using TP-Link USB Bluetooth Adapter, its works fine, no latency issue while watching YouTube. Only while gaming pc, sound via Bluetooth does not work, so i purchased 2male to 1 female  headphone splitter cable and 3.5mm male to male aux cable to solve this issue. Only thing to to complain the soft cushion cover arround the ear is not that good quality, it will come out slowly very fast, even with deliciated use. Since its only 800 bucks, its hard to complain."
5,It's awesomeIn 899 it's superb actuallyNoise cancellation is also at high levelGive superb bass as wellNoise is clear as crystals soundsBattery life is almost enough for a dayWhen comes to comfortableAlmost after using it  for 4/5 hoursI didn't feel now I have to take it offBecuz it's light in weightAnd give awesome comfort when we are Using it
1,"I have ordered as per Ptron said to avail warranty of my previous ptron product.Ptrons says that we should buy something priced equal or more than for which we want to claim warranty and they will process the refund once we receive the new product.So this way, Ptron is increasing it's sell.Otherwise the quality of headphones in this price range is far better in OTHER BRANDS.Ptron is using CHEAPEST MATERIAL to build product which would not even last till it's warranty and would ask customer to buy new product which means that Sales would go high and also they could show to their investors that How much Customers trust Ptron that they buy products regularly.Also, Ptron customer care doesnt read the Email thread properly and reply based on their presumptions.Ptron Customer Care never works on phone call. They will provide a Number which is never gonna connect your call to the customer care.I have It's been a month since I have submitted warranty claim for my previous product and still they have not even acknowledged that they would be making refund"
1,"I bought this product for good sound, but one side speaker turned out to be defective. The replacement speaker also turned out to be defective. The first one was getting lighter sound from the speaker, but one of the replacement speakers was coming from the same sound. Do not get caught in the cheap, but it is best to take expensive to take. This is nothing in front of the boat."
5,"The product is just amazing!! It comes in a good packaging, has a great colour and I love it💙. This 🎧 can be connected to any bluetooth device. It can remain charged for a very long duration. The ear cushions provides a comfy experience. The sound quality is superb. It's noice cancellation allows u to just concentrate and feel the music. It's worth the price I paid. This 🎧 is completely light weight. It also has an information manual and a 1 year warranty card. This product is a Must have!!"
3,Product is good but Warranty support not hassel free by ptron.  They ask for courier the product to Telangana for services.  Its take too much time n metal harrassment for customers.  Telephonic customer care is wasted of time. Waiting times too much n then phone cut.And no support from amazon also.Very poor after sale service.
5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box.

4,Very nice sound quality nd good bass ..nd bass quality nd sound not harmful to hearing ...Very nice 👍👍
1,"On very first time after connect with my phone one Right side speaker are not working.Very bed product,Package are broken from inside.Please don't buy cheap items, buy at least modarate items. After reviewing all comments. Don't impress by Hrithik,Go with product quality."
3,"No return option available, placed for replacement.1. Received the product at 12:30pm,tried to turn on but it seems the battery was drained out so put it on charging using cable and power bank.2. Once plugged in, a small red light glows indicating charging process and in 1 hour that turns to blue to show complete of charge.3. At 3:15pm paired it with my phone and started playing PUBG mobile, Bass seems to be high and conversations are audible but not excellent.4. At 3:40pm I start getting ""Battery Low"" announcement during the game and headset shuts down by 3:45pm.5. Kept it for Charge again which took from 4:00pm to 5:00pm to turn blue again.6. At 6:15pm turned on headset and paired it to Phone and started playing songs on Wynk.7. Bass is good and dominated the song while FM is not good based on poor signal reception quality.8. At 6:45pm the battery low notice starts again and shuts down in 2 minutes.Received the replacement, kept the headphones on charge for 1 hour, played songs continuosly for 1 hour battery still shows 70% available. Audio is better than last one(lesser bass). However when connected with Aux cable only one side of headset is audible seems like problem with Aux cable however I can get used to this, Still not totally satisfaction but good buy at rs700-800 price mark."
4,"Good headphone at this price bass is more,moderate and  comfort. Bought at rs.820.Mic issue when on Bluetooth mode."
3,These are my honest review of the Bluetooth headphone after using it for two weeksLet me divide into two categories likes and dislikesNumber 1 likes:-1. The sound quality is average . Bass is moderate overall average in this price category.2. The play pause volume up down button are working fine.3. Battery back up is decent.4. Bluetooth range is good.Dislikes1.You can't use it's for longer period your ears starts to hurt after an hour of usages.2.Takes long to charge.3. Many times there is disturbence in the music while listening as if the Bluetooth connection is getting disconnected and connected automatically.But at this price point it's an average product .
1,"Too bad quality of these headphones. I never think that Zebronics music product quality is like this. I have a Zebronics bluetooth Home theater speaker, only bcz of that quality of speaker I bought the zebronics bluetooth headphone. But this is the poorest quality, also these are too light weight, and the AUX cable is so light. It is like that at any time it can be damaged.I request to all the people plz plz if you are thinking to buy this item,then plz forget this. If you are interested to waste your money then yess you can buy this.But according to me and my family, this is only and only wasting of money."
5,"Had always known Zebronics to provide quality speakers at fractions of cost of others, and this headset didn't disappoint either. Fits well, looks neat, and sound quality is great and seems well balanced among low-mid-high spectrum. Pleasure to use!"
4,"I purchased Zebronics Zeb-Thunder Wireless Blue Tooth Headphone in March this year from Amazon and delivered to me just 2-3 days before complete lockdown.What it OffersObviously over the ear headphoneIt's Bluetooth and so not wiredIt has a built-in FM Radio (See Con Points)Provision for SD Card to load SongsHands-free phone conversationOperates by a battery and it can be charged via  USB for which USB connector is supplied with the Gadget. Only connector no charger, please.It has a surprising and unique feature that no other Bluetooth headphone offers. It is having provision to connect to a phone or any other music source by wire and the wire is supplied with the gadget besides the charging USB connector. This helps us to continue to listen to music even when the Headphone battery needs a recharge.PROS:Excellent and superb audio quality and plenty of bass and sound which can be adjusted to your liking.Good Design aesthetically made and quite appealing to the eye.Good battery life even when not in use for days togetherBest price and easy on the pocket. Surprisingly priced very low at Rs. 772 from Amazon and it's being shown at Rs. 840- today when I checked just now (10th July 2020).CONS:FM Radio Khas Nahi hai. Its like, Is it available? Yes, available type.I could not tune it to all 10 stations that are available in Hyderabad. Normally, when we opt for FM radio,  one of the stations can be listened to, and to get another station, we need lots of patience. Instead, we can as well switch on FM radio on our phone and get it via blue tooth in the headphones.The FM Stations' reception is very poor and always with the FM noise in the background.Although the Head Phone looks wonderfully giving a very expensive look, I am afraid it may not withstand rough use. No complaints on this count so far in the last 3 months.I load my favorite instrumentals to enjoy crystal clear superb quality audio during my morning walk. I am charging it once a week. When it is paired with your phone, the percentage of charge shows in the Bluetooth interface of the phone. So accordingly, we can decide when to charge.Overall, I give 4 stars out of 5(Because of FM Radio 5th star not given) and recommend for those who keep their electronic gadgets out of the reach of children and use them gently and of course who love music with good quality audio."
5,It's amazing with high bass clear sound quality it's totally ossum
5,Like the product as described by the company. The best part is that they are comfortable. I wear them for atleast 3 hours straight sometimes but the don't hurt. AUX cable option is great when the batteries are drained.
5,"Wow! This product is just really amazing ❤️. I loved it's sound . It has a feature of extra bass. The most liked feature by me is that it has aux as well as bluetooth. I loved it ❤️. Of someone sees my review . I will recommend you to buy this product. It's amazing 👌. If some gamer is seeing this, so I will recommend you to use this product for gaming. It feels like you are in the game when you play any game wearing it. At the end I will only say that I really really really love this product 😍!"
5,"Very Good Product Budget For A Good Affordable Price And Sound Extreme Level As Mobile and PC Computer Good Bass level and Sound Quality.Not displayed battery level in Mobile,Only shown Bluetooth icon,Ear muffs also very good to wear comfort..Overall i satisfy..."
1,"frequent disconnection in charging. The red light gets on for some time while charging and the gets off. Again i take out the charger and insert it. Again the same thing happens over and over again.Sound quality is good, no complainBut charging difficulty is coming very much."
1,Too bad sound quality.no bass sound. Very worst product performance.
1,Pathetic I want to return this product but I am not able to as there is no option of return just I can replace.I really don't like the built up quality.Sound quality is also not good.Battery is also not upto the mark after full charge it works only 1:30 hrs.I need money backInfact the box is also damaged and the package came to me was also not packed properly it was also damagedThe product was full of dust as if it feels like it is used product.I have ordered a fresh product it feels like it is used and full of dust
1,I just ordered this product because of good reviews but trust me it's not at all good when it arrived at my place first time its mic was not working properly so I replaced it and the second time when it was delivered it was broken then again when I try to replace it Amazon give me the option for refund so thanks to Amazon for refund.Advice:- Not to buy this product because of cheap rates go for wired headphones at this price they are more good than this product.
5,"The battery lasts a very long time. After a full day's work, battery is at 70% for me. I guess it could last 3 work days if I didn't recharge it daily very light weight no issues with ear pain  cushion is so soft comfort this many features not available Rupees 6000 branded headphones now a days can’t say more about this product no issues at all g productIf you're an audiophile, or you care about the sound quality, all these headphones are mediocre. They are tuned to the taste of the average consumer - there's a lot of bass andSo far these work great! I'm still concerned about the durability, but I'll also only be using these guys for walks and runs around the city for the foreseeable future. Hopefully, that mitigates the risk of damage."
5,"1) micro SD card option of music is the best option to hear it without laptop.2) Battery backup is awesomely good and i use this headphone almost half day nonstop or more but no need to worry for battery level.3)10-12 feet distance no disturbance,4) AUX wire quality is low but working properly.5) material used is feels like of low quality plastic so no idea how long it will run.6) overall i am happy for this product as more than expected good sound quality i got.7) must buy item."
5,This product give its 💯 many of saying bad battery life but that is not true ihave use this headphones for last 4hours and its 50% Now  so it is nice produce nice quality evwn its ear cushion are also perfect if u want many fearures under 1000 then it is a perfect its connect with bluetooth very easily its is comfartable one of its disapointing this is light plastic use it can break if u dont care of it thanks
5,Product is very cost worthy but the delivery service is very bad....the delivery boy came to my gate shout like a freak and left the box outside gate without making any call.... its slight rain outside and the box was kept outside and delivery boy just ran away... I know one should follow the social distancing in this pandemic period but there is a civilized ways to deliver electronic products especially when there is rain outside.... I have no words to describe the such pathetic way of delivery service.... product is nice but highly disappointed by the Amazon delivery service...
1,Pls Don't buy this Zebratronic Thunder  Bluetooth is not getting connected and if at all after much deficultly Disconnects often.  Searching for a service Center and getting it repaired is very deficult since I live in a small town i have to go to a city some 423Km away.  Pls DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT you are throwing your hard earned money in garbage if you go for it.
5,"I thought it's going to be a light orange but i received a deep red which make.me very happy cause my fav color is red. Ok about the sound stereo windinf id really good, bass are really good but not the best. And it cancel noise really good  perfect for listening music or story without disturbing from around sound. And about bluetooth connect really well backup last longer than i expexted really happy but i don't know how long will that be im talking about the battery backup and one last thing we still can connect with audio jack 3.5 that really helpful if the battery backup out ang specially good for gamer. Almost forget we can control the volume, play pause, next and previous directly from the headphone which is really helpful. I will update about the battery backup later and dont forget u can charge it using mobile charger i.e micro cable charger. U will get the micro cable with this headphone free."
5,It's battery 🔋 Life is Just exellent it has loud speakers 🔊 that's why you not need to raise volume over 50% and at this volume it easily last 4 days at 2.5-5 hrs of usage...Connectivity is also good you just press power button for 2 second and it starts then it's blue light blinks till it's not connected ...start bluetooth then once you connect manually fron secound time it will connect in less than 30 second...Bass is not too great but very good and clear sound quality at this price point...And what I feel best is supported memory card and also have very DURABLE BUILD QUALITY..... And of course good battery 🔋 Life...You can buy if your budget is around 600...I got it for 600 rs in sale
1,"I got this product today. After much anticipation and offer by Amazon, I opened the box and connected it to my android using blue tooth connectivity. Sound is awesome, connected quickly checked with the device volume option, it worked fine. When I wanted to check the volume option from the headphones, I found that the volume down was broken. I changed to FM mode, it did quickly after pressing the play/pause button for a few seconds...I found that the volume was decreasing automatically.... I found that the volume down button is stuck and is pressing the volume on it's own."
5,"I know there are many bad reviews on this product but this is fantastick.I love listning songs on this and it works great awsm cooolllll and fantstick.Go for it.Don't wait just buy it now. No need to read more reviews just go for this.Go.........It's mic quality is just awsm and stunning.I love its bass.Thank you seller, zebronis and amazon to give me such a great product.It's battery life is just awsm..........."
5,"Pros:Excellent built-in quality.Bass quality is superb.SD card support.Over 8 1/2 hours of battery back.Useful while jogging, walking etc.Comfortable for hearing.Cons:Time delation.Not that good for gaming.  Totally, go for it."
5,Used it for 3 weeks and now I am writting this review. Sound quality and bass is good at this price range. Battery life is enough for a day. Wired connection can also be used if the battery is drained. The sd card slot works well. Volume controlls are nice. Noise cancellation is satisfactory.
5,"All-rounder like Kapil Dev 😁Bluetooth, superb bass, volume control, provision for direct non Bluetooth connect, can play music independent off any other device from a micro SD card , FM radio,Comfortable to wear and audio is excellent.Only thing lacking is provision of a mic to equalise music and conversation.But, I can live with that deficiency."
5,I got this Zebronics Thunder for Rs.599 which I would say is an amazing deal and like any other headphone it does has some pro's & consPro's :• It's really damn cheap 599/- as compared to other wireless headphones.• The packaging was great.• Battery back up us preety good 9hrs/per charge and it takes around 2.5 hrs to get it fully charged.• The ear cups would you a comfory experience.• The sound quality is pretty good if you listen to songs from Spotify but it lacks lil bass as per me while playing YouTube videos.Con's :• The build quality seem to be delicate so need to be little extra careful.  Over all I will rate it 4.2/5.
5,This product is great for this price go using this for 4-5 months now and just works amazing. Bluetooth connectivity is so strong that i can leave my mobile device connected with this headphones at a corner of room and walk around whole house waring these without any issues ( connectivity can easily penetrate 2-3 walls). Don't over charge it 2.5 hours is max. It works perfectly fine otherwise. Most beautiful part it is that it's over ear and soft and comfortable.
5,Best quality product from zebronicsPremium quality......Bass is good listen joker song on YouTube full for bass experience..Only drawback is FM radio range is not so goodBut working fine ☺️😊😀Highly recommended by me.
5,"Wow!. Its amazing guys 😍😍😍. Build quality is decent, but the sound quality is Awesome. Deep bass and crystal clear sound. You can hear the each of the instrumental sound in songs. If you are a normal user. Then it is the best choice. But if you are looking for a headphone for gaming, then its not recommended. Because there is some delay in game, while it's connected with blutooth. But if you compromise wireless mode and play games by connecting the 3.5 mm cable, given inside the box. Then you can go for it. Battery backup is also very good 😍"
5,"This headphone is one of the best headphones I have ever used (in this price segment). Sound clarity and quality is awesome. Bass is moving, and the equalization has been done really good. The best part is the battery backup. It has an amazing battery backup. You can continuously use it for straight 24-28 hours without interruption. I'd recommend this headphone to anyone who wants it in the budget segment. Close your eyes, and go for it!"
5,Better quality sound and battery than expected. Charges very quick in about 30 mins and a playback time of 8-9 hours. Couldn't have got a better product at this price. Purchased for ₹700 in the Prime day sale.
5,"Yes good I will recommend it best in listening music , watching videos,mainly playing ping/ free fire best experience.yes it is best in low price for listening 🎧 online classes.it has both blutooth and wired both with same sound.it us better upto some what I'm noise cancellation while listening music.i kept charging for 3 hours It worked for 4 days(**note** only for online classes daily2hrs)so buy .I bought this item in 600(**best deal of the day**)offer."
5,At first I got a broken damaged product but then I replaced with this red one and I swear this is the best low cost headphones I have ever seen. I had used a lot of products but it has some special specialities...1. Wireless Headphone2. Price is only Rs 800 which comparatively very low to other in market3. Very comfortable to wear and cusions provide xtra comfort.4. It also runs in pc very well with both aux cable and Bluetooth.5. It has also a ad card slot6. It has an inbuilt F.MI am very satisfied. Thank You Amazon. Love You 💕
5,"Excellent product for personal use.Lightweight, good battery life, ergonomic, loud, clear, robust, looks trendy.What else do we need ? And all this for a mere ₹ 649 !!!I ordered it for the kids so that I don't mind if they break it, but it eventually ended in my work table due to its wonderful quality. Ordering one more for kids."
5,"This is one of the best headphones ever. Useful for students and people who listen to music. The feature of both wired and Bluetooth mode makes it even cooler! The FM mode works fine but not great. Requires a particular alignment of the headphones in order to receive the signal. But an overall awesome product. The battery backup is very good. The cushions are soft, do not make the ears sweaty, and no earaches. They are broad and fit well, making it comfortable to use."
5,"To begin with I will recommend this product to everyone. Seller is & Amazon is very good in service & Delivery. Product Quality with regard to material, finish is very good. Look wise it is sleek item. Sound is excellent. Controls are very easy. Its On/off & Call pick at side is what it makes it superior among the other headphone. In all a very very good product. One must opt for it. It is VALUE FOR MONEY. If you are looking for HeadPhone go for it."
5,AFTER 2 WEEKS OF DAILY 1-2 HR USEPROS:Sound quality is ear deafening... u can use it with 70-80% more than that u cant ..or u r crazy ...BASS 5/5I feel the price is affordable.5/5The wire are very durable 5/5(Wires with nylon outer cover as of i know )the buttons 5/5I use it as a daily driver in gym it wont come unless u take it out.Cons: After using it for 60-70 minutes you will feel slight discomfort due to the ear wing and  also you feel discomfort whiling  using it in while on a pillow in bed.( the ear hooks are detachable) it gives more comfort.but it is the best wired headset in the range and it is better than their own 225 headphones...i highly recommend it for people who need A good bass headphones
2,"I was looking for midrange earphones from quite sometime for my workouts and running .but this piece of earphone is upto my mark asIt is perfectly grip in my ears no fear of falling while running,Clear and metallic soundGood bass ,Look wise it is awesome.Braided wire means strengthAfter using it for few days there is change in sound pattern  so I returned it. And I'm changing my review from 5 stars to 2"
5,Loved this earphone its bass is out standing... build quality is great...if you're getting it for 449... Grab it. It's better than boat 225 and ant w56.. good for jogging. Design is not so Good but build quality is great. Get black color earphones. And cherry on top is it's has volume control buttons too... nobody gives volume control buttons in this price.
1,As they promised that the quality of wire is too good but it is not.. the wire got damaged with in very short time at the joint as shown in the pic. I cannot replace now not sure how to claim warranty. Can someone (Amazon) help me to get this replaced or repaired?I will mark it as 5 star if it is replaced.
4,"Excellent bass above 70% of volume. Sometime you will feel vibration of bass in 100% volume.😀Nice build quality.Ear tip fits well.You get this earphone, extra pair of eartip (small and large) and collor clip in the box. Neon green colour looks very nice.Didn't find any con after listening to 12-15 different genres songs, call quality is also good.Go for it in this price range (450-500).Though I received an open box but its not related to product quality. 1 less star for delivery and packing."
5,"This is a product review after using it for straight 2 hours since it just got delivered today.What an improvement firstly from the boat bassheads 225.Now, i dont know what the other negative reviews are about since i personally did not find any issue whatsoever with these infact i am delighted by it.If you are looking a for a good wired earphone and dont want to spend much then this would be the best budget earphone in the market right now.Firstly speaking of the body it is plastic and not metallic and so it has become lighter than the previous bassheads so much that after using it for 2 straight hours i almost forgot i had them put on. I just felt the wire could have been a bit thicker but dont forget the wire is braided and coated with a rubber like material which should resolve that dilemma.These come with ear hooks which to my surprise were so comfortable. I usually hate ear hooks cause they hurt after a while but these are just so soft and fit right in.Moving on the main purpose and the bigger question ""BASS"".I would say it's perfect.The sound quality is so very crisp and clear.BASS is in the right spot and according to me you dont need anymore.You may hear from other reviewers the BASS is not as good as the previous bassheads please understand it depends on what kind of music you listen and mostly the KBPS which is kilo bits per second. The higher the kbps the better the sound including bass and treble.The loudness is great almost deafening at the highest volume.To check noise cancellation (although these earphones dont say noise cancellation) I made a few phone calls and asked if they heard any background noise and they said they could hear little to nothing of whats happening in the background. Now ofcourse this is in a normal environment and may not cancel the traffic sounds or a loud background noise.The added advantage is the IPX4 sweat and water resistance (you dont find this feature in most wired earphones atleast not in this price range) which is great specially when you work out or when you are jogging or talking a walk. Although since it is wired you will find discomfort and so may want to get wireless bluetooth earphones instead.So heres how i would rate it on a scale of 1 - 5, 5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest.Price: 5Build Quality: 4.5 ( Only cause i think the wire could have been a little thicker)Loudness: 5Call Quality: 5Bass: 5 (The bass is just perfect if any more bass than this you'd better be putting your ears on a  loudspeaker).Hope this clarifies your doubts about this product.All in all yet another great product from BOAT and you wont regret the purchase."
5,"This is the true earphone to connect you to nirvana not for longer times because it starts pain in ear after a long time continuous use.Bass- in the price of 450, bass is terrible. You will get powerful bass than you expect.Sound- if a headphone has poor sound, it is not a headphone. But this one has the sound that will blow your mind totally.Noice cancellation- in the price range of 400-500 no brand will give you perfect noice cancellation headphones, but in boat bassheads, there is noice cancellation but not so good.Overall- if you have 500 rs. And you are searching for beast headphone in you budget and if you are reading reviews, and if you are reading this one, i am telling you go for it without hesitation beacuse after a long research on 2 shopping sites i found thi product best in my price range.(i bouggt it for 450)."
5,"If you want durable earphone, protected from sweat, water. Go for this.Build quality: Very good form factor, braided cable with waterproof coating. Eartips are comfortable and fits nicely, looks durable.Sound: Boat earphone, hence Bass rich, treble and mids could have been better (as I listen music in studio monitors, so I felt, not a big issue)Downsides: Wire seems very durable, but not too thick. Could've been thicker. Extra eartips only 2 small and 2 mediums. Couldve been provided more.Overall you can surely take this if you badly need waterproofing and durability, otherwise 225/152/162 has slightly better sound. But this has volume control keys, thats a plus point."
3,"Just overdid it on the bass. There is virtually no treble. The singers voice just gets muted. Good for pew pew Hindi, pop, hip-hop type songs. I guess that's why they are sold in India. Not for metalheads! Also the eargrips are uncomfortable after long use. Needless addition. Durability I will comment a few months later. But for the price can't complain. It's no Bose."
1,It is second day of my usage. I went for run with this ear phones. They claim to be sweat proof but after 2 minutes of run my mic and volume button are giving false signals. Automatically music gets change and volume goes to zero all of sudden. I think this is because of sweat and mic is mis-operating.I think we should not call earphones sweat protection if any of the system is friendly for sweat. completely disappointed with product.
1,"I purchased this boat hadset, initially it was working excellent but after 2 months, I don't know whether it's a design issues or might be other problem, I contacted service center of boat. They denied to replace my headphone, staff said me that it's a special cricketer editon so I need to complain via online from the boat website and I registered a complete raised ticket but still now no reply. Poor service. till date no reply from  BOAT. kindly think before buying boat products."
5,"Best for me. If you fall in the middle category, where you don't want the best of the best earphones but also don't want the worst, go for this.Earbuds don't fall from my ears! My ears are kind of weird. Like Amir Khan (lol). (I have had a bad past with regards to this with my previous earphones).Bass is gooood. Sound clarity is also good. Some experts may say the vocal clarity is overshadowed by the bass, but I am okay with that.The clip is very useful in preventing the earbuds from falling. I clip it on my collar.The cable strength is also good. The cable got pulled twice by accident, and nothing happened to the earphones.The mic is also good. I use these earphones to listen to music, watch YouTube, calling, send and listen to voice notes, etc.Best. Cheers!Don't think too much :)"
1,"Before these earphones, I used the basic Samsung earphones which were 5 years old.And I am writing this review after 3 days of usage,daily for 3-4 hours.Pros:  1- Crystal clear & loud sound.  5/52- Amazing bass.  5/53-Call quality is fine. 4/54- The wires are braided which make them more durable.  5/5One of the most amazing features is that you get sound control buttons in this earphones which work as a charm.Cons :1- After continuous use for 45-60 mins, they cause pain in ears.2- They are MADE IN CHINA.  I didn't know it before.Edit: After daily usage of almost 1 week, the right earplug is not working properly and they are causing hell lot of pain and itchiness on the ear.I am reducing the rating from 4 stars to 1. Also I have applied for replacement.I really wish, somehow refund would be possible, as I don't want to waste 500 Rs."
1,Worst sound. It's like someone is poking you with a needle in your ears. Great design but no use. Got ear pain within two days of using this. Sharp painful sound at higher volumes. Somehow managing with low volumes. Bad bass. Worthless.
3,"Okay, some people may differ but in my opinion the bass is too much. So much that it overpowers all the other aspects of the song. If you're into EDM where it's basically bass and.... just bass, then I guess it's a good fit. But if you want to hear other genre of music, then I would advise not to buy this product. The bass is just painful and I had to return the product and buy Sennheiser CX180 instead. It's too good for the price range."
2,"bass is better than boat 225, sennheiser cx180, sennheiser cx213 and sony mdr EX15AP. also tangle free, at this price of 549, it is worth of money.drawback is your you cant use this product for long time........"
1,by look and sound it was goodBut it has a very poor quality of wire which has been a problem of BOat.This is my 3rd boat earphone which one side is stopped working... replacement earphone quality is also of same quality usually lasts for 1-2 months only.it has zero noise cancellation dont think about taking calls using it
4,"Great product...Great sound ....And got it on deal price 449...In this price, they give volume control with great sound quality. ....must buy product"
3,"One side of these ear plugs stopped working within 3 weeks. The number that was written/given for the warranty related issues is not correct. No other way to contact the seller....Hope they will react now after seeing  my review.... Otherwise good product, only if it worked properly for some time."
3,"In this price range it's the best option. If you have higher budget it's not the best. The problems I faced are high bass at higher volume levels, destroying the song... Recommend listening at 65 to 75 for best results (pretty good clarity at this level). Next is usage time after like 1to 2 hours, ears start to pain and becomes uncomfortable.Pro's1. Best fit, it will not fall out.2. HD sound at approx 70 percent volume.3. Mic is good not the best. Manageable at this price range4. Noise cancellation good blocks 90 percent of the backround noise.Overall best in its price range. Don't expect much, you see it's not a Bose."
5,"Earler ive used jbl, philips, sony and mi earphones. But this stands top of all.  And i personally call it baap of all in this price segment.  Even 1500 segment of jbl and sanheiser.  The moment i plugged in these earphones and played muqabla.. I just stood up from my chair.... As well as all my hair on hands.. What else i can say... Just go for it.. Please dont search for anything else and waste your time.  Ive done a lot of review. Sent back few earphones coz of some problem.  But this is all rounder."
1,"My second Boat earphone is also stop working within three months. What is this, and there is no response from your side regarding my first earphone replacement from many days (ticket no. 1154217)You guys are not responsing about my complain, is this way to deal with your costumers. Your call center is not picking up call. You give warranty of your product and when I claim for warranty you stop responding me. I bought two earphones and both are not working.  bad product.... After three months of use it will show different types problems.. And there is no response from company when you go for warranty. I have two same earphones and within 3 months both are not working."
1,"Very flimsy! Not meant for runners, sports or even walking for that matter.The wiring inside the mic assembly where other buttons like volume controls are placed was shorting causing volume commands to be activated on slight movement of the cord around the mic module. Buy it if you still want to experiment and don't mind loosing your money. Keep the packaging for at least till the return window in case you buy it."
1,"Don't buy this model of Boat..It is useless, no sound quality, no bass..I really wonder how customers are giving wrong feedback..I have been using Boat products for almost 4 years now, but this one is a waste.. Don't buy this model of boat earphone.Aside, shame to the seller....he is sending used product...the package was opened and used.."
3,"The overall sound quality is good, this is a good sports earphone for the price, but you get another earphone that's far superior than these, at the same price. They are called Leaf Bolt.Leaf Bolt's sound quality and bass is far superior than Boat Bassheads 242. And I have worn them in showering rain multiple times and they have remained absolutely fine due to their water resistance tech. Go for Leaf Bolt instead if you want overall better experience and comfort as well. Or go for Realme Buds 2 or Boat Bassheads 225 if you are obsessed with earth shattering bass for this price range."
3,"I was confused whether I should return or not.  I have done the sound test on this boat earphone and I compared with JBL. I tried to see the difference in the same music.  I am going to do sound test on Vivo earphones.  I tried to use both earphones on vivo s1 phone.Pros (why you should buy)1. Good bass(bass lover should like it)2. Awesome wire quality.  Tangle free, durable and beautiful.3. 1 year warranty4.You can remove the sports cap if you are not using for sportsCons(not to buy)1. Treble is 0. No treble.  Bass treble should have balance.  Sound quality decreased.  It looks someone is pressing the neck of the singer.2. There is no surround sound.  The earphones with surround sound gives pleasure.  The left music should play in left earphone and right in right earphone. It is lacking.3.if boat Will work on above two points.  This earphon will be awesome.4. The earphone is not comfortable for long time music.  You have to remove the cap.  The boat should release half earphones like apple and vivo. The earphone is comfort after removing cap."
4,"Before I start reviewing, let me tell you, this is my 5th boAt product. (4 boAt 225 and 1 boAt 242, boAt 100).Things I liked -1. The build quality. Doesn't look like one of those that you buy on road side.2. Economical, compared to those well established brands. But if you still like to show off JBL and Sennheiser etc, this isn't definitely for you.3. I don't understand bass (yeah, pronounce it as base :P) etc as I'm not musician but I like music. I don't find any difficulty or loss in the music that I want to hear.4. The soft ear buds make the listening experience very enjoyable.5. Doesn't get entangled6. Also, I must mention that, if there's any problem with the headphone and if it's within the warranty period, you can get it replaced easily by writing to - info@imaginemarketingindia.com.What I didn't like -1. Zero noise cancellation. If there's something going on in the background while you are speaking to someone, the person at the other end can hear every bit of that's going on in the background at your end.2. None of the headphones lasted more than 2 years. Each one of those had problem with the speakers or the mic.If you are not too savvy about big brands, I recommend, you give boAt a try and decide for yourself."
1,"Till now I never reviewed any negatives about the product.But this one is very worst product made by boat.sound quality is like 50/-rs street shop earphones .High sounds are like gun firing,bgm,etc is like watching movies on Kaarbon 2000r phone speakersThis is worstFrom past 3years am buying boat earphone and headphones all that was worth for more than that price But this 242 is not even worth for 50rsI don't know whether it's boat product or clone product"
1,Warranty of this product is not useful after buying this product 3-4 months later in one side and Mic not working after dead I made in warranty ticket then they picked off from my phone and deliver to the Mumbai head head office of boat service centre and then while I checking the status of my ticket then it is written that replacement product issued now it's been one month over and I didn't get my product so their service is very bad don't buy these products otherwise the product quality is very good but their service is very very poor
1,"Product is good. Sound is good. In short this is nice product. But as u now can see on the pictures this happened with me with this product. One side of earplug is automatically came out from its wire. & This is soo heartbroken.So all I want Plz replace this product, so I can enjoy my music. I am your regular customer.Hoping & waiting for a positive response from Amazon/boat India.Thanks"
1,It is used for 8 months one side does not working now I applied for the warranty and take the product but now the boat has not replied to my email and calls @boat I very disappointed by the boat company.Very very worst response from the boat they replaced my headphones after 2 months and they send green colour but my headphones colour is black and they send without any box and rubbers (ear buds) very very bad response don't buy any boat accessories the warranty they told is fake.
1,"Mids r sharp, painful in ear, not clear vocals and treble. Bass good not best. Plastic used cheap quality. The ear fitting and design very bad for ear. Wire is one side in bud so that it pain ear. Very sharp and thin treble audio and bass is not matching. Very unfit and painful for ear cheap plastic quality design. Artis 400m is much better than this atleas clear vocals and 15mm driver. Money vaste product. Everyone who giving it 5 star even don't know about audio technologies."
5,This is my review after using a month.Pros:- Easy fit- Good sound- Pretty good Noise cancellation- Provided a small clip to pin the wire to your shirt.Cons:- Can hear non stop for 40 minutes or a hour. then you can get slightly feel the pain. pain is good becasue it will notify to take rest for sometime :)Even though seller mentioned it is waterproof. but still i'm taking care of it by staying away from water and wiping the sweat often.You should buy it without second thought... Happy Purchase!
3,"Looking at lot of good reviews, I think the opinion probably differs with people.. Sound quality is definitely better than any low profile earphones, but bass quality seems to be so unnatural, boosted to much that gives pain in the ears.Pros: Ear piece stick to the ear comfortably, Sound quality is decent enough, call quality is goodCons: Boosted bass sound spoils the original music (some may like it) it hurts the ear drum in short time of listening to the songs. `This is the first day review, if my opinion change after some days of usage, will get back to change the rating."
3,242 is not up to the mark. I already have Bass head 100 which is better than this one. Noice cancellation is not that much great. Only benefit I found is that it has inline mic with volume control.Good in bassTreble is above average but actually I found it a disturbing one compared to bass head 100.Fits in ear with ear clip.The additional clip for dress is also helpful.Good cord length and material is also good.Product wise it need improvement.Delivery and packing is fine.Thank you amazon
5,"It was just an Awesome sets of earphone with accurate frequency point to listen a song ... Just replacing the ear caps, change the tune & frequency for the listener ...In small pair of ear caps you can hear pure Crystal Clear voice & only it focus on voiceIn medium pair of ear caps u get a sense of Equalize bass, drums, voice (as per song u have/make)In large if it will fit in your ear it will give u complete sense of isolation of song like an large hallIt work like as per a high-Quality headset become sounds as per there change of Padss Cusans ... It's awesome to have it ... Try it u goonna make sure it sense something else in every different ear pads"
3,The built quality is too bad. Cheap plastic quality. Sound quality is decent and above average. I got this for Rs 399 during lightning deal but definitely not a Rs 450 or above product for the quality of plastic used.
1,"The headphone are of very good quality but the service is WORST!!! I faced the typical boat issue of one side not working after 6months. I reached customer care and they had a pickup but it's been a month and there is no update. Whenever I try to call customer care it gets disconnected frequently and by chance if it gets connected then the executive doesn't cooperates and says the same thing that it would be dispatched tomorrow and this countinues for over 4 weeks now. Have had this experience previously with bassheads225 but still I chosed to buy boat product again. But not making the same mistake again. If you wanna buy boat products consider buying a newer one again after 6 months, coz this is validity of there products."
5,"Sound quality is good,  bass quality is good too. Lookwise it is stylish and amazing. But this product is not DURABLE.Got it delivered on 30th september and it's hardly 2 months passed that it has stopped working yesterday. Till now I have purchased 5 Nos. of boat earphones. But I am unhappy with the last two purchases. Same issues with the previous one too,  stop working too soon.Initially, for me they use to be the best- better in quality as well as price but not anymore. Varients have increased with time but the quality didn't. Will not recommend anymore."
4,"Just got this after 1 day ( 1-01-2021), and i can say the quality of the earbuds isn't that great because it feels super plasticky, sound quality on the other hand is one of the best I've heard in this price, i also use realme buds2 and the sound is clearly better and clearer in this one, i listen to loads of EDM so this is on the same level or better than RealMe buds 2 in the bass department.Also the earplugs for extra fitting can be removed, i personally find them irritating so thank god for that, so far so good & will update in the future (Update 8-06-2021, left earpiece has stopped working, i never used it harshly but still it stopped working, it's been happening with every earphone i buy, max use time is 5-7 months)"
5,Build quality is very good. Best sound quality in this budget. Mic is also good.
1,The right side of the headset didn't work and i am returning it andd waiting for replacement
5,"I received this product with 3.5mm jack (extra jack adapter -  two female to one male node 3.5mm jack)compatible and useful to connect with android mobiles!This product Redragon headphone have two 3.5mm jack(one for speaker and one for mic), also it has volume control button(only volume control for noise cancellation and no forward and backward buttons) at one of the side speaker(you may notice that easily)Pros:Superb sound quality.Good product material.Money worth product.If think buying headphones as one time investment then you may go for much price product of Rs.1000 and more."
5,Nice packing no damages.Fast delivery by Amazon.I am singer so I know sound quality.It's sound quality is amazing then others headphones.It's having two micro aux cable.It's mic surfing is very good.I got very seal pack like new one unpack.I am very happy with this product.Volume control buttons is very nice.It's voice quality give you amazing.Go for it buying in your budget.I have sing a song and recorded my voice with  this product nice voice.Go for it it's amazing.🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
3,The product is awesome packing is also good. For hearing it is perfect but mic have some problem. First I saw reviews of this product and then I buy this but it have problem in mic but it is alright
2,just its worth its money but i have to tell i go to school k so i us it minimum itself k now look it was my summer vactions and i used to game 3-4 hours with it after 20-25 day the left side began to completely stop working and i opened it and i fixed it but then again the problem came around and around and now the left side has completely stopped working i wasted 800 rs for 20 days so i say that save money and go for headphones above 1500 its the bestand im going to buy a headphone of rs 200 and more so plz im open to suggestionsthnkudo click helpful
5,"Purchased it to use with office pc to make calls over the network. Extremely loud, but no voice cracking at high volume. Extremely sturdy. Mic is exceptionally good. The mic piece was bit short but have no difficulty to pick up everything we speak. Volume control is on headphone itself, not on the chord. The headset itself is two plug (mic & headphones separate). But they do provide an extender to combine those to use with single plug systems.Ps: I've never used it for gaming"
5,I love this headphone because of its qualityI am using it for few months I can receive one problem which is nothing 😂😂😂😂🤗🤗🤗😋 go and buy it now I also found it offline its cost 3500 so I check on Amazon but at Amazon only 800 thanks amazon
1,"It is been 4 months now I have ordered this headphone, and I am using them daily. Suddenly its mic has stopped working. The person on-call cannot hear our voice properly. I thought it was an internet issue so ignored it for few days. After some days my speakers also start malfunctioning! I have to keep my neck in some fixed direction to hear the opposite person's voice clearly or else it gets disappears.Then I tried to call on their service center which they have mentioned in the description on Amazone. But no one is taking the call. I was calling on weekdays and during working hours so no one should give any reasons. overall the purchase gone waste.My suggestion is not to go for these new companies, rather purchase from any well-known company even though they charge high. So dont buy it! and change your Mind!!!"
3,"The mic used to be good until 5 months, now it no longer works. Probably has to do with the economic wires.As in any other cheap headsets, the volume control has given up too. Now at the highest volume, one side works and the other is slightly at a lower volume. This is fixed by lowering the volume a bit.There’s no noise cancellation, you can hear people talk on phones if someone’s around.It looks fancy and the stereo isn’t half baked. You can identify where the opponent is with their footsteps."
4,"It is the best gaming headset under 800 rupees but only thing i hate this headset is its mic don't comes with noise cancellation. Sound quality is superb &  i can easily spot enemies in pubg pc even pubg mobile, pubg pc lite, csgo &  apex etc"
5,"Nice product in budget.I want to tell few things, make sure you read.1) The bass quality is nice.2) The sound is so much crispy and clear, each and every detail can be heard.3) Some what doing Passive Noice Cancellation.4) Mic is also good, but you should talk a bit louder, as if you talk in low voice, as mic is somewhat far from mouth, it won't be recorded properly.5) Suitable for budget.6) I recommend to take some break after 1 hour, if you are in a humid climate, as it causes some sweating.Edit after 2 months of usage:1) I recommend it for all purposes.2) The bass is exceptionally very high after lot of usage, it is just shaking with bass, it's thumping.3) No sweat after habituation.4) Overall, I think it's better than 10,000 worth headset for me."
5,"According to me, this Redragon headset provides smooth and highest quality sound at a low budget. Its noise cancellation feature is more than impressive at such a price. It doesn't come with breaded cable which disappointed me, but the product's other features impressed me a lot. It comes with a sleek design, perfect for modern day gamers. Also it has an attached mic and the volume control wheel at the back of the left ear piece, this makes it easier to access to the volume control. The cushion rests provided at the ears and at the head support region are of stupendous quality. The headset also features gold plated jacks. Also, two female to one male connecter is found inside the box, in case you want to plug the headset to your phone and listen to music or play games. The manual is provided with the warranty card. And a sticker is found in the box which is the logo of Redragon coloured in blood red.I suggest this headset to hardcore gamers, and those who wish to buy a new good quality headset. I hereby give it 5 stars in order to give it the honour it was manufactured to have.~QwertyFusion (Rishi Banerjee)"
2,"Good but not great. It doesn't completely cover the ears so Doesn't completely minimize external noises as a result, After few hours of usage, my earlobes begin to hurt as well. Headphones that comes with bigger cushions will provide better comfort. Also this headphone does not have a good bass. If you like to listen to music then this will be a disappointment. Add a few extra bucks and buy a JBL ear phones or panasonic or sony headphones meant for music and buy audio jack splitter so that you can use it for gaming. That is better. Edit: Not good. I would not purchase this again. the ear muffs came off. And revealed very low quality product inside."
2,"Major issues with side microphone  as its tooo small & many times other side person cannot hear in between....The side MIC shud be long enough by 2inch or more...Quality wise, its good only MIC problem...Good thing is you get single audio jack to two spiltted jack (MIC & SPK) for connecting the headset to mobiles & devices with single audio jack."
4,"I have used these headphones for almost 1 yearthese headphones are pretty good, they are very comfortable we can use them all day longthe sound quality is good and they fit ears very wellbut the problem comes with the wire after some time of usage, it gets bend and you have to keep it at a certain angle to hear the sound.after some time only one side of headphone workoverall you can buy itI have enjoyed it"
1,"Mic doesn't work, the right side of the headset doesn't work and I get a flickering audio while listening to anything on the headset, the headset started to give pain in my ears under 2 days and I'm getting the item replaced as it is too late to get a refund for it now, please do not buy this headphone it's the worst headphone you can get in this price range, it is not at all meant for gaming or any other outdoor usage and is very uncomfortable. I would suggest going with any eSports headphones as they have a tighter grip with a better cushion pad quality which you can use for hours and still not get pain in your ears. This is the first time I ordered a headset and it's the worst experience ever."
2,The headphone worked for 2-3 months properly now mic and one of the side of the headphone does not work. Please help us get a replacement. It has one year warranty. I hope someone will get in touch with us. I'm trying to call the support number given in the product description but no one is answering.
2,"When I first got the headphones, I loved it. For Gaming, it is really lightweight and comfortable so if you want to play for long hours, this is for you. The earcups quality was good and was very comfortable but the volume control was OK and I could only hear voice from the left side in a few months. I recommend you not to buy it unless you only want to use it for a few months."
2,Everything's work fine in Desktop but the mic doesn't work in CS:GO(COUNTER STRIKE GLOBAL OFFENSIVE) and I got the Headphone only for GAMING PURPOSES to use the Mic while Gaming or Streaming
1,"just not worth it ,spend a few extra cash and you can fund better options.its feels cheap, the volume is very low, even when settings are at max.I contacted amazon CS after few hours of receiving it and asked for a refund and they said they can only replace it. well i dont want a replacment i just dont like the product.Why can't  i get a refund?"
4,Coming to the build quality it did not make up my expectations but the audio that is extraordinary.  I have JBL t460bt and when you compare with it there is very slight difference between the bass because comparing 900 rs to 2500rs 2500rs i.e JBL was good the volume control is responsive and the thing u have to know surely is that it has no noise cancellation. you can use it for gaming because it is confertable and light weight. It also has a adapter that you can use to connect to your phone. Overall it's a 4 out of 5. The delivery was 1 day late but it's all right due to covid it's fine
5,This product is really great. The Headphone arrived with connectors ( for use in ipads ; laptops and mobiles ). The Sound quality is good although a bit more bass. There is a volume control on the headphone. I havent tried the microphone but all in all this is a great value for money.
4,"The cord lenght is great and is the best USP for this product. The converter from mic+headphone to TRPP 4 port 3.5mm jack is relatively of low quality but if u dont plan to move it much it works!Overall bass is very high, so dont expect 1:1 reproduction. It will be super bass-ed.Would recommend only because of long 2m wire."
1,"Less than a month after receiving, the mic has stopped working. No idea how to get a replacement or check it under warranty."
5,"So....First this is great product I would recommend you to get this product for your daily works like schools and meetings and also for gaming...What I just doubt is that the inner box, inside that polymer packet, was a little disfigured...I thought that maybe my headphone is a little bit damaged, but it's alright...Maybe that defect is due to overload shipping of items....I would recommend this product to you..."
5,"If you are looking for a best and cheap gaming headphones, then this headphones will really fit for you. It's a great product. In gaming every noise can be heard clearly. Also when you will wear this headphones then you will hardly be able to hear the outside's noise. Its noise cancellation is the best. Also too it is having its own volume rocker at its left headphone.😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰You should go for it with closed eyes.Thank you redragon and amazon too."
1,I bought the product in May and within a month no voice coming from left side. U can only hear in right  side. Now return window is also over. Do not buy
1,There is a constant buzz from the mic but the volume isn't bad when I was gaming and playing fortnite my friends said there was a constant buzz and they could barely hear me I would say go for a stand up mic for the same prize it is on amazon
4,For gaming sound base is OKFor noise cancellation is goodFor sound quality in woofer effect during song playing totally flat
3,My ear hurts a lot of after a few hours of use. You have to wait a few days until your ears are back to normal and then you can use them. Would not recommend if u are gonna use it in long gaming sessions. Will just be fine if you are gonna use it to listen to music for awhile. The noise cancellation isnt too good but its decent.
5,Product is as good as it was expected to function.  My children are having fun.
5,"Value for money, right now using as a daily driver, no complaints."
5,The sound quality is extremely good. The voice quality from mic is excellent. The wire is sufficiently long and the included adapter works brilliantly with mobile devices too. All in all a good purchase!
4,Works great with PUBG PC and mobile. Indicates clear footsteps and direction. Good stereo. Music quality can be improved by tweaking with equalizers in device. Microphone is not that sensitive but works just good enough for voice chat (Not for high quality sound recording).Can feel a little uncomfortable after 1 hour of constant use.
4,Writing after 1 year useThis is best headphone in this price rangeBest for gaming footsteps are clearly audibleBest for songs with high baseOverall this is best headphone for gamingAnd the base Is also very goodFeeling when listening high based songs is terrificAwesome product
4,Within three months of the time it's not audible from one end of the earplug. This seem to be a defect as far as product reliability is concerned. We have been ordering from Amazon regularly but upset with the product. As a customer gesture would expect an exchange of the defective product within unacceptable period.
1,"Honestly, terrible product, when I'm playing on my PS4 with the headphones output to full and the headphone itself on full, I can't hear anything. I can hear literally my fan turning when I'm wearing the headphones."
4,"Well its just a normal gaming headphone, and everything is just normal about it. The build quality is also okay. The best feature is its comfort. Very comfortable to wear and doesn't give pain to the ear. Sound is nice, better than the headphones of the same range."
5,I bought for my son and he loves it. I also used sometime for calls and quality of sound and clarity is superb.
3,Great built up quality but sound quality is not up to the mark although inbuilt mic does it's job in an exemplary way. Their is hardly 2 to 3 hours of stand by battery back up and the main drawback is aux cable provided with it is NOT COMPATIBLE never experienced such a mess with amazon till now. My personal opinion BOAT is better than Boult. Hope amazon will take necessary actions to rectify & satisfy it's customer's.
5,Nice buy at this price... awesome sound and subwoofers does a great job...wow flexible and comfortable..no problem in connectivity and no irritation even after long meeting sessions or music too...
1,"1. Received open box product.  Seal of headphone box is already open as it is a used product.Electronic item should be sent as sealed box only.2. Got new sealed pack headphone after replacement BUT now AUX connection is NOT working, only Bluetooth is working. BAD product."
1,"1.Aux cable is not working2.Sounds greatMy Experience  :-Buy in July2020 , return on same day-Replacement Product also have same problem."
1,Bad Quality
4,"Great sound quality, decent built and amazing battery life.However, the microphone doesn't work the way you'd expect it to and noise isolation is average."
5,"It's worth every penny spent , amazon delivered the product in 2 days and it's packing is good , headphones are light weight and delivers good audio quality."
5,This is a real hulk among the headphones. For the USP it selles is it's unbreakable headphone. It was really the need of the hours for the kids to do online study. I have my self tested the headphone and it's strength is awesome. Rest off all it does the job of the a headphone. There are people who expect everything in this headphone are fools. If you really want to compare the apple to apple then better buy other headphone bit do let me know if there is any other headphone in the market which is as strong as this. Best for kids. Buy it and forget it. Awesome product.
1,"Though light weighted the quality was soooo poor , one side of the headphone does not work and the other has poor sound quality (no i should have not used the word quality, its tat worst) is the worst headphone i ever seen , no usermanual and no proper response if i turn on the headphone no single evidence of noise cancellation infact outside noises are very clear than they are , utterly dissapointed better go with boat if u like to be in budget or for best sound  and u dont worry on spending go on with b&o and very disappointed as i brought it in quarantine"
1,"Ordered the first product few days back and the first day saw that the headphones were delivered in good condition. Upon opening, the sound on the headphones was good but Mic was not working. Wanted a product where both sound and mic works so returned it.Replacement product arrived, box is unsealed. Connected the headphones even if it was unsealed and see that the mic is not working again.Not sure for how long I will have to work this out.There is neither a working product not a refund to choose another one. This cycle is irritating, ordering, returning"
4,"The audio is just amazing and promising. What I feel it needs is an upgraded mic. You really need to be loud to be audible when on Bluetooth. Also when a product is marked price of 5K you expect the packaging to be good. It comes in a flimsy plastic case in a thin cardboard case which on first look makes it look like a duplicate, while if I compare with other product in market they come in nice cloth cover n then the plastic."
5,"First to make it clear. I am not an audiophile. I use headphones for my zoom calls mostlyI had purchased a boat rockerz 400 in Sept of 20. Within just 2 months the headband broke. I used feviquick and fixed it.After one month the headband broke again in new place and again I had to apply glueBut when it broke for the third time within barely 4 months, I decided enough was enough.I started searching for new headphones. I wanted a headphone with strong build. I actually accidentally came across this headphones. I was little nervous since it was a brand I had not known about.The headphones are really great. There is metal band that goes around the band which will remove any chance of the band breaking down.Regarding sound quality, I didn't find any major difference from my previous boat headphones. The buttons are really placed well and the Bluetooth doesnt suffer from noise breakage which used to happen with my boat headphoneI am really satisfied with the product but have a small minor complaint. Why  your headphones come with open seal in the box ??. I have seen many reviews that complain about the open issue. Please look into it. Its not a good thing."
5,"First thing i would like to say is at this price range it is is one off the best headset i can say,Sound quality 10/10Noise canceling 9/10Bass 10/10Material used is also of very good quality really it is fully flexible at any angleYou will get one usb data cable for charging purpose and one Aux cableEasily gets paired and works perfectly in 8-10meters rangeBattery life last upto 10-12hrs i can say as i used it from 9 am to 8 pm it was paired whole day and i was using it for bass boosted songs but the performance was superb."
3,"The build quality is good. Looks sturdy but then  the sound quality is not satisfactory. Also the cups of the ear is not big. The cushion lies on the ear. Not over the ear. Therefore after about one or two hours of using it, you will feel discomfort. But it is priced reasonably. So you can go for it. Else look of ones with bigger ear cups."
3,The Headphones are nice  actually its quality of sound is good but sometimes it make some problems like if i have my phone connected to it and its in my pocket then also the noice breaks .In the middle only if i am seeing any video the sound stops coming and to retain it i have to switch off and again switch on the bluetooth .But its sound quality is great .
5,"A very good value for money product from Boult audio. You can blindly go and purchase this amazing product.Sound quality is very awesome,you can enjoy songs and movie in very punchy manner.The design is great,we can even rough use it ,as it provide fluidx design.The sound quality while taking calls is also decent. Noise cancellation is very good inside home. While in noisy environments also it's woks good.The comfort while using the headset is very good,we can use it even for long hours as it provide cushion support over the head.The battery life is also good.I love my Boult headset very much."
1,"Extremely low voice during calls, uneven sound distribution in both ears, battery lasts as promised.In short, totally not worth it.And icing on the cake, can't get a refund on this now, it's a total waste of hard-earned money."
5,Its been like one month since i ordered this product and i had to charge this thing only once. Battery is monster in this thing. I use this for gaming too. it is very comfortable so you can have it for hours and hours. Sound quality is very nice. The bass is super deep and noise cancelling is also super effective. Overall a very good headphones. You will not be dissapointed.
2,I purchased boult audio pro brass FLUIDX headphone on 21.01.2021 from AMAZONIt's been just a few days and the headphones have stopped working. The power on and off button has stopped working completely. I tried charging it but it's still the same.This is the first time I ever bought the product from Boult but it has been a very disappointing experience for me.
4,"The product is so good, its pretty well designed and has a great audio quality, the cups are just perfect and they fit on the ears completely without leaving any space for air, the quality is durable and the material is averagly flexible and regarding battery life, they claim it for 10 hours but I once charge it complete and it runs without any problem for around 4-5 days and gaming with it is so much awesome!"
1,The sound is not audible also the mic is not good where other persons are not able to listen. This is a poor product
1,Bad quality it had many scratches on it .  I had bought an one before this one it had scratches too  I had replace that headphone with this one than also I had an an defective product that's why I am returning this headphones
1,dont buy this headphones whenever i wear this headphones my ear pain & 3.5 mm port  Defective
5,"Aux cable doesn't fit, looks like stoners were making 3.5mm reciever . If you think its print rate is real rate, it seems to be false if you look at the packaging. But it works good with Bluetooth. Just brought it, if I feel any problem, I will review it later."
1,Dislike only for not fitted properly very loose fitting it is only use when you sit on one place otherwise headphones fallen down and I think mick is not there so it is difficult to attendant phone calls sound quality is good but the purpose of using headphone is not up to the mark so don't like low quality cheap headphones fitting is good than this and must have mick
5,Headphones are really very good it have more battery life then what I expectedIt is very comfortable and easy to useIt take very few time to chargeWhile playing games we can have a perfect gaming experienceWhile watching movies it feels as if we are in a movie theatreIt is foldable which helps to carry itHeadphone have an amazing base and good noise cancellation
5,Best Quality Headphones.Noise Cancellation:Excellent Noise Cancellation.Sound Quality:Sound Quality is best. Loud and adjustable volume.Battery Life :Battery Life is 7-8 hours.Padding :Padding is very comfortable.I am very happy with the product.
2,Sound quality is good but microphone is not working at all. When I opened the headset it doesn't look like new one. It was like used product with scratches although the box was closed. I would not buy again or recommend to anyone.
5,Amazing packagingAmazing sound and bass qualityNoise cancellation is not too good😑Otherwise the features are elegant ❤️Battery backup is too goodBuilt quality is awesomeAt the bugdet if 1499 it's fine
2,"Better options are available in the market at lesser price. Battery life is not good. Also issue when on call, other person cant hear you properly, you need to talk in high pitch. Heavy on ears, you can feel the weight of the headphones.. dont buy if dont want to waste your money.."
2,"first of all, seal is brokenJust buy something elseNoise cancellation is decent as it covers your earSound quality is not that good right side is very low don't know why it looks like only left side is workingBattery life idk"
3,Built quality is very low! The buttons are horrible and you can here is click in the middle of your music. The light on one year keeps flashing continuously which I personally do not like.Finally the fit is also below average and ears hurt after 20 min of wearing as ear cups do not move at all.
1,Its been approximately 3 months and the Forward and Backward options are not functioning. pretty surprised .. I would have used this hardly for 4-5 times and noticed.  is there any warranty for this?
3,Aux cable is not working. How can you provide such a pathetic quality cable. Now I have to buy a seperate cable. Quality is becoming questionable with this issue. Three stars
1,"Product box was damaged, box seal was open and the product was damaged... I feel the product is very old or used or rejected... Please don't cheat the customers like this. We lost trust on Amazon by doing this..."
4,"Such a good product I have ever used under this price.Its sound quality is really very good,and it's battery life is almost 10 hr.Noise cancellation is not so good,but yes it's good enough.But you can use this headphone thoroughly for 1 hour,after 1 hour it's slightly hurts your ear,Other wise it's a very good product."
2,"It will produce sound on the outer device even after getting connected . You have to restart your device to get the audio in Headphones . Very much unsatisfied , but not returning as I need Headphones urgently & it can only be replaced not returned ( same kind of product will come again ) ."
1,They fit awkwardly on your ears and the aux didn't even fit the panel . The design is so messed up. It's just really poor headphones. Delivery and refund was good
1,"Broken seal product received, seems it was used before. Requested exchange.Exchange received with same issue.....Very poor customer service they are trying to harress customer....I recommend look for other similar product..."
2,I have been using this since 3 weeks now and already the battery life of this product is very minimal and needs recharging after just 2hours. the sound gets distorted sometimes even within 1m range
5,Awesome headphone in good price. I love sound quality of this so if you are looking for budget Wireless Bluetooth Headphone then this is great choice..
3,Evarything is Good but when we use 1½ hrs above too much of pain occured on ears
5,Sound quality awesome bro without noise...charging also......peaks...
5,If you all are looking for a new and best headphones then go for this blindly.. you will comfortable.. this headphone is absolutely perfect for music lovers . It also gives the best gaming experience ever.if red color us available you can go for it because it is very attractive. And if not available take the orange or grey one. Same product but green and black will not make you look attractive. This is not deep bass but this is punchy bass. And yes you will not get an auxiliary cable.It connects only in one or two seconds only. So Do Not WATCH ANY OTHER HEADPHONES AND GO FOR THIS ONE ONLY..if any doubt ask me. I will definitely reply.
5,This one is FREAKING AMAZING...  BoAt Rockerz bhi iske saamne nahi tikega.  Just go for it
3,"Bads :1. Bass not at all there.2. Cushions too hard, in 10-15 minutes ear pain starts.3. Buttons clicks like toys and feels like any moment may fall down.4. Aux cable is not box content.5. Dual pairing between PC and Mobile I found very pathetic. Headset confuse when to stay connected with which device. I was on WebEx meeting on PC, when phone rang instead of just notification it literally disconnected from PC and prioritised phone.6. When mic receives same continuous sound like 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' it breaks otherwise works fine. Now could not review how it handles surrounding noise so no comment on noise cancellation of mic.Goods1. Fair build at a give cost.2. Does not look impressive neither bad.3. Mic is loud enough. Tried on different phones, apps, computers, tablets, mobile operators for calls. Results is just same.4. Voice listening quality is average. Not bad at all.Final words :1. Good for calling in short time and roaming around phone at short distances.2. Bad buy if looking for music listening."
5,"Product is very nice.Price is great,Sound quality good,Noise cancellation also good.Battery backup is excellent.I got the product before time, on 30 Jan. When I switched it on, it had 80 % of battery. I used it thoroughly and battery came to 20 % on 7 Feb. And then I charged it.It's a great product in great price.👍👍👍"
5,"Packing was good.Sound quality 100/100Looks 100/100Fabric material is niceNoise reduction is perfectTreble is equalised.I did few video calls, using this headphones and people are gone crazy.Asked me for links.Beat part of this headphones is the outer area which is designed in net form, which makes it look more coooolll🤘🏻By far best headphones in this price."
5,Every thing was fine only the issue was that package was not well in conditions but ok in this range I can perfer anyone to purchase this as there should be one more thing added with it eg aux cable which is not been given.
5,Not expected from this product. Bought it to do work from home as office laptop had bluetooth. However started using it for listing to songs. Battery backup A1 sound quality A1 bass effect A1 (tested on EMUI sound and music equaliser) drawback is the mic. On call it really not that good
5,this review is after long term useageat this price range this headphone is awesome good sound quality with long term battery life at a 50% volume this headphone working upto 24hr.bass is also awesome
5,"I like the product. Though it get a little tight around one's ears and cannot be worn for long hours, it solves the need at an affordable price."
5,"Love the colour and the design. A little tight, but it's okay."
5,Satisfactory for this price range. The negative thing is ear cushions not upto mark & will get damaged if you sweat too much 😑
4,"It's a pretty good product. I am actually writing this review after using this for about 10 months now. The sound is good and battery life is also amazing. The bluetooth range is also amazing. Now coming to the cons what i want everyone to consider is that it's not very comfortable. The ear cups are small and so my ears starts to pain after some time. Now this is subjective of your ear size. Using continuously for 2 hrs will be very painful. Regarding the leathery materia, it's pretty comfortable and good, but last week the skins started to peel off slowly. It's not a very big problem as we have padded cotton underneath but for some it might be something to consider."
5,"Great product , value for money . Best headphones under 1000 rs . Awesome bass quality with high sounds . Long lasting battery.Also fast delivery. It is value for money product.Buy this headphones without any doubt.😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩"
5,"Everything is good, sound quality is good. Folodable was amazing ang especially design is so good and very smoothly headset."
5,PERFECT HEADPHONES 🎧I JUST LOVE IT...IN MAX. VOLUME IT'S SOUNDS LIKE A SPEAKER📢🔊SOUND QUALITY AND BATTERY LIFE IS AMAZING 😍WORTH FOR EVERY SINGLE MONEY 💰DON'T MISS IT....
4,"The headphone looks good, the feel of it is just about average (good for the price I paid). Sound too is good at this price range. Given its moderately long-lasting battery backup, one would consider buying it for long usage, say, to watch an entire movie if not an entire web-series. But, it fits tighter than other headphones and the tightness cannot be ignored because the ears start paining.  I thought the headphone will loosen up its tightness after a few usages, but no, I am writing this after using it for 12 days and it still hurts the same. (Except for the pain that it gives, it deserves a 5-star rating for its price range)."
5,"Value for money. If you are searching best headphones 🎧 then it's no. 1 choice because price is reasonable, quality of headphones is fantastic, sound quality is fab."
5,So good...nice build quality.once again zebronics prooved itself as good one...thanks Amazon for getting me this nice product at 800 rupees.
5,Best bargain at this price. Comfortable fit. Wireless. Good battery life. Sounds great. Loving it.
5,Its osammm...🤩🤩And its base is unbeatable
5,Awesome product i've been using for past 6 months...its great. From my side i feel no negative points. Its best in market for this price. Its 100% comfort and stylish to wear.
5,Worth buy. Battery back up is excellent.
5,BuyItXlent productNo need to botherIt will satisfy you
5,"Likes this product, it has nice sound qualit y y and noise cancellation .it also has more than 3 day battery life but it looks large and heavy"
5,"Good product in this range, sound quality is too good"
5,Value for moneyGood product super like 👍Sound quality also good
5,The best product.👌For best rate.👍I loved it.♥️A superb quality best life quality 😍
5,Very good productFully satisfied  with zed bangAwesome.
5,Bass quality is good.
5,Zebronics is best i have ever used. Sound is very good
5,I like this product so much it's good for gaming and it also look nice with good design battery backup and bluetotloth range is so good you can buy this product without any questions
5,"The product was initially defective. They replaced it, and the new one is very good sound quality. Recommended from my end."
5,Mindblowing quality. But the ear 👂 begins paining after some use.
5,Excellent headphone with beautiful bassVery temptful one. It's a good product for Gaming.Experienced an excellent sound in PUBG Mobile.I recommend this...
5,Good Product and sound quality is bestwhen I ordered zeb-bang headphone thats battery is immediately discharging. But Amazon Replaced this headphone. now zeb-bang headphone is good working . thank you amazon thank you seller.
4,"Just OK.....not as good as expected, but can't complain much.you get one notification and the meeting sound goes off (maybe because I used it with my phone and laptop both together)For listening music, it's not bad..........not high on bass, but okay considering its price........ don't have high expectations.Wish I could return it and order some other headphones insteadEdit:When I received the product, it might have had a faulty mic, I ordered a replacement, took some calls with the new one, and it's meeting basic expectations (you cannot expect bose/jabra like noise cancellation but it's not bad).Overall sound quality is also not bad but don't expect high bass.For 800 rs, it's  a good deal."
5,Awesome sound quality and it's is the best headphone under Rs700. Value for money product.
5,"Okay.. I was skeptical at first to buy this as i was tight at my budget , but to be honest this little product really exceed my expectation. If you are really tight on budget just go for this one.Ps - for Redmi phone user , go to setting - sound effect and user equilizer and play around with sound enhancer to get the best sound result."
5,The earphone is worth what you pay for. The design of the earbud may cause pain after prolonged usage. In that case basshead 103 is good.In terms of sound this is way more advanced than basshead 103. Bass is also increased.Quality wise i would preferred the nylone wrapping of even the two small cable would have been better. Since most of the time those cable gets damaged.
2,"First ever experience that im highly disappointed about Boat product, this is very ordinary product, mudic is muffling, no quality at all. Don't buy this, many alternatives in boat brand, no return about this product, please stay away from this cheap product from reputed Boat brand."
2,Audio quality is pathetic. Vocals are suppressed too much. Beats and Bass are too high. Not enjoyable.
4,Decent sound quality on music and calls. Bass is elevated just a little bit not too much. Sturdy wires and the wire from jack to mic is braided and has a good texture and feel. The jack is some kid of rubberized plastic so it helps to grip it when pulling the jack from phone or laptop. Satisfield for the value it provides for the price.
5,The earphones looks okay. Basically in this price they solve the purpose. You can take meetings and use them as normal earphone. They fit perfectly. I thing it's the best purchase in this price. Obviously they can't be use to hear music if you are hardcore music listener you won't find that good in this case.
4,Good and descent product for long term phone calls/meetings as the design is little comfortable for both the ears. Please do not go for sound quality it will not satisfy your need.
5,"Best headset ever I used in my life, genuin product, good condition, reasonable price, value for money. And thanks to Amazon for a perfect delivery feature."
4,Sound is good but the bass is quite low
4,.sound quality is good.but sound could be more better.overall good earphone. Design of earphone is average.bass quality - good.
1,"Returned the next day itself, no quality sound, it even starts paining in the ears and headache issue, would recommend to go with Realme ergonomic the same model as it has great sound quality overall"
5,Simply Awesome
5,This is amazing I must say... Comfortable in ears and sound is amazing on call and music 🙂 Extremely satisfied. And this price amazing.
5,"Very nice headphones , like iphones original, high bass ,clarity mic voice.....worth for buying , Always BOAT... ⛵"
1,Sound is very bad and better go to boat bassheads 242
4,Overall Good
4,Perfect in this price range 👍
5,Excellent work for me
5,Good sound quality
4,It's good but I think design is kind of lame
5,Best in class sound. Budget purchase! Recommend.
5,Good
5,Good
1,Damaged oneSound quality is not good
1,Sound hurts your ear drums very flat sound
1,This product is bed sounds quality is bed
3,So so
4,U can buy
5,Fantastic product
5,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.
4,Very nice sound quality nd good bass ..nd bass quality nd sound not harmful to hearing ...Very nice 👍👍
1,"On very first time after connect with my phone one Right side speaker are not working.Very bed product,Package are broken from inside.Please don't buy cheap items, buy at least modarate items. After reviewing all comments. Don't impress by Hrithik,Go with product quality."
3,"No return option available, placed for replacement.1. Received the product at 12:30pm,tried to turn on but it seems the battery was drained out so put it on charging using cable and power bank.2. Once plugged in, a small red light glows indicating charging process and in 1 hour that turns to blue to show complete of charge.3. At 3:15pm paired it with my phone and started playing PUBG mobile, Bass seems to be high and conversations are audible but not excellent.4. At 3:40pm I start getting ""Battery Low"" announcement during the game and headset shuts down by 3:45pm.5. Kept it for Charge again which took from 4:00pm to 5:00pm to turn blue again.6. At 6:15pm turned on headset and paired it to Phone and started playing songs on Wynk.7. Bass is good and dominated the song while FM is not good based on poor signal reception quality.8. At 6:45pm the battery low notice starts again and shuts down in 2 minutes.Received the replacement, kept the headphones on charge for 1 hour, played songs continuosly for 1 hour battery still shows 70% available. Audio is better than last one(lesser bass). However when connected with Aux cable only one side of headset is audible seems like problem with Aux cable however I can get used to this, Still not totally satisfaction but good buy at rs700-800 price mark."
4,"Good headphone at this price bass is more,moderate and  comfort. Bought at rs.820.Mic issue when on Bluetooth mode."
3,These are my honest review of the Bluetooth headphone after using it for two weeksLet me divide into two categories likes and dislikesNumber 1 likes:-1. The sound quality is average . Bass is moderate overall average in this price category.2. The play pause volume up down button are working fine.3. Battery back up is decent.4. Bluetooth range is good.Dislikes1.You can't use it's for longer period your ears starts to hurt after an hour of usages.2.Takes long to charge.3. Many times there is disturbence in the music while listening as if the Bluetooth connection is getting disconnected and connected automatically.But at this price point it's an average product .
1,"Too bad quality of these headphones. I never think that Zebronics music product quality is like this. I have a Zebronics bluetooth Home theater speaker, only bcz of that quality of speaker I bought the zebronics bluetooth headphone. But this is the poorest quality, also these are too light weight, and the AUX cable is so light. It is like that at any time it can be damaged.I request to all the people plz plz if you are thinking to buy this item,then plz forget this. If you are interested to waste your money then yess you can buy this.But according to me and my family, this is only and only wasting of money."
5,"Had always known Zebronics to provide quality speakers at fractions of cost of others, and this headset didn't disappoint either. Fits well, looks neat, and sound quality is great and seems well balanced among low-mid-high spectrum. Pleasure to use!"
4,"I purchased Zebronics Zeb-Thunder Wireless Blue Tooth Headphone in March this year from Amazon and delivered to me just 2-3 days before complete lockdown.What it OffersObviously over the ear headphoneIt's Bluetooth and so not wiredIt has a built-in FM Radio (See Con Points)Provision for SD Card to load SongsHands-free phone conversationOperates by a battery and it can be charged via  USB for which USB connector is supplied with the Gadget. Only connector no charger, please.It has a surprising and unique feature that no other Bluetooth headphone offers. It is having provision to connect to a phone or any other music source by wire and the wire is supplied with the gadget besides the charging USB connector. This helps us to continue to listen to music even when the Headphone battery needs a recharge.PROS:Excellent and superb audio quality and plenty of bass and sound which can be adjusted to your liking.Good Design aesthetically made and quite appealing to the eye.Good battery life even when not in use for days togetherBest price and easy on the pocket. Surprisingly priced very low at Rs. 772 from Amazon and it's being shown at Rs. 840- today when I checked just now (10th July 2020).CONS:FM Radio Khas Nahi hai. Its like, Is it available? Yes, available type.I could not tune it to all 10 stations that are available in Hyderabad. Normally, when we opt for FM radio,  one of the stations can be listened to, and to get another station, we need lots of patience. Instead, we can as well switch on FM radio on our phone and get it via blue tooth in the headphones.The FM Stations' reception is very poor and always with the FM noise in the background.Although the Head Phone looks wonderfully giving a very expensive look, I am afraid it may not withstand rough use. No complaints on this count so far in the last 3 months.I load my favorite instrumentals to enjoy crystal clear superb quality audio during my morning walk. I am charging it once a week. When it is paired with your phone, the percentage of charge shows in the Bluetooth interface of the phone. So accordingly, we can decide when to charge.Overall, I give 4 stars out of 5(Because of FM Radio 5th star not given) and recommend for those who keep their electronic gadgets out of the reach of children and use them gently and of course who love music with good quality audio."
5,It's amazing with high bass clear sound quality it's totally ossum
5,Like the product as described by the company. The best part is that they are comfortable. I wear them for atleast 3 hours straight sometimes but the don't hurt. AUX cable option is great when the batteries are drained.
5,"Wow! This product is just really amazing ❤️. I loved it's sound . It has a feature of extra bass. The most liked feature by me is that it has aux as well as bluetooth. I loved it ❤️. Of someone sees my review . I will recommend you to buy this product. It's amazing 👌. If some gamer is seeing this, so I will recommend you to use this product for gaming. It feels like you are in the game when you play any game wearing it. At the end I will only say that I really really really love this product 😍!"
5,"Very Good Product Budget For A Good Affordable Price And Sound Extreme Level As Mobile and PC Computer Good Bass level and Sound Quality.Not displayed battery level in Mobile,Only shown Bluetooth icon,Ear muffs also very good to wear comfort..Overall i satisfy..."
1,"frequent disconnection in charging. The red light gets on for some time while charging and the gets off. Again i take out the charger and insert it. Again the same thing happens over and over again.Sound quality is good, no complainBut charging difficulty is coming very much."
1,Too bad sound quality.no bass sound. Very worst product performance.
1,Pathetic I want to return this product but I am not able to as there is no option of return just I can replace.I really don't like the built up quality.Sound quality is also not good.Battery is also not upto the mark after full charge it works only 1:30 hrs.I need money backInfact the box is also damaged and the package came to me was also not packed properly it was also damagedThe product was full of dust as if it feels like it is used product.I have ordered a fresh product it feels like it is used and full of dust
1,I just ordered this product because of good reviews but trust me it's not at all good when it arrived at my place first time its mic was not working properly so I replaced it and the second time when it was delivered it was broken then again when I try to replace it Amazon give me the option for refund so thanks to Amazon for refund.Advice:- Not to buy this product because of cheap rates go for wired headphones at this price they are more good than this product.
5,"The battery lasts a very long time. After a full day's work, battery is at 70% for me. I guess it could last 3 work days if I didn't recharge it daily very light weight no issues with ear pain  cushion is so soft comfort this many features not available Rupees 6000 branded headphones now a days can’t say more about this product no issues at all g productIf you're an audiophile, or you care about the sound quality, all these headphones are mediocre. They are tuned to the taste of the average consumer - there's a lot of bass andSo far these work great! I'm still concerned about the durability, but I'll also only be using these guys for walks and runs around the city for the foreseeable future. Hopefully, that mitigates the risk of damage."
5,"1) micro SD card option of music is the best option to hear it without laptop.2) Battery backup is awesomely good and i use this headphone almost half day nonstop or more but no need to worry for battery level.3)10-12 feet distance no disturbance,4) AUX wire quality is low but working properly.5) material used is feels like of low quality plastic so no idea how long it will run.6) overall i am happy for this product as more than expected good sound quality i got.7) must buy item."
5,This product give its 💯 many of saying bad battery life but that is not true ihave use this headphones for last 4hours and its 50% Now  so it is nice produce nice quality evwn its ear cushion are also perfect if u want many fearures under 1000 then it is a perfect its connect with bluetooth very easily its is comfartable one of its disapointing this is light plastic use it can break if u dont care of it thanks
5,Product is very cost worthy but the delivery service is very bad....the delivery boy came to my gate shout like a freak and left the box outside gate without making any call.... its slight rain outside and the box was kept outside and delivery boy just ran away... I know one should follow the social distancing in this pandemic period but there is a civilized ways to deliver electronic products especially when there is rain outside.... I have no words to describe the such pathetic way of delivery service.... product is nice but highly disappointed by the Amazon delivery service...
1,Pls Don't buy this Zebratronic Thunder  Bluetooth is not getting connected and if at all after much deficultly Disconnects often.  Searching for a service Center and getting it repaired is very deficult since I live in a small town i have to go to a city some 423Km away.  Pls DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT you are throwing your hard earned money in garbage if you go for it.
5,"I thought it's going to be a light orange but i received a deep red which make.me very happy cause my fav color is red. Ok about the sound stereo windinf id really good, bass are really good but not the best. And it cancel noise really good  perfect for listening music or story without disturbing from around sound. And about bluetooth connect really well backup last longer than i expexted really happy but i don't know how long will that be im talking about the battery backup and one last thing we still can connect with audio jack 3.5 that really helpful if the battery backup out ang specially good for gamer. Almost forget we can control the volume, play pause, next and previous directly from the headphone which is really helpful. I will update about the battery backup later and dont forget u can charge it using mobile charger i.e micro cable charger. U will get the micro cable with this headphone free."
5,It's battery 🔋 Life is Just exellent it has loud speakers 🔊 that's why you not need to raise volume over 50% and at this volume it easily last 4 days at 2.5-5 hrs of usage...Connectivity is also good you just press power button for 2 second and it starts then it's blue light blinks till it's not connected ...start bluetooth then once you connect manually fron secound time it will connect in less than 30 second...Bass is not too great but very good and clear sound quality at this price point...And what I feel best is supported memory card and also have very DURABLE BUILD QUALITY..... And of course good battery 🔋 Life...You can buy if your budget is around 600...I got it for 600 rs in sale
1,"I got this product today. After much anticipation and offer by Amazon, I opened the box and connected it to my android using blue tooth connectivity. Sound is awesome, connected quickly checked with the device volume option, it worked fine. When I wanted to check the volume option from the headphones, I found that the volume down was broken. I changed to FM mode, it did quickly after pressing the play/pause button for a few seconds...I found that the volume was decreasing automatically.... I found that the volume down button is stuck and is pressing the volume on it's own."
5,"I know there are many bad reviews on this product but this is fantastick.I love listning songs on this and it works great awsm cooolllll and fantstick.Go for it.Don't wait just buy it now. No need to read more reviews just go for this.Go.........It's mic quality is just awsm and stunning.I love its bass.Thank you seller, zebronis and amazon to give me such a great product.It's battery life is just awsm..........."
5,"Pros:Excellent built-in quality.Bass quality is superb.SD card support.Over 8 1/2 hours of battery back.Useful while jogging, walking etc.Comfortable for hearing.Cons:Time delation.Not that good for gaming.  Totally, go for it."
5,Used it for 3 weeks and now I am writting this review. Sound quality and bass is good at this price range. Battery life is enough for a day. Wired connection can also be used if the battery is drained. The sd card slot works well. Volume controlls are nice. Noise cancellation is satisfactory.
5,"All-rounder like Kapil Dev 😁Bluetooth, superb bass, volume control, provision for direct non Bluetooth connect, can play music independent off any other device from a micro SD card , FM radio,Comfortable to wear and audio is excellent.Only thing lacking is provision of a mic to equalise music and conversation.But, I can live with that deficiency."
5,I got this Zebronics Thunder for Rs.599 which I would say is an amazing deal and like any other headphone it does has some pro's & consPro's :• It's really damn cheap 599/- as compared to other wireless headphones.• The packaging was great.• Battery back up us preety good 9hrs/per charge and it takes around 2.5 hrs to get it fully charged.• The ear cups would you a comfory experience.• The sound quality is pretty good if you listen to songs from Spotify but it lacks lil bass as per me while playing YouTube videos.Con's :• The build quality seem to be delicate so need to be little extra careful.  Over all I will rate it 4.2/5.
5,This product is great for this price go using this for 4-5 months now and just works amazing. Bluetooth connectivity is so strong that i can leave my mobile device connected with this headphones at a corner of room and walk around whole house waring these without any issues ( connectivity can easily penetrate 2-3 walls). Don't over charge it 2.5 hours is max. It works perfectly fine otherwise. Most beautiful part it is that it's over ear and soft and comfortable.
5,Best quality product from zebronicsPremium quality......Bass is good listen joker song on YouTube full for bass experience..Only drawback is FM radio range is not so goodBut working fine ☺️😊😀Highly recommended by me.
5,"Wow!. Its amazing guys 😍😍😍. Build quality is decent, but the sound quality is Awesome. Deep bass and crystal clear sound. You can hear the each of the instrumental sound in songs. If you are a normal user. Then it is the best choice. But if you are looking for a headphone for gaming, then its not recommended. Because there is some delay in game, while it's connected with blutooth. But if you compromise wireless mode and play games by connecting the 3.5 mm cable, given inside the box. Then you can go for it. Battery backup is also very good 😍"
5,"This headphone is one of the best headphones I have ever used (in this price segment). Sound clarity and quality is awesome. Bass is moving, and the equalization has been done really good. The best part is the battery backup. It has an amazing battery backup. You can continuously use it for straight 24-28 hours without interruption. I'd recommend this headphone to anyone who wants it in the budget segment. Close your eyes, and go for it!"
5,Better quality sound and battery than expected. Charges very quick in about 30 mins and a playback time of 8-9 hours. Couldn't have got a better product at this price. Purchased for ₹700 in the Prime day sale.
5,"Yes good I will recommend it best in listening music , watching videos,mainly playing ping/ free fire best experience.yes it is best in low price for listening 🎧 online classes.it has both blutooth and wired both with same sound.it us better upto some what I'm noise cancellation while listening music.i kept charging for 3 hours It worked for 4 days(**note** only for online classes daily2hrs)so buy .I bought this item in 600(**best deal of the day**)offer."
5,At first I got a broken damaged product but then I replaced with this red one and I swear this is the best low cost headphones I have ever seen. I had used a lot of products but it has some special specialities...1. Wireless Headphone2. Price is only Rs 800 which comparatively very low to other in market3. Very comfortable to wear and cusions provide xtra comfort.4. It also runs in pc very well with both aux cable and Bluetooth.5. It has also a ad card slot6. It has an inbuilt F.MI am very satisfied. Thank You Amazon. Love You 💕
5,"Excellent product for personal use.Lightweight, good battery life, ergonomic, loud, clear, robust, looks trendy.What else do we need ? And all this for a mere ₹ 649 !!!I ordered it for the kids so that I don't mind if they break it, but it eventually ended in my work table due to its wonderful quality. Ordering one more for kids."
5,"This is one of the best headphones ever. Useful for students and people who listen to music. The feature of both wired and Bluetooth mode makes it even cooler! The FM mode works fine but not great. Requires a particular alignment of the headphones in order to receive the signal. But an overall awesome product. The battery backup is very good. The cushions are soft, do not make the ears sweaty, and no earaches. They are broad and fit well, making it comfortable to use."
5,"To begin with I will recommend this product to everyone. Seller is & Amazon is very good in service & Delivery. Product Quality with regard to material, finish is very good. Look wise it is sleek item. Sound is excellent. Controls are very easy. Its On/off & Call pick at side is what it makes it superior among the other headphone. In all a very very good product. One must opt for it. It is VALUE FOR MONEY. If you are looking for HeadPhone go for it."
5,"An excellent product. It is of lightweight design and of snug fit wired earphone.It have long durable tangle free cable.Easy to handle.It have Hi-fi audio quality with good bass. It is water and sweat resistant due to which can be used during gym, running and sports.It have passive Noise cancelation. Perfect for both indoor and outdoor use. It have hd mic for clear quality phone calls. It have wide range of compatibality with 3.5 mm jack. It can be used in smart phones, tablets, computer, MP3 player and laptops.One of best product in its range."
5,"I really love this I have compared to My original AKG headphones (it's ₹16.5k) PTron meet with it and disadvantage is we can't use more than 30 min with minimal sound 40/50% volume, I feel pain' on my 👂 n it's little longer we can't use under the Helmet.Well packed and they even provided pouch on the package/ cap for 3.5mm jack and 2pair buds, cable also very good quality. Thanks to the seller 💚"
5,I am writing this review with the intention to help online buyers. I bought PTron Pride earphones from this website almost 2  ago. These earphones are premium in touch and feel. These earphones are very comfortable to put on and off. The in-ear design reduces external noises and helps in crisp and clear music experience. It also has a mic and control button to answer phone calls and control music.
5,"These are excellent for under 600. I own e10c, zsn pros etc and bought these since i had a cash back offer and i only had to pay 250.These are rebranded tangmai f3's, a somewhat unpopular chinese earphone and those sell for around 1000 on aliexpress.Coming to the review, the sound quality on these are definitely better than sennheiser cx2 streets, everything is better defined compared to them and i am genuinely surprised at how these sound. The only problem is that the sound is not clean. There is a lot of mid bass and no sub bass rumblings, Mids are muddied and sounds thin overall. But then again i am comparing these to earphones over 1000. These are probably better than anything in their price range."
5,"Amazing product.Hardware-wise: solid build quality(braided cable + metallic joints),lightweight,perfectly fit in ear(come with different sized earbuds shown in photo, nice case for protection(gives a premium feel),very strong wire.Sound-quality: perfect balance between clarity and bass, amazing noise cancellation,pleasure to ears,voice not crack at top volume.Summary: For the price range(i got it for 399), they are simply phenomenal for the quality you get in the product.Last but not least : timely(early) delivery by amazon + safe packaging."
5,"Used it for few days and realized that these are the best earphones i used till date. The sound is crystal clear, bass is quite balanced and quality of wire is very high.* Best sound quality* Bass is very good* Wire quality very strong* Crystal clear sound* Includes a pouch in the box* Perfect fit in the earsCons:-Not found till now"
1,"I had 3-4 earphones.I used Sennheiser, Boat, Boult, Ubon n sony earphones.Sennheiser is best, sony is awesome, Ubon is good, Boat is like goat, n Boult having manufacturing foult.Out of all The PTRON is simply super duper hit n best awesome good all type of qualties when we merge the Sennheise, sony n ubon.It meets below all 5 parameters :Sound Quality - 5 starsValue for Money - 5 StarsBass Quality - 5 starsDurability - 5 StarsBuilt Quality - 5 stars.Friends when my Boat earphone stopped working then I went to service centre to claim the warranty.They directly denied to replace the item saying stupid reasons.It stopped working within 3 months.But PTron is the best earphone for this price.I will suggest everyone to once use this awesome earphone to get the experience of 2000-3000 rs costly earphones.Thanks a lot.Conclusion - Don't think a lot, Go for it.....✌👌😊😎🎯The Upper review was before 3 months but now earphones stopped working and I was truated them that they will definitely replace the same.But now customer care number is not receive my call. And ticket is opened from 7 days.Worst service not expected from these type of brands.Guys it's an humble request don't purchase the local products. Go for brand.Think u purchase 3 to 4 earphones in a year of Rs 500-600 reach then why not purchase the only one earphone of One Plus.Just purchased the oneplua wireless bullets for Rs 2000/- they are simply awesome...Don't think go for it..."
1,"Sound quality-: terrible, couldn't even properly hear basic tunes in the music. In order to create a small amount of bass, this  'PRIDE' of ptron muddies the mids and the highs are almost none existent.Noise cancellation -: somewhat ok as expected.Value for money-: Maybe?? If you don't care about sound clarity and like a bit of bass then go ahead, you are the ideal market for these earphones.Microphone -: Is again terrible, people on the other end hear constant noise from my earphones when I play pubg with these.Overall rating is 0.5"
1,I have used the similar product last year which worked nicely for more than a year. So I purchased the same again in the month of July and within 2 months it stopped working. No sound is coming and I cant see any warranty policy. Dont buy it simply waste of money.
5,pTron High Bass Earphones Fit is by far the most comfortable amongst all the earphones I have tried. Wonderful and value for money product.
3,Didn't expect much for the price but its great.Build quality 4/5Sound quality  3/5Bass 3/5These earphones have a braided cable throughout.100% tanglefree.Zipper pouch keeps it well protected.Go for it if you are on budget.
3,"Everything was awesome except the costumer care service.I claimed for my warranty and called them,the person said we have to courier the earphones to them. I was okay with that but after registration there was no update given to me. I called them the bot always says that the coustomer care executive is busy and it's all time! They don't reply my emails and calls. I would suggest you to go for boat they have very good warranty claim procedure and the delivery boy comes to your house for the pickup.After sales services are just terrible."
5,I guess i really dont like this mic. I am gonna keep it though!! May come in handy some time else.. Not really the best buy if you want to record audios. the mic has the terrible airblast sound when you say P or B ... i guess a lavellier is a better option if you want to record audios. the headphones are ok. Does the Job. Its perfect for everyone who wants to talk over the phone hands free.... the product is not at fault at all here... Just wrong choice for me
5,I mainly ordered it for online classes. It does its work decently. Thanks pTron for the good product and Amazon for one day super prompt delivery. I bought it in lightning deal with 199/- rupees and I am very happy. I have claimed for product warranty too on the pTron website and very pleased with the service. Hope to buy more from them in near future.
3,"Decent product at this price with good sound quality for average listening. Bass 7/10 Mid 5/10 Treble 8/10One and only fault is the sound is bit left inclined i.e. the left earpiece is bit louder than theright earpiece.Overall good for casual listening, Movies and Conference. Not for listening music."
2,"--Update--It has been a little over a month since I started using this and it has already been damaged. Ive only used it indoors, only for phone calls, and yet the 3.5mm connector has loose contact issues. Beware before purchasing it.-----I wanted a wired earphone for editing videos and attending phone calls, so I got this one at 179.Pros:✅ Lightweight and comfortable (metallic) eartips✅ Good quality, high sensitivity microphone✅ Gold plated connector to reduce static noise✅ Both of the earphones are at equal distance from the microphone module, which makes for better balance while wearing them.✅ Excellent sound quality with very good passive noise cancellationCons:❌ The cable is rounded and fragile❌ The cable near the 3.5mm connector seems vulnerable. Better secure it with a Spring or electric tape.❌  The L-shaped design of the earphones tips makes it such that you cannot switch them around.But I'm willing to overlook the above cons for the incredibly low price tag. I have no problems recommending this to anyone looking for some good  quality wired earphones for phone calls.Social media: @thehopelessgeek"
5,"Would've given 4 stars(and that's a very decent rating as well) but I'm giving an extra rating for the price tag they're offering. I bought the Pride Lite earphones for 250 only and they do offer it at 200 on some days too.Sound quality is good, comfort is better( wore it for long hours without an issue). Mic works really good on calls don't know about the noise cancellation part yet but didn't have a problem making a phone call using these.One thing you should know is that the volume button is not actually a button but a slider which increases or decreases volume based on how much you slide it. But that too works well, no issues.There's also a 6 months warranty with this which you need to register on the ptron website when you make the purchase, otherwise you won't be eligible for warranty.Overall more than decent earphones, build quality could've been better but then you're spending just 200-250 on these."
5,I was looking for a pocket friendly headphone to do my zoom classes & came went for this one.The 1st thing that is best is the built in mic. Best quality. I never have to repeat my words over & over. Such a comfortable wired headphone with mic.The sound quality is quite good. I am nt a music person so can't say in details. But if you need a headphone for work purpose go for it.The tangle free wire & carry bag iare added benifit. Just through the small bag inside your travel bag Or pocket without worrying about the tangle headache.
5,"This ptron earphone brand has overall gained a good reputation overtime. As this earphone that o have ordered is a good quality product, with an adjustable sound button and microphone as well for clear audio during a call. The bass of earphones is very good if compared in this price range, the extra buds provided with the box are useful if they don't fit properly in your ears so you can use and change them. Overall a nice product with good quality."
2,"The USP about pTron headphones is quality product at reasonable price, delivered at your doorstep. Considering the price of this product (actual + delivery charges), this particular product is not worth buying at this price level. The build quality is not that strong, the packaging was normal like local headphones, the wire size is normal, the quality of sound is pretty decent though. I have used other products of pTron, this particular product is not that good, its better to spend an extra 100 and go for a better model."
1,Don't buy this product as the sellers and manufactures are not trust worthy.Worst thing I want to mention here is the after sales service which is very very worst and inspite of being in warranty period they will not give replacement of product nor the refund.It's a Waste of time contacting them for warranty issues.
5,"1. This is good Wired headphones volume control with mic.2. Sound quality is better than some of the premium ear phones.3. pTron Pride Evo HBE (High Bass Earphones) is very nice and good finish by colour and nice looking. These earphones are premium in touch and feel.4. You can enjoy songs of DJ mix, Yo Yo honey Singh and many more crap musicians on these earphones.5.I bought realme wireless ear phone in 1700 but this is 3 Times better than realme and this is cheaper only 289 and i like the packing also very professional.6. First of all i received my earphones on time and received it in a good packaging,This pTron Pride Evo HBE (High Bass Earphones) was a good purchase The best thing about this is that it fits in perfectly and it is very comfortable. Price is also in budget, overall 5 stars for the pTron Pride Evo HBE (High Bass Earphones)."
5,"These earphones are really cool. Sound quality is super amazing. Design is just perfect and sleek. It is very light weight and easy to carry anywhere. Buttons works perfectly. They fits well in the ears can be used while walking, online classes and meetings. Doesn't creates any pain at all. It feels so good having these classic earphones. At this price such kind of earphones are rare. They're just amazing and the brand is good too!I have been using this since a week and it's working smoothly."
5,First of all I am a regular buyer of this brand..The type of material quality and the sound quality they have.... it is really amazing.I bought this product a week ago and again this is amazing at this price.The bass quality ....sound quality and also the noise cancellation all upto the mark.
5,"I was looking out for best noise cancellation headphone and i got it. It is good for taking calls, specially for work from home people. Good design and audio quality is also great. Thanks Amazon for quick delivery."
3,"I would like to give it 3.5 stars. While the earphones worked fine initially, it is a bit delicate and can rip the wire from the ear piece if pulled accidentally. It did happen while i was just lazing around and managed to fix it by  re-soldering the wire. Wonder how many users would be able to fix it if such a thing happens... Still better would be to put a small drop of silicone sealant adhesive at the place where the wire exits the ear piece so there is no strain on the delicate wire."
2,This earphone stopped working in just 20 days. Wrote an email to Ptron Support in order to get the warranty. But they asked me to buy another piece of earphone and promised me to refund the original invoice amount. I asked them to send me a replacement from Ptron but they weren't ready. Why would I buy again the same thing knowing that the problem can occur again anytime? Either Ptron should send a replacement or stop writing about 6 month warranty feature on the page.
5,Starting from its look it's stylish and sound quality is too good and add bass too. Also about packing it was packed and shipped without any damage and also provided with a cool earphobe case . Must buy product for long hours usage  for listening music or watching movies or else ..Nice product 👍👍
4,Durable for about 8-10 months. Even if you handle it carefully the gold plating will go and it will stop giving any sound at all after that. Secondly if you are sleeping and you want to turn to the side while these are plugged into the ears it will be very uncomfortable. Sound quality was still awesome.
5,I have a crazy collecting earphones/headphones and I can say an earphone worth 2k+ doesn't sound as good as this. Base could have been slightly better but this is in all other respects perfect. Best part is it's volume. You practically can't hear anyone talking. Works well for calling and the clarity is superb for both listening and microphone.
3,"Well, it's not a very bad product under 200 rs. You shold not expect something like realme or boat earphones. You can not wear it for more than 1 hour continuously. After that your ear will pain. The wire is very thin, so don't know how long will it last. The mic is very below, so you will have to hold it in hand near your mouth or speak louder so that other persons on call can hear clearly. Bass is fine. Sound quality is good."
5,"This smart wired earphone has good bass quality and the volume up-down functionality by sliding the volume bar is really cool. The wires as mentioned don't get entangled. Overally sound quality is really nice and fits in pretty well in ears. Used it for back to back meetings, faced no problem at all."
4,"I got it for 199 and I think it's a pretty good product at this price. However, bass is very minimal in this one. Other than that, the sound quality is good. It's long enough and has a connect-disconnect/play-pause button along with a volume slider. Mic is also quite okay but you have to place it near to your mouth as the mic is very far way from the mouth on the wire which I find a little inconvenient. pTron, please take note of this and place the mic a little up on the wire."
4,"I think they’re pretty decent headphones for a budget headphone. Sound is clear and quality seems good except the wire doesn’t seem it’s as durable as the rest of the product so just take care of the wire and this should be good. Especially liked the dedicated slider volume control, gives a nice touch to the product. I got this for under ₹200/- and find it perfect at that price!"
2,"Good for non sense listeners but literally bad for sensible listeners. Bass effect is good. But missing details, clarity. U can enjoy songs of badshah, honey Singh and many more crap musicians on these earphones. But if your taste is different (new age, acoustic). Then go grab some money and buy something expensive."
5,"Fantastic earbuds for the price...I doubt if u would find something better for Rs199. I have used other expensive earbuds...in the Rs2,000 range..those are definitely better...cannot be compared to those..but still...very good quality..tangle free wire..clear sound and proper bass..what more do u expect from such a budget earbud?!! Could have been a little lighter maybe!!"
3,I received an used item with improper packing and also there was earwax on both the buds. This is pathetic ptron. I paid for new earphones and received like a renewed one. There was also a crack on one if the sides. Sound quality is good at this price range but the problem is with the mic which is at a distance from mouth so have to take efforts to hold in hand and talk.
5,"Ptron pride is very helpfull for me in daily need, it's sound quality is awesome, bass sound is very nice, each song which I listen is just good, wire quality is also good , very convenient for daily journey, light in weight, it has noise cancellation also which normally not found in this range."
2,"* The packaging was not that good (Exactly as shown in the 3rd picture)* The earphones accompanied a pair of extra earplugs and a sort of warranty card.* The earphones has a slider volume controller button making volume control easy.* The wires of earphones will get tangled no matter how carefully you keep them.* The sound and wire quality matches the same sound quality that we used to be getting if bought free earphones with mobile phones.*I didn't feel any bass in sound it was just loud and was noisy to other people over calls and online meetings.All at this price, I think it's a okay product. This giving 2 stars. Not sure how durable this product is.Edit: Since the product is not refundable, I tried returning the product and got an exchange to experience the same issues of noise during calls, no bass, and pain in ears after using these for around an hour."
1,"wire quility not so good but not bad, Sound panic bass little slow...overall wrost"
1,It has 2 pins one for audio and another for mic - please check your laptop before ordering. It was incompatible with my laptop and it's Dell. The description or photo do not inform you that. And Amazon's doesn't have a return policy on this.
1,"The MRP on pack recieved is 695 but MRP mentioned on website is 845. So, this is kind of cheating.[...]look at this for correct MRP"
3,I order this item and observed that sound volume is low and rest was all good. Compare to cost plastic used and Spong used is not bad.I used it for video / Audio conferencing call and observed that volume is very low.So I raised replace the request and in 2 days it was replace but same problem volume is low. So I concluded that this product has low volume compare to others. Now I went to low shop and bought 460 rupees iBall Rocky headphone and it is cheap and better volume and sensitivity to mic is better then Logitech.
4,"Good headset for calls connecting it to PCs, as some PCs still use 2 ports, 1 for speaker 1 for audio. Great Sound quality, Mic is loud and decent noise cancellation.Have been using this since the last 1 year, 3-4 hrs daily for calls. Comfortable on the ear for long hours of usage. Good Pricing as compared to other similar headphones.Note: This headset is good for calls, dont buy if you are looking for listening songs or watching movies. You can get better headphones for that in the price.Clearly mentioned in the picture and description that this has 2 pins, so people still buying for single pin laptop/PCs and complaining in reviews should review their carelessness first."
1,Not good as expected
5,"I love these headphones.  I have owned this product for probably 5 years with no problems, and decided to buy a backup.  For the price, you can't beat it.  I'm retired and I teach on Skype. So why I love these headphones is 1) They're light, 2) They don't cause your ears to sweat, especially in a hot climate, 3) You can wear for hours and you hardly even notice them 4) Both the audio quality and mic have a very clean sound.  Out of curiosity, I decided to look at the critical reviews (the 1s).  Dummies!  They should have looked at the pictures before buying.  This product has 2 pins, perfect for my laptop.  So don't buy this product (H110) if you want it for your phone or your laptop has one jack.  Buy Model Logitech H111 with 1 pin.  Bottom line?  This product should have a 4.5 rating or better."
1,"Its been almost a year since i have been using these headphones, built quality is cheap, mic quality also not good, sound recording is so bad that even after noise cancellation in audacity the sounds are not good, overall not a good product, only positive is you can wear headphones for long hours, not durable at all!"
5,"It do not have a volume control switch and does not do noise cancellation. However both the mic and headphones are good.After 6 months of non-regular occasional use, the sponges that covered the headphones got worn out and now it pains a lot in the ear even after a minute use 😔"
3,I have given 3 stars due to the very very poor quality of the ear pad cushions. After about 15 minutes of using the headphones you can feel the pain in your outer ear. Now I have to buy additional ear pad cushions since my usage is more than a couple of hours at a stretch. This is one of the major drawback of the product. Otherwise I’m satisfied with the headphone sound quality and also the microphone quality. Logitech should do something about the ear pad cushions.
5,These are excellent! First ordered two for my family and then I ordered two more as backup. Very happy with the prompt delivery.The packing is grear too. The mic and volume are very sensitive and thus good to use.
5,I liked the product very much and is suitable for online classes and for listening Bollywood Songs. It is very comfortable to wear till 3-4 hrs. No pain. Sound quality is excellent and volume can be controlled through our mobile Or computer device only. Mic is working properly with a nice sound. OVERALL Nice Product. I must recommend you to buy it
1,Don't buy this product if you have laptop. It has two jack pins one for hearing and another for taking to be used only for pc. No return policy. So you need to keep this product but you can't use it. Sound quality very bad. Within 20 mins your ears will start paining. Very uncomfortable.
5,"I have ordered this headphones for 575/- excellent quality for a person like me who Is a skullcandy owner and have hands on Bose to ....I am doing a gaming setup at my place so it is the part of it.....I know using a 575 thing is like a joke but for a 14 yrs old doing everything by his pocket money is not a joke ........I have tried my hands on several products from logitech mouse,keyboard and now these headset and like always I am never disappointed because the quality Is way good in this price range and logi is known for their quality things......though these headphones may be cheap but i guess they are still competing a headset for like 1500 or 2000.....at the end product is very good amazing sound mic is very clear but the packaging is worst kudos to logi but disappointed by amazon"
2,"These are not very good. I didn't have too high expectations to start with, being more of a call, voice type headset, but it seriously lags in terms of quality. The sound output is too low, and I have to crank up the volume all the way on my PC to get any decent output. The case gets worse with the microphone. I believe it has to do with line resistance. I needed separate microphone and headphone 3.5mm pins, so I bought this, and now I have to throw them in store somewhere. Better, go for noise cancelling USB type Jabra headphones, or something else. Very disappointed with such poor quality."
1,"I ordered this product along with Logitech Webcam. On usage I found that they product quality is mediocre and could be bested by those with half its cost.But worse thing is that Amazon does not have return policy on this. I wanted to return it as soon as I got the package due to flimsy build, but found that there is no return policy on this item. Amazon should mention this prominently so that customers could make their decisions based on it."
5,Mic catches voice nicely and headphone sound is loud and clear. Long cable with two connectors one for mic another for headset. Product quality and appearance is very simple and sober. Good for professional using desktop and working from home. Also for online classes for kids.
4,"Logitech H110 - two different pins ( 1 for Sound, 1 for Mic ).Logitech H111 - only 1 pinI purchased H110 for my Desktop PC having 2 female ports, this model works for my laptop also.H110 model is not suitable for my Samsung Tab / Android Phone.  For, Tabs/Mobiles, H111 will be suitable.Overall, I am very happy with H110."
4,"I had this even before, bought it for the second time, sound quality is good however, the loudness adjustments could be way better. the ear sponges gets worn out with continuous usage within few months. You will love it for the price and brand though."
4,"It is useful only at low noise environments. Noise cancellation isn't great, its just functional. Skype calls sound quite good, but you need to keep the mic really close to your mouth and speak a little loudly for the person at the other end to hear you clearly. If you are someone with a soft voice, you may have to keep shouting every now and then.Buy it if you have a PC with separate slots for mic and headphones and also if you have a good loud voice."
4,Could have given 5 if the packing was nice. The whole thing is packed in single polythene bag. It's good that headphone original cover was intact. Adding review after 2 weeks of use. Sound quality is very good andsamw goes to mic. Perfect for web meetings and seminar.
5,"This is the best 2 pin over the ear headset I have found within this budget range. I am using this headset with Dell n5050 laptop for last 3 months. My laptop's inbuild mic was not working for all the conference calls, specifically Microsoft Teams. It's is best headset I found while purchasing from online. After recording mic's sound is crystal clear and sound is also very good from the headset. Logitech is the brand they always build the product up to the users expectations. If you have two pin 3.5 mm jack in your laptop then only it's compatible. I will suggest definitely go with this product."
1,"My experience with this product is unfortunately not great at all .. Whenever I wear it on , within a 5-10  minutes I fill so much pain on my EAR ... It makes me intolerant ... 1st time ,I thought it may be manufacturing defect . But I was wrong , the replacement product was have the same problem with.  At the end I returned the product.  Disclaimer:- The information above are completely my own experience. It may very person to person."
4,Very good head set for pc with dual 3.5mm jack. Excellent sound quality. The only reason I am giving 4 star us because I got a defective item first and had to place replacement order. Also it causes little pain to your ears on long use like for more than 4 hours
4,"The price looks more for the sound quality. It's mentioned noise cancellation, but I didn't feel, my opponent person could hear all noise from my end. The length of the cable is higher than other headset, that's better. Except noise quality, everything else is good"
1,"One of the very worst products that I ever came across. For sometime I was looking for a headset with noise cancelation and found this. However this turned out to be a very worst decision, as neither its not cancelling the noise nor sound control is as expected. If it's not cancelling the external noise I'm ok, but it is stated giving noise on itself which makes this product unusable even for a minute."
5,While I am happy with these head phones and use it on my computer and phone for office and personal calls the words noise cancelling in the description is misleading. Theirs is no noise cancellation on this model - neither active nor passive.
3,"It seems to serve its purpose well except for the wire, which seems really weak.  Even slight pressure on the wire seems to make a dent on it.  At least 2-3 other people have commented on this in the reviews and questions.  As a precaution I have covered the points at which the wire bends with tape so that it doesn't break."
1,"Waste product no Warrenty at all, mic stopped working in a week, never buy logintech at all, I sent email to customer support and I don't see any response at all"
4,"the headphone is good at this price range, serve the purpose of talking and listening during online meetings.Pros:1) Low price2) Good quality of soundCons:1) painful if you're wearing it for longer time2) noise cancellation is bad3) not best in class sound quality"
4,"the quality of the product is good but be aware that it has separate 3.5 mm pins for mic and speakers, so you will need to also buy a adapter to combine these two to use with the 3.5mm jack in the current laptops and phones."
5,It is a very good product. I got it at a very nice price of Rs 700.Please don't pay more than 1000 for this product as it's the same one which is priced at 1299 and 1799😄Think wise and act wise !!!!
4,"Received delivery on time as promised (actually same day of ordering!). Sound quality is good enough. One thing though, it has two separate input pins, one for Mic and one for Speaker. Cannot use directly on my Android phone / Laptop which has single 4 pole pin socket both for mic and speaker output. I guess I need an additional adaptor for the pin."
4,Works fine like a good old 90s headset should do. Comfortable for online meetings. Comes with two pins - one for audio out and another for audio in (microphone). Check your system for the releveant ports before ordering the product. It cannot be used on tablets and mobile phones. No returns allowed. Only reolacement.
5,"There is no volume control in it, which is fine for its price range. A great purchase if you are looking for a headphone fit office calls and meetings . Single port. Mic is good and so is the audio quality. Comfortable on ears ."
1,"Very Poor Quality WIthin a month the microphone stopped working and echoes and noise  is very high. Don't buy this low quality product. Logitech is cheating. Better go for other brands i buy it for online classes, but no use now thrown away and bought a new one from other brand. Logitech is of very very poor quality."
1,Very Cheap Quality product. No doubt it's a low budget headphone. Still Quality is very cheap.Don't buy it.Thanks To Amazon for providing Return Policy. I have refunded it and got my money back.
5,Prouct as per desired quality.Adequate for Office use of headphones. During lockdown. Microphone & Noise cancellation work as per requirement.
5,"Working well, sound quality is poor, not our expected level... unable to enjoy the music 🎶, only use for online class, but it good for online class teaching.... Somewhat disappointed..."
5,Pros:1.Voice clarity2. Volume is decent3. LightweightCons:1. Fixed earpieces and doesn't move2. Not at all suited for listening to music.3. Non existent bass.
1,Separate audio/video pins. The product is already outdated for current gadgets mobile/ PC that are having only single 3.5 mm Jack. If the picture would have been proper people can order only if it fits to their gadgets
4,"I loved to listen music with earphones. I have already used JBL c100si & c200si. I bought this one to gift someone. I used this JBL C50HI for 3-4 days & here are some points that will be helpful to decide to buy this or not.Build- Earbuds housing made with plastic looks basic. Wire length is 1.2mtr. It is very thin & twin wire. Wire is not tangle free. It is not feel strong & durable. One good thing is L shape 3.5mm jack so you can put in pocket while sitting without no worries. Overall build quality is average.Sound- Sound Quality is well balanced. Bass is good,Vocals & acoustics are clear even on 100% volume. And as I said sound output is well balanced so it is loud & clear but not so much loud so you can listen music on full volume. You will feel the true JBL Sound with this earphones. I used it with OnePlus 3T.Earphones comes with in-line remote with single multifunctional button & Mic. Mic works good during calls.Overall sound output is good you can feel the True JBL Sound Output with it but build quality is not so good. It doesn’t look premium & durable.Suggestion- If you want listen good quality music then you can go for it but you need to use it carefully.If you want use earphones roughly then go for Realme Buds/ BOAt Earphones but you need to compromise with sound quality.Check earphones videos on my YouTube channel link in my profile."
5,"Lots of request floating in @ What the WATT - Reviews for reviewing this entry level headphones from JBL.  We got this headphones from a colleague and thought its time to post a detailed review after a week of constant usage.We tried plenty of entry level cheap headphones, time and again realizing one thing - ""The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low prices are forgotten""Summary of review1. Specifications – Mic and 1-button remote2. Reasons to buy  a. Great fit and multiple right sleeves for that perfect bass response  b. Amazing bass3. Reasons not to buy  a. Many options available if one can up the budget by 100 Rupees by JBL and other brandsDetailed reviewPackaging - The one startling thing you notice when receiving this product from amazon is what lies beneath that packaging of Amazon is a great package of JBL and JBL has not compromised on their values to provide great packaging and great sound. When you compare the same with Mi or boat its pretty evident that there is a significant compromise on the packaging in order to probably provide a good product, but the compromise in other product department is also clear when one starts discovering other aspects of say MI and boat (Rating 5/5)Design/Comfort – When choice is of great sound - its also for great aesthetics, you probably don’t want to carry an awful product in your ear/body and only enjoy great music, isn’t it ! JBL does not disappoint in design even at this entry level wired headphone. The wire is long (sometimes feels too long) but after a use of 2-3 days we find it quite manageable. The twin cable is back but JBL has some special engineering design for this good old twin cable – “High fidelity twin cable” (rating 3.5/5)Sound – In a nutshell the audio is crisp and loud. This time I believe JBL got the voice of customer and packed a great sound in great price. The beauty of these headphones is you don’t have to screw those in your ear. One of the sleeve will fit perfectly to an Indian ear and that matters for experiencing the bass properly, a bad fit will certainly be not delivering experience of good bass. The shape of the headphone tube/canal is rightly angled – honestly we have not seen such a good design, it’s a little way from typical JBL design but we welcome that change which reflects in sound positively. Low frequency – 5/5, Mid/High Frequency – 4.5/5 – Voice clarity – 4/5. Over all sound is a go from our side and we give these headphones 4.5/5 ratingDurability – We ran an exhaustive test on these headphones especially on the electrical joints/abused them and these held on to the connections really long. Infact lifted a 2KG load with the cables to test strength and they did not break at all – A specially designed test in our labsCall quality - Noise cancellation microphone is indeed a treat to the ears while on call and a one button remote is certainly value for money at the price. We give it 5/5 for the microphone and call quality. Remote is of great usage, smart one button remote in same microphone housing - wonderful (Single press - Mute/start music, Double click - Next song)Overall rating – If you are looking for a budget good sounding product and value the brand you get associated with – JBL C50HI is for you. We rate these 4/5 and not many entry level headphones get past 3.5 rating from our test lab and reviewers. So go for these headphones (pick any color from 3 available).Used it for almost 3 months now - Updating rating to 5/5 - Amazing durability"
5,"The bass response of the earphones is amazing. If the sound is distinctively clear for a song like ""smoke in the water"", imagine how impressed I would have been! The design of it is great especially because it helps in noise isolation when on call and fits perfectly (I got tiny ears :D). And the ear canal fit is amazing. Also one small trick one can do is to twist the buds after you fit in the canal (you can thank me later). I think it's great for the price you pay in comparison to all the other products within this price range + I got it during the sale. It also works great on my laptop. Absolute worth the buy according to me."
1,Bought this one reading all the good reviews but it was so misleading . JBL is known for good sound n bass but this one is complete disappointing. The sound is ordinary n no bass at all . Didn't enjoy music experience at all . Plz don't  give false reviews just becoz it's JBL . Most of buying happens reading reviews as there is no product return in electronics ones bought n only exchange with same one which doesn't really help
1,Product was good..JBL mark ..But worst delivery by Amazon..
5,"Great music.. excellent treble, good base,.. best in this price bracket😍😍"
5,"I recently bought these earphones because I enjoy listening to music at all times and with this one, it's great to do so for its fit primarily.The buds are ideal for all ear size and the canal design makes it stay in ear all times. I did like the fact that it came with 3 sizes for the ear piece, because I can share my earphone with my brother too. And it the large size fits him perfectly well. Another issue that I used to face is with 3.5mm connector is not being compatible with my mobile phone because of the mobile case, but now it is easy and fits perfectly. Compared to the products that are available in this price range, I think this is the best one! The attention to details are credible especially to the connectors and ear buds."
1,"Very POOR quality. Stopped working in 3 days. Even the sound quality is not great. Very unsatisfactory. And the wires are so fragile and thin. Go for boat instead, sturdy and way better quality."
5,"There are three things that impressed me the most: Quality of the music, clarity and durability of the product. The cable is thin but looks pretty sturdy. It's got an ideal cable size for comfortable user experience. I give it a 5/5 for the output of highs, mids and lows! The price is genuinely remarkable and maybe safe to say that it is much better than all other cheap Chinese counterparts of similar price range in the market."
5,"I bought these earphones a couple of weeks back, during a sale. I picked it up without much research simply beause it's a JBL product but I was truly impressed with what I received. A simple but great package that encased the product. I've been using it ever since & may I say, I have butter fingers and have dropped my phone plenty of times but the cable didn't rip or shred at all due to the sudden drop or anything! Giving 6/5 on the make and durability it offers. Somethings that are worth the mention are its sound quality, light weight and bass. As a student, this fits perfectly in my budget but definitely offers a music experience that is beyond any other product of this range."
5,"JBL has always been my favourite right from the first flip, used the speakers before,I have to admit but it's become my most preferred brand for earphones now. The product was not just amazing in its sound output quality but easily better than a boat, skullcandy or a sony. It's simple, tangle free and neat not a whole lot of bells and whistles but performs what it is intended to do really well. After browsing similar products of the same price, it was clear to me that this definitely is the one for me . Strangely enough, I called a few times with the mic and the sound was distinct even when I picked calls while I was in an airport. I have in fact watched plenty of videos with these & pausing it is so much easier with the precise remote button on the earphones. Obviously wasn't expecting such clarity from a product priced at such a low end of things. Fits my budget and exceeds in performance for sure. In fact, I'm so impressed that JBL has introduced a product of this price range too! Another thing that I was really glad to see that its sound quality was not distorted even on laptop."
1,"Sound quality is just ok but if cord touches any object, it humms in ear. That is worst enough to irritate you. Secondly, cord is not of quality for durability, no quality in the play/pause button too. No value for money at all as my  hp earphone is far better than this. And most important, no return, only exchange, means once your money is gone means gone. Hell of it. Sincerely, stay away from it. High brand name only but cheap ordinary Chinese product, made in china. Better to buy of other good, reputed  Chinese brand. Sincerely."
3,Angular eartips fit in your ears and feels light and comfortable. You can use this for hours and won't have any problems. Mic in this provide clear sound while calling even in noisy environments. As this earphone fit comfortably in your ears it provides very good noise cancellation and give you clean noiseless sound. Now comes to sound quality. As this comes with 8.6mm drivers sound is very good with clear vocals. Bass in this earphone balanced well. It's not too high nor too low. These are olus points of this earphone.What i dont like in this earphone that is wire quality. It's thin rubbery wire which can tangled easily.Second no volume buttons.If you want a light weight cheap earphone with good balanced sound you can go for this one or if you want better build quality and more bass you can go for realme buds.
5,This has a perfectly balanced linear sound. Neither too bassy nor too much treble. And the overall quality is good for the price too. I think it sounds almost similar to the Sennheiser CX-180 which is costlier. Also it is light and one of the most comfortable earphones that I've used.
1,Not sure whether it is really JBL or not.  In the Description mention that deep BASS.  We can't hear any BASS in the music.
3,Sounds good but the wires are not looking that durable and you cannot even return the item only replace is available so be careful before you order
5,Review of earphones :-1) Bass - 9/102) Sound clearity - 8/103) Treable - 8/104) Wire quality - 6.5/105) Build - 7/106) Design - 8/107) Plastic quality - 8/10 (considering the price)Overall the earphones are best in its segment.Bass is too good almost like JBL 150.Wire quality is thin but it is okay for this price.Must buy if you want low budget earphones.Please hit helpful button 👇 if u like the review
1,I used this with my OnePlus 6 phone and it's not a quality product. Every now and then one of them stop working and during calls the voice clarity is just okay. I got on exchanged already because the left one wasn't working and with this replaced product it's unpredictable which one would stop working. At times when I'm watching videos left one suddenly stops and during calls at times right one doesn't work.Looks like JBL stop emphasising on quality.Though earlier JBL headsets of almost the same price range worked really good for a year and more at times. Which is not the case now. Mine started giving problem in less than a month.
1,No doubt its a good headphone sound wise. But it stopped working from one side in just 2 months. They replaced the product from jbl service center but didn't provide me with additional warranty so i have 10 months warranty on a new headphone. So i really doubt that they provide you with new ones. Its going to be usefull as long as your warranty.
5,"I am using this product for more than 11 months till now.1. Mic is very good quality,sensitive to low sounds (in case you need to whisper :P )  But no button near mic.2. Easy to listen for long hours.3. Maintains the genuine bass groove and music quality JBL exhibits.4. Blue colour is extremely good looking, modern and elegant. In case it is unavailable, wait for 4-5 days maximum, it will be available soon. I got it too in that way. Thanks to Amazon for keeping up to their unique standards.conclusion: i prefer buying this over the previous JBLs i bought at 800 and above. it gives same music and bass quality, dont worry."
5,"The bass response of the earphones is amazing. If the sound is distinctively clear for a song like ""smoke in the water"", imagine how impressed I would have been! The design of it is great especially because it helps in noise isolation when on call and fits perfectly (I got tiny ears :D). And the ear canal fit is amazing. Also one small trick one can do is to twist the buds after you fit in the canal (you can thank me later). I think it's great for the price you pay in comparison to all the other products within this price range + I got it during the sale. It also works great on my laptop. Absolute worth the buy according to me."
5,"A few days ago I decided to buy a earphone within the sum of rupees 500. When I saw the earphones on Amazon it was difficult to me to choose between Boat Bassheads 100 and JBL C50HI. I was confused. So I bought both of them and after using for 2 days I returned one of them.In the next day after ordering the Boat Bassheads 100 was arrived. I used it. It is nice. Build quality was not too much durable as expected in this type of budget. Also wires are not tangle free. Its 3.5 mm pin is not L-Shaped so it's provide some pain when you plugged it in with the mobile and put the mobile in the pocket. Sound quality is nice but little bit much louder with full sound. Bass is lower than I expected. The main problem is the mic. The mic is little bit far from your lips so when you need to talk you have to hold it with your hand near to your mouth, it is a pain when talking with someone for a long over earphone. This headphone easily fitted in my ear but it becomes uncomfortable when using continuously for over an hour. Earbuds are also uncomfortable while laying on the bed.After two days of ordering JBL C50HI was delivered to me. Build quality is same with the Boat Bassheads 100. But JBL C50HI has a L-shaped 3.5 mm pin which is comfortable option to plug it in when your phone is in the pocket. Sound quality is more than I expected. Too clear, balanced and pleasant sound. Not too loud just the perfect balance. Bass is superb. The mic of this JBL earphone is placed just beside your lips so you don't need to hold it with your hand while talking with someone over earphone. It is also a perfect fit in my ear and too comfortable for long time usage. I also used it while laying on the bed for more than 3 hours continously it is perfect. In this JBL earphone's earbuds marked with 'L' & 'R' so it is easy to discover that which one will fit in which ear. I just love this one.Therefore I returned the Boat Bassheads 100. Hence I will suggest you to buy the JBL C50HI if you confused between the former and latter.But remember Boat has a 1 year warranty and JBL has a 6 months warranty. Your choice.Edit: The date is 5/11/2020 today and it has been 1.5 years since I bought the JBL earphone. Still working fine. However, the 3.5 mm jack of my mobile might has got some problem since earphones stops working after 5-6 month of daily usage. First time when my earphones were not working I called the JBL customer care because it was under warranty period. As no JBL service centre is located near my location they asked me to send the damaged product to their Gurgaon office. It costed me 35 rupees to send it via Indian Post. Within 3 days I got a new earphone delivered to my address. The same problem happend after 6 month again. Since warranty period was over and I already had taken a replacement I thought I might need to buy a new one. However, I wrote an email to JBL along with the invoices. They saved me again despite exceeding warranty period. That time I wasn't asked to send the product. They told me to cut the wires and mail a picture. I did it and got a new earphone delivered again.Customer service of JBL is incredibly awesome. 🙏"
5,Very good Sound
4,Excellent in terms of audio but poor in terms of build quality
1,"Bought this product trusting the JBL brand. But this is a sub standard product from JBL. The sound quality is not up to the mark at all. Noise cancellation... there's no such thing. Bass quality is next to nothing. All in all, a very inferior product.The lesser priced MI earphones are much better. I would suggest everyone not to go for this.Also, to top it off, I asked for a return to which Amazon said no, we can only replace. Now Im stuck with this sub standard product."
1,I bought it in October 2019 and it is may 2020 and has not been a year and one side of the earpiece has already stopped working. Probably the quality of the  product is cheaper than it's price . I didn't expect this to happen atleast for a year from a product of reputed brand like JBL. Totally Disappointed.
1,Average sound quality..Not at all durable...started giving me trouble with the mic just after 2 monthsWeird activity with my phone is happening ever since I started using these...Volume goes up and down rapidly and automatically... 👎
4,"First of all, in the past three years I have owned more than five earphones or so...when it comes to Skullcandy (which I have used three of them) seems quite good when it comes to music quality, each lasted three months since the jack or the wire started to break inside...leading to disfunctioning of the earphones...after consecutive use of three of them I switched to a Philips one, this one lasted two year...which I am glad with the outcome...and this JBL one is going to be my fifth one, as far as I know this one seemed pretty good quality when it comes to sound and bass...but I hope the wire quality could have been better... overall the durability is quite good...but let's see how long can these last...(fyi I never used earphones in a harsh way...just popping 'em into my ears for some music, while studying or during leisure time)"
2,"Sound quality is awesome but the built-in material not looks so durable.I bought it 3 times but every time I found that after few days one side gets non functional. & due to warranty policy if little bit rubber part cracked than service center won't accept exchange,so there is a waste of 1 year warranty.Please prefer Mi earphones if u want in this or less budget which is more durable."
4,Powerful bass very strong cable an unique color and design just blindly go for it
3,"I am a music freak, i always spend time listening music, i spend atleast 2-4 hrs in my day listening music.I don't recommend these earphones for a guy like me because, this doest have punchy bass which is the main thing i always wanted in my earphonesSo for bass i give ☆☆☆Comming to point ""for working out"", i also don't recommend this because as you know this pair has very low quality rubber wire which is not tangle free, so this everytime you take out these from your pocket, you'll have to spend 2-3 mins detangling your earphones. Major drawback! ☆☆After getting these pair of earphones in to you ears you have to consider and you have you accept that other than your songs you'll here lot sounds as the wire wont absorb the impact it travels into you ear, what i mean is, thes doesn't have any noise cancellation until or unless you are sitting somewhere and not letting the wire touch any of your body part, it makes sound as it touches something, ☆☆"
4,"Build quality is cheap, sound quality is not.I have used many JBLs, Sennheiser, Boat, Mi, Focal, Audio Technica, Soundmagic to name a few. It's been a while since I saw such flimsy wire on an earphone, so look for something else if build quality has more priority. It's useless talking about it, let's talk about sound.I am straightaway comparing this with the more expensive C100SI, 150SI, Sennheiser CX180 and Focal Sense 100SI although it's way cheaper. Sound is crystal clear without equalizer. In fact, all JBLs I've used have a really well balanced output. Sure, 9mm drivers on C100SI, the sennheiser and the 8mm driver on the focal produce more bass than the 8.6mm on this one. I changed the ear tips to the larger ones and it did quite the trick. Too much bass actually makes the experience uncomfortable after some time. This one has natural bass, with very good mids and highs.Comfort: 5/5. It's plastic. It stays in the ear and doesn't feel like much when it's in there. Unlike metal build, plastic is lighter and doesn't fall off + angular tips help a lot. My focal sense slides out at times and non angular design makes them uncomfortable after 30 minutes, no such issues with this one. The ear tips are super soft.Loudness: Loud enough to cause problems at high volume but not as loud as the focal sense or the sennheiser. Boat basshead is loud but emphasized bass kind of kills the sweetness on those earphones...yes, this is where a balanced output is appreciated on the C50HI. Sound perception is subjective though :)Durability: I don't think these earphones would last more than a year, none of my JBLs did, even with better wires. Roadside earphones have wires like the ones on this one. No gold plated jack but that doesn't make any difference.If you can overlook build quality and need a really good sounding earphone within 500rs, this is it. Nothing else beats it in this price range. On everything else below 500rs, sound quality suffers."
4,"First off, I would like to thank Amazon for the superfast delivery. I was not expecting them to arrive in two days, but they did.Now let's jump into the review of JBL C50HIThe overall sound quality is not great, but the bass is punchy. (If you're a bass-head you'll love them)Talking about the build quality, it's good. It doesn't feel premium, but it doesn't feel cheap as well.Noice cancellation works well on the street and public places.Another thing which I love about them is the wire length.The wire is long and it'll make your life easier while watching movies on devices.You'll be able to move around without unplugging the headphones.Overall, a great deal at the price point, you can buy it without thinking much.But if you have a Miniso store in your city, they have some great head phones under 500.I bought a pair of Miniso headphones from Miniso for 290/- and they were immense value for money.The sound quality was close to JBL CH50I."
5,Bought for Rs. 500 during Republic Day offers. This earphone is really sturdy and fits perfectly in your ears.Sound quality is brilliant. Build is sturdy. Dont have to worry about wires breaking.
5,"Model: JBL C50HI in-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black) - JBLC50HIBLKSeller: Appario Retail Private LtdManufactured Date, Place: May 2020Length: 1.2MWeight: 13.6 gDate of Purchase: 20 June 2020Warranty: 1 Year Manufacturer Warranty=== Whats different from C200SI? ===* C50HI is lighter than C200SI (5 grams) - Good* C50HI has an L-shaped 3.5 mm jack - Good* C50HI does not have a gold plated 3.5 mm jack - Bad* Build quality is average compared to C200SI  - Bad* The one button universal remote button design is different. C200SI has a better quality one  - Bad* Quality of wire is better in C200SI  - BadPros:1. Design and Build Quality: Considering the price, design is great and satisfactory build quality too. Except the microphone area, it does look classy.2. Great comfort and fitting inside the ear - thanks to the good quality plastics which makes it light weight and the soft silicone ear tips.3. Snug fit and excellent noise isolation inside the air.4. Superb sound quality. You get almost similar sound experience offered in C200SI which is priced ₹300 more.5. The Bass is also good and it is same in the other JBL earphones in this segment.6. The 3.5mm L-shaped jack is a nice addition in this range.7. Passive noise cancellation with the built-in mic works as expected.Cons:1. Average quality of the plastic built One-Button Universal Remote button. Unlike C100SI/C150SI/C200SI, the click happens to the whole half of the button instead of a round button.2. Wire quality could have been better, but cannot complain much due to this ultra budget range in which it is offered.3. Gold plated 3.5 mm jack would have been a good addition, since you get this in models starting from JBL C100SI which is just priced ₹100 more.4. In comparison with C200SI, the microphone of C100SI captures a little more noise but also you get a clearer sound along with. C200SI recording feels less noisy but sound is also a bit muffled due to passive noise cancellation.Note:The one which i got delivered first time had a defect - one of the earpiece had less volume compared to the other. Replacement got approved and the new one works great as expected, hence no issues.If you are in a very tight budget, this could be considered, else you can go for JBL C200SI which has the same sound quality but with a better build and a gold plated 3.5 mm jack.Also please pay extra attention during the usage since there is a high chance to get damaged due to the thin wires."
1,I buy this but 1 speaker is not working i hope this is not original this is copyI also choose return option but suddenly lock down  and now return option is not came I want to return this but howVery chipper I dislike thisI am sure this is not original
1,"I got this for ₹399 & for this price you are getting a JBL wired earphone. The sound quality is good & the bass quality is also good. Only the wire quality is a little delicate, you have to be really careful while using it. Overall a really VFM product 👍Update - After using 4 months, the mic stopped working...Update - After 6 minths the right side speaker stopped working...Final words:- Don't go for this product.. add 200/300 ₹ more & buy a good earphone.."
3,"I was an apple earphones user and needed something budget friendly. So thought of buying infinity and came here after youtube reviews.The sound quality is good. But it is not enough. When in high pitches,  these don't let the dialog or vocal to dominate. So you would end up increase the volume which is bad for your ears.Normal sounds it works perfectly. Call quality is good. Noise cancelation is okay for the price.Bass quality is good but not as others mentioned. You can feel the bass but won't be satisfied if you are bass lover.Sound quality is good if u can live with first point.Budget earphone which does its job.The reason for giving 3 star is, boat 225 sounds better than this. Multiple songs compared and also action sequences. Boat performs better, but it was heavy. JBL is lite but comes with these limitations.So choose well. It's not bad at all but it's a choice you have to make."
1,The item was good at first. But now it's Mike is not working. I can't talk with my headset bacause the other person can't hear anything. But I willl be able to hear what they are saying. A genuine product will get damaged within 2 months. How you could say it's a genuine product. It's the worst experience I have. Already I have purchased 2 other JBL headsets but this is the first time I have faced such an issue. Poor quality..
4,First thing that strikes u is the shape of its ear buds. After a bit of hesitation plugged in and did not remove them for 6 hours straight!!!!!! . Have used so many earphones but never have I ever felt so comfortable .No hard plastic things that hurt your ears. They r so soft that u don't even feel them even after hours. They don't drop out. So u don't have to keep on adjusting them. Didn't hear any outside noise so much so that my dad and mom were calling my name & I was blissfully unaware. Didn't even hear the door bell ring !!. Bass is loud considering I am more of a vocal hearing person. Sound output was a bit low even at full volume. I have heard cowon earphone give more output. But decent I guess. Ear buds didn't crack even at full volume. Today was the first day. Let's see how long they last ?. At this price of 499 during lightening deal they are worth it.
5,"hi viewers, i like to share my personal opinion about this PTron Boom 3 earphones, seems like I'am using for last few days continuously, and bought this earphone from Amazon. For Rs 399/- and I don't feel like anything wearing it, it's so lightweight. I am very happy with its stereo sound quality. The dual driver speakers produce very clear low, mid, and high sound frequencies. If you hear and 4D or 5D music on these earphones, you will surely experience home theatre like sound around your ears. Golden thumbs up to Boom 3 from me. Worth buying."
5,"I have used many headphones and earphones till date. These earphones are truly worth it's price.The build quality is good, despite using plastic body. The design is compatible with the ears, so it doesn't slip off. Sound quality is good. If the budget is tight then definitely this one is for you."
5,"I am happy I got this product .One of the best Online Class Tool. Will Recommend if you are a student.Comfortable + withwire + light weight will be best option for Online classes.If you are Looking for an earphone for worth 449, Will recommend this product.I got this ptron earphone its really supperb and very satisfaction product in 449rs.Thank u soo muchThanks for Reading, if you have any doubt , Comment below i will try to Help you. Have a Great day ahead"
5,Good quality  earphones
1,Sound not good. Better to buy redmi earphone at same price.
1,"Pathetic sound quality. Nowhere near to its  discription. Double bass = double treble and no bass For this earphones. pTron, please take this into consideration and don't fool your customers."
1,The sound quality is quite basic and is worse than you'd expect.
3,Sound quality is not good as per descriptionI want to return this oreder not replace
1,As described product doesn't have good base. I used boat and it's not beating that. Ok ok headphone but not value for money
1,No comments....😡😡
4,I am using these earphones from 2mounthsSound quality is goodBase is also goodIt's mic is also goodBuild quality is decent wire is not braided but it's covered with a rubberized layerAnd It's not that heavy how it looks
3,"When I use this 1st time, I feel too much bass from other brand's earphones. But best sound in PUBG & COD game, u can feel all enemies foot step sound clearly. But this earphones I never recommend for music lovers."
2,"While I didn't have much expectations from a headphone of this price, this headphone has not even lived up to those.I needed a simple set of wired headphones for video calls, while this totally didn't serve the purpose. The shape is bad and it doesn't stay in the ear well. The audio quality is pathetic, even the free headphones given during flights have better clarity. Mic works only if you hold it near your mouth, otherwise it's hardly audible to others.There are many other manufacturers selling at similar price ranges. Would recommend going for them and skipping this"
3,"Bought this product for 399 Rupees.1 - Ear piece build quality is not great. Fits perfect.2 - Cable quality is great. Images of the product looked amazing, but actual product is not appealing as per PDP.3 - Sound Quality, not up to the mark. Needs improvement. Feel like someone shouting.4 - Suits call purpose and good with gaming.5 - For 400 rupees, nice to see volume control and option to play next and previous song."
2,"I had lot of expectation from these headphone, but it has just disappointing to own such product. I am writing this review after using the headphone for couple of days.Pros:1. Looks Durable2. Tangle Free wire3. High Volume4. Noise Cancellation5. Cost (less than 400)Cons:1. No Bass (You can say its almost 0). Treble is too much.2. Not comfortable3. Use of cheap plastic and earbuds4. Lags during calls.5. Call quality is not good. Person on the other side does not hear me clearly. There is always some disturbance.Over all, this headphone is definitely not for Music Lover, Gamers or even cannot be used for calls.Final Verdit:If possible, avoid buying it. Even though the deal (less than 400) seems to be profitable, the headphone are of no use."
2,"Too much hype with dual drivers. I felt was minimal. Probably good for 399 Rs, but the hype around it raised my expectations and I have to say it was not that good.I used it with LG dual screen and although I was able make out the footsteps, I have to say that jbl with one ear functioning did a better job."
4,"I am writing this review after continue usage for a month. I purchased 2 pairs. I already used cx180, jblt110,jbl cs100, realme buds2, and my personal and for occasional purpose 1 more triple driver. I am not comparing it with 1 more. Ptron sounds way better than the above mentioned earphones except 1 more. Talking about the sound quality. I would say, instrument separation is good and has wide soundstage. I am using this with my sony Walkman player. Treble is awesome, mids are above avg, bass is punchy enough, vocals are warm. I would recommend this for music lovers. You will not regret n moreover you will not find such sound even for 2k. Blindly purchase it. Awesome product."
5,I just love the quality of these earphones . The bass is so good and sound quality is great. It comes with controls to adjust the volume and microphone. Apart from it I liked the fact that it has a nice casing to prevent wire entanglement  and to increase shelf life and the main packaging was also very good.  I feel it is a great product for such affordable price. I have been using it for both  online classes and listening to music and it works nicely.
5,"Have been using the bassbuds lite tws by ptron since a year.So, I knew the quality of these would be good as well. The sound is at par. The noise cancellation works well. The earphones themselves have a volume rocker which is pretty helpful to increase or decrease the volume. All in all a good pair of earphones at the price point"
3,"Noise canceling is to lowbase quality avgSound  quality  not  for music  lovers it uses  for games like pubg,  free fire"
5,"Build quality, unique design,deep bass which I like most.and the volume is bit low compared to old versions but it didn't effects.and also it is a good option for Gamers in this price category. completely satisfied.dual speakers brigs a 4d sound experience which is an advantage for gamers.wire length is not too short or not too long. comfortable.I didn't feel any issues or to be improved.While playing pubg when we are shooting at an opponent infront of us then suddenly someone came from behind this device will pay a special attention to footsteps we can easily spot enymy. My first experience it vibrates in my ear when an unexpected fire comes.."
5,"The earphones have a good build quality,considering the price I got them for, much better than others. The earpiece are of a very good size are comfortable, can easily be used for hours. The sound quality is good and justifies the price , one of the best in this price range. The volume control and mic are of a premium quality.I would surely recommed you to try these."
5,"At this price, I guess it is one of the best earphones. Bass is good, sound clarity is good, even you can hear the instruments very clearly in the background, that's why it is a gaming earphone. It comes with a pouch as shown in pictures, I loved it. Quality of earphones is much better than other variants. If you want earphones, just go for this, its quality is better than Ptron lite, it costs 200 bucks more than that."
2,"Sound Quality: Terrible as compared to realme earphone in same price segment. Got pinch irritable noise when increased volume to 70%.Build Quality: Poor ...feels like 100 rupees earphone sold on streets.Durability: A little bit stress can break it.Failed to deliver the product as promised like bass, crisp sound.I guess they have again delivered the returned item to me as they have added new stickers on old one.🤭"
1,Don't buy this product.After 4 month use one side is Stop working .I contacted customer service its take 5-6 days to confirm my issue . Now they asking me to order new one after delivered send the invoice to refund the money . Iam only able to buy only on Amazon .now Amazon not taking orders because of corona . Iam totally disappointed . The problem is starting from aux pin . When wire shake right side working. Incase i am order new one but problem come again what can i do.Please don't buy this product 🙏🙏🙏
2,Bought this earphone after looking at what they have advertised. With dual drivers.. and all. But I was really disappointed. The sound is ok for the price it comes at (bought for under 400). But the fit is really poor. There is no sound isolation. I would say there is a major flaw in the shape they have made the earphone. It starts to pain after 20-30 mins (This is my personal experience).
2,"Just bought pTron Boom Ultima V2 Dual Driver along with JBL C200SI, Honestly, I had the highest expectation on pTron compared to JBL as it looked like it had 2 speakers on each side, played Dodge Challenger HELLCAT Showtime | TroyBoi - Do You? (Bass Boosted) 2019 youtube video to test sound clarity. pTron utter failed and JBL blasted amazing. I would say don't buy pTron if you really like what you want to listen if u just want to use for phone call then its good for the price."
5,"The noise cancellation is good, the dual drivers in the earphones makes the bass very good, makes it very good for gaming,but it is a little uncomfortable in the ear, its provided with a case which is good. Idk if it is valuable for money because as it is only 2 days since I have got it."
5,"The quality of wire is so smooth, I really the sound quality it was one of the best I have purchased. Even Design is way to perfect for for gaming guys and good thing is, available with case now that can save my earphones!It has feature of volume control butten as well!"
5,This is very good quality of earphones . They fir in ears perfectly. The voice quality is also very good . The wire quality is good too. I am really impressed with the quality of the earphones in this price . I recommend these earphones to everyone
5,"I have been using these earphone for 3 days. it's quite comfortable. amazing sound quality, cheapest gaming earphone best, i m regualar using this earphone. earphone is tangle free and bass is high it have volumr control button and mic with in it i really like this product thanks amaozn for this product . Sound quality, noise cancellation and volume control are amazing 👌"
5,"Good quality product, I love itI found it better than what I was expecting.Wire quality is very good. Speaker and mic sound quality is nice.Good comfortable flexible and connectivity to the driver very easy."
5,"Pretty impressive earphone , getting love on this brand just used this model and probuds of this ptron brand and I am fully impressed with its sound quality and it's has easy sliding volume control"
2,"Sound quality is awful. The so mentioned dual drivers are just for design. Your pubg gameplay will deteriorate if you use this earphones. Better put in some more money and buy a good earphones. 1 earphone I would like to suggest under 1000 INR for PUBG is ""One more piston fit"". I'm gonna throw this in trash and gonna order that. At last I would just like to say do not waste your money. Rest is your fate."
5,Sound quality is best and perfect. Gives extra ordinary Music experience with pleasent sound 'not' noisy with extra bass.Its perfect for music lovers and also excellent in Gaming performance.Its best in ₹400-₹800. Best earphones 👏🙌👍👍Fully Satisfied CostomerIts material Buildup is also really good and wire quality is also excellent and good than I expected.
5,"Best headphone for the price, audio quality is good, is dual driver headphones so audio is loud, and best part is there's volume slider on the headphone where there's a button and headphone wire is coated so no worry about wire breaking, and will recommend to everyone to buy these headphones, this company is good and has so many good products"
5,"THIS PRODUCT WORKS AS ADVERTISED. INTIALLY I BOUGHT IT AS THE REVIEWS WERE PRETTY GREAT BUT ALSO SAW A NEGATIVE REVIEW STATING SOUND QUALITY IS POOR... WELL THE SOUNDS GREAT AND HAS A GOOD BASS BUT DON'T HAVE UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS FROM A  SUB 500 EARPHONE.... IT PROBABLY HAS THE BEST SOUND IN THIS PRICE RANGE BUT IT'S NOT PEFFECT....P.S. : THIS IS AFTER I COMPARED IT TO A RS.10,000 PREMIUM EARBUDS.."
5,"Amazing product, pocket friendly,you can use it as ruff and tuffAs it's quality,sound and dual driver are soo good,,it is like that you use a primium productI'm order 4 of it for 4 different people  and all of them are working it's been 2 year I'm using itAnd for gaming like PUBG or other games it is super amazing the bass the clarity of sound"
4,Wasn't expecting much but sound turned out to be good.....nice instrument speperation and when bass is turned up it doesn't interfere with the vocals and other instruments
5,I rarely post review of  any product but this product compailed me to post a review...this earphone is pure value for money.. trust me guys my gameplay improved a lot in pugb i can differentiate every sound of movement.. and on top of it the fit of product is so impressive i can run wearing them and they won't fall of .. I'll tell you they are must buy
4,"I bought these headphones for about 9k with a 1000 INR off with SBI Credit Card discount.Pros:-1. Comfortable fit2. Battery Life (Average charge in 4-5 days , i use these for close to 7 hours a day for my meetings, movies, songs etc.3. Fast Charge - USB C type4. Light weight (Does not give me a headache)5. Sony headphones at an affordable price.6. Good bass with ANC enabled specially (Better than sennheiser)7. ANC is better than sennheiser 4.50 SE BT8. NFC has a fast pickup. (Used with Oneplus 6T)9. Mic is great for calling and cancels out a good amount of noise outside.Cons:-1. Noise cancellation is decent but don't expect it to do any sort of wonders. Feels like cabin pressure similar to what you feels in an aircraft.2. Can wear it for 3-4 hours straight after that it might just give you some sort of ear pain or a sense of discomfort.3. You can't switch between different devices. Connects to only 1 at a time unlike the sennheiser 4.50 SE BT in the same price range. But the connecting speed is pretty fast so again this is okay for me.4.  No case included , a soft case in included with sennheiser 4.50 SE BT.5. No app support which is there in the sennheiser one. However it didn't affect me much even if it had a support.Overall Verdict :-Good headphones if someone is more towards the brand Sony and has a tight budget of not more than 9-10k since the sennheiser ones sometimes comes at a price of 11-12k with similar features. You can anyways buy a hardshell headphone case for 600-700 INR. ANC does it's job pretty well in the price range especially compared to any other in the same price bracket. Gives a decent fit for majority. Battery life is good about 30-35 hours and charging time is not that much as well, close to 1.5-2 Hours for a full charge. If someone is already using phones with USB-C type then i would say you don't even require to take out the charging cable of sony.Better option for people with higher budget :- Sony WH-XB900NBest Price :- I would say the price which i bought it for (8991 INR incl. of 1000 INR off) was possibly the best price out there if you wish to buy it from trustable websites. Wait for some credit cards discount and then buy it.Reason for a 4 stars Review :-There is nothing so unique about these headphones which makes it stand apart from the competitors at this price point. Does it's job pretty well but yeah an app support or toggle btw. 2 devices would have given it a 5 stars rating.Might just be a reason that after reviewing it's Sony WH-XB900N, i expected a bit too much. :P"
1,After 10 months: see in pic.After few days:Everything else is at best but these leather ear pads. After normal use of 15 days(only inside home) ear pads bubble out.15 days of home use is too soon to see this.Choose wisely.
2,"These new 'budget' ANC headphones are for the casual listener who wants noise canceling and the SONY brand without having to pay the higher price of the headphone 'champion' — the XM3.Unlike the XM3s, these headphones are Bluetooth v5.0 compatible enabling quick pairing, low latency/lag, and favorable battery life. But that's where the (better part of the) story ends. Build quality (plasticky), packaging (no headphone case), and performance (watered down audio quality and noise-canceling) are subpar.Rather than throw money on a less-than-satisfactory pair of headphones, it is better to wait for a significant price drop for the SONY WH-1000XM3 (as the next iteration of the premium headphones is due any time soon) and buy those instead."
5,"I am a long term XB400 user and now upgrading I was confused about between XB900N and this CH710N.I read a lot of negative comment/reviews on Amazon and random youtubers, However I checked the Overall sound quality and performance, I was average, and yeah that's what a consumer gets under 10K.Let me straightaway share my experiencePROS1. Build Quality is really impressive (please don't believe the random people saying it a cheap plastic, its a textured plastic and a really good one), earpads depth is a bit low but still good enough clearance for my ears and if you have really big ears then avoid these.2. Light weight, yes very light, some unexperienced players out there will say these feel like a cheap one, and yes because most premium products are made heavy to give premium feelings, but light weight helps, no neck pain or ear pressure3. Sound Quality - 4/5 - Bass is just enough for me, it has thump on top volume.4. Format support - I used iPhone 11 pro, it blew me out, AAC is supported on them so it was obvious, I used it on windows via audio jack, It was a bit low in quality (compared same song, but yeah audio drivers plays a big role)5. Noise Cancellation - Yeah that's what make them worth 10K, and some oversmart people in reviews are comparing it to 1000XM3 (I have used those), they are of course better as the price is 2.5X but for 10K it provides 60-70% quality to 1000XM36. AUX CABLE - really good one, its thin but really good, its reneforcedCONS1. Vocals - Sometimes vocals are not so clear due to heavy bass2. No Sony App Support - If Sony Support comes to these then we will be able to control bass and clear out vocals when needed.I will update after some weeks of usage."
1,"*Worst product ever from sony.*Build quality is really cheap.*No finishing.*ANC is just for namesake purpose. It doesn't work at all.*Poor Packaging*Sound quality is poor too, lacks bass n volume is too low.*Sony app not supported."
1,"Sound quality and other things r good. But the problem with this headphone is that it causes motion sickness. Pleas be aware that the Ambient noise and ANC mode in this headphone is of average quality and it causes headache, nausea and dizziness. After half an hour of using the headphones I feel like I am going to throw up. These headphones aren't good for people who get any kind of motion sickness.Better to use normal headphones than these cheap ANC headphones.Also, manufacturer should give a disclaimer about it. Its a serious concern. Its important to inform customers that it affects their health.Sony should better be aware and make these headphones better suited to all kinds of customers."
3,"Reviewing after two replacements, and a month of use.Build quality: Very plasticky but light weight and scratch resistant design. Received damaged product initially, had to replace it.Sound - Music: Fairly good, but not extraordinary. You might find occasional crackling sound depending upon the file being played.Sound - Calls: Flawless clarity, and probably the only area where it scores big.Mic: Replaced faulty ones due to mic issues where mic wasn't working. But, no issues with the replacement. Mic is good in its segment and captures voice clearly even if speaking at low pitches. Good at filtering background noises.Noise cancellation: Does the job decently but only in wireless mode. Not for music buffs; if you have a bigger budget for go for Sony XM3-1000.Comfort: Very light weight at around 200 gms, but comfort is a subjective thing. For me, I develop fatigue in about 1 to 2 hour of continuous use, so have to take a break of 5-10 minutes in between. But, largely very comfortable for day to day use. Ideal for office skype/zoom calls.Connectivity: Doesn't support active multi connection. You will be able to connect only one device at a time. For laptops, make sure you change the default device to this headset for audio and recording for seamless connectivity.Battery: One full charge lasts all day long use for 3 to 4 days.Wear n tear: You gotta take care of these things. Items like these won't last long if you mis-treat them."
5,"This is definitely a great product from SONY.Here are the PROS & CONS:-1. Build Quality is really impressive.2. Light weight, no neck pain or ear pressure3. Sound Quality is clear4. Noise Cancellation is of course better5. AUX CABLE - really good one, its thin but really good.t6. Fast Charging -USB C type7.& MIC quality & Noise cancelling function is just greatCONS:-1. Vocals -Sometimes vocals are not so clear2.Bass quality is average"
3,"Being a Sony Product, it doesn't live up to its name to certain extent. Built quality is reasonable, though not premium. The Physical buttons on the headphone are rather ordinarily built. Sound is ok. Nothing great. Battery life is very good.This headphone is not compatible with Sony Head phone app or Sony Music Centre app which is a big let down. Hopefully, Sony will upgrade it's app to include these soon. Now, the Noise Cancellation Part... It has an Ambient sound on/ off toggle, but frankly I couldn't distinguish between the two. The same switch is used for noise cancellation.  Noise cancellation is nothing extra ordinary. In fact, despite noise cancellation being active, one can still hear lot of ambient sounds, though suppressed. Even car engine sound inside the cabin is not fully suppressed. On other set up,  high intensity low frequency hum was audible. So, not very satisfied with noise cancellation part. The headphones were moderately comfortable for long usage."
1,"Noise cancellation is quite less. You won't feel much difference with or without noise cancelling on. I have used 1000mx3 headphones before too. So, I have a benchmark to compare the noise cancelling. This one is nothing compared to 1000mx3.  Plus it causes a lot of cabin pressure without giving much noise cancelling feature. Passive noise-cancelling blocks 30% noise and Active noise cancelling take it to at max 40%. So you still hear 60% of the noise around. In 1000mx3, passive noise-cancelling was cancelling 30% noise and active noise cancelling was taking it to 90%. So you hear only 10% of ambience sound. These ones are not at all effective for high-frequency noise cancelling like TV sound or room chatter or utensils sound. 1000mx3 are quite effective at high-frequency noise cancellation.About sound quality, I am not a good judge of sound quality. But I also own a pair of JBL Tune 700BT, which cost around 4.5k. And, I don't find much difference in their sound quality and its sound quality. And I find that their passive noise-cancelling only was cancelling 50% of the noise. So, instead of buying this, buy a normal good pair of headphones with decent ear cups or go for 1000mx3."
1,"This is a 40 days review. The sound quality is good, noise cancellation is good for the price tag and battery life is awesome. I should be giving this a 4 or 5 star rating.But I will give it 1 star. Here is the reason:I just found that the left ear plastic which hides the wiring has broken. I have never stretched it too much, let it fall or hit it anywhere as it is of Rs 9000 or so. But it still has automatically cracked within 40 days. Now, I can't even replace the headphones. Very bad build quality and a total waste of money."
3,"It’s very cheap looking and Noise-cancelling is just next to not having, I can hear the celling fan running 🤣 and the mesh covering the speaker are like a piece of cloth just sticked for the name sake. And the worst part is I can’t return or exchange it even if I asked for a return on the same day of delivery.26th September 2020- now all the plastic on my headphone band broke up with just the pressure of removing it from head. Don’t buy it."
5,Awesome pair
1,"DO NOT BUY!!  I can go on and on about the problems I faced with this headphone after using it for 4 months.Evry time it connects via bluetooth, the auto voice says that the headphone is connected and it also says ambience sound off/on or nice cancellation. And the mode doesnt stay the same once power is off and on. So evry meeting I miss the initial 15 seconds of the meeting.Battery % is discrete, it either says battery is 20%,,50% or 70% and you would never get to know what exactly is the battery %. Which decade are you in, sony designers??Coming to calls, the stupidest thing is if you are not on mute, the people on the other end complain of noise from their end. Most of the time goes in muting and uniting the device during meetings. If noise cancellation is not ON, people on receiving end have problem hearing you.The connecting wire is too small, I cannot move away more than 2 feet from the pc.You will have to press and hold the power button like forever to turn on or off. I dont understand why would a 10k worth headphone have this kind of sluggishness.It does not connect to two devices at a time, which is a manageable problem though but I would expect that when they are costing this much.It's been 4 months of usage and the layers are already ripping out, very disappointing cheap product.It gets heated up in the left ear if you connect to pc.Noice output is also not loud enough.Overall, what a worst experience!Review Coming from an electronics engineer"
1,"The ear pads are within the months start tearing and looking very odd to use.When I take to Sony service Center Pune, they told me that it will not cover on warranty as the pad and head band.Very odd looking and you could not able to use this headset outside.Bad experience."
3,"While the product does decently well in the Noise Cancellation department which is its mainstay in terms of features, what I was really REALLY disappointed about was the build quality on this thing. Just a month after purchase, the plastic on the side bands has started to fall away like ice cream in the summers. Literally fall away. The usage was also not that high, I only used it during calls and such. To add insult to injury, I am on an EMI for this, so essentially have to pay every month for a product that didn't last even a month of use (the warranty does not cover physical damage). The lower end Sony headphones didn't have this issue, no idea why this pair is this defective."
4,"Battery life is amazing. You can go on listening to good music and still the headphones would say ""fully charged"".But I've faced two issues:1. Gets disconnected randomly.2. Mic doesn't work on specific devices (like my work laptop).But I guess this isn't a problem with everybody so please check before you buy.But otherwise, the product is great."
1,"I bought this on 12th Feb 2020 and the plastic broke on 20th Feb 2020. Please don't buy this cheap plastic Headphones because of the brand name. With this cost you can buy so many other quality items in other brands. Trust me, noise cancelling is not so optimistic but it does work and bass is ok. Consider other brands for 8k rs.Warranty won't cover this type of damage is the worst part.Am disappointed sony"
4,Been using them for five or take two months now. The sound quality improves over time. You need to break in these headphones properly. Don’t just expect them to work out of the box. Noise cancelling is subpar at best. But at the price point can you really complain?One glaring emission is the lack of multi device support. I’ve tried the lot. Both on Mac and PCs. Android and iOS. It just simply doesn’t work.If you can make do with this all but small miss. Then you should buy it. Cushions are soft and plush. Soundstage is flat and balanced. You get enough bass. Not Beats or Skullcandy levels.
2,"The reason am giving this 2 stars is because the headphones are great to listen to music but HORRIBLE for taking calls.I bought these thinking i could dual purpose it for my office Teams calls and swap it over for my entertainment too. But, there is so much distortion and lack of clarity and the mic makes it sound like I am stuck in a cave.Don’t buy it if you want to use it for work.On the entertainment side, heavy on the bass and above average mid levels.Active noise cancelling is a gimmick. Just move to a quiet place and use regular headphones."
4,"These are my first pair of sub-premium headphones so I don't know how it compares to other premium headphones but here's my take.I got it for ₹8100 during prime day sale and for that price I'm very satisfied.It has good sound quality with sufficient bass. If you're a bass head these are not for you.The comfort level is also decent, I wear specs and I don't have a problem in the first hour of wearing them but after that I do need to take them off for a couple of minutes.Noise cancellation is fine. I mean for the price range you don't expect miracles and it blocks out nearly everything in the room unless there's a super loud fan or someone is talking to you then you'll hear that.There's no lag while playing games in bluetooth mode.I've deducted 1 star due to the lack of multiple device support. I do switch between devices often and though the pairing process is lightning fast, the extra step of pairing every time can be a bit of an inconvenience if you switch devices a lot.Overall I'm satisfied with this product and I'd recommend it to fellow buyers."
2,"Pros:1. Sturdy2. Good for music3. Good mobile connectivityCons:1. Keeps disconnecting from laptop2. Even if connected, keeps dropping from calls - I need to disconnect and reconnect to be able to hear3. Scratch prone plastic4. While on calls, the folks on the other side complained about echosBottom line: My purpose was for taking calls as well as listen to music while working on my laptop (with the headphones connected to my laptop). The purpose was not served, hence returned the same"
3,"For the price I expected better. I am on calls all day long and so I bought these as an alternative to in ear buds so that I can change from time to time. Having buds stuck inside can be painful for hours. However I don't find these particularly comfortable either. They're a little heavy and tight (may be my head is slightly larger than average). And they do cause sweat. I briefly tested out the on ear phones (the lower price point) and found those more comfortable as they don't cup your ear and press your earlobes.As for sound quality, audio is fine, nothing super. Noise canceling is average, like one of the reviewers here commented. Nothing out of the ordinary...Amazon delivery was reliable so no issues there.Overall, now that I've spent 10k buying it I have to use it!"
3,"The item was as described.  the batter life is amazing.  I have been using it for more than 10 days now (on and off for atleast 2 hours per day) and battery still says 70% and haven't charged it yet. The sound it Ok.  the quality of the material, the layer which is between the ear drivers and ear (its very thin) could be better for the price tag apart from that no complains as of now.Noise cancellation is not that great."
5,Firstly i really thank amazon for the 1 day dilevery... So let me tell you it's a replacement model at first i got refurbished or what idk it doesn't sounds like Sony!! But this one is amazing 😍 so tbh sound quality is excellent nothing less expected than sony but don't buy it if you need a thumping bass or extra loud sound! It provides you an enrich sound with natural bass! It's not from Sony's extra bass series... And when i came to battery life that literally worked for 15 hours non stop and it still says 30 percent with anc on i haven't charged it after buying... And i got 70 percent when i got this so 50% for 15 hours is awesome! Rest build quality is pretty decent according to the price and these headphones are really very bery comfortable! Anc is good as expected... You can't complaint about it! Am repeating again it's not for massive bass so don't give bad reviews after purchasing! Thank you have a good day reader! ☺️
5,"Bought this as a birthday gift and the person loved it. They tell me battery life is insanely long and charging times are short with a fast charger. Sound is classic Sony, with not very high bass but very clear vocals and sound seperation. Noise cancellation is really good too, but don't expect it to completely drown out sounds from the environment. Overall, I'm super happy with the purchase."
5,"Love the headphones. Sound quality is amazing. Noise cancelation is amazing. I get cabin pressure in my ears and need to pop them sometimes. Initially, got a headache because of that. But I've gotten used to it. Although have to pop my ears in between. I don't know if that's the device's fault or my own, because of my ears. But apart from that. Really happy with the headphones. Good value for money."
3,"Poor build quality. The plastic itself is alright but the headphone as a whole is not sturdy.ANC is acceptable when playing audio. Cannot be compared to the high end Sonys and Bose units, but it's alright for 50% of the price.Sound quality - typical V shaped tuning with rolled off highs, nothing special about it.The provided 3.5-3.5mm cable is the worst thing in the box, absolutely pathetic - makes me suspicious if I received a fake unit.Overall, it's alright. I just expected a bit more for 8k"
4,"It was not as good I expected it to be. The sound is good but it's not good for proper music( the high-quality type) and don't even think about audio rendering in this, I don't want to get started with that. The fit is perfect, I have a big face. And it sometimes hurt wearing them for more than one hour. I will suggest you save more money and buy the more expensive version. It has some problems with Bluetooth as well but it only comes when there are multiple sources of sound. Works fine when the lead is there. Its also not BASS boosted so I don't have the most amazing experience."
2,"A very good product. For me bass is also good though music is personal choice.Connectivity is good. I tried going on roof while phone was down. Just on above the room, connectivity is there.One bad thing is no multi device connectivity. it can connect to only one device at a time. However, positive thing is if you close bluetooth on one device it automatically connect to next available paired device or if finds none, switch off to save power.One weird thing I am facing is, if you connect to older devices having bluetooth less than 4.2, audio will go mute in between calls or playback once you switch it. Ex if you watching movies, audio will go off when next movie play in same app and in continuity. Workaround turn off bluetooth and turn on again.Noice cancelling is there but not that effective. However it supress basic noice for caller. And noice cancelling only reduce sounds until something is playing or speaking. If there is a pause or low music, you can hear the world around you even noice cancelling is on.Battery backup is good. But so called 35 hrs I am not getting instead it's about 12 hrs or less. But need to test again.Edited- 3stars cuz of Amazon. I got defective piece. Bluetooth with laptop was getting disconnected auto in few min in between calls and cable was not working. Amazon replcaed it fast but now this new product I have issue with cushions. They are not soft and back of ear start paining after some time as well as issue with noice cancelling. It's kinda not working. Disappointed with Amazon this time. Will try replace again. If not working then return it."
2,"Didnt feel worth the price (10k), have been hearing a lot of complaints about voice not being clear during call from the person at the other end.Sound/Music is OK, but felt you can get the same effects on a sony headphone less then half its price.Would really like to return it but the return period of 7 days had just passed.Suggest to look for other options as I bought it even after seeing lot of negative reviews only because I have been using Sony products from a long time and was really happy with it untill now."
5,"This is an amazing price of hardware.Performance wise, the Noise Cancellation aspect is amazing.  I am not an audiophile, but am using it to block out traffic and construction noise.  It is absolutely fantastic in that aspect.  Motorcycles and tractors, going past at 30-40 km, you don’t hear anything.  Zero. They have an ambient sound setting, which you should use in high traffic areas.In addition to blue tooth, it has a wired connection. I am able to use my legacy devices, like the FLAC player. (see picture)Charging is via the newer USB port."
5,"One of my friend recommend me this product, and I couldn't believe Sony could offer noise cancellation with AI at this price, but after using these, it has changed my perspective about Sony. Sony has really created a product for this generation, light weight, noise cancellation with AI, comfortable and long battery life. Best part is, it offers C-type charging port. The only down side I felt was plastic built, but at this price with quality and features this product is really great."
4,"Overall - 9/10. My only issue is with Comfort- which i hope will resolve over usage.Sound - 9/10. Feeling little in balanced at times, but not very noticeable. Sound quality is very good for this price range. Vocals, Bass are good. Noise cancellation is decent for non-vocal sounds.Comfort- 7/10. There is clamp force, which may appeal to others for secure grip. However, i feel long use puts pressure on ears. Also Sony could improve padding on par with other headphones at this price range.Battery- 10/10. Looks like i need to charge this only 2-3 times per week. I use them to tale calls, music etc wigh avg of 4-5 hours a day. They retain charge for long time.Bluetooth- 10/10. Connectivity is excellent as i can roam to another floor while my phone is charging."
3,"The headphones look nice and fit is comfortable and snug. But sound quality is not up to my expectations. Earler was using B&W P5 S2 headphones. The price difference of 20 k vs 8k is there, but still a 8k headphone was supposed to be good. It sounds sort of hollow and more tilted to low frequency band and hence the taught audio and clear high notes are missing."
5,"Excellent product in priceQuality productGood Noise cancellationGood Sound qualityOverall, KID is happy and can wear headphones for a long time to attend his online class.We had ""Sony Walkman NW-WS623 4GB Wireless MP3 Player with Bluetooth and NFC (Black),"" which is also a good quality product but somehow not good for long time use such as online class. It makes ears uncomfortable after hour usage."
3,"I purchased this for taking office calls. But, was disappointed. Plus, this item was non returnable so got stuck with it. There is a difference between replacement and returnable policy which people tend to overlook while ordering. So, pay special attention to that detail for any item. Here is my experience so far with the headset:Pros-1. Excellent battery life.2. Sound quality is acceptable.Cons-1. Fit is not comfortable at all. Due to over the ear shape and ANC mode you will get headache or start feeling dizzy if you are walking. The upper head band is also not that soft.There is a warning note as well in the manual which says that do not pull headphones all of a sudden from your head. Otherwise, it can damage your ears due to vaccum created for noise cancellation.2. Was picking noise far from background. In reality, the distant noise was not that loud but somehow the microphone of this headset picked it up and amplified it. Thus, I didn’t find it ideal for making office calls through teams/skype.3. If you are having single band wifi router (2.4ghz), do NOT purchase this. Because all wireless Bluetooth peripherals works on the same frequency. This causes interference with wifi signals and you won’t have good experience especially while making calls.If you are having dual band router (5ghz), then it should be fine."
3,"not meeting the expectations.The noise cancelation is not good. It does not cancel it but decreases noice, But you can still hear a noise and get distracted.I use it with Samsung A50 and Dell Laptop; with both devices, the audio output is good.  The beats are clear and the audio is also good.I use it for my WFH call as well as during meditation and workouts. the sound could have been better more punch with headphones which are of 10K or above but overall it is good."
3,"This Sony product really went under my expectations. I never thought I'd say that.Pros: Cool looks(I guess?)Cons:Inadequate performance overall.Extremely average sound delivery specially coming from Sony. Yes, a little all-rounder Realme Buds Air 2 leaves this in the dust.Bass is faint.Noise cancellation is almost non-existent.Ambient mode is useless at higher volume."
3,"If you pay 10k , expect it to be comfortable enogh for long use. Somehow i dont feel cofortable using it, constant itching in left ear due to its design.Sound: sound quality is good.Noise cancelation: prettry good for this price range.Felt they should have work little bit more on build quality , it would have been great product"
5,They are really a beast . Vocals are crisp even at high bass is just above average but give a nice feel and are super comfortable at this price point these are the best
5,According to price product is more good by my exceptation... happy to buy full money saver and awesome product.... happy to buy from Amazon...I have a best shopping experience here....gud service and delivery on time...#happy with boult
5,Super Bass...  Sounds quality is good .. Rich feel..  Awesome looks
3,"The sound output is good, it has good bass, the product is marketed as saying that it provide high quality braided cables, I did not get those as shown in the picture , and the package was mangled up when i received it , i was a little worried, that the product would have been damaged, when tested, it is working fine, because it was a need of the hour for me, I have decided to keep it, this is the reason why I'm giving 3 starts.  No braided cables received, No manual in the box, need info on Max voltage input to charge this headset , handling of the package, one more problems with this headphone is that , people complain that my voice is very low on phone calls, and the MIC volumes are too low on my laptop."
1,"A Truly Pathetic Headphone With Baddest Mic, Wrong Desriptionbabout Crystal Clear Mic.. Speakers are Clearly audible To everyone from Outside..Very BadNever Buy..Very Bad Experience."
3,"overall the quality music is awesome never had such experience in other headphonesI would recommend buying this,CONS:1. The Bluetooth is not so strong to hear a song in a terrace, audio breaks like anythingin a closed room, u won't find anything like a break-in the signal2. The aux cable is totally not lengthy not suitable for PUBG like games Bluetooth audio is slow for gamesand aux is not fitted properly and it's not a dependent onePROS:1. good audio, awesome everything to hear and noise cancellation is really good"
2,"There were issues from the beginning. First, Amazon delivered a package which came with an empty box, without headphones. So, I returned the box and Amazon promptly replaced it. But, the package did not have a User Manual.Every time I used these head-phones on an office conference call, the others complained of heavy background noise.The connecting cord is short.  Bluetooth syncing with different devices is not working as seamlessly as it should.Build quality and packaging is flimsy."
1,"Noise cancellation doesn't work in this product, I tried to return but policy is not allowing me to return and get my refund . hence putting this feedback. I am not happy with such product and quality , I will not recommend this product for official purpose.  Please don't buy and stuck like me .ThanksUmesh Sharma"
5,"Review 3 month kaKhula hua package mila soo bad, andar sab kuch tha 2 rupe wali cables or kuch bina matlab ki books.Battery backup: 10 hrs bataya hai advertised,2 din chalta hai bhai bina ruke.Bass quality: Kaan hila ke rakh deta hai... Bass heads ke liye perfect h... It's gives you eargasm...Comfort: itna khas nahi hai par chal jayega..Noise cancellation : passive noise cancellation hai iss liye normal sonds like engine, fusfusahat, chalne firne ki aawaje nahi aati haiBaki sari aawaje aati hai par thodi kam, total mila ke thikthak.Bluetooth connectivity: bhoot hai mere liye, me apne mobile ko charge laga ke pure ghar me ghumta hun....Mic. Bakwas×1000× googole^Or kya bacche ki jaan loge 1200 me😂"
4,"It's a good package overall.To be honest, if you do heavy music or gaming, I won't recommend it.I bought it with comfort as my first priority, which however isn't that good (at-least for long sessions) but otherwise I have no complains.The Bluetooth experience was really good, no issues with that.WARNING!! For long music/video or some serious gaming sessions, a good wired earphone is still the king of arena.Regarding the price, I feel its bit overpriced. It feels like a 1K headphone cause sound quality isn't that good. They should have specified the driver size, etc. So, buy it at your own risk.I'm not a tech reviewer but still these are my initial thoughts."
2,"1. Anything you listen, even at 50% volume, is audible to people in other room as well. They should be categorized as mini speakers rather than headphones2. Aux cable provided in the box is too short for using with laptop/computer3. Even with music playing, we can hear everything (zero noise cancellation)Worst product and note that there is no refund for this item => you end up with same piece again!"
5,Review after using 15 days.... Till now happy with the performance of the head phone sound quality is excellent...Sound Gives hall effect ...mic is good. Battery back up is good.. But colour choice was not available. One can say excellent product at the price band of Rs 13k.  Will provide review after 6 months of use
5,"Battery Backup:10/10Sound quality:10/10Bass:9.5/10Build:9.5/10Comfort:9.5/10Packaging was very good. Light weight & Battery backup is commendable. I use it for 4 - 5 hrs continuously, but battery reduction was minimal.Very good audio quality with passive noise cancellation. Microphone is also very effective with clear sound. Worth every penny. Just go for it. you'll love it.Overall, best value for money !!"
4,The looks and feel of the product are good. The sound quality is poor. Obviously I won't expect from a product made of steal data from a successful product in the market. I want to ask all the sellers to come to discuss your annual requirement and try to fund a single company which can make all products according to your budgets and specifications. This way we can unlock our domestic market potential.
2,"First day after seeing 100% charge and good sound quality, was impressed though material quality was not that good. But after 2 days only it drained charge and while plugged in for charge, not even charging for starting headphone also after 2-3 hrs charging. Later it started sounding whenever plugged in for charging, though not charging at all. Working if used aux cable, but did not charged at all. Returned."
5,"I have heard many headphones, but i choose very wisely.I love this over the ear headphones with a theatre kind of feeling with noise cancellation.Also one more good good thing is, it comes up with wire if incase battery of bluetooth is not available.They also call once for support and feedback which i think no headphone company does."
1,I wish i could give rating in - minus.I am using boult wired headphone and Bluetooth speaker which have extreme bass and sound quality. Keeping this in view and this bluetooth headphone look i went for this product. But sad to say my 999 rupees just gone in vein. Waste of money. As a music and bass lover very disappointed with this product. Refrain your self from buying this product and save ur money. Sayd ye 999 rupey chori kiye the mene.
2,"I am not at all satisfied with the product, though sound is quality decent for hearing video/songs but something is missing... so 7 out of 10. About battery backup... its better than expected, 10 out of 10. I took this product for work for home purpose but it really disappointed me. While calling there is a issue of background noice. Sometimes me or the other person is unable to hear the conversation clearly. I am disappointed with the overall performance of the product except its battery, which is really good it goes for more than a day to two."
5,"The product under such a price range is excellent.I got it for a 75% discount.The ear cushions are good and comfortable.Headphones are not so heavy.Both, wireless and wired modes are available.The auxiliary cable comes with the headphone.The battery life is so good. Once you charge it fully, it will last for about 10 hours or more or continuous use or a week if used for a few hours daily.The noise cancellation is okay.The Bluetooth wireless connection however, is a little weak.The sound gets off for a moment very often in wireless and lags often in gaming and watching live streams.Thus, wired one is much better than the wireless connection.The sound quality is awesome.Super bass boost and high volume.Somehow, the sound is higher in Bluetooth and lower in wired one.Overall, it is a good product and good choice for such a low price.One can definitely go for it for low budget."
1,"I returned it, fragile and not comfortable for wearing for more than 2 hours"
3,"At this price range these headphones offer decent sound quality and if you like more bass than you will also like these headphones.But these headphones also comes with compromises such as:- very cheap build qualilty- you can not use these headphones for long sessions ,they create pain after using for 1 hr.- also the fitting of these are very tight at your ears and as a result it starts creating sweat on your ear cushions.- controls of these headphones are very confusing"
4,"I have used this product for now 2 days, its a very good product in this price range. Sound Quality is good and it definitely has good bass. The overall build quality of the product is great feels premium. Bluetooth range is good, I tried it by keeping my laptop in one room and headphone in other and it dint got disconnected.Only thing I felt it should have is a little bit bigger cups which actually fits over-ear, because of which it cannot be continuously used for more than an hour it hurts your outer ear, other than that it's a nice product in the price range."
2,Not worth for buying.sound quality is pathetic.bass is muddy.midrange frequency is boosted.vocals are clear.bass and treble is missing.flimsy built.slight pain in ear.cheap looking.Returned the very next day.Amazon is really good.they refunded the money.and i ordered boat 550.amazing headphone.
3,"the headphone looks good, but is a bit bulky, my ears start aching after 1hr of use. the cushions are comfy but it makes my ears heat up too soon, and makes me uncomfortable. the bass quality is good but the ""voice"" in songs isn't much good. the major problm is its heaviness that sits on my head.  also my *inline mic* is not working, i dont know if i should return this....... the mic is supposed to work or is its just a hole?edit: the mic is too low, i cannot shout in my cabin to talk to someone on call. i request the seller to give me refund for the above and not a replacement"
3,"For around 1k, I wasn't expecting super-duper quality, so I am satisfied with this. The so called MRP of 4k is wayyy overpriced.The good: Decent quality sound, bass. Very little background noise. Ideal for having some respite from the annoying outside noises from construction, street hawkers and ignorant honking vehicles. Bluetooth connects quickly and the range is good in a straight line. At 1k, you can't expect much and this does a fair job for the money.The bad: For some reason, as soon as you connect the headphones via bluetooth, the volume shoots up to almost max on the audio player e.g. youtube or vlc, etc... This is potentially harmful for your ears! The padding for the ears is soft and comfy enough but could be better. After a few hours it can feel uncomfortable. The volume grading could be better. The lowest volume setting is what should be at least 3. The plastic is cheap, toylike. The low battery warning. I have never noticed the flashing red light that is supposed to indicate low battery (I doubt most people would) so we have to rely on the audio notification. Unfortunately, this comes at the very last stage when it annoyingly repeats around every 15 seconds. The audio alert should ideally start earlier when there is about an hour remaining.The ugly: The user manual! What a joke! It's tiny! In places like Europe they have standards for such material where the text needs to be a minimum size. This would definitely fail. What is the point of making it so tiny? Might as well just give us a link to the website where we can read it properly. Finally, the customer service. What can I say? It doesn't seem to exist. Numerous numbers are provided on the website, manual, etc... none of them work. After selecting 1 for English, and then 1 for new enquiry, the call disconnects. Contacting through the messenger on the Facebook page is not much help either. Not even sure if it is a human responding there. Standard auto replies suggesting to call the very same numbers that don't work. One of the reasons I bought this was because it is made in India. Is this really the best we can do?"
1,"Even the Sound is getting static. Headphone is charged 100% but still . Voice is not clear.Issue with MIc was already there. its a complete waste of money, My money 1099 was wasted completely.I have purchased the Headphone on 18th October but facing an issue with Bluetooth Microphone. Facing trouble when connected to any Whatsapp Calling or Google Duo Video conference on my desktop. Persons on other end is unable to hear my voice properly, Voice is getting static.Send email to complaints@boultaudio.com but still no response."
5,"it is an amazing product, very good sound quality and it is very comfortable to wear, i am using these headphones since 3 months now and i am very satisfied with this product, would love to try more products.but, As soon ass you plug in the jack in your device, the bass is lost/reduced. The headphones will start sounding flat. With only the highs and mids, no lows. also there is a bit of problem in connection with my laptop, i=but i am really happy with the sound qualityOtherwise the headphones are amazing."
5,This was the first time when I bought a product of boult after it was delivered  I was really happy to see my boult thunder bass headphones which have a classy look and are easy to use being stylish with advanced features at a very reasonable price.  The sound quality is amazing just like its look and it completely cancels noise so I can listen to songs being in public and take online classes sitting with family because of its noise cancellation features and good base . I have been using this product for long time now not a single problem occurred it's working amazingLoved the product .
4,"I have been using this headphone for almost a month now. I purchased this majorly for making o/g calls for my official purpose. However I do use it for listening to music and seeing webseries.Pros:1) The sound quality is amazing. Especially when connected through USB cable.2) Battery back-up is superb.3) Quality of sound while recording is also nice.Cons:1) Noise-cancellation is least effective.2) One needs to disconnect and connect the bluetooth every time to use the bluetooth connectivity option.3) Voice breaks sometimes through Bluetooth connectivity but is more effective via USB cable.4) After a prolonged usage, ear pains slightly along with sweating (try adjusting it to different positions)."
1,"Forget about the sound quality and others please ensure about Quality of the product. Worst design it will be get broken exactly after your Return policy completion. Worst body quality, Hate this one alot, please stay away of this product."
4,"The product is good.  Sound could have been better. But no complaint overall with the product but, when the product arrived it was already opened. there is a sticker mentioning don't open if seal is broken but someone has opened it and used cellotape to close it.With the warranty and other manual stuff opened from the small red package Boult had given. Please in future please look on to it Amazon."
4,"Sound quality is satisfactory, but the quality of the plastic material is dissatisfactory; finishing is average, not really appreciable. Colour combination looks good, and bluetooth connectivity range is also good. Average for the price..."
1,"Received a open seal box. After opening saw few hairs, looks like its a used piece."
4,"Not for gaming (I knew it before I even got this), noise cancellation is like.... Yeah, it stops a little noise. Bass is really amazing(tune it with your equilizer for perfect sound) and it's comfy enough.Wireless range is not really awesome but it's good when you're somewhat near your phone. And the mic works in wired mode but not the buttons. Mic isn't pretty bad. Well I'm writing this after about a month. I'm satisfied for the price I got this for."
4,"Good sound quality, built quality is fantastic at this prize also connectivity is also good, however many times it’s automatically changes from Bluetooth to phone while on call which is irritating. One point worth to mention is mike is not up to the mark and its quite uncomfortable if you put them on for more than an hour so keep it in mind while buying this . Other then this amazing product, i have been using it for more than 3 months and I’m totally satisfied with it value for money product."
2,Though I wanted to return iam made to keep it forcefully coz by mistake the set box was thrown which had the adapters.  This set looks stylishly but there is absolutely no noise cancelation nor there is peaceful time with that. I get a weird noise in between the usage for about 5 seconds during which I cannot listen to anything and that occurs every 2 minutes makes it so irritating.  Not at all happy with this product
5,I am Boult audio thunder user and I am fully satisfied by this product. The notice cancellation is good but then too you can hear loud noises of vehicles. The sound quality is better. The battery life for bluetooth connection is best because If it is fully charged then it can work for almost one day but I the battery gets over then you can continue using it with the help of cord which we get free with it and the cord is also of comfortable length. One thing I didn't liked is that it is sensitive if you hit the speakers then it looses the sound from that side but it automatically gets recovered in one day.
5,"Great headphones! The sound quality with the cable is just freakin' awesome! Even when there's no music playing, I can't hear anyone when I put this beast on my ears. The bluetooth connectivity is great and responsive too! It has a good range and day long battery and charges fully in about an hour! Though, sound over bluetooth has a 100ms delay, which is very much recognisable when gaming, but I guess that's with every other bluetooth headphone. With Aux cable, these headphones are just what I was looking for!"
4,First of all its sound quality extremely awesome as well as noise cancelation and Bluetooth quality. Material was also gud but only one drawback is I felt painish on my right ear while using this product  even I couldn't use this headset for 30 minutes continuously. I wouldn't like to return this item but only for paining issue I'm returning this product that's y I gave 4 stars.. ..otherwise all are good worth for money
5,Ordered this 2 weeks ago and fully charged on Day 1. Since then i haven't charged it yet and still the battery is 10% left. It easily runs for 10 days on a single charge.Complete noise cancellation ensures you only listen to high quality music.Would highly recommend this product.***** 5 star
5,"First of all Thank You Harman for launching an affordable headphone. Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it. You won't regret afterall it is by HARMAN.#thelongestreview?"
5,"Would I recommend this product to others? Definitely yes.Pros:Light WeightBattery LifeCons:No 3.5 mm cable, only blue toothI was in search of a light weight wireless headphone that I can use for long hours. I have a Bose now but I cannot use it for longer than 2-3 hours as its heavy and ears and head start aching.This Infinity one wins there. I have used it for 6-7 hours without any aches or pains.The ear pieces do press a little on the ears unlike over-the-ear ones. This one is on-the-ear.  But it is not uncomfortable and gives a good fit.The sound quality is good too. Noise cancellation is not big. With low volumes, you can hear surrounding noise.Battery does last for a long long time. I used it daily for 4-5 hours for about 3 days with one charge. Am truly impressed with it.And it folds, hence carrying it around is convenient too.And I got it in the lightning deal at 1500 Rs. Worth the price. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a non-expensive wireless headphones with a decent sound quality.I am giving it a 4 because I am not sure of its durability. If it lasts foe 6 months at least, then I will come back and update the rating to a 5."
5,"Hi all,After a week rough usage i am sharing my opinion.i through that under 1499 INR i should not expect the headset with all features except sound,but this one made ,my through wrong.One of the best budget product it is. ""Infinity (JBL) Glide 500 Wireless On-Ear Dual EQ Deep Bass Headphones with Mic (Charcoal Black)"".Pros:--1.product quality is good on this price.2.sound quality is extraordinary,especially ""Gaana website songs"" are awesome,prime video streaming sound experience just like a theater.3. Battery backup ~20hrs is good is this product.Cons:--1.aux port not enabled in this version.2.No other reasons here."
1,Not liked because his product is made in China so that I am returning
1,"Hello Amazon Team,In the Carton box it is mentioned as Manufactured in USA but in the product it mentioned as China . This is breach case , pls look into & Update."
2,"I bought this headphone as a replacement for my in-ear headset. I attend lot of office calls due to WFH. I wanted to have a Bluetooth headphone with great battery life and decent mic quality. To be honest, I can't use these headphones for more than a hour, my ears are paining a lot. The cushioning is very poor and cheap quality. Giving two Star, as it is basic sense to design a headphone with proper cushioning for comfort. People who enjoy too much bass can be happy."
5,This product is better than its old counterpart i.e. JBL infinity 501. With more upgraded features in an affordable price and under a trusted brand. The most catchy thing is it's 36 mm driver and 72 hours playback time as compared to earlier 20 hrs. playback.
1,This is waste of money. Guys Don't go for this headset you will get lot of ear pain and you can't feel any Bass exist in it. Please don't buy it I had purchased later I found such a worst product and returned immediately.
5,Its awesome product...thumping base...ears vibrating bass..bery good sound quality and in a affordable pricing...
5,"I am impressed with sound quality of Infinity glide 510. It's a value product at a reasonable price. My initial impressions.Pros:1. Good sound quality- mids and highs are clear even with a punchy bass.2.Decent build quality at this price.3.Excellent Bluetooth connectivity and range. I am especially impressed with the range.4. Battery life of 72 hrs which is an unbelievable offer at this price.. (I can't comment on battery life now)5.Pretty decent noice cancellation ( not active)Cons:1.The Deep Bass mode is useless, which spoils the sound quality ( It is set in deep bass mode, you can change it to normal mode by long pressing the volume keys together)2. I could feel the pain on the ears after an hour's usage.I am sure, you won't be disappointed with this product. It's quite a catch at this price. Hope it will be durable."
5,"First to write the review I guess,Okay, so harman has done a superb job with the glide 500. I bought it as soon as I saw it.These are for for people on a budget looking for a pair of decent looking and decent sounding headphones.I now use it for my daily use.For the price, this is absolutely amazing.It is a plastic build yet not cheap.a nice matte finish texture,with soft cushions, I have used it for almost 2-3 hours straight and doesnt hurt my ears.Also has three buttons( volume and power) a micro usb slot and infinity branding on the headband and the sides.As for sound its a 10/10. Doesnt get distorted on bass, no screeching on treble and nice smooth mids.Smooth criminal you can call it! I have tried house, RnB , Pop, EDM. Can hear all of em suppressed sounds we usually dont hear on cheap headsets.Double tap for Your assistant, quick response and the best part. Deep bass on Pressing volume up and down together.You cant expect the skullcrushing bass, like I said, you get quality bass which doesnt hurt you. Im a Bass head myself, i really love the bass delivered by this beauty because it is well balanced.Battery backup yet to be monitored, playing wellb for around 8 hours now on no charge yet. Sounding well, overall a premium feel.  I had tried boat,boult,ant and those budget ones..Trust me this is the best Hands down.Superb job Harman, keep up the good work!"
1,"Highly disappointed and dissatisfied . Can't wear for more than 30 min as it starts to pain , completely against of claims in advertising . Battery backup claimed as 72 hrs ... practically 15 hrs . Cushion on ear cups are not soft enough. Bluetooth disconnected after 7-8 metrs ,  If one scrutinized the reviews well , he can understand that top reviews are paid or Fake ."
5,"Enjoy ""AWESOME DEEP BASS EXPERIENCE WITH LONG LASTING BATTERY LIFE"".Another Excellent product from JBL. I am already using JBL INFINITY GLIDE 500 since 6 months and that itself is having such a good battery backup with a of claim of 22 hours. In one charge it goes for a month or so with an average use of 1 hour. I have bought the product 3 times and gifted them to my brother and friends.With this new model claiming 72 hours backup, it will be just awesome. I have used it for 2 days now and with around 5 hours of use battery level has come down from 80% to 70% only.This is lightweight and more comfortable as compared to its previous Glide 500 version.Coming to its performance... It's just awesome for HEAVY BASS crazy people like me.For the best HEAVY BASS EXPERIENCE, please install DI.FM RADIO App from Google Play Store and enjoy few channels like ""Russian Club Mix"", ""Bass & Jackin House"". You will definitely love this product.For CLEAR MUSIC EXPERIENCE, you can install RADIO TUNES and enjoy beautiful music from channels like ""Mellow Smooth Jazz 🎺"", ""Smooth Jazz"" etc.At this price, it's COMPLETELY AWESOME 👌 👌 👌"
1,"Basic functionality of connecting more than 1 device simultaneously via Bluetooth is not available. You have to disconnect from one device so you can connect to other. There are better local brands having this feature. Moreover 40mm driver headset cost same or less than this one, then why should someone buy just because battery lasts for 72 hours. No one listens continuously that long. I am returning this product and so do others if they understand what I mean!!"
2,connectivity - goodcomfort level - goodcall quality - goodmusic quality - below averageeven on flac format song i miss the expected average music quality than samsung level u....
5,"I am amazed at what the Infinity JBL Glide 500 headphone has to offer.Check out the video to learn what I think about it. If you are short on time, read below- Great for listening to songs while workout (I use it daily)- A small footprint makes it look awesome!- Great bass and overall excellent sound quality- Volume increase buttons on headphones seem to be semi-connected to the phone. The volume can go higher than what's shown on the phone.- It connects to the phone in seconds- Great range!- No mute button(con)- Comfortable around neck- Voice quality is decent!If you like my review, do not forget to click the helpful button. It helps me to write and record great content for you guys! Have a great day!"
1,"Infinity (JBL)By harmanI m great fan of jbl - HKBut didn’t expect such bad experience from u.Connected to iPhoneSongs getting disturbed as if Bluetooth out of range.  But phone at 1 foot distance. Songs getting interpreted , annoying experience. Connected in android phone too. Same problem.Pls infinity(jbl)(HK)Dnt disappoint by launching lik this product.Bass is good , very clear and no distortion even in higher volume . Looks good , nice foldable compact headphones , fits nicely on ear. Soft cup feels pleasant while listening music.Could have included 3.5 jack port - aux cable can be used in case of battery exhausted.Blue light always flickering once in 5 sec , disturbing in night - which is not required to flicker."
5,"Using this infinity headphone for the past 1 week and here is the brief review:# Pros:1. Excellent bass, delight to listen music on this headset.2. Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity is top notch..It's connects very quick after pairing.3. Handset Muff's are decently soft.4. Very less external sound creep in when u r listening on minimal volume. In higher volumes, u can't figure that.5. JBL quality sound. Minimal sound distortion in higher volume. 2 different base for unique listening. Very good value for basic listeners..6. Easily adjustable headset leaf so that it can be fitted tightly according to ur head size.# Cons:1. Build quality is basic. Its more of plasticky and looks normal. The turning hinges looks fragile. Till now, no problems faced, will update it long term review.2. Power on/off becomes a tricky function..It take more than 2 sec to power on/off..During power on, it starts syncing for new Bluetooth devices due to the prolonged time.3. Call voice quality is normal. The voice is very low heated from the other end.Apart from the above, the headset is value buy and its one of the excellent, branded headphone choice in the current market."
5,"When there are thousands of headsets in the market including the cheap Chinese ones, I wanted to go for an option from top brands within my budget. Harman being a reputed brand I shortlisted this as my budget was low and purpose was for indoor use only. I am very happy with the call quality (It is at par with my Bose NC headset when you compare indoor performance) I am not a pro so could not find anything wrong with music quality. The range is good as it is Bluetooth 5.0. Lastly the comfort level is good because it is light weight."
1,"I bought as many people said its plastic, but premium. But, its not. Its a very cheap plastic.Sound is very hollow. No punch, or clarity. High and Mid are very dim, bass is ok ok. With the bass boost option, sound is Ok, else its very hollow sounding.For this price of 1499 or cheaper, Boat is way better in both build quality and sound quality.Wont recommend."
4,"1#Actually its hell of a product I have been using for quite long and this is what I feel about it:Pros-1.Battery -It has a long lasting battery as about 72hrs( as company claims) but I am sure no one using it for continuous 72hrs but what I felt is that when I unboxed the product it was 80% and after 3 days of regular usage like music,youtube,movies I was able to make 3 days with 50%remaining i.e 30% for 3 days and it took me about 45 min to chagre it up to 80%2.Sound quality and bass-This thing is a beast regarding bass and sound quality I can asure you that this wont even dissappoint you in case of sound quality and for bass,if you bass lover like me it got 2 mode-normal and deep bass.If you cant feel enough bass at normal mode you can easily shift to deep bass mode by pressing +and -button together then you will feel an astonishing bass effect even you can feel the headphone starts vibration at each beat and if this doesnt make you enough then I recommend you to meet an E.N.T for check-up Dude belive me it's crazy3.Bluetooth range-Its just great because its version 5.0 and provide greater range even after crossing 3 rooms you can get adequate range without breaking any signal4.Microphone-its like a bonus because it has good audio recording but the only problem is that it works only during calling i.e you can use it to record or send voice message in whatsapp5.Usage of buttons is just as simple as it seemsLets get to cons:(Only two minor ones)1.comfort-Actually it is only one negative thing I felt about the device after my first usage .It is a bit uncomfortable to wear and you will feel a slight pain over your pinna (external ear )after using for 1 hr ,but now I became adjust to it now I can wear it for hrs without any problem belive me,it can take some time to adjust and after that you won't feel any problem plus it's is weight less and small device so you will easily adjust within one day2.Plastic quality-(It is my feeling that )it seems to be a little fragile during transport especially keeping it in a bag so beware of thatOther than these 2 minor factor I never felt anything bad about this device.So my verdict is that I usually loves to hear music with a good bass and effect and I have used many device from Sennheiser,Ant audio,Jbl,Boat,Skullcandy,Audio technica,Sony and many more so from my experience I will recommend this device to many and I would say THIS IS THE BEST HEADPHONE IN THE MARKET THAT PROVIDE BLUETOOTH AND SOUND QUALITY AT THIS REASONABLE PRICE POINT IF YOU ARE GONNA BUY A HEADPHONE UNDER 1000 JUST PUSH YOUR MAXIMUM TO THIS PRICE POINT IT WILL ALWAYS BE WORTHY.A GOOD PRODUCT FROM HARMAN AUDIO /JBL AS ALWAYS#But all these good factors vanishes because of the horrible comfort that is why I gave 4 star.Otherthan comfort this is awesome"
1,I absolutely hated it from the moment I started using it. It feels so cheap. Even though I was sitting right in front of my laptop it got disconnected multiple times. My ears started to get hot after some time. I'm trying to return it but apparently I can only replace it. DO NOT BUY THIS!! IT IS A SCAM ! U CAN'T GET A REFUND! THEY WILL send u the same thin again!
3,"SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD, BUT THE HEADPHONES ARE TIGHT AND MAY GIVE YOU PAIN ON LONG USAGE. I have not been able to use it for long time since it's too tight for me... And Irony is Amazon doesn't want give refund to me. I want to go for in-ewr headphones but still they don't want to give the refund. And cherry on cake is Customer care shouts on the customer... @Amazon you need to train your customer care people. Ridiculous experience. Please give my money back if you can so I can have another headphones.Update: Amazon gave my money back, and i was able to buy another headphones. Thank you Amazon."
1,"Pls don't purchase it. It has a sound in right side of headphone. Harman group had told me to send this product. I had parcelled this which cost me around Rs 400. Now they have returned the item again to me without any notice. And when I called, they are saying there is no fault. Such a poor customer service.Sincere request, don't purchase it. It has a prominent sound like vibrating string. Add to this such a poor customer care. Their behaviour is shameless. They should learn from Amazon.Update on 20.nov.19: Customer service of Harman group are shameless. I had some recordings. Everytime they will say we will call you back after 24 hours. But they will never call. I am going to file a case in consumer court.Its not a good headphone at all. Pls purchase other item. Forget about customer care, sound quality is not good. There is a Continous belling soung.Thank you"

3,"Review by a semi professional...Buid quality-7.5/10(headband is thin)Noise isolation-8/10Sound leak-10/10(almost no sound leak even in full sound)Sound quality-7.8/10(instrumental separation is not good,bass is a little muddy not tight,edm/bollywood are best for this... acoustics/rock are not fit into this)Battery-10/10 (12hrs for sure)Connectivity-10/10(instant connection, connection is flawless upto 10ft)Mic-8/10(better though not best)Comparision with some popular cans-1.senn cx180/213 has 2times better clarity2.boat basshead225 has 1.2tiimes better clarity3.onemore pistonfit has 1.3times better clarity4.jbl cs300si has less clarity5.boat 400 has just a little less clarityBut but when it comes to songs with bass this one is better than almost all others(though cx180 has more pleasing bass)**Bass mode has more punchier bass than normal...those who r saying no effect their phones  r rubbish for sureAtlast i say if u get it in 1200/1300₹ then its perfect..for 1500/1600₹  u will feel less satisfied,,,wait for the discount, don't buy when its above 1500₹"
5,"Superb clarity. Bass in normal mode is enough, no need to change the EQ setting. Highs are little less bright but still comprehensible. Vocals sometimes feel muddy but looking at the price range, there cannot be better headphones. This is top notch quality in this price. Far better than Boat, far far better. No comparison, in fact. JBL is JBL."
4,"I purchased this on 28 August, it was delivered on 31 August. The delivery was good. Now to the headphones,this headphones has all the things you need to called this headphone. I mean the sound quality is excellent. Bass is good. No distortion in taking calls and decent build quality. It kinda look like jbl t460bt younger brother. I have given 4* because it has a minor issue of producing a sound like ""ting ting"" when you touch or tap right side of the headphones. But it doesn't bother that much so it's a sweet deal. Hope you can enjoy this product.Update: 27 may 2020- I have been using this for past 8 months and their sound quality is best considering it's battery life and build which is far good than other headphones available. The only one drawback is their are not much comfortable. So if you can compromise a bit then go for it."
5,"The build and sound quality of this thing is awesome. I upgraded to this after my Sennheiser cx 180 street ii broke. For all those who are wondering it comes with a 610 mah battery. I am by no way a audiophile but the sound i feel is excellent. It was by default in bass boosted mode and i switched it back to normal. Battery life, Durability all those things will be updated in a future update. I feel it was a bit uncomfortable for large head, mine is xl 😝 but not that troublesome (3/5 for comfort). Edit : The sound of the headphone is excellent after burning in for more than 10 hours. You get used to the headphones after sometime. So yeah its more comfortable now. 2 days of 3 hour per day use in medium volume gets battery down by 10%. Buy this thing eyes closed."
1,"It worked fine for first 2 weeks, It's now less than 15 days and it stopped working.Not sure if It charges properly... I can see the red light while charging. Then click and hold power button to start - power button seems to be not working.Is there any reset button to auto fix settings?It's useless now. I can't return it as after 10 days as per return policy. I have 1 year warranty. I don't know how to claim that.It's not a good experience."
1,"This is made in China product (written on the box). It's showing it's nature from first day. If sound is not played for 3-4 min and then you play any sound the headphones will not respond until you until you pair it again. I don't know if it is happening with me only. In one hour I noticed 3-4 time sound stopped for like half sec which I did not expected from JBL, me and my phone were on same bed .Sound is nice but breaking half sec between songs is not acceptable. Bad bluetooth connection.I literally search JBL is US brand but still they have quility like Chinese products."
1,"Hey guys , read this before you buyI bought the headphones 1 month ago which was around 14-15 sep. Everything was going well. Exactly after 1 week, which is 21st sep I used the headphone for 3 hrs to attend some meeting and as soon as I disconnected it the headphones stopped working.  I went to the phone shop they said they won't repair this. I wrote a complain at Harman website they had no response.. please Amazon  have a look at this product and I will wait for the reply.Regards"
4,Sound is good but will only work with mobileNot with laptop or anyother device
5,"Mind Blowing 3D surround sound Experience, I have sennheiser and Sony headphone but really this headphone is amazing, every notes and vocal r clear and bass is very very very awesome when u r switched in powerful bass such u feel with new bass experience. Overall I give full rate 5/5"
5,"Here is my detailed review of this product after a week of usage:1. Build quality:Earlier was sceptical a bit about on-ear headphone that the outer ear will pain after long use. But this one comes with great built, comfort, lightweight and handy that one can use for longer period without any discomfort.2. Sound quality:I'm an audiophile. Love to hear every single frequency from low to high and set my theatre for the same. Here comes the sound of this product it'll really produce the low frequency approx 80-100hz which is really good for such small speaker resulting good bass, clear sound with balanced trable.Noise cancellation is as expected. You'll be cut out from outer world.3. Bluetooth control and battery:Bluetooth is working as expected and can be achieved at a distance of 10-15 mtrs. Control buttons are good with proper sensitivity battery lasted 18 hours of regular use.Over all a nice product from Herman and can buy without having second thoughts."
4,"I wasn't able play pubg connecting with this headset, you will get the fire sound or foot sound with delay of 2 seconds so you can't sync the sound of game which you hear in headset and game play."
5,Infinity Glide 500 is very accurate in terms of sound quality. Build quality seems to be not so good because all is plastic. I was comparing this with Jbl T460 bluetooth headphone. The INFINITY GLIDE 500 is having puncy bass. I could say that bass is little bit overpowering...there is option to switch ON the deep base mode but believe me friends I could never feel the need to enable deep base mode. The bass is too much even in normal mode. So bass lovers will like this headphone for sure. Please allow some time to burn the headphone to produce quality sound. First day you may not feel the headphone good but believe me from second day I was just in love with this as it produces sharp details. So burning time is required to free up the components of headphone. Battery backup is tremendous...as compared to Jbl T460. Jbl T460 has just 11 hours whereas this headphone has 20 hours backup. Price is also very low.Thanks.UPDATE AFTER USING 3 WEEKS:This headphone has really became my travel mate...This has bluetooth 5.0 and it does not even disconnects in Mumbai crowded local trains. Your phone should support bluetooth version 5.0 and it will connect with this headset seamlessly. Lower bluetooth versions are also supported of course...But 5.0 is great for connectivity and battery optimization.EQ mode is not that great and it does not give any difference and there is really no need to push for deep base....it is just awesome in normal mode....Flexible to carry and travel...Great headphones.
5,"This is my first Bluetooth Overhead headphone.Reason why I do not prefer Bluetooth headphone is due to its poor battery backup and sound quality, I always prefer Wired headphones also for its sound quality.But this headphone is a game changer1. Battery Backup: this headphone is really great in the battery backup. I was an average listener and game player. So it was giving a backup for more than a week easily for me. I never thought of charging it from the day I bought it.2. Sound effect: The sound is absolutely good with some equaliser and it’s best with power amp, and some music player which has custom equaliser in Android. If you are iPhone user and wanna enjoy music in default music player , then it’s not for you. However we can install some third party music player with equaliser and enjoy the music (eg: onkyo player).And the best part of the headphones is enjoying a movie with deep bass mode. If you are looking for a headphone to enjoy movies for long time with best bass boosted high volume sound effect then go for this without thinking. I really enjoy watching Marvel collections since I’m marvel fan. Oven never enjoyed such a deep bass anywhere. Even in laptop the movies sounds great with VLC media player(subjected to best equaliser settings).3. Comfort: The headphone gives a great comfortable tight fit. I’m a big head guy and it’s really so hard. I can’t wear it for more than 20 min. But I gave the same headphone to my brother and sister, everyone is comfortable wearing for so long. So I wear it in a different angle and it helps me to fit comfort. This is definitely for round headed people, it has a huge extension but still there is no adjustment for horizontal flexible adjust fit.4. Build Quality: So good and sturdy. Light weight and foldable.5. Noise Cancellation: It gives a nice noise cancelling sound environment with more than average volume level. Compression is perfect for normal head. Since I have round and huge head, it is not giving perfect closure to ears if I extend the length of the adjustment. That’s the only problem for me. Never mind if you are normal headed.Mic: During call and gameplay I never had a complaint from other end. They can hear my voice clearly.Drawbacks: It does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack and I can’t enjoy the Dolby Atmos effect from my laptop. For this extreme bass headphone if it gives me option to connect and enjoy the music I would be so happy. But it can’t be bundles with all futures right. That’s negligible for me.Overall it’s a Best Buy for the price range. I really enjoy it and my family is enjoying with this headphone.Thanks"
2,"I was expected a lot from this Bluetooth headset, but disappointed very much.It like a normal piece, not worth to buy for Rs1700"
1,"Today, I have received Glide 500 wireless on-ear headphone. But the product is not as good as I have heard abt it. I purchased it for brand name HARMAN but sound quality especially Bluetooth connectivity is so irritating that I prefer to return this. I played music on ganna app as well as songs available in my phone but same problem exist both the time. Every 4-5 seconds a interruption occurred and sound became low. So I recommend not to buy this."
1,DUPLICATE DUPLICATE DUPLICATEThis is a duplicate item as there is no barcode to register this product. SOUNDS LIKE SOME 500 rs headphone.In marshal headphone you can rotate the right side ear piece and inside it has barcode which after scan shows the serial number.The product got delivered without serial number.Spoke with Amazon customer care but of no use.I don’t think they take any action on seller..DUPLICATE DUPLICATE DUPLICATE DUPLICATE
4,"Well I read somewhere in the review that these are not original, but these are original. When it comes to sound quality, these are excellent. I have used number of headphones including IEMs and I would say these are decent headset to enjoy music. High, mids and lows are clear. It has bass present and it's not on the expense of vocals. Usually headset with good bass eats up the vocal but these have clear vocal. One big complian with these are they are uncomfortable for wearing for long time. You start feeling the grip on both ears though with time thay getting loose. Overall a good headset."
4,"It's really good. The reason I reduced one star is because of the over-the-ears is on the ears for me. I have what one might call an monkey ears, so wearing  headphones for long hours is not possible for me. It hurts!If Marshall Major III has a bigger ear cups please let me know I would buy them. And its easy to remove the ear cups with a twist. So please make one a replaceable larger ear cups plis plis plis!The mic quality is awesome. The detachable wire, it plugs into any other headphones with a detachable wire feature. So my old Sony without a mic feature, now has a mic thanks to MMIII :)"
1,"To all those who are thinking to buy this: DON'T!All the negative reviews are true unfortunately. It's a classic scam. Duplicate earphones that look just like the original but sound like worse than a 500 rupee earphones.Almost negligible bass. Mediocre sound quality.The worst is there is no return policy. Trust me, you might not care about that while you order because of the 'Marshall' branding, but it's really important.Amazon probably knows about this and just wants to clear out the stocks."
1,"Irrespective of the adjustment, it really squeezes your head and not good for all. It is very tight and holds your ears eventually giving headache and ear pain (externally). Sound quality is optimal, not as great as other products in its league. Even in winter or AC room,  you seat around ears, especially areas it clears. Maybe it's due to leather covering. A cloth/sponge kind of covering might solve these issues."
1,"I looked hundreds of headphones before purchasing it. I own a Marshall kilburn bluetooth speaker and thought that the headphones will also of that quality. But no, the headphones are their products. Its too tight on your ears it will hurt them badly. Your ears will start getting hurt just after 10 mins of usage. The sound quality is also very poor. No bass. Does not meet any of my expectations. Do not get fooled by the good ratings."
1,I ordered this based in a recommendation from a friend to use for singing online and for voice overs . Initially itself when I compared the recordings with my nirmal earphone I didn't find much difference either in recording or sound quality ...Today I was recording for a voice over and I found a background hiss in the entire recording ... when I removed and reconnected the headphone leads at both ends ie to the headphones and  the recording device and played back a test bit  I was shocked to hear nothing was recorded except some scratching noise . Couple of attempts yielded the same result . Now I am in a fix as it has been over a month and the return window has also closed.  Really disappointed . I suspect it was a defective piece they sent to me .
1,"I don't know how this headphone got such good ratings. The sound quality is totally unacceptable for a rs.4000 rs headphone. The bass is feeble, the trebles a bit tinny and overall sound is not full and won't satisfy you. I really should have believed reviewers who didn't recommend buying this. But I think the Marshall brand biased my decision. But remember that these headphones are made in China and their quality feels cheap. Maybe these aren't originals."
5,"These headphones are awesome, the sound quality is just amazing and the headphones cut the outside noise and give an amazing sound experience. I would suggest everyone to go for it, moreover, it's suitable for long hours and doesn't hurt your ears unlike other headphones which you can't wear more than an hour or so. I received a genuine product with superb sound quality. The ear cushion is really comfortable and fits the ear perfectly."
4,"Lives up to the expectations. Great sounding pair of headphones. Definitely recommend to all the bass heads out there.Comes with a nice coil cord and mic. Very useful during concalls and watching movies..Very easy to carry and great leather Black pads.To enjoy the headphones, you would definitely need DAC amplifier"
1,"Bought a major 3 wired. The product is a duplicate. Seems like all the reviews bout the headphones being ""fake"" are actually true."
1,Never expected this from Marshal. This wires started coming out after 8 months. Also the ear cushions also started tearing off.The sound clarity and all is pakka.
5,"Sound quality, durability, comfort worth the price. Actually better than most premium brands even jbl, skulcandy!!!"
5,The pack. The size. The sound quality. Best part I can plug my son's earphones to hear the same music.
5,It was worth the money paid
1,It's frustrating to not being able to return the product on Amazon. I didn't like the product and there is no way to return it. There is nothing mentioned in the product description while purchase and looks like scam to loot money from people.
5,Amazing performance ... Worth Every Penny you pay.
5,"Superbbb as expected, I simply loved it"
1,"Just got fooled by the false advertising that it has 30 hrs playback in a single charge , didnt even get a replacement.....pathetic"
5,fantastic but I wear specs so sometimes it hurts on the ear otherwise fantastic(I wear the headphones almost around 10 hours)
5,Excellent quality very happy
5,Good product
1,The headphone is not working... can’t hear any sound! It worked for about a month! Since June we are trying to get help
5,Great build quality. Amazing sound. Precise mids and highs. Enough low.
1,500 Rs headset can provide better quality and experience than this product
1,Don't buy.
5,"Product is worthful, Only problem is you can't hear for more hours like more than 2 hours continuously"
1,Very bad build Quality not worth for 4000Please Don't buy this.
2,Can hear only sound in one ear piece when connected jack in one ear
2,Does Not do Justice for 5K.
1,This is the worst headphone at 5k over!Extremely bad sound quality.Didnt expect this from Marshall
5,"You could mention ""sound quality"", ""comfort"" and ""thickness"
5,"Comfortable fit, good sound even at max volume"
3,there's a scratch on leather covering at left ear side part.
1,Fake!!!!!!!
5,Amazing
5,Excellent Quality
5,Sound quality is good
5,Good
1,This product is fake the in ear barcode does not record it as a genuine Marshall product.The earphones get static transferred from ear cup to ear cup and then one of the other they keep shutting off.Extremely poor quality craftsmanship and I then decided to check the authenticity of the product which I did and besides being defective it’s a fake
3,"Pros:1. Sound Clarity. You can clearly Judge where the enemy is coming from.2. Good bass.3. Mic length is good and adjustable so more clear audio for your friends.Cons:1. Biggest con is Ear Cushions are not comfortable, just after 1 or hour you will start feeling pain on Earlobs.2. Mic's Noise cancellation is not good enough. People hear lot of background noise while u are using these headphones."
3,Good but not supporting to computer
3,Sound is Good ..best for gaming..but u cant use it for a long time like 1 or 2 hours...its create a pain in your ear...
4,"Can be used for office calls as well. Mic is clear and end user hears it well. Good build quality. Bit uncomfortable at start, but gets use to it in 4-5 days.Mic is adjustable but no cushion on mic is there to avoid disturbances."
1,"Very big in size, not good for professional office related work and also not suitable for laptops as mentioned by seller.. waste of money"
4,"Soft cushions, flexible mic, good sound quality media, gaming and call"
3,The sound quality and mic is fine. But the headset fits too hard on the head even after expanding causing inconvenience after a while causing a bit of an headache. Even my young kid is not able to resist the hardness of the grip.
5,"Proper mic , proper speakers in headphones , sound cancellation is very supportive in mic ,delivery was also good only the thing which is not good is the AUX pin which is very loose -to make it tight use three rounds of thread around the tip of aux pin , overall its an super worthy product at this price .  ” MUST BUY “"
5,OK good
1,"Mic not good, sound is clear. The person on the other side can hear lots of noises. Should have focused on good mic quality."
2,"Personally I didn't like the product,  after paying that much cost I was expecting a good quality product,  it is not reducing background noise,  and the biggest problem with his design it hurting my ears while wearing because one side of cushion was not good & now I have a pain in my one ear. After paying 750 RS.  Just because of one issue I am still using my previous headset instead of this 😢. But instead of my problem it have a good sound quality and mic is also good...."
4,"These are very good at this price. Pretty good quality body ,durable,and sound quality is great too. I would say one thing is to he cups would have been much more round than oval.  I bought one more set too.Thanks ."
4,I received the product just 2 days back and I am using it since then. What I found is build quality is good. Cable is thick and long enough. One thing I noticed is base is little high and though the voice is clear it is not on the top of the base. That is the only thing that I have noticed about the product. Apart from it I received the product on time. Came in good shape. Box was intact. I am quite satisfied with the product.
3,"Thanks to Amazon call centre, for assisting me in returning the product for refund.  Though the product looks good with quality materials, it was not fitting / alligning properly  on my ear side. Hence had to return the product."
4,"Had been troubleshooting why the mic is not working, with various online mic test sites, phone apps, for more than an hour. At last found there is a switch to turn off the mic. To all those complaining that mic is not working, check if the switch is in ON position."
3,"Just Average product.  Weight of the Headphone is way heavy, if you wear for more than 15 mins you will feel something heavy kept on your head. In this price it is way costly!"
5,It is a really underrated product. I got mine pretty fast. It has awesome build quality. I wanted to buy a budget headphone and I finally found it. Fells like nothing when you wear it. Sound quality is just god level and noise cancellation is also pretty good.I only thing I dought is that the on-off switch for mic can break.
4,The product is good. The mic and sound quality is nice.The headphones have a strong grip and it hurts the ears at first but after some time it takes the shape of your head and it stops hurting. It is useful for attending online classes and meetings as well.
4,"Nice built quality, sound quality good in the price range of 800 but sound pops out clearly... If you are talking to someone while gaming, people can listen to their voice clearly if they are nearby you... That can be really annoying for gamers who record gameplay at home..."
5,The produck is fabulous and i like the way it look but it was not packed and it was in a bad condition from outside and the box of the headset was damaged and i also didn't received a bill im the box but the headset was not damaged .But i was not happy with ur packing
1,I brought this product for internet call for use in laptop and PC. But it is not at all compatible for any of the two eventhough it is written in description.I wasted my money for this.
5,Audio is quite clearMic works wellWorth the moneyVery comfortableYou can extend the headphonesGood packagingEarly deliveryOVERALL I suggest you can buy it.. for me it was worth buyingAlso gaming experience is next level :)
3,Pros: - Sound quality - Looks goodCons: - Outer ear hurts after 2 hours of continuous usage - Outer ear gets hot and sweats after continuous usage
3,Only suitable for gaming than for calling and watching movies because of the sound quality. Worth investment for Gaming for kids.
4,the product package was damaged when bought .although it's sound is really nice it's noise cancellation is really lessif you are buying a headphone for a privacy of what you are hearing then i won't recommend it.but if you are buying for enhancing the sound and need a nice theatrical feel . go for it
5,I needed for my regular official work as I have to be constantly available over calls & meetings & thats really cool that I dont have to keep adjusting Mic & wires etc... Kts just the way i wanted it.
4,It's very good but you should provide the audio splitter cable with it...and i am giving it's sound 4 star cause it's too low and the bass too...I am really satisfied with its looks and comfort....but unsatisfied with the audio and that I have to additionaly purchase the another audio mixing jack..
3,mic is not so okey somehow Noise are much heavy load with this headphones un comfortable sound... But product received is original... Not very good for gaming serious on....
4,NICE HEADPHONE 🎧 IN GAMING BUDGET OF 1000 RS ..BUT SOUND QUALITY SHOULD BE IMPROVED MORE ...OVERALL EXCELLENT PRODUCT ..THANKS
3,Hi as per my used this is Good only for person who want to use an hour but if you want to buy for long calling purpose So dont buy। Because you cant stay for ling time on head। It will give you headache and pain in Ear।Ita really not comfortable for long time।।
4,"Best for Gaming/Calling/Video calls session, The quality of Mic sound is so much clear, no disturbance in Mic, during calling/online classes/gaming.satisfied👌🏻, Good, loveable👌🏻"
1,Cheap quality sound... Useless for gaming..We don't expect Noise cancelling .Not Comfortable with this product
1,Very very tight fitting. Gave me a headache after putting this on for half an hour. Do not buy unless you have a very small head. Also they have a replacement policy only and this does not serve my purpose. Please do not buy this horrible ill-fitting product
5,Very niceGood for pubg and mic quality is very good the item worth
1,"Have used this only for a few days and regret purchasing it.This cannot be used for a long time, 10-15 minutes and my ears start to ache.The MIC has already stopped working."
3,The sound quality is excellent but the pressure on the head is too much
4,"I like this product but noice cancellation is not good.it is not good while gaming , affects the battery while gaming I don't know why some time's the battery doesn't go low and some time's it goes too low.It has a very stylish look and I like it."
1,Don't Go for it plzzI thought Cosmic byte is a good brand so I purchased it but it is very poor thing.Wearing it is very painful.I'd suggest that red gear is the best899 one
5,Vera level
4,"Sound quality excellent, Bass is good as they are 40mm drivers but, it will feel uncomfortable as your ears pains a lot, if it's used more than 15 minutes. Other than the fitting issue everything is fine."
5,Pros:1. The product is cheaper than other gaming headphones.2. It is light weight and doesn't feel heavy on the head plus it is also having a head comforter for more grip on head and comfort.3. It has a really amazing sound quality for every type of system and comes with an extra sound changer on the cable wire which is very handy to use.4. The wire of lenght is very big and is most of the times needs to be coiled.5. The material is not at all cheap. Some reviewers have marked it cheap but is pretty great.6. The product is actually underreated and must get more actual reviews. It deserves it.Cons:Still unable to find any as I have purchased this product last month and didn't had any problems with it.
4,It gives very good listening experience.- Bass boosted- build quality (4.5/5)- confortability - (4/5)- High sensitive mic(5/5)- copper 3.5mm jack with extra layer cable coat- coushion quality is far better than lether- easily identifies footsteps- camo grey looks dope
4,"An inexpensive pair of headphones which can be used on pc and ps4, as far as I'm concerned It's with your own hard earned money that you'd purchase this. Yes, there are better options available but this is good and you get your value for money spent on the product. Must buy option for the average consumer."
5,Awesome product good for gaming...and good for musics and movies...best gaming headphone under Rs.850 good bass and it reduces the side effects rather than using bullet headsets and bass headsets
1,"*******Do Not Buy This Product******We bought this product on June 15, It got delivered on June 17, They have a 10 Day Return/Replace Policy from Date of Purchase[Not from Date of Delivery]. Used the Product for 2-3 times. And Now the Product Has Stopped Working. This is the worst Product, We have Ever Received from Amazon. Upon reaching out to the Customer Service, they have Given a Direct Seller Contact Number, which is disconnected[No Idea from when.].This is just one more mechanism of Fooling Customers.Thanks Amazon for such a Wonder Full- Wonder Full Experience."
2,"The only issue i had was , whenever i try to change the volumes via the headphone the voice difference between then changed enormously.Been using this for more than 4 months.I  product is overall pretty awesome .UPDATE: So i waited to write a review for 4 moths cz i wanted to use it first , but now in the 5th month the MIC has stopped working , theres audio disbalance , one side gives more audio than the other , and its pretty annoying.The sound quality has not been reduced but , it has become really low and mic has stopped working.Now that i think what i would have done is , save a lil more money and go for something better."
5,"Best Headphones at budget!! Good quality,good bass,overall good product.Its durability is okay given it's price .Go for it if you're low on budget and need a headphone badly"
5,I purchased this product only for mobile gaming and i can say its perfect for pubg mobile you can hear footsteps very clearly so you can easily guess the position of your enemy. Mic quality is superb in-game communication between teammates is crisp and clear. Honestly i didn't expected this much precision and the build quality of this product. This is not for music so don't expect bass.
1,"I choose this one for my pc gaming but the sound quality is not upto the mark.when I got this product is already someone's return product with invoice inside. If you select this one for pubg then it will disappointing you,you can't hear any footsteps. I will suggest you to skip this product and select some other one, I replaced this one with readgear cosmic 7.1. It has only one advantage which is 3.5mm jack, so it can be use for phone, if you want for pc the you have to purchase splitter for that."
4,"According to my personal taste i liked this a lot.This is my 2nd headphone. Move to the 3rd para for direct reveiw. Writing the reveiw after using it for 2 months.My first one was Boat bassheads 900, that heaphone is awesome their customer support is way too better but that was not comfortable for using nore than an hour.Recently i bought Hyper X cloud 2, and thats out of bodget for max of us, but they hadnt compromised on anything about that, a complete satisfaction on that item. So basically i useI have the mixed black and white army type colour which gives a fantastic look.If you are a pure gamer consider the MERITS first in the next paragraph.DEMERITS:Personally i am satisfied but i will first mention the drawbacks.Sound is very loud, i mean u can hear the sound from even 10 meters away so the question is, is it a headphone or a speaker. I will mainly point out the noise cancellation, even noise cancellation is okay but u cant have a moment of privacy with these headphones its too loud that your neighbors will listen everything very clearly whatever u are listening to. Another demerit is it doesnt have a call receiving/play/pause button. Another demerit i felt, it doesnt feel so comfortable to wear it while sleeping.MERITS:Now lets come to the things i liked about it, i will say again i love the looks, it just looks like a crown on your head. Its heavy but the padding is great you will not feel the weight, its just feels nice. The cables i will surely praise they are around more than 2 meters and they are so strong, the build quality of the cable is like the quality of the electric irons, i mean literally i m not kidding. I will recommend this for every pc gamers as this have a very long cable, a volume control with it and even a switch for the mic on/off(quite useless for me).The best benefit u get with this is that u are getting a speaker free with this😜 feeling heavy, irritated on ears, volume it up and just keep it on ur table (just kidding🤣). Lets ge back it is very comfortable to wear for as long as you want. And the only reason i like it over boat bassheads 900 is the confortness and the sorround sound. If u will listen to 8d sounds u will think that the boat bassheads 900 is more clear about the sound directions but while playing i get the loaction way much better with this headphone, not sure but its kind of a illusion. And if you are gamer then forget about the demerits i mentioned, beacuse i dont think those demerits even natter for you."
1,Received on 21st May 2020 and now i.e on 6th June 2020 the left side has stopped working how can I get a replacement or refund?
5,Fantastic product. The build quality is superb to say the least. The wire is sufficiently long as well as strong (very thick - almost 3mm thick). This is the thickest wire I have seen on any headphone. The jack is durable and will withstand the test of time.The voice clarity is excellent (A+++). I am not using it for gaming but for vocal recordings on a popular karoake app. The headphones also provide superb voice quality. Overall a very nice product which I will recommend highly to anyone looking for a good pair of headphones at a Great price.Another feature which I like is the additional volume control in-built into the wire.Thank you
4,Providing the review after 2 month using. Please find the review belowPros:1. In this price range this is a good head phone.2. The padding is very good.3. This is good for playing pubg. Right left year sound outcome is good.4. In this headphone you will find a volume button which i found very helpfull as I am using the headphones in Ipad while paying pubg.5. Now coming to the sound quality. Recording facility is really good. you will get a awesome recording sound with this  headphone. You do not need to speak very loudly to get good sound. Cons:1. I am deducting one star because of the fitting issue. It is a little tight on head. Even when using it with max length I faced the issue. After playing for 1 hour need to take it off for sometime.
3,"Both sound and mic voice clear enough. I can hear long distance footsteps easily in Apex, PUBG, etc. But it's not comfortable for me. I need to take it out every 30 min or less. I found it has a very small space ear space (you guys can see egg space) that why it gets hurt if I wear it for a long time. And I don't know either that I'm the only one facing a comfortable issue.I'm thinking to return it but again I like sound quality. Man, what to do....?"
5,"This is a good headphone. I had purchased from the market three times and each time they broke the same way, while I was removing the headphone off my head the ear muff broke .. lol! I think my head swells with too much pride when I work ... rofl! anyways as I am a medical transcriptionist and a good headphone is a must and my old headphone is only for use as a crisis stopgap I went to Amazon website and purchased this one. Sound quality is good. You can have good Skype conversations also. The wire to attach to the CPU is long so no bending your head to the left/right so you can do your work ... All in all for the price a good purchase and also nice designs. I bought the Army grey colour one. It's cool. Thumbs up to this product! :)"
1,"according to price headphones are very costly, built quality is average , plastic, it has only single pin , u have to use splitter to connect to computer, so it is big drawback, so i return. purchased splitter from market and using my MI headphones with computer they r best.cosmic byte sound quality is crap."
5,"This is really cool man I just loved it....I'm using it for my PS4 PRO and I wanted to go for vibration headphones but there's no 3.5mm jack to connect it to my dualshock 4....There's option for USB too but I need to go the console for using it so connecting it to my dualshock 4 would be in handy rather than to go near my console.The sponge/cushion/foam for the head is as soft as a feather and didn't expect that it would be of that premium quality...My concern is that it would have been the best if it would be wireless coz it's hanging from the headphones like running nose..Overall its a good product, I would recommend to all gamers to go for it..."
1,The mic stopped working in a month. No warranty or support. Now i'm stuck with this useless pair of flimsy headphones. This is sad. Please invest on some other quality headphones who offers you after sales support
5,Bought it On 15th may 2018. N still working good. Long wire which is a benefit to me. Mic quality is really awesome.Headphones made contact with water plenty of times..one time it's volume controller was left dipped in a glass of water for a whole night. Then in morning i put it in a bag of rice n it works as fine as before. Water made contact with the mic too but didn't damaged it. Works really good. Sound  quality really good. It is  slightly changed then before but not that much. Good bass. N perfect for gaming. Really comfortable for ears. Padding is really soft n durable. Happy for this purchase.
5,Pro:  Good sound quality  Correct fit  Good design  Cable is strong  Great bassCons:  Little heavy  The volume adjuster part feel like low  quality plasticsGreat product at this price range of 800₹
5,"I have owned overhead/inear ranging from 500-20k. At this price range, this is beast, it couldn't just get better. The bass is nice, there is clarity though I wish the base wasn't overpowering the voice certain number of times, thats fine as that can be adjusted in the equalizer.The headphone is big but doesn't feel bulky while wearing as its lightweight, looks durable and sturdy. Cushions make it comfortable to use it for a long time.Feedback for the maker: If you plan to upgrade this model maybe try to use a higher quality wire.Dont think twice to go for it."
1,Dont purchase this by seeing all the postitive reviews. Most of them seem to never haver used a proper earphone or headphone. My elearphones have better audio quality than these headphones and they only cost Rs100 more. The audio quality is so pathetic that you will never be able to pinpoint the exact location of gun fire or footsteps
5,This product quality is awesome .... Comfortable to wear ... Sound quality is too good .. Mic quality is good with  adustable  stick .. With volume up down bottom and mic off on switch .... This is my 3rd headphone that i buy ... But this is best headphone for me .... Best gaming headphone at this price range ....
5,"So, I have been using this headphone for like 6 months now, and trust me this headphone is really great. Normally I don't write reviews for the products I buy, but this one deserves it. This is the first gaming headphone I have bought. The sound quality is really great. Even with full volume you won't find any change in the sound quality. The headphones really comfortable to wear, and your ears won't hurt even if you wear it for hours together. Now comes the microphone, I was really amazed by how great the mic works, its really clear(even an online friend of mine said so, when I was playing PUBG with him).Bad points : it has a combo jack, becuz of which I had to buy a mic headphone jack splitter to use. That's all, I didn't have any other problems with this mic during my 6 months of usage."
5,Awesome Headphones For Gaming!Pros-Awesome Styling Feels PremiumGood Foam UsedSound Senstivity SuperbI personally used it for PUBG in Smartphone it Sounds awesome !Not too loud not too SlowSaperate Slider and Buttons fpr volume and mic on offPerfect !Cons.-My ear size is slightly big hence after long time use i have pain in my earsPackaging I got was too bad and damaged boxWire is too long if u are buying this for Smartphones ! But if u r buying thia for pC then it will help u for sure !Thanks For Reading!Dont forget to click that Helpful Button !Take care !
5,"I love this headset. I've been using it for over a year. The mainly purchased it for official calls and meetings. However, it works really well when I need to listen to music or watch movies. The microphone picks up audio really well. Mics broke off on my older headsets because they used to be separate. But, on this one, I've not had that issue because once the mic is folded, it's a part of the headset and is not protruding out.This might be the right choice if you are an audiophile. If you are normal user who wishes to listen to music and use it for calls, it's the best at the price range."
3,"Writing this review after a year of usage.  Headphone is good for gaming or i would say best headphone in this price range but when it comes to durability, it doesn't last more than 5 to 6 months. Sound quality degraded, volume level reduces after few months of uses, ear cups torns out as shown in the picture and lots of static noicse coming out from headphone jack. I have played lots of pubg mobile matches using this headphone, it performs well in the beginning, it gives exact location and footsteps of enemy but at the end, there exist a term called durability which this headphone doesn't really poses. If you're a hardcore gamer, this headphone isn't for you but if you can consider the durability, you can go for it. Hence, 3 stars."
3,Not for music loversPros  1.over ear headset  2.low price  3.clear audio while gamingCons:  1.Very poor bass  2.Audio quality is not satisfying while listening music  3.If you wear it for a few minutes you feel uncomfortable and sweat.
5,"One of the best budget gaming headphones out there in market. Just buy it,  it's totally worth it.Pros.1.The sound quality is amazing compared to other budget headphones2. The bass is well maintained for all events..3. The Cable given with this so long that u can easily connect it to a PS or PC and sit in a couch and play.Cons1. The cable length will be irritating for mobile users.2.Nothing else guys.  Just believe in me and but this amazing products"
5,"Probably the best and fully worth headphones with mic. What a bass and treble. I love music and I am a singer as well as gamer. I have beats solo 3, bose quietcomfort 35 and airpods pro. To my surprise, the sound quality is near to all these headphones. The build quality is the only place which is worth the price. Everything else is much much better than the price charged. I got these purely for gaming because i wanted a headset with proper mic but now it is one of my favourite too. Because the mic is way too clear and crisp. And plus point, it is over the ear headset, so somewhere it blocks outside noise. Fully worth! Go for it without second thought. I just hope they last longer because the build is plasticP.S. I did the sound comparison side by side!"
4,"The product is fine with respect of its price. 699 is what i got for and the lowest it goes during sale.ProsThe sound quality is goodNo distortion while using on full volume ( depends on the song if it has more bass then there will be distortion with full volume )The sound signature is good, the mids and highs are impressive with the low end being high making this perfect for gamimg and musicThis is perfect for gamers and music listenersConsThe headset is not so comfy on my ears ( although do note that my ears are big and if your ears are small you wont have any problem )Sound - 5/5For gaming - 100/5For music - 4/5Mic quality - 5/5Material - 4/5 not cheap but not too expensiveOverall - 4.8/5Worth a try and its a really good headphone"
3,"no idea why 7k people have given such good reviews just to mislead people,maybe because this comes with a 3mm audio jack and fits most devices instead of the typical usb style which other gaming headsets come with. out of the box the product looked cheap quality.i kid you not compare it with redgear cosmic 7.1 that comes with in this range.i have rough used many times but it had a metal headband,braided wires with extra protection wrapped inside a plastic casing and the cushions were the most comfortable. after 3years of dropping it many times stretching the wires by mistake etc etc. it finally had an issue on one side with a small malfunction on the connecting wires. but I thought I'll buy another brand because it was a bit heavier on the head because of all the extra cushioning etc and also the mic was disturbance most of the time. so I saw this with so many good reviews and looked light weight and also the mic can be hidden.but biggest mistake of my life.this is just crap infront of it. with quality (full of cheap plastic.i dunno if it will survive a drop)and audio too is not that great. I regret the purchase."
4,"I play multiplayer games where sound cue could make or break your round/match. These headphones have really improved my sensitivity to such  sounds and I've been able to perform slightly better in my games.However, if you plan to watch movies /listen to music on these headphones and it's an important element for you to consider then I suggest looking elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, you can totally watch movies or listen to music on this but the quality might not be up to your liking. I am satisfied with it."
4,"Nice Sound but not comfortable..[Got them @15/SEP, writing this review after 1 month @16/OCT]1. Sound and Mic [5/5] - The sound and mic quality is really so awesome! Since it sounds sooo damn great, NO PAIN inside the ears; and no need to scream for your voice to get delivered.2. Build [5/5] - They are very stylish and look very cool! They are sturdy and hard enough to survive few shocks, padding is also soft. The wire and connector are also of awesome quality. Wire is very long.. so no problems in that!3.Comfort [2/5] - They are really a bit bulky and stick very hard on the ears.You are really going to feel pain on your ears, neck and head; if you are a medium to heavy user, but as time passes you will get more used to it. or you can just put a lot of books between them so that it can stretch as much as it can and not hurt you!4. Compatibility [5/5]- No issues. Everything as stated.For connecting with desktop, you need an audio splitter to split it into 2 Male Pins.Which is quite obvious because single pin headphones don't connect to PC directly, or if u connect them to the sound one, then you'll not be able to use the mic, pretty easy to understand!Summary of Review-Loved the headphones, seeing the price, they are really value for money!Deducted 1 star because of less comfortability.Would I recommend it?Yes, I would surely do! they are extremely value for money because of their mic, sound, style and braided cable.Thanks for reading; I hope it was worth reading this!The Review is 200% genuine and written after 1-month usage, it is not fake."
4,"The sound clarity is good, you can literally listen to songs by keeping the volume upto 90%. For gaming you can probably keep it to 60-80% depending on your preference. Sound quality is sharp and while playing games like pubg you can hear the footsteps quite clearly. The mic does a decent job, its not the best but for the low price you cant ask for anything better. You can go for it. Its quite heavy too compared to other headphones we normally use."
4,"Though touted as a gaming headset, I have used it for conference calls and music briefly. It fits quite comfortably and noise cancellation is decent via the ear muffs. The voice quality on calls is good. The music sounds great though the Bass is balanced. It does not enhance it much. For the money, it's quite the accessory."
2,"Bought these for taking calls, but unfortunately there's nothing great in them except the voice clarity. Highly uncomfortable for big head people and doesn't sit well on earlobes.I could have given one more star but even the sound quality is not upto the mark, listening to songs is a complete no no....I am not sure about the other reviews regarding the gameing since I am not one, but if you are taking this as an all rounder than definitely not a good choice."
2,I bought it for playing pubg in my mobile poco F1 but sound quality is superb but it's too low ...I even can't hear a foot step when he is approaching towards me....So honest review from my side ...If you have a sound proof area than you can go for it's other wise don't...Buy a boat headphone around this rate....Build quality of boat will be low compare to this...But sound clearance and sound quality will be great...
5,"Best Product For Gaming but if you buy it for Music purpose then it's sound quality good but not better then other, Here I give the rate/marks out of 10 in both aspect gaming and music on own my experience that is 9 out of 10 for gaming and 7 out of 10 in Music.In Only baas I rate this product 6.5 out of 10.So if you are a game lover then must buy it but if not then look for other choices.Thank You."
3,"Sound is ok no great shakes but the mic is not compatible / adequate for the laptop. changed it once hoping it was a defective product but the replacement is equally bad.Note: This appears to be the case only with the laptop (tested with 3 of them) . With the phone, the mic seems all right so there is some issue with mic gain / pickup I guess.Delivery and service are excellent though."
1,"* First Thing After 30Days After The Return Date Finishes The Mic Will Not Work . Important You Cant Return* After 2Days The Speaker Will Not Work As Well . Important You Cant ReturnIf These Things Won't Work The Whole Headset Will not Work Waste Of MoneySound Quality And Mic Quality Worst . Try Other Ones Like Cosmic Byte , Red Gear etcOver All Zero Stars Worst Worst Worst 🤬🤬🤬"

5,"One of the best pair of earphone for the price1} Sound quality is amazing for the price 😍2} Built quality is good but not the best but  for the budget price I can say its good ⚡3} Headphone jack is not gold plated ⚠️4} I have been using this earphone from past more than a year and have replaced it once under warranty which was super easy hassel free🎶5} I have used many other brand earphones such as JBL, Sony, Sennheiser, RHA, Boultaudio and recently Infinity and I am not a professional but have experience of many earphones so I can say this is the best sounding in budget and very comfortable in shape to use for longer duration 💯💥I can definitely recommend this earphones must buy in budget segment 🔝🔝✅🔥🔥"
5,Build quality (5/5)Durability (4/5)Wire length and tangle free(5/5)Sound quality (5/5)Microphone (4/5)Ear comfort (5/5)This product met my expectations....Thanks Amazon ❤️
5,"Love the sound quality, but moreover the services offered by this company are pretty amazing!I ordered these earphones about 9 months ago and one of the ear buds stopped working about two weeks ago, I read about their manufacturer's warranty, and registered my product on their site and filed a complaint. They, then, picked up the earphones from my address, and sent a brand new one to the same address in two weeks and free of cost."
4,"For a price of rs 400 it's worth the cost, i previously used boat bassheads 225, now i tried this for pricing it does the job.Pros,Easy fitNice qualityGood bassInbuilt micCons.It doesn't have a clip or dual coloured ear buds noraml black only.Maybe you should give blue, red colour like other products.The connecting cable will be flat unlike folded one, that quite difficult while playing games or youtube bt you figure it out gow to mangae itUpdateAfter 9 months one side stopped working and i have complained in their official website with downloaded invoice from amazon and the next day my product was picked and in next 15 days got newer one. For the 400 rs it lasted about one and half years that was good for the price and it has one year warranty compared to mi and realme 6 months warranty and you have to carry your products to their outlets.Note .While claiming warranty you have to upload invoice that has to be downloaded only in pc version as of now ,so login amzon account in seperate browser in desktop mode or use pc to download the invoice."
3,"I bought this in sept and I'm NOT SATISFIED with the purchase... Don't get me wrong, the sound quality is amazing for a earphone this cheap, but its flat... The bass kicks in only when there's too much bass in the music, else the sound feels very flat... Also the audio via the microphone is bad, and the mic is located on the split end of the cable, which is very low... At times I've heard people complaining that they cannot hear my voice clearly... Only for those who are struck with the price tag of 300-400rs... In that range its good, but if you can spend a 100rs more, get the basshead 225..."
4,"This is a very great earphone with a good quality sound, but it's not for rough usage! The sound is flat, so less bass in regular condition! But the earphone has got a very good frequency range. So still a deep bass is possible but with an equalizer. You can try my preset.  Also remember that the quality of sound also depends on your device's sound card."
5,I bought this earphone cause I had read in the reviews that they provide excellent after sales service and replace the earphone if any defect occurs. I had previously tried many companies earphones but in a few months always they would give problems. The sound quality and durability is amazing for the price. But due to rough usage one ear stopped working after 3 months. But the after sales services are amazing. They arranged a pickup of my old earphones and delivered a new pair to me after 10 days.Really happy customer
1,One of my friend has this product that's y I came for this product.  My idea is to by skull candy only but cos of my frd i came for this product. He s having good product but what I got is defective material. Actually i got this by last week at my work place. I got an emergency to travel so i left the product at my office itself. Yesterday I came and checked the product. It's a broken one. Yes it's broke at the connector area.  They hide it and deliver to me. While checking the product didn't work after full checking headset came into 2 parts. Kindly return my money back or send me a genuine product.
1,"After using it for less than one week one of the headphone wire comes from the Mic join point. It detached automatically. Yes, automatically. No pressure no pulling caused this. I did my registration and complain to their website. They sent me a ticket number through email and text message. I am so so disappointed ; don't know when pick up will happen and when I will get a non defective earphone. Such a horrible experience."
4,Got it for 400.  Okay for the price.
4,Edit : After two week of usage I realized that sound leaks from the earphone. So other people may get irritated.  Bought these earphones in a sale for 400₹. I have already used boat bassheads 225 and this time also boat doesn’t disappoint me. Here are my impressions: Clear output Quality build Low weight plastic build (I was disappointed with bassheads 225 since they have bulky metal build ) Great customer service Medium bass Decent microphone ( I didn’t face any problem during a call) Great designFor 500₹ I think it is overpriced. During Amazon sale and sometimes daily deals price drops to 400. You should definitely buy at this price. But MI basic earphones also comes at this price. If you are looking for clear sound quality you should go for mi basic otherwise for bass you should go for boat.
1,Sadly just 2 months and it is dead. the most sad part is it was sold with one year warrenty but within a month they refused to replace the item. total waste of  hard earn money.
1,"its been two or 3 weeks since i brought this item, it was working well for 3 weeks after i brought this item and then all of a sudden one of the drivers stopped working and i was like damn these earphones were made by a leading company how come they could have made such a unworthy product. and the main part is that the bass is not that good actually saying bad. so, i suggest everyone not to buy this product.  SPREAD THIS !"
4,"I haven't heard about this brand until my colleague told me about it when I was looking for earphones on Amazon. I ordered this pair after reading 80% good reviews on Amazon. It arrived within 48 hours thanks to Amazon Prime. The pair looks beautiful. The sound quality is surprisingly good for a below 500 rupees earphones. The only problem with the earphones is the fit, it doesn't stick to your ears when you are walking or running. I have to keep adjusting it every 5 minutes. Other than that, it is more value for money."
1,Volume button is broken in barely a month ! cheap product ... Not worth the buck
5,Just loved it and sound quality is awesome 😍😍 Mumbai Indian edition is the cherry to the cake😍
5,"Looking for earphones online? This may be the best choice for you.if you are a stock Android user or any user, this earphone provides the best hearing experience.I'm using this earphone since hours, but no pain in ears or head,  that means their ergonomic design really worked.The Black colour looks more classy then other colours , and its design is beautiful .if we talk about comfort.., do they well played here.,these are so comfortable .but we can purchase same audio quality earphone through the market , like ubon big daddy bass for less than 300 rs but the durabilty ,and comfort is not same as these earphones .Cable - cable is good ,it is tangle free and easy to handle.Design - impressive design , it doesn't fall from your ears even while running .Button - it provides a single button , but can fo many things with this single button if you are a android user .1. double tap to play next song .2. triple tap to play previous song .3. long press to access google assistant and directly apply operations4. single tap for play and resumeThe button is comparatively very smooth to press."
1,"Says on the pack extra bass. But no bass sound. So I installed a Equalizer in my phone and increased bass. Right earphone started giving additional ish ish sound at the end of each bass beat. The kind of sound you would hear if you increase the volume too high and the speaker diaphragm makes a sound out of extra vibration. I have used senheiser before. My toddler son  has habit of breaking things, so settled for this one. If you planned spend more. Just go for other ones. Not this product."
1,"Por sound clarity, we can't expected this type of poor quality from Boat"
4,Good sound  reasonable price
4,"Boat brand was unknown to me. I gave it a shot and bought these earphones after reading several positive reviews. For this price there are no other better earphones out there. First thing I noticed was how strong the connecting cables were, much tougher and sturdier as compared to other well known brands. The earpieces also fit tightly into the ears and seem on the harder side. They will never fall off from the ears. Sound quality is above average as compared to their next product in the hierarchy. Frankly the only missing part is the heavy bass.(this comparison is unfair as I also use Sony XB 550) Other than that an excellent product."
3,"Okay product. Will comment in 3-6 months regarding durability.These are supposed to be basshead earphones but I don't think they qualify - not at their price range.They don't really boost bass just amplify it and make the entire lower range frequency louder. As a result, if you go above the halfway volume mark, the sound sort of starts cracking and hurting ears. The problem goes away a bit when you tweak the sound settings. However, the range is small. If you optimize settings for bass, then treble starts cracking, and if you optimise for middle range sounds (can't really get a good treble), then bass starts cracking. Just not satisfactory for me.Of course, everyone's taste in music is different and their requirements from earphones are different. Obviously, I listen to everything from Opera and Death metal to bluegrass and hip-hop to rap and jazz to Punjabi upbeat songs and Ghazals. So this earphone covers only a fraction of all that and hence I do not particularly like them even for the price of rs 379 that I paid in the lightning deal. There were a few cheaper earphones that were much better than these and I only bought this because they were out of stock.However, if your taste in music covers a narrow frequency range and similar genres and you just want loud percussion sounds and don't care about much else, go for it.As for watching TV shows and Movies, earphones generally don't affect the experience that much unless they are too good or too bad. However, here too, I find that the sound gets annoying if the volume is too high and I cannot eat while watching because it amplifies the sound of my jaw too much. Plus it makes everything sound a little weird. But I guess the last part gets adjusted with use.All in all, I will try a different pair next time. I mainly checked the reviews and bought them because they were rated high on durability. If they break soon, then there will be no point in me ever buying them again. I will see how long they last."
1,"Felt like Cheap Chinese Headphones in some nice packing.Go for Sennheiser, I wasn't able to wear then single day.Pro - So Loud at full they can even bleed your ears too.Cons- High bass driven outshines the highs and the mids ( Vocals lie deep down that boom boom)- Not that comfortable to wear.- even design is So called hawk but it is not if comfort is considered.Choice is Yours."
1,Worst product ever. No bass no sound quality at all. If i get less than 1 star option i will give that.
3,I have lotsn lood Earphones. I have bass heads 225 as well. To be honest this one is for a more casual use in bikes and travel etc and there's the problem.the wires are actually not looking that strong and the lack of L pattern jack actually makes it a problem for keeping pockets jeans and riding a bike.Sound burn in is extremely important and no one reviews that way because everyone will just buy and plugin and give the reviews the drivers need to be calibrated for any speaker earphone headphone anything for a minimum of 20hrs. I have kept it on olaymode for more than 8 hrs now and this is really good. Bass is real good and serves the purpose very very well.Major points1.its not as sturdy as bass heads 225 is atleast in the feel.2.the look n feel is not premium again compared to 2253.why they didnt give an L pattern jack they only know and it sucks4.price point is great just below 400.5.most importantly the brand presence and service is great.Buy it if u r a basshead and also the vocals are great. I always listen to Arijit Singh Laal ishq from Ramleela for testing any earphone and headphone its superb... Butbuf u have a little more budget go for 225One small note for the bikers... This will be a great in helmet choice as bass heads 225 will be a little pain on the ears within helmet as it has a little longer metal ear cap vent.
1,"honestly saying, i was influenced to buy this product from my friend who is already using this product. i opted this over sony as this product is giving better sounds than that. i purchased this product and after few days of using, the left earphone started to give odd sounds. it actually giving symptoms of not going to work in future, exactly what happened within  days. it completely stopped working.i thought a product defect and applied for warranty (used for one month). then i came to know that the same problem my friend is also facing with the same earphones. his earphones also got the same wire issue.so i better suggest you to not buy this product.thank you."
5,Quality is very good & Need to improve printed logo Of Mumbai Indians or you have to write Mumbai Indians it's faint.
4,•  fast delivery and in good condition•  build quality or earphone is good and bass is excellent with this range• sound quality is good there is no pain in my ear even after continuously use or 1.30 hour
5,I got this product for 399 rs and its worthy.Tho it's not as comfort as other earphones in our ears it gives you nice music and base is okay.Its more worth than your money I'd say if you buy it for 399
1,"What I dislike about this earphone is its design. It is not at all ergonomic.There are some significant flaws. I write this, after having used Mi red phones which are in the same price range -300-400/-1. The ear buds are too small and don't give you that tight grip feel. It will fall off in the slightest of activity2. Position of mic: The mic is situated very low, at the point of intersection between 2 strings. It literally falls till you lower chest. So while talking on phone you have to hold the mic up manually near your mouth. In Mi earphones mic is placed near the right ear string, at a height near your face. That makes it easy to talk while earphones are on.3. The connecting cable at the point where you plugin to your phone is too long. That makes it prone to a lot of bending.This may cause early breakage.Having owned both earphones, I would recommend Mi over Boat.Voice quality is similar. Just above decent"
1,I bought it 3 months before was working fine suddenly it mic was not working I couldn't fond the reason I contact boat company even I have all my gadget from. Boat after my headphones u bought another one for my parentbut my one is stopped working reason is nothing the company is not ready for claim or warranty really upset the why I should go all my products with Boat so I stopped purchase it from boat
1,The product was very good for the first 10 days of my purchase but then after my calls getting disconnected automatically when headset is connected and few abnormalities happing when connected. Unfortunately the return date is expired. Don't know what to do.
1,Actually there is nothing in the product that can be appreciated..The product is promoted on the basis of quality of extra bass which is totally a fake promotion. There is no bass..and the sound quality is also very disappointed..Overall the quality of the product is very cheap and below average....An earphone of costing Rs 50 has much better quality than this product....Its my humble request to you please stop cheating customers through these fake advertisement and promotions......
5,"Just two hours into listening music on this headset, and it is really at par with many of the reputed brands..I have been a fan of JBL head sets but, this one is also is at par with it but at a lesser price.. started to like boAt as a brand and lifestyle products manufacturer. Even the shape of the ear buds is different than regular rounded shapes...Good to see some different shaped head set.Got this one during the sale on Amazon, and I feel it's value for money."
1,"Bass is not good. The sound is just like as chinese low quality product.There is no instant refund policy, first they will provide you replacement which is not useful. If not satisfied then refund for returns will take long time may be 15-20 days. The seller does not care customer."
1,I bought this headphones on basis of Amazon Rating. But quite disappointed with quality of sound.I have used many headphones and I would say this one is worst I have ever bought.More details given below -Prons -Only PriceCons -Sound quality is really worstNot comfortable fit for earsCan't listen that very small background music which can be heard on some other good quality phone'sEar buds are of low quality and not softI would recommend not to buy only on basis of low price. Pay slightly more but buy good quality headphones.Definitely NO Go ! Don't buy !
5,"I had been using this earphones from last 1  week. It' been fine. The deleivery for this product was on time. The product was not fully protected though there was only box and amazon carry bag. I would like to tell you guys its pros and consPros:-Sound quality is great.Bass is well1) Treble is ok, somehow it is diminished by 2) High tones3) Buid quality is ok.4) Design is good.Thats all pros now lets move to cons:-…Less than 2 months of usage one side already stopped working.Sound is OK, but what good a product that has no life. Couldn't find a way to replace as well.No extra strains applied, always kept coiled with velcro strap."
4,"It is a decent product from boat, decent bass treble is good.If you want to buy a earphone that explodes with bass don't go for this one, but if you want clear punch and drum sound... then you should definitely buy this as its bass doesn't blend with treble and ruin the quality...Overall the nice product if you'll consider the price also.... I bought this at 399. Also oneore thing I like about the boat is that it gives the warranty of a year so if product stop working you can simply go to product complaint site and upload the bill within a week they schedule a pickup and exchange your earphone unlike other earphone products where you have to courier them by your own."
3,"Material qualityThe earphones come with extra in ear plugs for choosing the right size for your ear. Those extra plush do not fit the earphone. Only the one that the earphone comes attached to, works. The rest of them are useless, there by throwing the size selection out the window.SoundPersonal opinion, the sound felt a little hollow, as if I was in a room hearing background echo. The sounds are very much different from all other earphones and over head headphones I have used.Also tapping the wire give you a tap sound in the ear. So if you are moving and the wire brushes against your clothing or hand, you get a disturbance in your ear. This is something I have never experienced earlier.The microphone and pause/play button works well.DurabilityOverall looks a bit fragile. Will wait on this to see if it lasts.In conclusionThe earphones do the job, a little compromise on quality."
1,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.So my ₹1499 are wasted now..."
2,"[BIG UPDATE] IT BROKE ALONG THE RIGHT HINGE, I WAS WEARING IT NORMALLY AND IT SPLIT OPEN ON ONE SIDE.The extenders are weak. ( Pic inscuded) My boat 400s broke at the centre too. They need to concentrate less on celebrity endorsements and use the profits on materials and quality control. They still worked so I taped it up with a metal sheet. Still will give 2 stars for the sound.[ORIGINAL REVIEW]I've owned boat products such as the Rockerz 400 and some of their earphones and this is the best experience I've had with the product.Review after 1 day of use and will updatePrice I paid 1800Pros:1. Packaging is good for the first time2. The build and finish is on par with headphones costing 3 times as much.3. Range is next level, didn't experience any loss of connection in my entire house with the phone kept in one position.4. Boat headphones have always been super uncomfortable but this time they have actually thought of that.5. The cups are big and soft enough to fit your ears inside so they are over the ear.6. Base is not amazing, let's just say it's above average, the sound is like a 20 % improvement on the Rockerz 400.7. They have gone for a organic approach for the sound so the highs and lows are just ok .9. Battery life is just as advertised8. You literally can't find a better pair of headphones for less than 3k  for sure.Cons1. I was not sure about how they actually look when I ordered cos the image of the product kept changing, it had flat cups and then doughnut type cups.2. It's not as loud as I want it to be3. They didn't include a aux Cable which is crazy as they ship those with all other models.4. It does get warm in these and you will sweat5. No noise cancelling as they mentioned and passive design is not that good"
5,"This is a premium quality product from boAt-Lifestyle. It's professional grade 40 mm drivers truly deliver you to a music nirvana with a professional fine finish. The amazing battery life and the reduced charge time makes it a marathon runner. The ear cushion provides a comfy experience. The sound quality is fabulous and does not give a pain in the ear. It also is easy to carry around as it folds inwards, it also fold towards the sides which makes it extremely easy and safe to keep on a table. All over it is an awesome product."
1,"The boAt Rockerz line is boAt's super cheap lineup for budget buyers. This will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. It might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is  not something I'd ever recommend buying for your own use.1. Sound Quality - awful. Honestly, the boAt Rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. It isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. Most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. On or off, you can and will hear the outside world. Those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. The soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.2. Comfort - Horrendous. The boAt Rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. The audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. The good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. After removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. The cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. The frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.3. Build Quality - In a word - bad. See a pattern here? The headphones reflect their low price point, and are  entirely made of cheap plastic. The plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. It's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. If you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. Finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. You'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. It's really gross.5. Mic - Absolutely trash tier. You won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. I honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. Callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your PC for voice chat or conference calls. Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. It's really not worth using.4. Final words - Just, don't. Spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. The headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. Save  up some money, work at McDonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. Anything, but not these ones. The only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?1 Build"
5,"These are super comfortable and premium looking headphones. Beautifully designed with very good matt finishing.Sound quality is top notch, good for pop songs. Bass is good enough to provide a decent effect.Ratings - 4.5/5Sound quality: 9.5/10Durability: 9.5/10Bass: 9/10Material quality: 10/10Look and feel: 10/10Bluetooth: 10/10Noise cancellation: 8.5/10Battery: 10/10Cons -Aux cable not provided with the headphones, so can't tell the difference with wires."
1,Never have I seen as fragile headphone as this one. I have been delivered a product with manufacturing defect or it already damaged. The bud from the right side fell off as soon as I unpacked the headphones. Boat rockerz has not been upto my expectation. Think before buying.
5,Material is very poor quality but service also very good. Product replace after 10 month even broken. Now condition is new..👍
1,"Poor build quality. One side of the headphone broke down with normal usage within one month of operation. Never expected such a poor quality from boat. To make matters worse, in entire Hyderabad they have only one service centre which is far away at 15 Kms from the city"
3,"At 1999 they are decent.Pros1. Light weight because made of plastic2. Battery super cool @ 70 hrs3. I am happy at 40% volume, so they are super loud.4. They have thumping base5. Call quality is good for this price.6 connect easily and the Bluetooth range is excellent. I have tried them keeping my iphone in another room and roaming around the home. No distortion or disconnection.7. They fold so are easy to carryCons:1. Plasticky so can break any time2. Vocals are not clear and are dull. If they had crisp vocals, these would have been the best in the industry.3. They would need time to open up. For my ears they feel stiff and tend to heat after 2-3 hrs of continuous usage. Ears pain after this much usage.4. No case or pouch but was not expecting eaither at this price.Over all a decent product in the price range and can keep it as a spare headphone in my bag if i forget my primary headphones (Marshall Monitor BT) knowing they will always have some charge ( 70 hrs battery at 60% volume)"
3,"I bought this 3 months back and it's broken now as it was all plastic and not much flexible. The product says we have 1-year warranty but physical damage isn'tincluded. Bad experience. I have fixed it with fevi quick as a temporary solution, but I don't know how much time it would work.😢"
1,"It has got broken, very bad quality cheap product"
2,The body is plastic even the piece that is exposed upon extension. So its highly likely  to break! Mine broke and yours might be soon as well. So I'll definitely not gonna recommend this. If you already have them then Good Luck!
5,"⚫ SOUND QUALITY - Sound quality is amazing for this price and Virtualization is good .⚫ BASS - Average bass not so good or bad, it lies in the middle .⚫ COMFORT - Not so comfortable , but it is better than boat rockerz 400 , The ear cups are bigger than boat rockerz 400 .⚫ CONNECTIVITY -  Connecting faster to devices . Range is very good , i didn't face any connectivity loss upto 10m and also it has dual pairing feature . There is an audio latency when playing games and No audio latency when watching videos .⚫ CONTROLS - It is very easy to control and They have kept multifunctional or integrated controls ( Refer to the booklet provided inside the box ) .⚫ MICROPHONE - Mic is good, Not as bad as boat rockerz 400 .⚫ NOISE CANCELLATION - They have used passive noice cancellation , It doesn't not seems to reduce any outside unwanted  ambient noises.⚫ BATTERY - Standby time is amazing as mentioned by the Boat , Charging time takes upto 2 hrs 30 mins .⚫ BUILD QUALITY AND MATERIAL - They have used good plastic material but the slider for adjusting the size of the headphones is not good , the wire gets popped out when sliding . Pls be careful when sliding . The ear cups and headband cushion is soft and sweat proof , the water gets easily evaporated.⚫ DESIGN - It features an on-ear design and the ear cups are bigger than boat rockerz 400 . It is light-weight but not a sturdy design , which is not intended for jogging or running purposes . For gym it can be used to do strength or weight training or weight lifiting workouts not for aerobic or cardio workouts . The folding design is amazing for the safety of the headphones , it can be easily folded which is easy to place on the flat surfaces .⚫ LOOK - Premium look with matte black finish , looks sexy when wearing the headphones . ◼️ VERDICT : Waited for a long time to get a good wireless heaphone with premium look and design. You will never get a premium look headphone with hd sound & nice battery backup at this price segment , Overall a great value for money ."
5,"I am using Sony Headphones for over 2 years now, which were sufficiently good for me. They got damaged somehow, and new sony wireless  headphones costed a whole lot than this headphone so I would've had to buy the wired ones, so went for boat. So I'll be comparing these with Sony wired headphones in the same price range (<2000) (believe me, I've used all variants/models)Pros:1. The look: The Black ones that I bought look sick. Fallen in love. If you're a black lover like me, go for boat rockerz 450 instead of 510!🖤2. Bluetooth: it works crisp. I get range in my whole room and even when I keep the phone in my room and go into another room. Excellent.3. Price: I got them at ₹1199 at Republic Day sale 2020. Worth it.4. Aux cable: They provided me the aux cable. Everybody has confusion whether they'll provide or not, but they did to me.5. Sound Quality : Decent. Nice bass. If you have been using earphones, you'll love these headphones.6. Noise cancellation: My Sony ones didn't have noise cancellation but these do, and it's awesome.Cons:1. I've been using Sony and the sound quality of Sony is better than this.2. Bass of the sony headphones was way better than these. Believe me these are not at all bad(you'll love them) but if you are coming from Sony or JBL, you'll get a bit disappointed.3. Latency: If you want to play games with this headphones, you will have to use the AUX cable to do that. Can't play games wireless ly, because the game sound will lag too much, making them unpalatable. I tried PUBG, free fire, call of duty, etc. Nearly all of them. But I'm fine with it really, because when you play games on your phone your phone is in your hand anyway, so use the damn aux cable.Conclusion: I was getting JBL ones for ₹1999 but didn't go for them because they didn't have aux support. Sony wireless headphones do have it, but they cost a lot more (4000 atleast) so couldn't buy them as well.If you are ok with spending ₹4000 go with Sony. If you don't really need an aux cable support go with JBL. If you are ok with wired headphones go with Sony wired as they are in the same price range as these.So at this price range, these are literally the best wireless headphones you can buy. If this is your budget, go for it.I find these sexier than boat rockerz 510 but I'm a black lover and this is my opinion.If you found this review helpful, hit a thumbs up and help others."
1,THREE MAIN DEMERITS👎 NOISE CANCELATION 0% PRODUCT VERY HEAVY AUX CABLE MISSING....... BOAT ROCKERS 400 BEST. ALSO NOT FOLDABLE HEADPHONE. NOICE CANCELATION IS THE MAIN REASON TO BUY BOAT NOT JBL. BUT THIS PRODUCT VERY BAD........
1,I brought this headphone few months ago and now it broke. I just took it out n it snapped. Its even in warranty period
5,"These are the best you can get for the price of 1399/--Sound quality 5/5Used Both wired and via Bluetooth. (Tested wired on the stock aux of boat 400, also a little less bass on Bluetooth but that's expected)-Build 4.5/5Though I trust boAt but the extention of ear cups is via plastic ziplock kind of thing which may lead to early wear and cause headphones to go loose.-Design 5/5 (Over-ear if you don't have large ears)Awesome design and form factor and the cups are comparatively more comfortable and larger than boAt 400.-Inbox contents 4/5The only drawback here is that there is no aux included like in the previous versions but that's not an issue as it was foretold in item description.Edit after a month of through usage :--Comfort 3.5/5Will cause sweating and minor numbness or pain after longer usages i.e. watching complete movies etc.Battery life 5/5Working as described complete 7-8 hours of backup, needless to say it also charges quickly i.e. within 1.5-2 hours.Overall best headphones to get at the price range of 1500/- and below, just wait a bit for lightning deal and viola best offer ever."
1,"Recently ordered the product so after using it for about 6 hours constantly, here is my review in pros and cons.Pros▪Comfort level is better than jbl 450 and  previous boat rockerz edition.▪nice bass and sound quality.▪premium matte finish.▪ conectivity is pretty fast and good.Cons▪sound quality could have been better. i mean bass is good balance is good but sound quality is above average.▪no aux cable.I majorly bought it for jogging so i will update about battery backup and perfomance of this headphone afterwards.Update: perfect pair of headphones for jogging. Battery backup of 7-8 hours easily. get you through 2 days easily if you are medium user.Edit: 8 months and its broken now. i loved these headphones 😥 and now broken. Poor plastic by Boat."
4,Really Nice On ear headphones from Boat. It has really Good bass and Thumbing effect. For Full Review Do visit Technoholic Life on youtube.|Audio  test | Mic Test | Latency Test |
4,"Rockerz 450 is my Second Headphone from boAt, other being Rockerz 510.+ Packing - Comes in a great packing which looks good and easy to unpack+ Design - This is a good looking headphone with a cute Circumaural design (not that big as Rockers 510). Graphics over the ear cups is just nice. When I rub my hands over the cups and I could feel the quality of the material. I was late to notice that the cups can be rotated to 180 degrees.+ Comfort - Smaller headphone when compared Rocker 510, still the cups are large and soft enough to impart a Cozy feeling.+ Sound quality - I am using this one for general listening as well as editing my YouTube videos, and the sound quality is good enough for me.+ Volume and Playback Controls - Playback and volume control on the rear side of ear cup lets you skip tracks and adjust the volume.+ Bluetooth - Connectivity is just great. I am able to move within all rooms of a 1500 sqft Floor.+ Battery Life - I recharge the headphone once in 2 days after using it for 7 to 8 hours with intermittent intervals.+ Economic when compared with other brands in this segment.- Noise cancellation is not working as advertised.- The buttons assigned for volume aren't smooth enough and make a uncomfortable noise.VerdictA good looking, easy to carry, quality headphone, recommended for people who are looking for a good quality headphone within Rs. 1200-1600. I bought my piece at Rs. 1499. and when I write this review a week later, I see that the price came to Rs. 1199 as a part of Festival Sale. So, I think this is the best time to buy it.Moreover, Welcome/Exit messages are just Awesome.While we switch on this gadget, a Super Energetic guy says, Power on. You Plugged into Nirvana!At exit, Adieu Amigo, Powering off!love & regardsAJ"
2,"The mic of the headphones doesn’t seem to be good, a person on call is unable to hear your voice clearly even in a quiet environment. As for a noisy environment, the noise cancellation is pathetic! I fact apparently the background noise is more clear than yours. Good music quality and pretty comfortable though. In all it’s a good headset not a good headphone."
1,This is my 1st time using boat headphone but I shocked when I see I got a headphone which has some minor scratches maybe it's a used. Headphone. I continually use for 10 days. I didn't see any problem in headphone but after 10 days I see that I'm getting a little noice during charging but ignore this sound . Day by day it increasing. One morning  when I woke I see that headphone giving alot of heat but when I open all screw of headphone I see that battery is burned in fire. So don't buy this headphone brand sent me a used headphone.
5,"The product is just amazing!! It comes in a good packaging, has a great colour and I love it💙. This 🎧 can be connected to any bluetooth device. It can remain charged for a very long duration. The ear cushions provides a comfy experience. The sound quality is superb. It's noice cancellation allows u to just concentrate and feel the music. It's worth the price I paid. The main thing I bought this is that it had the calling features and it really works. This 🎧 is completely light weight. The product comes with a charger for charging and an aux cable which can be connected directly to the phone if we want as it saves charging. It also has an information manual and a 1 year warranty card. This product is a Must have!!"

1,The sound quality is good. Especially the bass is great. But one of the limbs broke after two months of use. I fixed it with fevikwik and tape but it then broke at another part. I had taken extra care handling it but the kind of plastic used is below standards. I mailed BOAT customer support regarding the same and my product was picked up from my address. After a few days I recieved a picture of my product totally damaged with no explanation given and they sent it back to me. Poor experience with the way they handled it. Also the ears start hurting within half an hour of use.
1,"Worst quality .amazon is waste for selling goods and it never meet the requirements of customer ..such a waste product from amazon that I have bought ... I need a replacement of this boat headset otherwise I’m gonna proceed legally..Loose wire connection and very delicate headset I got ,I mean even if I place it on the bed it broken such a worst product given by amazon ...I’m going share this review in all websites if u didn’t respond"
5,"This is nice one, bass is really great and sound also loud, its like mini home theater on your ears. Completely happy with this. Many not suitable for long listening as theses are on ear headphones.Manufacturer package box is perfect. Thanks to Boat"
1,Product material build is the worst of all.The headphones broke into half while adjusting the cups length just after 3 days of using.Recently Boat has been fooling customers with these horrible products that wont last even 3 days.Styrofoam  made products will last longer than these boat products.NEVER GONNA BUY AGAIN FROM BOAT.
4,This headphone is good for the price but RockerZ 510 is far better than RockerZ 450.The 510 is extra bass boosted while this headphone feels like any other normal headphone .I've used both 510 and 450 so if you wanna buy one then I would suggest you the Boat Rockerz-510 .
1,"I have purchased these headphones for my husband as a surprise. And it was so disheartening, that the product was such a failure. The headphones claimed to be noise isolation supportive, but everybody could listen to the song I am hearing. All I could feel was thump, and the headphones were vibrating as I maxed the volume. I paired my phone with these headphones,  but when I tried any other phone to be paired, it just gave me error messages ""Pairing rejected by Boat Rockerz 450""."
5,"First of all i am writing this review after intense usage during lockdown. If you want to buy it, go for it without any hesitation over jbl and mi super bass. As usual amazon's delivery was super fast.The build quality is extremely good but the headphone are made up of plastic. Quality is better than mi super bass headphones and these are very comfortable even when worn for extended periods. Bass quality is pretty good and it also has an in-built mic which cancel much of the background noise. It also has a 3.5mm audio jack so you can use it wired( without any battery usage) or wireless( on battery). The charge lasts around 8-9 hours if used for non-stop gaming like playing PUBG Mobile and COD Mobile. It has a standby tume of more than 100 hours ( yes that is true i have checked it myself) and it delivers lag free voice when playing games and it has a warranty of 1 year which can be claimed on the official website after registering the product. Note- the warranty doesn't cover any physical damage after the product has been handed on to the customer but boat's customer service is very agile.Please mark the review as helpful."
5,All of thing is good but one thing is not good is that aux cable is missing in the box
3,"It's a good build quality headphones from boat and looks good in design. Sound quality is average and bass amount is good too. If you have used any wired headphones like audio technica (Sonic) or Sennheiser(HD206), don't buy this one. You will not like the sound quality from this product. It is more comfortable than boat 400 and little better in sound quality. While using in Bluetooth mode there is 1sec delay in sound while Gaming(in Pubg) and it's effect the gameplay. This delay is not happening while watching videos or movies. I don't recommend if you are buying for gaming. It's not comfortable for long hour usage as it becomes painful after some hours. Aux cable is not included in the box."
2,"Hi guys, as expected both 450 and 400 are alike but slight high at 230hz and thump for 450 and remaining are same as 400If you wanna buy a new one of head set for bass lovers go for it if you are already boat customer of 400 no need to upgradeI also have boat 600 but it lasted for only 1yr approx due to non sweat proof and cushion  has damaged but  head set speakers are fine😍 for 450Pros1) bass2) good clarity3) comfortbut after a hour you feel discomfort but later it will be adjusting for feew weeks 450 rockerz, which i not found on boat 600( AS THEY ARE COMFORTABLE), but very much irritating on 400 rockerz4)  Battery lasted for more than 8 hrs as I used high volume5 ) value for money6) indication for max volume and connection, blue light for idle position, red even for charge and battery l7) quiet strong no room for breakage I hope they had build stronger than 4008) mention of battery in Bluetooth section how much percentage left9) connectivity is good as my home is 3 bedroom it came through two walls and outerdoor more than 15mts untill I go to down floor (400 had disconnected in 10-12 MTS )10) you can connect to two devices once only ( i have connected to iPad and mobile at once ) plays them alternative this is good featureCon's1) As it was not fully over ear2 ) it won't allow you to turn your face as it occupy whole neck (you should expand to max length )3 ) pads are cushion but the gap btwn both speakers are less so some discomfort (boat designers should realise that little bit of space is needed to design as they beat everyone )4) that's itThese heavy than boat 400 in weight and thump little bit in scale of 15/15 for 45014/15 for 400I have used 400 and 600 earlier as I suggest go for it for bass and mid lovers and budget 1500rsButtons are given as it gave on 400They are strudy enough , my previouss I got for almost 4 yrs boat 400 , and 600 last couple of years as am the first customer who bought thatt in 2015 as no one know boat at that time I have recommend for more than 50 peopleNow I have changed my opinion they broke of after 4 months I hope they are not that worthy if they broke out like this in betweenI have attached pictures so that you can handle it carefully already bought customers, or else better go for strong one rather that it's"
1,Hopeless headphones. Absolutely no base and even saound is not loud. A big waste of money. Worst product from boat that I've seen
3,"This product is not bad but not good either..... I bought it for 1400, I don't know quality of other headphones aroud this price point..... But it has some flaws... Such as...1) Noice cancelation is good if don't mind outside noice...2) Calling sucks...... It feels like ants are in my ear and they are having a party.....3) cusions are soft..... But can't wear them more than an hr....But at end of the day sound quality is good... Listening music feels great....."
1,As u can see...i brought two of them..and after using them for one month... they both broke one way or another...only in sensitive manner...donno why company is making the extendable belt with very cheap quality... although I'm a big fan of sound quality...these aren't making me to listen to it 🤦🤞
3,"Surprisingly got it for 1599 ...decent HeadphonesWith decent soundPros:Battery backup is goodLook and feel is coolGood thumping BassCons:vocals and treble might have balancedNot good for long time use as it feels irritatedMight have improved build quality from it predecessor 450Only extra Bass will not suffice good audio experience, it should be balanced , Boat signature audio is poor i think they should work on it.Overall average experience!!"
1,I have ordered headphones. I got it sound was ok not as powerful as i expect. Another problem arisen when my charging got over i try to charge headphone for mor than 2 hrs.. itz not charged after a long time. So i ordered replacement. I got replacement today just few minutes ago. Before opening item i take snapshot so they will believe me.. look at thw stickers the right one is different than left one(the circular one) means seal is broken.After opening this.. i Haven't found charging cable & on hear headphones too...Extremely disappointed..If u r going to buy through amazon...Please check it properly coz vendor will send u defective items.. or missing items...Extremely disappointed....
5,I got this @ ₹1499 bucks. The sound quality is immensely good. The bass is great. Well comfort wise I won’t say it’s that great because of its round shaped ear cushions other than in every aspect be it sound or battery life or connectivity every way it’s perfect. This is the best one can have within ₹1500 bucks. I would suggest personally to go for this one if one is looking for a budget bluetooth headphones.
5,"The sound qualities are really good, specially when you play PUBG the most important part is to get the footsteps of the opponent team and trust my words it give you the exact thing with clear sound , yes once you plug in these with you fav music on you are on a different level, Fits to the ear nicely.Earbuds yes it has extra rubbers with it with 3 different sizes Small, Medium, Large,  and also contains an external holding clip which is not found in most of the earphones now a days so that you can just clip on your t shirt while playing games or walking on the  road to talk.Mic quality is also damn good catches the voice pretty decently even the mic is far from the faceNo dislikes, Ya I wished the the silver part could have been metallic but, as it was also focused on light weight, Im ignoring that.Completely satisfies customer here I wish to buy more from Ptron. :) happy customer here."
1,"Well waited with high expectations, and was badly let down. I am a sound engineer and my review is such. These headphones are cheap and not up to the mentioned hype. The quality is 4/10. Build 5/10/ sound quality 1/10. It's dual drivers are of no use,there is no bass at all. It sounds like banging on a tin Pan. The highs are high, lows miserable. The price is way too much for such cheap quality headphones. I suggest don't waste your money on these headphones. The market has much better ones at an affordable price. Caution! Don't buy these headphones. I have thrown mine away in the garbage."
1,Please don't purchase it. i have purchase this earphones but after some day it is not working  very poor quality and totally wastage of the money . and i want to return it so there is no receiving call from customer service and  they say courier and all . who has time n go post and for courier give money  to post from our pocket. we purchase it from online so why are you not providing the service that your person from amazon  comes and takes and receive it
1,I bought this headphone on 9 August 2020. I used only two months but left side speaker is not working. Headphone Jack problem and now totally headphone not working. Amazon is a well known company then why it is selling this kind of 3rd class product at high cost and why cheat genuine  customers.  Cheating is the new policy of amazon???? I m totally upset ☹😡 please don't buy this headphone.
5,"The sound is really nice and crisp clear. Noice cancellation is also really good. From the price point, its really a great product as compared to other brands. I specially liked the volume button. And the fit is also really good in the ears.The plus point at this affordable rate is that you will get a earphone case along with a clip and 3 different earbuds for your earphone."
5,This PTron Boom 3 headphones is very nice... Personally I like very much.. It's sound quality is so nice to compare other headphones... It's give a incredible sound... perfect for gaming because noise cancellation is superb...U can really enjoy very sweety..... It's looking very amazing n also stylish..... In this cost it is a very superb headphone....just go for it...
3,"Due to its unique shape and design ,  it's sound quality is better than the conventional earphones , however a few like me find it difficult to use it for more than 30-40 mins while putting these on as the ear starts to pain . Also the bass is not so profound as I believed before buying it , Though my daughter likes it as it has a nice carry case too . So have given it to her ...."
1,"Stopped working within 2 months. Very pathetic customer service.  I am following up since 12 days now and nobody is bothered to respond, forget about warranty. It has 1 year warranty. When I contacted amazon they are saying that I need to get in touch with manufacturer and wait tgem to respond. Now its been 12 daya manufacturer is doing nothing and I am just waiting. Whats the use of being prime customer when Amazon cant help me to claim my warranty if swller or manufacturer not responding. Really frustrated."
1,I bought this product few days before and impressed on first day after testing of this product but due to busy schedule can't use more than 5-6 time from day of perchesSuddenly this earphone is stop working this is totally Frod please don't buy this earphone if your not regular users this is not of money matters if you love some product and suddenly its malfunction then you will not trust on any other brand so please don't buy itI loose my money please you save yours
5,"The quality of the lead is awesome,the best part is the whole lead is covered with a plastic kind of cover over the wire that protect it from damage, cute lead box is also amazing, the quality of that is also good,sound n base quality is great.Such an awesome product in such amount."
3,"To make the earphone Boom centric, fidelity & clarity has been reduced or rather muddled a bit.Loudness, treble & bass has been increased.New genre of music will be ok I guess, but authentic rock and classical will get hampered. Metal proper will also be alright.If you are thinking of a “Zeppathon” or being “Comfortably Numb” with Pink Floyd or have a Psychedelic experience with Jefferson Airplane… Naah!."

2,"There are many paid reviews.Sound is great, no doubtThis is the 3rd piece I'm using.But the volume change button will break over time and IT'S NOT SHOWN AS IN THE PICTURE ""it's purely misleading.And the seller is not straight forward."
5,One of the best earphones present in the world right now. Volume is awesome. Bass is superb. Best for bass lovers and gamers. Zero lag in sound. Volume control is very amazing. Design is very attractive. It has passive noise cancellation activity. If you are looking for wire earphones then just go for it no need to think. Fantastic. Thank you pTron and Amazon for this amazing product.
4,"At its price range, these are some really good headphones.The sound quality is a tad bit loud, and you won't always need to set them at max volume to enjoy a song.Luckily even at max, it doesn't tear the sound like some headphones do and keeps it very clear and crisp.The headphones even have a volume control slide on them which is a great feature to have.The only one complaint I have about these earphones are the ear buds provided. They aren't the best quality, and will be a problem no matter whichever size you try. I replaced the earbuds with the ones from my older earphones, and it was back to being an amazing earphone.Definitely would recommend at this price bracket."
5,"So first, let's talk about the external-Bulid quality is awesome 9/10 even at such an affordable price.Looks-I have all 3 colours of these earphones and all colours looks coolWire-the wire quality is 10/10. I have these earphones from 4 months and these haven't tangled since. Also the rubber coating and the inside braided wires gives a nice  looking effect.But 1 thing I have seen is the middle piece which have a mic and buttons is 180 degree reversed. so, many times it's difficult to pick the right or left earphone without seeing. But it is mentioned on the earphones so that becomes easy.Now about the main part the internalsThe sound quality is so so nice. 😊As you can see in my title. 9/10. You can listen any music like lofi or peacefull type and when it's time for a party you can listen rock, bass boosted songs with such a adorable quality its the true definition for true sound and at cheap prices.Bass quality is also good.But noice cancellation is 7/10.Obviously there are very high quality products then this product but those will alteast cost 2000. But I will choose this product instead of a 1500 one or less than 1500 because this cost less than 500 or sometimes less than 400(depends on sale) but quality and services of these products are not less than of a 2000 rs earphone.In past, 1 of my earphone died but the coustmer care is so generous, there services are so cool and quick. So those got replaced within 3 days. (it's 3 days because I forgot the eslip, if you mail them with everting ready it won't take more than 2 working days)It's an honest review by me and I will definitely suggest you to but these. ☺️🙃"

5,pTron is one such brand which never cease to amaze me. The new 4d models are very accurate and it helps in online games like Players Unknown Battle Ground and Call Of Duty Mobile a lot. The build quality is great and I like the volume control slider a lot. It comes with additional ear buds to help you choose from different sizes and have a nice fit and good experience. In normal music also the sound quality is crisp and has a good bass. Truly a magnificent product. It comes with a earphone pouch which is handy while travelling
5,After using this earphone  for a week i am writing this review the earphone quality is very premium...it come with a tangle free cord..with a high quality bass and dual driver speaker which gives a feel of full surround sound...i play pubg from this earphone it feels really great than other  expansive earphones .It has perfect volume level perfect deep bass for better sound quality.And i love the most is its round case for keeping your earphone safe...i highly recommended u to buy this earphone.
1,"I have used Ptron Pride and its the best in class. I ordered this one believing that since its from the same brand I might as well go for it. But I was wrong. The earphones are pain in the ears. They don't fit well, they don't stay well and they sound like hell. It feels like I am using 50 bucks cheap roadside earphones. Ptron Pride is great but this is no way near it."
3,"If you are looking for a budget (light) Gaming earphones.I have tested this on CSGO and Rainbow six Seige. It performed well to a passing mark.This product can be of use, at least for the time being.Noise cancellation is standard.Built quality is average at this price point.Solid: 6.6 out of 10 in my books"
3,"Decently priced. I've been using for over 3 months without any fault.Pros:* Decently priced. Got it during flash sale.* Has hardware volume control, Mic & Multifunction button (single button)* Average quality cable* Carry pouch is a good additionCons:* Not much sound quality. Easily distorts. Sound driver is not good.* Bulid quality is just OK. I don't have rough use, so it survived this long.* Ear bud caps  provided are flimsy.I still prefer my BoAt in ears for sound quality over this"
5,"I have listen to Dolby Atmos Songs (on Samsung M21 which has Dolby Feature) with this Earphones, sound quality is good and the bass in this headphones is deep and punchy i really love this ""Thanks Amazon"". Build quality is good, nice to have volume button and call quality on this is good. Headphones also comes with case so i can easily carry."
3,"The product is an excellent buy for Rs.500. The sound system inbuilt for this item is superb, however the only drawback for this item is the discomfort of the earphones inside ur ears for long. Your ears would start to pain after a while for the discomforting cushioning it has, which prevents me from using it. The hold of the earphones inside ur ears is not strong unless u want to push it further inside which results in pain for more than 15-20 mins of usage.One of the reason for me to return the item, the second is the mic quality not very impressive as the other person would have a hard time hearing you. Otherwise if you just want to use this for hearing music for a shorter time, then I would give a 10/10 for sound quality. Excluding the mic quality and the discomfort of the earpods settling inside ur ears."
5,I purchased these pTron earphones and I have been using this masterpiece for about 3 days now . Only one thing comes to my mind that these are the best earphones in this range. This value for money product has great bass and sound quality . I can hear almost minimal noice of outside world when I put these beast on. Punjabi and EDM musics are my quality checkers btw.
3,The headphones comes with a good pouch and design. The sound control slidder button is nice and good a feature.Build quality is also good but you will not get the good sound quality like JBL and other premium  brands.These headphones are average headphone.I was expecting good sound quality but these headphone does not have thatThe sound is loud but missing the quality.
4,"The product is definitely value for money. The cable quality is pretty sturdy and the sound quality is more than adequate though not mind blowing. The product comes with a good carry pouch which is protective. My slightest complaint is with the shape of the ear plugs which are not a snug fit, but then that could be just me.  All in all I recommend the product - it's excellent value for money"
5,Super dupper hit..i liked it ..packing was so impressive and got 3 different adjustments for proper adjustment in ear with a small kit type box to keep my earphones safe can be used for travelling earphones..earphones are double layered for extra protection...worth the price
1,"I am trying to claim the warranty from almost 2 months now but nothing from patron team, surely the product is Cheap Chinese product selling at high pricePTron is one of the worst brands when it comes to service, if u are looking for best earphones please don’t buy this one go for reputed brands like MI and REALME they provide 1000 times better service than this chor PTron"
1,"I bought this product 3 months back. And now the side of the earphone has stopped working. When I claimed for warranty, they said to buy a new earphone of same or higher price and they will refund the price of original. Even I agreed to that.But there is no wired earphone now available of same or higher price. The one bought earlier is also now available at low price. When I asked them if I can buy it. And then can refund me the price of new earphone there was no response from there side. I tried mailing them 3-4 times but no response. I tried calling them but no one picks up... It is a pathetic service from there end."
4,"Amazing Product. The wire is the most remarkable feature of the headset. The body around the 3.5mm port is metal, which is amazing. The volume control on the mic is an amazing feature, this headset control's its own volume without disturbing the phone's volume. The only addition that this product could have is the mic could be metal as well like the body around 3.5mm port. Currently it is plastic which is great although, metal would add-on to the look.Overall 4.5/5"
4,Let me be clear i am a musician i prefer Enough low level bass should be audible...I have tested the The experience of JBl sony Skullcandy..WHICH I BOUGHT MOSTLY ABOVE 900 RSAND THIS PRODUCT AT ONLY 499 ...IT KILLS THE COMPETITION...YES..BASS LINE.TREB LINE.. EVERYTHING IS BETTER....DO GO FOR THIS PRODUCT
5,Very fine quality regarding sound when we hear but only one small issue that other outside sounds like tv can also hear when the volume level is in normal range because the buds are not deeply go into ear so small gap is there otherwise very fine.
5,"Absolutely amazing headphones. The bass is deep and sound is super clear. The design is comfortable to wear for long hours.This is my 3rd headphone of the same style. I have a tendency to sleep with my headphones so mine gets spoilt quickly, bit each pair lasts me At least 10 months. So for a regular user it can last much longer.This blue colour is super pretty. Not girly or too bright so boys, you can use it too !!!"
1,Worst product I ever bought from Amazon Work good for 2 months after right side of the earphone not working and after 2-3days other side is also not working don't buy by seeing warranty policy they does not reply for warranty and is you want to return you have to courier them and is the earphone is physically broken in transportation they did not give you the new earphone don't by.
1,"There are a lot of reviews and recommendations on this product in YouTube saying that it's the best for gaming like pubg and other high end games. I purchased it for gaming purposes but as per my experience I could say that it's not the best for pubg at all. You get much better clarity in realme buds 2. And to those paid YouTubers my advice is, please don't mislead buyers."
5,"The product is good and up to the mark in the quality. The sound is good in all in terms of bass, treble and depth. The fitting is also good and it does not fall from the ear easily. Also, the sound is amplified. Overall the product is value for money product and very useful."
1,So here in 2021 . I ordered a new earphone specially for PUBG after reading review of that product but that product i used is worst i ever had. Firstly its box was open without package second one side of year not working properly it's wire quality is good but that product is worst i ever had. I already used many earphones as well as headphones for pubg but this is at last m wrost.. i suggest if you wanna play pubg or even you wanna play song don't buy that i prefer boat company
1,"1. Weird shape, huge buds, don't fit right.2. As it does not fit right, the ear starts paining after some time.3. Sound quality is very very average.One word of advice, DONT BUY!"
1,"All Good but sound quality is zero .no bass ,no trebble - it's like listening to a old mini tape recorder .it reminded me my child hood ,philips mono tape recorder. No return also only replacement for the same again."
5,Osm product
5,Totally worth the price
